If I get underweight from this(severly) they will get in trouble or no it would be my fault?

Cps is STUPID, and so are the cops, tried years ago they DON'T DO JACK SH*T. I'm not entitled to food no one is if you don't have a job its why i get punished. Yet i applied to 200+ jobs online no hires because it takes me

1,"  Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked kinda sad/moody about it so idk what to. Then ever since I did that: 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised  and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign? I once saw a guy come in speak to the nice guy on the front desk terribly and complaining then later my advisor was checking him out and he checked her out and when he sat in front of her she was all easy going with him and smiley. Iv always tried to be polite and yet she seems snotty with me. 

I got a job myself as I said earlier and she’s basically going to benefit from it with a bonus etc. I can stop it tbh and I want to. Why should she benefit out of somebody getting a job  she  didn’t want to bother with? 



Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence : /",01Mar2020,1

3,"I’m 18 and a senior in high school and quite frankly life after high schools terrifies me. I’ve already decided I’m not going to college.

I’m an average student grade wise (B’s and C’s with A’s in those easy electives). I’ve never really had a set career that I’ve wanted to pursue. 

I’m really interested in aviation but I just suck at math and anything science or physics related. 

I also tend to be kind of anti-social. I like being alone and private when I’m not in school or at my part time cashier job at a local grocery store. I don’t get invited to the typical high school parties and the such.

How do I go about this?",01Mar2020,1
15,"This'll probably end up being a slightly long post, TLDR at the end. I'm hoping this isn't a bs sub, I really need some advice here. 

I'm at a point in my life where I just feel *stuck*. I just turned 22 last week and still live at home. (With my mom and little brother. She doesn't really care that I'm still home - we lived with my grandparents until she turned 30-ish and got an apartment of our own, not that I plan to stay in the house that long.) I pay her $400/month as ""rent"" and to help out with groceries, cover my phone bill (she's always got money in her account so it's safer for me to have her card on file for my phone), and help pay for animal food. (6 out of the 8 animals in the house are mine technically - I have 3 geckos (I pay all the food for them though), 2 cats, and 1 dog.) 

I work a pretty decent job with great benefits - health/dental/vision insurance, certain discounts to some places, decent pay, and since I work nights I get a differential on top of my regular pay. I have no opportunity for advancement where I'm at. I work admitting in my local ER (so I register people coming in to be seen, verify insurance, admit people into our med/surg and ICU units, and occasionally register clinicals that come through). A few months ago I applied for a day time scheduling position in the same unit (but different part of the hospital) and was ultimately turned down (after being told I basically had the job and was given access to the scheduling desktop to get familiar with it). I suspected this was because I'm one of the ""strong"" workers in the ER and my boss didn't want to get rid of me - not many people are willing to work nights either. There really isn't any other place I can go where I'm getting the same pay + insurance without any kind of degree or certifications. 

I'd love to have a day job. I feel like I have no life whatsoever outside of work. I come home after my shifts and sleep and by the time I get up it's already later in the day when most people are winding down or businesses are closed, so I can get things done that I need to. I don't do the bar scene. I don't have friends here outside of my coworkers. I have my cousin that lives here (we're very close) but he's in college and has a pretty packed schedule with the amount of homework he has. I hate feeling so cooped up and it's making me depressed because I don't have anyone to hang out with or anything to do (small town, not a whole lot to do that isn't going to the movies that close at 12 or go to a bar from Friday-Sunday). 

That being said, I don't make enough money to move out of the house. I live in a small town (&lt;20,000 people) and a plant made it's way to my county a few years ago, making the rent for apartments relatively expensive for one person. Again, I don't have friends here that aren't my coworkers and all but a couple are either married or living with a s/o or a roommate. 

I know what I want to do in life. My go-to has always been to enlist in the Navy, and I hate that I didn't take my desire seriously while I was still in high school (I've been out of HS almost 4 years) because I've always been a weighty person. I'm also trans (although pre-everything) so it's still kinda up in the clouds whether or not enlisting is possible for me. If I can lose the weight it's possible I can try to enlist, but I have chronic back pain due to a pinched nerve that could DQ me. Losing the weight may or may not ease the pain (normally I don't have issues but here lately it has been flaring up, I'm assuming it's because the weather has been a bit on the cooler side). 

I need to lose approximately 100lbs before I can even consider speaking to a recruiter. In the event that the Navy doesn't work out, I'd like to be a pilot for an air ambulance company (think like Life Flight - I'm not sure if that is a nationwide company of if it's ""local"" but you get the point). The problem with this is that most companies require you to be about 200lbs for this - I'm 265ish. You also have to have at minimum 2,500-3,000 flight hours to even be considered for the job. I've also heard that the job area is a little hard to get into unless you're ex-military. 

It's normally not required that you have a bachelors degree with this kind of job, but is preferred, so I've considered a degree in either Aerospace engineering or Aviation science. Both will, in theory, get me where I'm wanting to go. But I'm worried that I've been out of school too long to apply for a scholarship (especially one that requires an essay) and I certainly don't have money for school. I *might* qualify under the Texas Hazlewood Act that could help towards tuition but I haven't looked too far into it. I suck at all things math and physics so I'm questioning how doable an engineering degree would be for me. 

To end the degree talk, I could probably move to part time in my job and do a few online classes (I already have a few done) but I'm not sure how doable moving away from  home would be - my mom had a pacemaker put in last year and I'm not too sure I'm comfortable leaving her yet, and I don't think it would be fair for me to leave my 6 animals here with her without being able to pay to help, and rehoming them isn't an option. 

What do I do at this point? How do I go about being a functioning member of society where I literally have no way to contribute and can't even go off to do? Maybe there are just too many if's and but's in here and it sounds like I'm just complaining... I don't know. 

*If you made it this far... thank you.*

**TLDR:** I'm 22 and still live at home. I work in a place where there is no opportunity for any kind of advancement and don't have the qualifications to move to another job with the same pay and benefits. I don't have enough money to move out and don't have anyone I can roommate up with. I've wanted to enlist in the military, but weigh too much, considered going back to school but due to finances, having animals that can't be rehomed, and my mom's health issues I worry about leaving town. I feel like I'm stuck in a rut and depressed because I don't have people to hang out with or anything to do in my small town.",01Mar2020,1

19,"Background: I have never been one to be very social, I've never had too many friends. I was dealt a bad hand when it comes to my looks and my self-confidence kinda sucks. I work a dead end job but I'm trying to start my own business. I'm not rich, I only make 40k, but I own a home and I make my money count.

About six months ago I met somebody and they are without a doubt the most interesting person I've ever met. She has been through everything, done everything, and been everywhere you can imagine. She is unbelievably beautiful, kind, and considerate. I don't know what it was, but I instantly fell for her. I don't have anything in my life that can hold a candle to her past experiences nor do I have any potential to match what she will do in life. So because I knew I didn't have a chance to be with her I decided not to flirt with, or pursue any thing with her. She flirted with me a few times when I got the chance to see her, but I tried not to make it obvious that I enjoyed it. I stopped seeing her about a month or so after we first met, and I thought of her almost daily.

Last week we matched on Tinder.

I said a few jokes and chatted, and next thing you know I have a date.

We head out to a local bar and start drinking, talking, catching up. I had an amazing time and paid the tab, but we had to cut the night short when her friend was assaulted by her boyfriend at another bar nearby and she had to get her home safely. I thanked her for the night and walked home expecting that to be the end. She texts me saying that she's sorry that the night was cut short, and that she would love to go on another date. I asked her what she wanted to do and she recommended going to the cities and spending a weekend getting drunk and partying. It turned into just a day and a night, but it was still an amazing night.

Again, I only make 40k and I put my money towards my home. I went into the evening with a mortgage sized amount of money and came out with almost nothing. While we were out, she asked if I wanted to go with her to some concerts in June. Clearly a good sign, right? This morning the weekend got cut short due to many problems. Thankfully so as I spent a huge amount of money, and I would no longer be able to bankroll this, but unfortunate as it was a fun time.

I had no idea going into this, but this woman is wealthy. She has access to more money than I'll have when I retire. I asked her while I was still pretty drunk why she even wanted to give me a chance, and she said that she genuinely enjoys my company, and thinks I'm attractive. Over the course of the evening she had told me about some of her pretty fucked up past and the problems she's had. The ride back was pretty silent. Music and dancing, but not much talking. It wasn't awkward, but I kept thinking why she would want me at all in her life. I have nothing to offer anybody. I'm as vanilla and milquetoast as the come. I asked her again, phrased better now that I was sober why, with everything she has, was I where I was? She said she does enjoy my presence, and that she doesn't care that I'm not rich, she would be fine with just hanging out getting to know each other.

I just need some advice though.

I don't really have too many friends. Everybody that meets her loves her.

I am afraid to be another problem in her life when she's had so many others.

I feel like I may actually love her, but I don't think of myself as loveable.

I simply don't feel good enough as a person, in any way, to even have the respect of her.

What do I do? How can I show her that I'm not good enough? How can I be good enough?",01Mar2020,1
21,"As far back as I can remember my imagination runs wild.
But it feels like adulthood and my myopy just makes it worse. 

I feel like it's a combination of both solitude and darkness that triggers the fear. It also mainly happens when I'm home, or in closed spaces like staircases. 

Ffs I can be scared in a dorm room as big as a WC, knowing there is only my bed and nothing else. 

It's so stupid because I know what triggers it. I know it is irrational. I know it's my imagination running wild. I know what I can imagine is not real. 
I know that if there was actually something in the room I can handle it to some degree (I mean, I'm not superman, I know my limits).
 
Yet I still get scared to the point of making up noises or a presence around me.
Especially if there is complete silence.

Its kind of like being in a dream and you know that you are in a dream. Yet you can't snap out of it. 


Tried complete darkness, some light in, light fully on, background TV noise, positive reinforcement etc... To no avail. 

I don't think it's a phobia because I don't have some symptoms of nyctophobia like nausea/feeling ill or visible shaking.

Pros:
• I find her personally attractive
• We’re good friends

•She’s told me that she has started to like me again recently

•I’m afraid some of my friends will call me a Simp or other shit for trying to get back with her

30,"My mom has a drinking problem. Its gotten to the point were she neglects her animals most basic needs, because shes too drunk. I went up to her house to scrape popcorn ceiling ifd, because she wanted to redo the ceilings. When I showed up, she was laying on the ground drunk, and kissing herself. She even had a gash on her face, because she fell. She has a dog, and cat. When I was there, I asked she was gonna feed her animals. She said ""they'll be fine"" so you're gonna let your animals go hungry, because your selfish ass wanted to get shit faced. I understand some people drink, because they are depressed, but that's no reason to neglect your animals. Another time when I was there, her dog started throwing up dark liquid all over the place, and was lethargic. She was too drunk to drive, so I took the dog to the vet, and paid the bill.

I don't know for sure and I don't know how to find out. If it did destroyed it, I'll need to get a replacement. It should be noted that a large portion of my life is spent looking for a job. I've been looking since I was 14 and no one has ever even interviewed me. I haven't been in school since I was 15 and I get money from the government because of my autism. Something that I'm ashamed of. I recently saved enough money to go on vacation to Europe and after 10 of the most depressing days of my life, I grew more as a person than I ever have in rest of my life.
But now that I'm home again my life has stagnated again.

Should I leave my life behind and start anew?",01Mar2020,1
33,Am I an asshole for waiting until 7pm to go out drinking with my friend? We had the plan to since his birthday was earlier this week.

I have this friend that is a year older than me and they told me about their mum, they said she would always scream at them for the littlest thing, shout at them until 12:00 am and she used to hit them, but they said it's died down recently so now their mum just throws things. And when I asked them who lives with her, they said they lived with their sibling and her mum. When I asked where their dad is they said they live in another town, however not far from where I live. So then when I suggested to move to their dad's house, they said they couldn't because they don't know the specific address, they can't find their dad's socials, they don't know his number and their mum won't let them get in contact with him. However, they did try by contacting their  auntie but she wouldn't tell them anything about their dad. The obvious solution would be to contact social services but I want them to get in contact with their dad or even with him before that happens, or course I will somewhere down the line but I think they would be less traumatised if they was in better hands first (by that I mean in their  dad's hands and not their mother's).",01Mar2020,1

Ight so I had this thing with a girl, she always undervalued me and disregarded how I feel treated I don’t deserve that, I know that. I’m a naturally caring person if someone I hate is crying in front of me imma try and help them so when it’s someone I actually like it’s a done deal I can’t stand the thought of her hurting I gotta do something so whenever some shit blows up she calls me and she cause I’m good at calming her down and making shit feel ok then shits good for a little bit and I can’t help but let my guard down just a little and think about how good shit would be if she just chose me. I always wanted her, always wanted to see where shit could lead then to make shit worse she took my virginity she’ll say the right shit but I’m smart enough not to listen and just look to the past patterns for answers but it’s so fucking hard cause I want everything she talks about so bad and when she says it she means it too but shit always switches and I know that I just want the strength to cut her off and move tf on but it doesn’t help that I don’t really have that much confidence I’m not really good with girls I’m a fucking mess tbh and I want her and everything she represents so much. I guess what I’m asking is how do I find the strength to make her feel better and still be able to help her and wish her the best cause it’s not in my nature not to without letting myself succumb to all those pointless thoughts about how things could be and just move tf on",01Mar2020,1
41,"Title is pretty self-explanatory, but here's some more info anyways. 

I requested off for today (Feb 29) more than a month ago. Ultimately, that request off was denied, but here's the catch; I had a prejury meeting for *federal jury duty*, which, if I had missed it, there would have been a warrant for my arrest issued. 

As soon as I noticed that my request off had been denied, I texted my GM and my coworkers, explaining my situation, but never heard back from any of them. I then told the assistant managers in person about my situation and they said they would handle it. 

Well, I'm not sure what happened, but my GM has now texted me saying that he never got my texts, and since no one showed up to cover the shifts, I'm at risk of being terminated for a ""no call no show"".

This evening the lady's son came out and my grandma said hello to him or something and he said hello and that ""it's a nice day to be passive aggressive."" At that point my dad (40M) got mad cause he called granny passive aggressive and they got into an arguement.

He just said ""let's talk, we can figure it all out"" and tried to be calm about everything. As the situation descalated my grandma came closer to the confrontation and called out to the other guys mom ""get your ass out here too,"" then the other guy got defensive. It's just really really annoying that she has to get in the middle of things and make it worse. My dad told her to go upstairs and leave them alone so he could talk and descalate the situation but my grandma said something else again. Now that everyone's back inside I tried to tell her maybe we can talk it out with them and figure out a solution, cause after all they are neighbors. The other man's mom seemed like she genuinely was a nice person. Their daughter who also lives with them seemed kinda rude and I think that's what made my grandma so defensive toward the whole family. My grandma just wants to pick fights. What should I do.

46,So basically someone has been consistently sneaking into our family vacation home and seemingly just living or possibly sleeping inside for a short time. It's always been when we have been gone but today my uncle was sitting inside and someone opened the back door. He got up and ran towards it but they were gone before he could see who it was. I was just wanting to know what we should do from this point. We're changing the locks and have a camera inside but it can only cover one door at the moment. I feel like we should involve the police at this point as they were coming in while we were home but my uncle and dad are against the idea for some reason.

I sit here thinking what life would be like if I just tried a little more, put myself out there and set out on a mission to enjoy myself... But I can't do that, everyone could say I can and I can do what I want. However, I don't even know if that is what I want, I don't know what a like or what I want to do. I just don't want to be sitting here alone anymore. I don't want to feel so alone. I don't want to feel so trapped, tired, uncomfortable and off. I used to be happy, or at least I think I was, happiness to me now seems like a fleeting goal , always just outside my reach. I can crawl and fight to get a little taste but once I feel that happy grow inside me, I need more to feel like myself again. My happiness isn't a habit, it's a fight for an addiction I crave. I want to be happy, happy all the time laughing and smiling like so many others. Like a childs imagination. But that happy, that feeling I crave, that warmness I need, I can't help but sit here and feel empty. No sad, no happy. Just nothing and no one, alone and empty. For an 18 year old who planned on university for most of his school life because it seemed right and what everyone else was doing. I went to a private school and I had friends, I still have friends although I don't see them as much. I have more than most, my life has been reasonably comfortable and yet I feel like the world turned its back on me and I'm trapped in a cycle of no knowing what comes next. I'm oblivious to my own desires and wants, so I'm left sitting here waiting, alone for a guide, a sign, something to tell me that it's going to be okay, that I'll find someone to help. That a guide will show me a way. That success and happiness will reach out to me and finally I'll accept. Finally I'll know what I want and where to go. How want to enjoy life now over this mundane nothing.",01Mar2020,1
50,"BEFORE YOU ANSWER: I KNOW IT IS MY FAULT. TELLING ME TO “BE MORE RESPECTFUL” IS NOT WHAT I AM LOOKING FOR. 
I am fourteen.
so to preface this, it was literally over food. over how to make a simple dipping sauce. someone said something that didn’t make sense, (“i don’t know what it was made out of!”)[i think there was a misunderstanding and they thought i was talking about something else, i asked how to make something that my grandma had literally been making longer than i’ve been alive.]
anyhow, i was rather amused and said “what the hell are you talking about?” suddenly, my uncle, whom i’ve already had problems with in the past, decides to join the conversation and scream “don’t you *ever* talk like that again or i’m going to beat the shit out of you.”(this is the usual response when he’s angry at me.) i am sick of the threats and as a self harmer, i decided i wouldn’t care if he did. so i said, under my breath, “then do it. i don’t care.” he got up very quickly and started running at me. it took all three other adults in the house to hold him down so he couldn’t beat me.
i forgot that i have severe flashbacks from last time this happened and started getting flashbacks and a panic attack. i’m still not sure if i’m safe from self harm because the panic attack is still happening and it’s all i can think about.
i know the obvious answer is to be a good kid and keep my mouth shut. but i’m honestly terrified of leaving my room right now, i’m so scared of him beating me. not because i’m scared of the pain.
i know that every last person in my family will hate me forever if someone saw marks from a beating and i was honest about what caused it and CPS got called. i’m not scared of pain but i’m scared of death. and it doesn’t help that i’m having a panic attack, but right now i can’t get that fear that he is going to kill me out of my mind.",01Mar2020,1

54,"There is this woman who lives in my neighbourhood a couple of months ago she split up with her husband and moved with her children to an other house. Her husband is mentally and phisicaly abusive. He doesn't want her to leave the house, cook for him and clean. She is friends with my mom and sneaks out of her own house to go outside and meet with friends. When she goes outside with him knowing but comes home late he apparently beats her up or verbally abuses her. Unfortunatly she went back to him after a month because of pressure of friends and family ( they are from turkisch orgin ). She never went to the police and says she does love him, I personally think that she thinks she can't live without a man and that she needs one to take care of her even tho she has her own income etc. So last night her and my mom were walking at night around midnight just around the block for fresh air. Her husband did know she was outside but came looking for her anyway after 20 minutes. When he found her and my mom he called both of them whores for walking outside this late and went on to curse at his own wife after he realised he doesn't even know my mom and randomly just called her a whore. My mom told me he said horrible things to his wife and took he to the house and probably beat her up. My mom was crying when she came home and was also frustated about the fact that the woman told my mom to not say anything back to her husband and basically just told my mom to keep her mouth shut. My mom and dad talked and my dad calmed my mom down but we basically can not do anything about it and that is just something that upsets me the most. It is that womans own choice to live there and stay with that man so you can't call the police or anything cause she says she is happy.

56,"Quick backstory:

28/M diagnosed with Depression and General Anxiety Disorder since about 16. Tried a plethura of meds that really didn't help. I am currently on two meds that have done the ""best"" job at keeping me going. I also have a psychiatrist, a therapist and several great in-person and online support people/friends. They do help quite a bit. I eat well and also try to exercise, but its not as much as I would like. I use nutritional supplements that I found have made a difference (took many years to get the proper ones), I meditate, try to practice mindfulness, and I allow for the occasional psychedelic experience for perspective; which has been monumental for my depression, actually. Just trying to avoid mis-use (as I've been there before)

However even with all that, I still find myself spiraling into bouts of depression here and there. Sometimes, for no reason...

Now, I've been drumming for 15ish years and I'd say I'm fairly talented. Not amazing, but generally considered a good drummer. I offcially got accepted in this band about a month ago now, and things are going well-ish. I know I want this and the band wants me. This band is serious and is trying to reach a fairly large audience and tours are being booked amd they're is sone attention on us... 

Sounds great, right? Well, it is... Except sonetimes (like now) I get so depressed and stressed and it really makes me not motivated or care enough to practice, do my best, feel good about my skills and all that. So, I'm troubled what to do. This is my dream, yet I feel weighed down by this depression sometimes. I then worry if im going to ruin the band's chances of success, which has already gone fairly well in short time... Should I quit? I dont want to hold them back... Or does anyone have any advice that can help me stay the course and fight through and give a fuck? Cause as much as I want this, depression really has a way of making one not give a fuck about the things they love and in my case, it just wants me to lay down and wish for sweet death sometimes (dont worry, I'm not suicidal just have passive thoughts of wanting to ""not be here"", perhaps sone of you will understand).

Reddit, what's your advice?",01Mar2020,1
57,"Was originally going to post on r/AmItheAsshole but  it  got  removed,  so  please  tell  me  if  what  I  did  was  wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

 I really need help with this. I feel terrible and like I did the right thing at the same time...

So for context, here is a backstory. By the way, TRIGGER WARNING: Depression, cutting, possible mentions of suicide. Okay, here it is. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know a boy named E. E is trans and has incredibly severe depression. He and I are in the same friend group, and we are part of a more closely knit group of five people. At lunch, the five sits together, and E constantly talks about how he “doesn’t know how he’s still alive” and how his brother bullies him and his parents don’t understand him at all. He also just offhandedly mentions that he took all of his anxiety pills and “didn’t expect to wake up that morning.” (This happened a week ago.) He also mentions how he might commit suicide several times, like how he has a rope in his locker and knives at home and how no one would miss him if he was gone. (Yes, people would miss him. He’s in a relationship for God’s sake.) And when he has his phone, he shows people images from Reddit 50/50 and things like babies being run over and five chopped-off heads. He laughs uncontrollably at people’s disgusted expressions and repeatedly says stuff like “The baby went pop!” It’s really disturbing, and although I haven’t mentioned this to him, fucking weird. What’s worse is that everyone else of the five just plays off his disturbing behavior. He’ll refuse to eat at lunch for several days straight and will CONSTANTLY talk about cutting or killing himself. Me and E have had our issues. He used to sort of bully me, and I would provoke him as revenge for him literally slapping me across the face hard. Then we both got in trouble and I’ve really been trying to patch things over with him and just become friends. Sometimes he’ll be nice, and sometimes he’ll just lash out. He’ll talk about cutting himself and show us old scars, and then when someone gently suggests stopping, he’ll lash out and say. “It’s not that easy! Do you know how fucking hard my life is?” And then he’ll rant about voices in his head. We all try really hard to help him, but he just doesn’t listen or care. 

&amp;#x200B;

On to the actual story.

One day (specifically the latest Wednesday, a few days ago) during lunch, our group was talking. I don’t remember what we were talking about to warrant what he did, but all of a sudden he pulled up both his sleeves. 

TW: GORE

It was bad. I absolutely cannot stand heavy gore as an actual picture, not to mention RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME. His arms were absolutely fucking COVERED in these angry red cuts. I thought it was pen at first. There was so much dried blood and one cut was as wide as a pencil. It looked like he sliced his arms over and over again because there were dozens of cuts. My mouth was wide open in horror and the rest of our friend group was gasping. He was talking about how much blood it was and we were all talking and telling him to stop doing it when he got up to get a pretzel. I immediately told the rest of the group that I was going to guidance. The rest of them agreed, but didn’t want to come with me. This is because of E. E has been reported to the school a few times for cutting, but never as bad as this. The last time, he thought it was me who reported him and called me a bitch and a worm and a whole bunch of other names that are worse than the bad names he normally calls me. He also almost assaulted me. He says that the school will only get him in trouble with his parents and that they’ll just send him to another therapist. But this time, I had to report him because he was in serious danger. The guidance counselor immediately went to the vice principal after I reported him. For the rest of the week, he was not in school. On Thursday, one of my other friends sent me a link to a TikTok video he posted. If you want his username, comment and I’m sure you’ll be able to find the video. The video basically was him saying “somebody snitched on me to the school and they snitched on me to my mom and I almost got my ass landed in a psych ward and I’m gonna find out who snitched on me and when I do you better watch out cause I’m gonna shit in your left shoe buddy.”  And I don’t know if I did the right thing or not because I’m afraid he’s been suspended or expelled or might be placed in a mental hospital. Please give me advice. I don’t know how to handle this situation properly or deal with E without losing control of myself. E, I know you’re on Reddit. So if you’re reading this, I’m sure you know who I am. And I don’t know if I fucking despise you or not because you sure seem to. I’m a human being like you, and insults do not just fucking bounce off of me. But if you come into school on Monday and start screaming at me for reporting you to the school, I might just scream right back.",01Mar2020,1

66,"TLDR: Give me a reason why I really need to move out of my city despite meeting some really cool people at the last minute.

Last year, I was in a rut. I was graduating with no job prospects, I couldn't afford the city, and I had lost one of my closest friends for damn near no reason at all. When my landlord proposed a rent increase, me and my sister (my roommate) literally considered moving to New Jersey to make ends meet. In NYC, we're already living way below market price and it's still too  expensive. Luckily, my landlord lacked enough initiative to actually draw up a new lease so we're now on a month-to-month. But in the midst of my emotional/financial crisis I realized a couple of things:

a) New Jersey, including Jersey City, will never be a desirable location for me. In spite of the cheap rent, it hardly emulates a true metropolitan area in the creative sense, and for me, commuting just doesn't seem worth it.

b) I've been to many cities before, but by far NYC exudes the largest attitude of relationship disposability-- the idea that people aren't worth staying in touch besides short transactions or networking. Romantic or not, there's plenty of fish in the city.

c) I hate gentrification. I can't even look around my neighborhood without feeling incredibly discontent and anxious. I also simply can't afford to live here. 

d) While most major metropolitan areas are gentrifying, few are doing so at the rate of New York.

e) I want to live alone. My sister and I don't even remotely share the same cleaning habits and I hardly sleep at night because she likes loud music and watching anime into the AM. I've lived with 2 other roommates before and my passive natured has forced me into being a silent sufferer. Even if I do confront issues, they're never resolved and an argument or unspoken grudge presents itself.

f) Living so close to my family members makes it really hard to be who I am and express myself accordingly. Whether or not they're with me in the moment, I feel immense pressure knowing that they're not that far away.

All these points led me to Philadelphia. Close to New York City both in culture and physical proximity, but far cheaper. I've researched Philly for the past year, visited, and I'm determined to move there. Regardless of my failing job search, I began searching specifically for remote jobs so finding a new job after moving wouldn't be an obstacle. As an English major, copywriting would provide the stability I needed in the moment.

Well, I finally got the job. My paycheck has increased dramatically, and I'm working from home. I decided to moved to Philly May 1 because I'm afraid if I wait any longer my anxiety will debilitate me.

But in the past few months I've met or strengthened relationships with some awesome people. For example, when I told my coworkers I was quitting, we organized monthly brunches as a group to keep in contact. And on an individual basis, I meet up with one or two of the group every other week to just chill and hangout. At least two of them have the potential in my mind to be really compatible, long-term friends. We really love and respect each other, and share the values I appreciate in a friend.

Then on the other side of things, I met about three people whom I have romantic/sexual relationships with. Usually this doesn't matter much to me because I don't take romance as seriously as most people do. Except these people I have put in a lot of effort into getting to know me and I feel like our relationships with one another could be long-lasting and meaningful. I don't get easily attached and I'm not, but I can always tell whether a new partner will ghost in a month (which happens quite often to me in NYC) or will be one of the greater experiences in my lifetime.

The problem is I need to move. I'm not usually the one to blame my mental wellbeing on an arbitrary place or locale. But even if it weren't for the general feeling of suckiness this feeling started, there are concrete characteristics of this city that are pushing me away. Even if I made a salary where I wouldn't have to worry about money and savings so much, I would feel like a traitor of sorts living in a city where a certain standard of living that is pervasively inaccessible is normalized. My local grocery store is a ""organic market"" and my food stamps for the month cover only some eggs, milk, and sandwich ingredients.

Maybe someone can offer a motivational quote or two that reinforced the notion that I need to get the heck out of here no matter what. Any advice is greatly appreciated.",01Mar2020,1
67,"I moved into this house about 8 months ago and haven’t really been too friendly with my neighbors due to work. 

My elderly neighbor approached me today asking for, “a big favor.” I asked him what that was and he said he needed to get to a certain city and that he needed a ride there to return some things. 

I told him that we are currently in that city that he wants to get to and asked what he needs to return and to whom. He invited me inside his home and showed me a pile of things, but said he doesn’t know who they belong to, but they need to be returned to  that city. I again let him know that we’re in that city and there’s really no other city in the US with that name. He tells me, “you see, that’s what has me confused, everyone keeps telling me that.” 

He has three very well behaved little dogs and he was talking to me about how he used to win dog shows and all that good stuff. Told me about his ex wife and how she took everything from him. He went on about how her friends found out where he lived and said he’s thinking of moving to Oklahoma where he had a lady friend. 

I go along and say something along the lines of, “oh must be nice, you kinda got it all figured it out then haha.” He again begins to tell me that he has a house in [specific city] and that it is identical to this one, down to the floor plan, but this isn’t his house. I tell him, “yeah tbh i think this might be your house. I’ve been living here for like 8 months and I see you all the time.” He again looks confused.

How do I go about getting him some help without stripping him of his dogs and his house?",01Mar2020,1

69,"Hello everyone, I will try to keep this very brief. My whole life I have grown up with a very overbearing mother. I would go as far to say that she is emotionally abusive to both my sister and I. However, she is emotionally abusive and manipulative in a very sly way. Always dangling money and gifts over our heads. My father and I have no connection. He makes no effort to try and get along or even talk with me. For instance when I told him I applied to grad school all the said was “yea”. Tonight my sister and I both took a mental health quiz and it said we were both suffering with dependent personality disorder. We are so codependent on our parents. Keep in mind I am 22 and my sister is 33. Every thought or action I have is ran through the lens of what my parents would think about it. Neither of us have any self esteem or worth. We are living in the south. A very conservative and redneck part of the south. I am also gay (parents do not support this at all) and stick out like a sore thumb around here because I take pride in how I look. I have a BFA in art from a private school. However, I constantly feel like I am ignorant and viewed as a loser/idiot. My degree is not good enough or valid for other people. Recently I applied to an art graduate program in St Louis. This would be a ticket out of this hell hole for me. However, when I tell people St Louis they tell me I will hate it and should move to New York instead. So now I feel like St Louis is not good enough. However, it is too late to apply to other grad programs due to deadlines passing. Overall I just feel like a total waste and that I am never going to be good enough. Please give me advice...I also apologize in advance over spelling and grammar errors...I wrote this in hurry on my phone.",01Mar2020,1
71,"My grandpa bought a trailer to live in. He changed his mind and gave it to me. I moved in and realized that this is barely shelter.

Oh yeah and I'm in az with a 30-45 minute drive to work. I'm 27 and I dont want to move back with my parents. They are helpful in letting me stay with them but the rent cost keeps me pinned to there.  Should I sell it at a loss($3000 ripoff), return the money and move into their basement or try to fully repair it at my parents house which is closer to work and spend way more for a non permanent house.

But I came back to my senses at my second attempt as it led me to a dating site this time. (a sex oriented one) Then I got really scared and deleted that account too. 

It's been a month since then and I always check my bank account but nothing happened. I am still worried though. Should I close my bank account and open a new one just in case?",01Mar2020,1
74,"Maybe it's my anxiety making this conclusion so I'm asking for a different perspective to make sure I'm not crazy.  I just need advice on what I should do.

So I'm a female college student living with 2 other people, they're my friends(also females) and we all didn't want to live with strangers this year which was fine with me. 

A lot of the times I get ignored in the friend group. Sometimes it's tiny things like being excluded from a conversation(they never listen to me or they just switch into a new topic before I get a word out). Sometimes it's bigger things like being completely uninvited/excluded from doing something or going somewhere with them. Afterward, they would talk about it in front of my face as if I knew the whole time(I never know about these trips or events).  It really hurts my feelings but I never say anything because it's not worth bringing up because I live with them. 

It seems like a lot of the time my issues or problems get thrown on the backburner. It never seems like the right moment to talk about my personal issues or problems with them as there's always something going on with them. Even though I listen to all of their issues and problems and comfort them, they never do the same. Eventually, I've just given up on bringing up my issues or problems with them and keep it to myself. 

I feel like an outsider looking in. Lately, I've been experiencing bouts of depersonalization/derealization and I'm struggling to figure out my identity at times. I don't feel like me, I don't feel like a person, and it just feels like I'm a floating consciousness, confused and caged in an unwanted vessel. I've chalked this outsider feeling to my anxiety. But maybe it's true? 

I don't feel welcomed in the friend group. I'm the friend that always tags along, who always walks ahead or behind the group because I'm not welcomed into the conversation, and who just stays silent most of the time because I don't feel like I belong or that my words are valued. 

Another reason I've come to this conclusion that they might be fake is that every time I hang out in the living area of our suite, everyone tends to disappear to their rooms. Often I'd get kinda subtly ""kicked out"" of my room(there are two rooms and a living area, it's a 4 person room but there's only 3 of us) that I share with one of them for hours. Usually, it's because she calls her family, which I don't mind, but other times it's just her watching her shows which is also fine but I need access to the room sometimes. I also get if she just needs alone time, but it'd be nice if she told me in advance so I can retrieve some of my needed belongings before being ""kicked out"". I never mind her watching her shows in the living area, I'm usually doing my own thing or I go to a study area if I need quiet. I just feel like my company is inadequate for them. 

I also rarely hear compliments from them, now it's not a big deal in of itself. I don't need compliments to function as a person or to know I'm valid. But one particular thing that bugged me a lot(still does) is that'll they tell each other they're good singers and I also tell them they're good singers. Not a big deal...except when I sing...nothing...nada....just silence? So I assume I'm just a bad singer maybe, but  I'd much prefer the honesty over the silence any day. But it got to my head so badly, I taped myself singing and sent it to my brother(because your siblings will be brutally honest with you, at least mine is) just to confirm if I was bad or not. He said I was a fine and was ""better than me lol"". Which makes me more confused, but idk. 

During winter break, there was a potential for a new roomie. I said that we shouldn't be mean or rude to a potential new roommate coming(because they could come in at any time since there's an available opening and it's emergency housing). I said this because it could be an emergency housing thing and we just don't know their situation so we should be open and be kind. But they both kept saying they didn't want a new roommate and would actively do things to the roommate to try to make them move out. I told them I wasn't going to do ANY of that because if I was in the person's shoes I'd feel awful in that situation. Then a few weeks later after lots of shit went down I had to change my housing plans to traditional. I said I hoped I didn't have a roommate next semester and I explained why. I didn't want a complete stranger living with me because I would have no one else I knew there. I've had bad experiences with roommates in the past(they knew this), but at least in my current situation, I would have someone to back me up if the new roommate was awful(I'd always give a person the benefit of the doubt before assuming though). I wouldn't have the same luxury next year being all alone. But then they called me a hypocrite for me saying that even though IF I did get a roommate I'd NEVER do anything to make them move out as they said THEY would. And I've dealt with cleaning up vomit from previous roommates ffs.

So in deciding to live on campus next semester in traditional housing and my roommates decided to live off-campus next year, they knew my situation and was fine with it. I told them it was cheaper for me and I needed to focus on my academics, not lies at all, but secretly it's also because I don't want to room with them anymore. They found two other people to room with and one has joined the friend group. Except, they both tend to make comments about my housing situation. For example: ""We'll have so much freedom next year, it's too bad you can't be there."", ""You can come over and use the kitchen since you won't have one anymore."", ""Better enjoy this now, soon you'll have communal bathrooms and no AC, ha ha good luck"", ect. I don't know what the exact goal of those comments is, maybe to strike a nerve? But they do it in ""I'm just joking around"" manner, but it really just feels like a snub on my financial issues when they make these comments.

They also tend to talk about me when they don't think I can hear them. I heard them say some end of a secret conversation of ""..we're both angry.""  and then both gave each other a look when I had forgotten my keys and ran back to my room to get them before we left. They both knew I'm the forgetful type, my very first semester I've locked myself out of my dorm a couple of times and I've been anxious ever since that it'll happen again to me so I always make sure I bring my keys and phone no matter what out of habit.

And just yesterday me, the roomie I share a room with, and the new friend were playing a board game, it was harmless fun. They even started the game over so I could join them(they just set up the game so it wasn't a big deal). Things were good in the beginning, I had a rough start and even rougher ending. I lost first, but it wasn't the game that got to me to make me shut down by the end of it. It was the stress of everything that week. So I kinda had a small mental breakdown after that last blow I could take from the game, the feeling of being useless and a loser just collapsed under me. They suggested playing another game, but I honestly didn't need my self-esteem ruined anymore at that point. I told them they could play a game by themselves and then my roomie said a comment like ""Great, you know I have deal with her this weekend."" As if I was some problem they just put up with(I had enough of my own parents telling me things like that). I couldn't stand being there anymore so I walked off after I was finished, and went into my room. I then heard them whispering about ME, they didn't realize the door wasn't closed. 

And my roomie has ignored my presence all day today except to tell me the washer wasn't going and that she got toilet paper. She said this while doing some weird/annoying hovering thing where she stands there for an uncomfortably long time after I've already answered her. SO now I'm here wondering if they're my friends at all or if I'm just there as a filler for when they need something or somebody. I have many more stories to share but I'll save you the time of reading them and me the time typing it, because this is long enough, sorry.

Am I crazy? Am I just being overly sensitive? Do my friends actually hate me? Or is it just the anxiety talking? What would you do?",01Mar2020,1

I'm male, 22 and live in Australia, I did pretty well in high school (mainly B's) but was never interested in uni until recently when I realised I want to work in a career with animals so I decided to study a 'bachelor of science - animal behaviour'.

Ok now the problem. I was never a huge fan of school and most of the time did the bare minimum. I don't deal with stress very well and get stressed pretty easily, I deal with stress by dropping everything i'm doing and try to relax by doing things that would hopefully take my mind off whatever it is stressing me. These past 2 years haven't been great for me either starting with maybe the worst 6 months of my life, I still have bad days here and there and struggle with a lack of motivation as well. I have however been slowly getting back on my feet the last year. The last thing that could become a problem is that my friend group isn't to big and they all work full time so I might be dealing with this all by myself, although I am pretty close with family however they work full time as well.

The way we write songs is that I write, record and send the songs to the band, completely finished. All their parts as well as mine have been written for them. On the rare occasion we get together, I teach them how to play their parts.

I've been feeling like I need to break away and do my own thing. The problem is that this band IS my own thing and leaving the band is essentially just kicking the 2 other members out.

While I’m interested in it it’s not my passion. Graphic design is an art major that I’m more passionate about but of course has less job/salary security. I’m leaning more towards the latter just because life’s for the living but I’m also worried if I’m going to look back in four years and wish I took the safer route because I might be struggling financially. Which isn’t a guarantee though. Anyone had a similar experience and have advice?,01Mar2020,1
91,"My mom just told me that I was disrespectful to a lady yesterday (her friend). The lady commented on my weight and said that I got chubbier so I was looking cuter. I straight up said, mind your business. She said, are you talking to me? I said, I’m responding to you. She said, I was trying to give you a compliment and you respond with being so rude!
I said ok?, and left. 

I have said this before, I think it’s disrespectful for people to comment on people weight. You just don’t know what could be going on with them. 
Like, what type of response you want? Thank you? I couldn’t act cordial lol I instantly got annoyed because unless someone is actively telling you that they’re losing or gaining weight, I absolutely think it’s disrespectful.

And my mom tried saying, oh your feeling insecure about your weight? And I said, what if I was? You’re just going to let your little friend talk to me like that? What if I got super triggered and decided to stop eating because I was in the right mind space? And then she roll her eyes and left.

How should I have responded to the lady? Was I wrong?",01Mar2020,1

I want to make sure I can relax a little more by 25-28 while still pursuing my passions. 

Ive made about 10 songs, released 4 of them. Write regularly, and have been learning drawing on my own.

I want to be able to make money off mainly books and screenplays and possibly do some cartooning eventually. I know these aren’t super reasonable which is why Im asking for advice while I work on these on the side.

Here’s what comes naturally to me:

Writing
History
Politics/law
Acting, film, and poetry/lyricism 
Psychology


For degrees Ive thought of:
Political science
Environmental science
Sociology 

Certifications:
Drug abuse counseling
Interior design

Most entertainment people I look up to almost always have gone to school for it. I truly believe if I go to school for the creative pursuits that Id probably be able to make a good enough career off of it. All of my creative stuff has always gotten praise by my teachers, family, and friends  and Ive been told I should do it. I got stuck in bad loops and didn’t stick with school and now feel it’s almost out of reach. Im scared I fucked up and really want to be more secure but have gotten much better creatively and want to pursue it still. 

Should I go to school and go for the art path?
Get a certificate and get a better job while doing art path?
Get fully educated in non creative major and do creative stuff in probably the most “limited extra time” scenario?

Advice on this is always conflicting so Im aware it’s not very good. I guess maybe suggestions other than STEM majors (as Ive never been good or had a natural inclination towards those subjects)?",01Mar2020,1

We were very happy with our decision and I will say, things are amazing 90% of the time. She makes me so happy and I make her happy as well. I know that she loves me dearly and I truly love her so much as well. There are problems here and there that always arise from drinking. I study a lot, and find myself not going out as much as I used to. Her, on the other hand not so much. She gets convinced so easily to go out by her friends and when she goes out she always does things that hurt me or make me feel off about the relationship. I know she would never cheat on me, but she is certainly very flirty with guys when she is drunk and never seems to see it as a problem. When she is sober, she understands why it makes me upset, but she never fixes the issues when she goes out next.

5 years ago a girl had a crush on me and now she’s messaged me on Facebook (I don’t have a pic of me pon there) and I’m worried She won’t like me anymore",01Mar2020,1
110,"This girl is a... lot to unpack.

First of all, she was toxic to me since the day I really met her. I first hung out with her at a friend’s birthday party and she said she thought I was weird and was scared of me (we were like 11 or something so that counted for a lot). Since then she:

-facetimed a boy she knew I liked a lot for 4 hours at our first sleepover.
-cuddled with that same boy right in front of me while insisting they were “just friends”.
-hung out with him and held his hand at a football game while I was right there.
-on one of the best days of my life she sent me a picture of them holding hands at an event I was supposed to go to but I couldn’t cause I was at a concert.
-when that boy left her because he got bored I tried to help her but she got mad at me as well as the other girls who liked him at the time.
-when I told some of the people I trusted about what she did she blamed me for turning the whole school against her when that was NOT my intention in any way.

She then got a boyfriend and this is the list of stuff that happened after that: 

-she later sent an embarrassing video to the next boy she knew I liked and made him awkward around me 
-she started flirting with a guy who I started catching feelings for in my social studies class and yelled across the hallway to him every day.
-she would talk shit about me to my friends behind my back about all my insecurities
-she facetimed the most important person in my life for 4 hours and insulted he to him and made me get in a huge fight with him about it because he was ignoring my texts during the call
-she lied to that boy about the things I said about him and told him I insulted him (which I did not; frankly because I had a huge crush on him)
- when that boy dropped me, she didn’t only sympathize with him: she outright treated me like shit just because he didn’t want to be my friend anymore
-not much later she started flirting with a DIFFERENT guy who has been a friend of mine since elementary school and tried to one-up me when I complemented him on playing football.
-she insulted me in front of literally every popular girl at my school at her pool party at the end of the year and told everyone how she didn’t want to be on my team or anything of the sort
- she went to his lake house with him over the summer and bragged about it on her social media
-she invited him to a Fourth of July celebration that has a fair in our area and clung onto him during it (also posted about it and didn’t tag me even though she was hanging out with me, but rather tagged my friend’s leg that was in the back of a photo.
-she invited him again to her Halloween party and flirted with all the guys there including him cause her boyfriend couldn’t make it  

Later, her friends told her boyfriend about all of the stuff that happened with her and all these other guys and he broke up with her. Turns out her boyfriend was only just holding her back from the worst of it;

-she continued flirting with the lake house guy and started making him teach her guitar
-she went to his house and they played guitar together 
-she walks with him in the hallway every day after school 
-she still continues to lie to him about things I’ve said saying; I never cared about him, his friendship was just a big joke to me, among other things


I tried to drop her around 8 times over the course of all that, but every time she blamed it all on me and put on a happy face until I’m back in her grasp where she starts tearing me apart again and again. I dropped her for the final time (hopefully) around two months ago because I couldn’t take it anymore. But, recently our mutual friendships brought us into situations where we’re forced to interact.

-during study hall a few days ago, I asked to go over one of my math homework sheets with my friend who also happened to be friends with the girl in question. The girl in question ended up also asking to work with the same person I wanted to and I was going to leave to avoid an awkward situation but I didn’t.
-she asked me something about if I was performing at our school’s open mic night thing and I answered her because I knew she was already going (to see lake house boy because he was performing as well)
-we joked around to kill the awkward silence and I moved back to my seat to study for something and avoid taking it further with her
- according to my friend I was working with, she told her “I talked to her! We’re getting somewhere” which completely contradicts the fact she was literally insulting me the week prior to my friends
-at the open mic, she hugged me twice and complemented my solo and duet as well as hugged my mom lmao
-she also hugged my best friend who knows everything about everything 
-she also was literally clinging to lake house boy the entire time I was around them.... sooooo

I think she thinks that I trust her or want to be her friend again but I can’t let that happen. I don’t know what to say to get her understand that without being an asshole because she hurt me so much.",01Mar2020,1

I know this is immature and stupid but my sister and I get bored and like to troll people. 

I have made fake snapchats with fake names and post her pictures (normal pictures) on the accounts story, saying to add her for nudes (she doesn’t give out nudes) or add her to see her fuck and blow her boyfriend or whatever. (With a picture of her and her boyfriend). 

My sister also made a fake Snapchat so people could add it. I post my Snapchat username on addmesnaps.com (since hers got banned). All these guys and sometimes girls add me and then go add her lol. 

I also make fake kik and instagram accounts and do the same thing. Telling them to go add her Snapchat for explicit material. 

my sister posts on her Snapchat that my accounts Are bullying her and made a fake snap that looks like mine with our old yearbook and started saying nasty things on it with our yearbook pictures.  She claims I’m bullying her and she told the principal and yadda yadda. And I’ve been bullying her for months on all these different social medias.

Well today someone added my sisters account and she told them all the fake accounts and how I’ve been bullying her since last year on all these accounts on various social medias. Lol. 

And they added her to a group saying exactly when she joined, someone said that one of them has a cousin who is an ex FBI agent and they are going to report the accounts to the ex fbi/police (these people don’t live near us and they don’t know where we live). and they were talking about it before she joined, my sister saw that and blocked the person and left the group. 
She said two other people from the group tried to add her but she didn’t accept them. 

I went back to my account and someone from the group said I reported your account to the police so have fun with that. I blocked them and deactivated all my fake Snapchat accounts. My sister still has hers up. But she’s considering deactivating. 

That person also posted on their story to mass report my account and have it taken down and all the other accounts too. Except my sisters. Idk if this is just a scare tactic or if they are serious. 

Anyways, if the popo do trace it, they will see all the accounts come from the same IP address....and they will see no nudes were ever sent or anything bad. Just stupid attention seeking posts like go add her for nudes, and then on the other one she’s bullying me report her type shit.",01Mar2020,1

113,"A while ago I got a letter in the mail from the FDOT saying that I ran two tolls in Miami. Which is weird since I've never been in Miami in my life.

Upon looking at the invoice the picture that they included, the car in the picture is not mine. So I think ""oh they got the wrong car. I'll just dispute it."" 

So I do and a couple days later they email me saying that the case is closed and I won't be charged for anything. Great! 

Well here I am a couple months later and the same car is continuously running tolls and I'm getting the invoices. I still dispute it everytime and it gets resolved a couple days later.

The problem is that with every invoice it adds the previous charges from the other tolls. Im afraid that one day the charges will add up so much that they'll suspend my license or a cop might arrest me for outstanding charges. 

The reason that I keep getting these invoices is that the other car has their top half of the license plate covered so the automated system thinks that it's mine. 

Is there anything I can do other than just changing my plate. I don't mind doing it but I don't like that I have to spend money because someone has a license plate that looks like mine.

114,"Bear with the long essay. Today she, another friend (18y), and I got on a call today to listen to her rant about a boy whom she a weird relationship with. Is she dating him? They both like each other; their thing is weird. She's made it clear she often does many sorts of nicotine products as well as smoking weed, and she's one of the popular girls at her school. Long story simplified: 

* This boy she's obsessed with posted a Snapchat story of him and another girl making kissy faces, and he customized the story to have it only to be seen by my online friend.
* This story upset her very much, but she has had a history of attempting to make him feel jealous of her with other boys (they're both, I guess, rather (insert B-word)y.
* To cope with her distress, she takes weed in both the night and the morning. She never admitted it, but it was pretty clear to my other Discord friend and I that she was high.

I am fifteen, and I do not do weed; and don't worry because I don't plan to. I've always kept a policy that I shouldn't be in other people's business, especially over Discord. But man, I don't know. I think I care about her and see her as a friend, even though we've never met face-to-face. I don't want her doing weed, and I want her to get help. I should note that:

* She skips all her classes
* Doesn't show interest in school
* Shows signs of perhaps being hurt. She doesn't express it, but she did mention once that her mother did cocaine and is an alcoholic.

So I ask you all for advice. Do I get her help or leave her be? Do I talk her out myself (I'm not very good at therapy)? She once mentioned that she went to school with a celebrity whose name won't be shared here; I could probably find her school's contact information and get her the help she needs, but that may be weird, and she may suspect that I was the one who anonymously reported her which may be creepy and could potentially ruin our friendship.

116,"I’m a 19 year old college student. While I do love my parents, they have always controlled every aspect of my life growing up. They are extremely religious (some even say, almost cult-like) and I am not. This has impacted most things in my childhood such as not being able to making friends, anxiety, bad social skills, etc. I was never able to do what the other kids in my school were allowed to do. I was never even allowed to go to anyone else’s house. 

Now that I’m in college a couple hours away from their house, my life has become so much more enriching and enjoyable. I even get excited at the thought of being able to go to Walmart whenever I want to (it’s sad I know). Many said I would go crazy and end up failing because I would finally be able to experience all the things I was not able to experience growing up. However, I’m doing just fine and my grades are well. 

I’m approaching the end of my freshman year, and I know I will have no choice but to return home for the summer. I learned from winter break that my parents still ridicule me at the idea of doing anything other than church-related activities. I know that I’m within my rights to do whatever I want, and I’m financially capable from working. However, my parents have ways of manipulating my emotions and making me feel awful for wanting to do ANYTHING on my own free will. They find ways to make my life miserable if I do anything other than what they want me to do. They have even threatened to stop helping me pay for my tuition, which I cannot afford to lose.

HOW do get out of this? Has anyone been through anything similar to this? What do I need to do to get out of their control, while also not making it to where I can never come home. Thank you",01Mar2020,1

I mostly feel like this when I'm with a group of people a few years older than me -- they've been to university, I have not, I'm still a Virgin, they're not, they know how to drive, I don't, my brother is married, I've never been in a relationship etc. I just feel like people who are older than me are superior to me because they just have more life experience than me.

I feel like I'll always find a way to make myself inferior to others for all my life. I believe people who are older than me can see through me and still see me as a child.

120,"I got into my dream school and will be leaving in August. I live in the United States and I'm going to Ireland, so this isn't a case of me being an EU student and hopping to a country 3 hours away.

I'll be gone for one year. My family is already panicking over this, but they're not letting on. Back when I was in undergrad, I left the country for a 4 month study abroad trip. They practically imploded while I was gone. One of my sisters ended up in the psych ward because she was so distraught that I was not in constant contact.

I guess I'm sort of the linchpin of this family. I'm the ""normal"" one, I guess, and my mom and younger sisters rely on me heavily for support. My younger sisters are twins and they're 20, so this isn't a case of me being needed for childcare. I'm just everyone's therapist?

123,"Ok so here’s a brief summary of what I’ve got going on here. If any of you have experienced something or are experiencing something similar, please let me know!

So basically I’ve been experiencing what I only know to describe as a feeling of “disconnect” between my mental and physical spectrums. This has been going on for around 2 months, and at the beginning I thought this feeling would just go away eventually but it hasn’t, which is concerning. Basically, whenever I am doing something it feels like my body is almost on autopilot, performing actions for me that I haven’t actually willed myself to do. I get an idea or concept of something that I want to do, but then my body just does it almost instinctually. I’m in a completely clear state of mind, and actual probably more aware than most other times, so it doesn’t have anything to do with my thought processing. It seems to have a particularly strong effect in the mornings, if that helps to give and clues. Another phenomenon I experience frequently is basically a spell of constant realization or discovery. Often this is a discovery of something simple, or something that I am currently doing. For example, making a cup of coffee this morning I seemed to simultaneously forget and then realize that I was doing this over and over while trying to do it. It was like my brain would go “Hey, I’m making a cup of coffee.” and then instantly forget that, and then repeat the process. Normally these events don’t last very long, but when they do it becomes overwhelming and I have to slow down and stop what I’m doing to collect myself. Overall, this has become a very annoying thing I’ve tried to cope with and haven’t found a successful way just yet.

If anyone has had anything similar happen to them, please let me know your story, how you’ve dealt with it and if you were able to revert yourself from it. Thanks reddit!",01Mar2020,1
124,"So yeah. I really don’t know how to feel. 

I’ll try to make this brief. So my parents separated 4 years ago. Was not super amicable, but I understood at that point in time that divorce would be the only outcome in which our family could move forward. They had been fighting for years and then one day, during the end of my junior year in high school, something snapped and my dad moved out. At this point I was so exhausted by all of their bickering that I was glad it had come to an end. Fast forward 4 years. I decided to go to college outside of the US, (japan), and have been living there for roughly 2.5 years. Late last year I applied to transfer to a new university in a different part of the country. So for last 3ish months I have been living at my moms house until my school starts in April (if the Coronavirus doesn’t kill everyone lol). 

So it’s been awhile since my parents separated, and thought maybe my mom was seeing someone. I didn’t care if my mom was single or with someone, I just want her to be happy. My dad already has a girlfriend, so i got used to the idea of my parents seeing different people. Because in reality they are in control of their own lives. Not me. But anyways I sort of surmised that mom was seeing someone but anytime I mentioned it, she vehemently denied it. I thought that was weird but realized it’s not my place, and she can tell me when she feels comfortable. 

Anyways a couple days ago one of those iPhoto memories popped up on her iPad. It was on the kitchen table out in the open and she wasn’t home so I peeped at it. To my surprise it was a picture of her kissing one of my classmates from High School. At first I was like what the fuck. Right now I am 20 and the guy is 21. I was flabbergasted. Partly because of the age thing, but mostly because it’s a person who I know. I don’t know how long they have been together but that iPhoto memory was from like 2 years ago so it’s been going on for awhile. I love my mom and appreciate her but I struggle to grasp this. She could date anyone and I wouldn’t really care but why did it have to be a high school classmate?! She does not know that I know this information. I feel like I shouldn’t bash my mom because she does her best for me, but I can’t handle this. I don’t know what to do or not do. Any advice would be appreciated.",01Mar2020,1
125,"I have (or had, idk at this point) a friend who is really close to me (literally too, he's my neighbor) and he completely changed his demeanor towards me and most of our friends, except a few bad ones who only take advantage of his money, house-partying and car rides everywhere. They are always doing drugs.

Long story short, he's been ignoring me and barely trying to make contact. He sent me a message a few weeks ago about something frivolous and then I saw it as an opportunity to let him know that I miss him, but to my surprised he just read it and didn't reply. He is isolating himself and, not only that, but I saw him on the streets a couple days ago and he's losing a lot of weight but he doesn't seem healthy and he's a very tall guy. 

I don't know what to do because I don't wanna lose his friendship and I love and care about him very much, but I also do'nt wanna force anything and risk definitely losing his friendship. 

We didn't fight or anything, I don't know why he's acting like I'm a stranger. He didn't even invite me to his new years party at his house (again, he's my neighbor and he knew I was lonely and bored by myself at home while he was trhowing the party...). I found out about the party because I reached out to him to see if he wanted to hang out since I was sad and bored, and then he told he couldn't because he was ""having a party with his friends"". I felt so left out, as if he didn't consider me his friend.

I partly blame the timing, I was under immense stress from school but another part of me felt that he wasn't MY person. 

I don't regret ending things, but here I am 3 months later and all of sudden memories keep popping in my head and I suddenly really miss him. I can't and won't reach out but I can't determine whether I miss HIM or I miss having someone there for me.....any advice on how to navigate this?

129," 

4 years ago I went to a lesbian meetup  party to meet women like me. It wasn’t my first time at this event (third) I always had a great time and never had issues with anyone. At each event they usually have a special speaker or performer. In the past they had burlesque performers or life coaches. The last event they had a  Shibari dominatrix (japanese rope bondage). At the start of the event the party host said she would give away 2 vip tables to a nightclub in town for whoever volunteered for the demo. I stupidly raised my hand because I wanted the free vip table to my favorite nightclub. I volunteered thinking the dominatrix would go easy on me considering I’ve never done bondage before and it was in front of 20 other women. So I stood up and without asking first the dominatrix pulled my dress up exposing my ass to 20 people. I was not expecting I would be half naked. I thought I would be tied with clothes on. Then she made me call her mistress. I was not comfortable with this because I was not expecting to be domineered like that in front of 20 women. I honestly thought she would tie me up clothed and I would be a quiet volunteer. Then she made me walk around the room half naked and roped up. I was dying of embarrassment on the inside. I really didn’t expect to be paraded half naked and talked to like a dog in front of a bunch of people. After what felt like an eternity the mistress untied me and asked for the second volunteer. The second volunteer chickened out after seeing what I went through so she gave her turn to someone else. The dominatrix then did a simple rope trick on the wrist of the second volunteer and that was it. Are you fucking serious?? She fucking gave me the x-rated demo and gave the second volunteer the g-rated demo. I was so upset it wasn’t fair. After the dominatrix was done with everything I quietly grabbed my things and left. The party host followed me out, I explained that the demo was not what I expected and I felt very uncomfortable. She apologized and I never returned to the meetup. If i knew from the get go what i was getting into i wouldn’t have volunteered. Was I overreacting?",01Mar2020,1

I told him I had to leave and basically walked out the door. He tried kissing me and I turned my head away and left. In the past we always kissed on the lips when saying hello or goodbye.

Over the week, she has been very distant, not answering her phone, ringing up crying, getting angry at others, etc. She recently lost her newborn nephew and ever since, she has gotten worse and worse. I always offer help, wanting to take her to the doctor, going to a psych but all I hear is ""I'll be right"". . And when I oppose that, she gets grumpy.  She wanted to get eloped in a few months but I'm only 18 and she's 20 so I said no. She said she is ok with that but I don't know. A few days ago, she posted a suicide poem in her snapchat story. I rang her in a panic and she said it was 'some writing' she has been doing. I spoke to her last night but now she's gone missing. She said shes staying in another town overnight with some friends but nobody, including her friends have heard from her. I'm worried about her, but if she comes back, I've been thinking about breaking up with her, because I have gotten over depression and anxiety, and I really don't need it in my life anymore. I'm really worried. I don't know if she's alive, cheating on me or anything. Her friend told me that they are going to file a missing person report if she isn't back by tonight, and I agreed.

138,"I'm not sure if I'm just getting old or what. I used to love drinking and going out and having a proper night out. But ever since I moved abroad, I just...hate drinking and going out. Hangovers are now debilitating for me, complete with vomiting, headaches, and generally horrible feeling every time. I even thought I had a drinking problem for a bit back home.

The problem is, everyone I meet just wants to party and drink and go out for fun. I really, really hate it. And every time I do go out, I end up drinking too much to have ""fun"", then wake up and vomit and feel terrible the next day. I just feel like nobody wants to do social things that don't involve drinking, and sober nightlife just doesn't exist. I don't even want to drink anymore. I feel like I have no real friends I guess, and everyone I meet just wants to go out and drink instead of just hanging out like my friends and I back home. I'm in Australia and there is so much pressure to drink here. Sometimes it feels like if you don't drink, there's no point in existing haha.

I just feel so boring! And when I turn down drinks, nobody makes another effort to hang out with me and just say I'm ""running away"" or call me boring.

140," Hey, this is my first time using reddit so sorry if im using this wrong. I am currently a freshman in high school, and I always hangout with these 2 ""friends"", I'm going to call them A and B. We have been friends since the beginning of middle school, and we've always gotten along but ever since we got into high school, I feel like I feel so distant from them, even if we hang out and eat lunch together every day.

Last year, I was extremely close to A as we had 5 classes together and (I think) B lowkey hated me because B had a crush on A. Now I'm pretty sure those 2 are secretly dating which I really don't care about, just more sad how they couldn't tell me. And it's not just my instinct, they post those story games on social media about their bf/gfs, you know. Now those 2 are extremely close and now that those are (most likely) dating, B doesn't hate me as much and we're pretty chill but she always follows A's opinion as he's a bit manipulating.

I don't feel like I belong in the small friend group trio anymore, and I don't know if leaving the group is the right thing to do. We have 3 months left of school till summer break, and I don't have any other super good friends to hang out with. I want to tell A that I want to (and should) keep a distance from them, but is it the right choice? How should I tell him? I want to tell A via messages as it would be awkward if I just kinda called him out in school.

143,"So, its legally my moms cat. I just do a lot when it comes to caring for it. Like taking it to the vet, feeding it, giving its thyroid medication. My mom buys the food, and the meds though. Anyways, the cat has hyperthyroidism, and has been on meds for about 4 months, and has been itching off, and on to the point of self mutilation. The vet really thinks it's the meds, so we are taking her off them, and waiting a couple weeks to see if the scratching subsides. If they do then they are going to try a diet food for hyperthyroid cats. If that doesn't work, then my vet suggested radiation tharapy that will most likely cure the hyperthyroidism, and the cat will hopefully live another 4-5 years. Well, the surgery will cost $1,500, and I'd have to drive to a city 5 hours away, and stay another 5 days, because that's how long the cat will have to stay in the hospital. Ive already taken 5 days off of work this month because I was sick, and I'd be afraid to take another 5 off because Ill have to stay in the town 5 hours away to get the cat. Now, I could pretty easily afford it at the moment, but honestly, I wasnt planning on spending all this money on my moms cat. She didnt take care of the cat like she should, and i felt bad, and started taking care of the cat. She is paying for meds, but she wouldnt have been getting the treatment that she is if I had never tooken it upon myself to take her to the vet. Shes also 15 years old, and I feel like she lived a long life. Am I a piece of shit for not wanting to spend the money to save this cat? I will probably talk to my vet more about it, but I'm sure this whole situation would be super stressful for the cat, especially being away from home for 5 days.

For context, I'm a college student who met this person back in August. This person and his girlfriend usually occupied this street corner, an older homeless couple, and I ran into them a few times while stopping and checking a map. They also took care of some formerly stray dogs, really sweet people, and I befriended them both. Back then they were doing alright, but I'd occasionally stop by to bring them food (the dining halls where I go to school are pretty to sneak food out of in containers). She went further south for the winter and they broke up due to some personal suff, but he hasn't been doing well in the meantime, even though his mother let him stay with her if he could pay rent. He has severe asthma and complications from it, and although he finally got a job in early December his boss still hasn't paid him, most recently because he couldn't go back to work after suffering a seizure. I started giving/loaning him out money (my mother always told me never to let someone borrow something you weren't alright with losing, I made peace with that long ago) but now I'm broke and he's starving. I sent him the last of what I had through Paypal since he was in the next town over. He hadn't eaten in days and was getting a pretty bad cough. North Carolina isn't exactly a cold state but winters are still rough. The pain is getting to be too much and he told me he was ready to kill himself soon if it didn't get better. The shelters here and in the neighboring counties are all full, and I physically cannot help him any more. I gave so much to make sure they'd be alright and I can't just let him die. I'm also scared to death to ask other people around me for help. I don't know how much you know about college kids, but most of us are either broke ourselves or selfish rich kids, and I'm afraid to tell my family that I've given so much to someone I only met this year. I feel naive and stupid for thinking I could help at this point, even though I want to, and I don't know what options are left.

If anyone knows of any resources that could help in the Durham-Chapel Hill area, especially ones that aren't completely overburdened and full, please, please let me know.

Most of my friends and people in my life have met him and my problem is that they will greet me with a phrase along the lines of “how’s (bro), how’s my favourite, when is he coming back” along with asking specific questions about him and not even asking how I am. At first I thought this was a joke but I soon realised they were all being serious. 

I understand that he’s more extroverted and a more bubbly person but that’s because our dad left when I was 12 and I just had to step up and take care of him and our mother, this led to me becoming quite introverted and having a slightly more rigid personality.

155,"My partner and I have been together for 10 months today. In the beginning we hardcore honeymooned and we’re having sex 3 to 5 times a day on average (this lasted a month or so). We were very flirty and silly and playful and adventurous- all the things associated with the honeymoon phase.

About 6 months in things settled, we moved in together, he works in construction full time and I go to school full time. Our relationship is beautiful. Despite our differences, our communication is patient and understanding and explorative. We can work through pretty much anything.

Nowadays our average is about 4 times a week. We have had approximately 20 dead-end conversations about our intimacy and how things have changed.

It’s difficult for me because I am not always in a playful silly mood. I have struggled with depression since I was a child. I also am bisexual and have had struggles with men that often make me feel like I need space from touching or flirting. 

He is a very sexual, flirty, silly person and maintains that nothing has changed about the way he feels toward me since the beginning. He feels that it isn’t just about sex, it’s about attraction and flirting and that I don’t show him that side of myself often enough for him.

Our conversations always lead to the point that we have different needs when it comes to intimacy and that it’s difficult to compromise those things that feel like core aspects of our character. We don’t know how to move forward. We love each other so much and are wonderful companions and friends (and wonderful lovers when it happens). We just are struggling to find a solution.

158,"For some more context, I've been with this guy for about fifteen years. I love him dearly, but more and more these days, I'm seeing aspects about him that are controlling and abusive. I've only just realized that he has a pattern of flipping out on me over things that happened months or even years ago and stirring up explosive and emotional fights to verbally pummel me over those events in the past and it always seems to coincide with when I start doing really well at work.

This last week, I was doing great at work, doing great with getting other little mundane life things in order and generally being on top of things. My confidence and happiness were so high until I come home Thursday night and he starts unloading on me about stuff he was apparently still mad about from almost a week before and then started digging even deeper into things from months and years ago to reinforce some argument that I was a garbage person pretty much. 

He drove me down a spiral until I was a sobbing wreck just begging him to stop. He's told me in the past that my job is a problem because he's convinced I'm trying to have an affair with my boss. I told him multiple times in the past, that if it's such a problem, I'd happily quit my job, but he's going to have to handle bills until I get a different job that he doesn't have a problem with. 

So I guess I finally acted on that. I was so emotional and kicked so fucking low, I honestly thought a lot about just taking all the xanax in the bottle and washing it down with a whole bottle or two of wine. In the fight, he'd gotten in his car and left me alone. In hindsight, I realize how fucked up it was of him to intentionally leave me alone like that, *with the xanax*, knowing that I've been suicidal in the past. I kept telling him earlier when he was freaking out on me to go take a xanax and chill out because I figured he was just having an anxiety attack and unloading it on me using unrelated, older issues as a reason to spark a fight—it's his pattern at this point and I know I should fucking drop him, but I'm financially cornered.

Anyway, just being dumb and self-destructive, I texted my boss to essentially quit my job while I was left alone, in some stupid hope that it'd appease the boyfriend enough to make him forgive me for whatever the hell it was I did that started all of this. None of this would have happened if he hadn't come at me like he did that evening, I'd been feeling *wonderful* all week up until he attacked me.

I wrapped up the text and was legit going to just go take some xanax and open up the wine—I was hoping maybe if I just took one, I'd chill out and not do something stupid like take them all at once and actually hurt myself. I tried to reason with myself, quitting my job like that was self-destructive enough, *that should suffice, I'm so fucking tired of having suicidal thoughts*, and I just don't even know what was going through my head at that moment, I just felt so fucking lost and beat the fuck up.

My boss is a really kind and sweet person. I don't know how to go into how great this person really is. He didn't have to text me back at almost midnight asking if I was alright, but he did. And he talked to me a bit and I mean... I'm in no way comfortable disclosing details of my life to coworkers or employers like that. I know I'm in a relationship with a really abusive person. That's my problem and I'm done letting it cause problems for his business when I miss work because I've been kicked around all night and morning before my shift. He's a good person who deserves a better employee than me. 

He talked to me and I wish I could really express how much it meant to me because I mean. I kinda really don't have anyone to talk to. I don't have a lot of friends and none who were up at the time. It was purely luck he was apparently up at that hour and saw my text right when I sent it. 

I wound up not taking any of the xanax and opting not to do anything stupid. 

But I still feel like I'd already done stupid shit and it sounds like he doesn't want me to up and quit. But I still feel so humiliated by all of this, like I can't even face going in Monday. 

I don't know what to do. 

Eventually, the next day, the boyfriend came back and everything was fine and hunky dory with him even though I felt hit by a freight train from all the crying the night before. He was kind to me and helped me back on my feet (I was sick as fuck the next morning, but I'd been a bit sick on and off the last few days. Anxiety, I'm sure. It tends to come out as nausea and feeling ""hung over"" for no reason.) 

I told him that I quit my job and he didn't really say anything. I slept through most of the day because I was just too depressed to do anything else. I slept almost fourteen hours. He came home after work and was super sweet on me again. I didn't feel like bringing up anything, I didn't have the energy to argue with him if I said something wrong, so I just rolled with it.

Today, I tried to talk about it since I'd recovered from the day before. *I quit my job since you had such a problem with it, now what?* Basically. He had no answer for me. I gave up trying to figure it out. He was in a good mood and I didn't want him to snap again. 

I don't know what to do. I'm too embarrassed to face my coworkers Monday, but I know that even if all of this does result in my getting fired, I'd have to go in to get my last check and clean my desk for the next person anyway. Inevitably, I'd have to face my coworkers and I'm so embarrassed that they were so worried about me the next day. They had sent a few texts to me asking if I was ok, and like... I don't know how to tell people that my boyfriend's an abusive psychopath, so I lie and say I'm fine. 

I'm not going to pretend I don't see how fucked up this all is, I know that if this were happening to someone else and I could see it all, I would tell them, ""You need to leave him, he's an abusive manipulator and he's intentionally driving you to self-destructive behaviors because he knows that if he hits you the way he wants to, that leaves evidence that could get him caught. Dump his ass yesterday, bitch.""

I just don't know what to do, though, I can barely hold a job as it is with my mental health (and his little episodes like this exacerbate the hell out of it.) I don't make enough money to make ends meet. And now I guess I'm not going to be making any money at all. So I've fucked myself, exactly as he told me to, I guess.

Idk, I just had to vent. I'm so exhausted of destroying my life over and over for this guy. It's not the first time and I know it won't be the last as long as he's around. I keep staying for the ""good times"" like when he was kind to me the morning after and I keep staying for the person he was when we first got together. But I've read so much about DV that I know this is exactly how you wind up seeing women who stay 20+ years with men that abuse them—I see the pattern and yet here I am, fucking trapped and only barely willing to do anything but live in denial.

I'm having a moment of clarity just long enough to make this post. Idk, I might just end up deleting it later, anyway. At least I tried, though. I don't know.",01Mar2020,1

He also told me to bring some guys over for his sake just any guys at all. I’m not sure why but I’ve always preferred talking to girls rather than guys and I get along better with them and like I said earlier Im just not as close with my male friends.

She checks my location incessantly. She goes out of town on the weekends, and even when she’s out of town, she continually checks it.

176,"Let me preface this with some context.  I am 24 years old and currently in school.  I work part time in retail for minimum wage, at about 13-14 hours a week.  Most of my money goes towards my medication, food, and transit fares (metro pass, etc.).  The rest of that time is generally spent on commuting to and from school, or doing homework.  I live at home.  My parents told me when I first started school, that I did not have to pay any type of rent.  I asked them if they were sure about not having to pay rent and they said yes because they wanted me to focus on my studies and not have to worry about making enough money and sacrificing my work time for it.  I also have a history of depression and anxiety and can become overwhelmed very easily.  I also have severe anxiety about being abandoned or left alone, and they are aware of this. However, I try to make up for not having to pay rent in other ways: I clean and cook meals when I don't have an evening class or night shift.  I buy my own groceries and eat my own meals.  I just try to be helpful in general.

That being said, my parents still treat me like I am 16 years old.  I need to tell them where I'm going, who I'm going with, and when I'll be back.  They block the wifi on my computer, phone, and gaming systems because they say it's interfering with my sleep and school (I have made the honour roll 3 semesters in a row). My brother tried to buy and install his own wifi about two or three years ago after getting fed up with the blocks on the wifi - a rep from the company came to install the modem and my dad found out and FLIPPED.  He made the tech leave and then proceeded to yell at my brother.  I get in trouble if I say a 'bad word' , was only recently allowed to put a lock on my door (and even then this was forced by my own hand: I grew a pair and just bought one and installed it on my own).  My parents and I argue sometimes and when it gets heated, they threaten to kick me out of the house, knowing that I'd have nowhere to go if they did so.  Last time my mom got two inches away from my face, screaming at me to 'pack my shit and go'.  They get annoyed if I don't eat with them when I'm home, even if I'm cooking my own food or just simply not hungry.  I started dating my first boyfriend a few months ago, and when I was going to visit him, my father stopped me in the hallway, and told me not to 'give it all up'.  This was so embarrassing and I was livid. I told him it was none of his business, and he told me that I was a precious 'commodity'.  If a certain chore isn't done exactly to a specification, I am dragged out of bed to finish it.  If I am on the phone or have my headphones on, my name is yelled because I am needed for 'something' that can usually wait until what I was doing is over. They've threatened to give the family dog away when he wasn't walked one day (I was doing a task and lost track of time). There are more incidences, but I'd be here forever listing them. It's like their priorities and needs are always more important than mine. 

I realize that I am an adult and need to do things on my own.  I know that I am extremely lucky and privileged to have the opportunity that I do for this living situation while I'm in school.  However, I'm starting to get frustrated and feel like I'm not being given room to grow up, even though I'm twenty-four years old!  Moving out is not an option at the moment (I am currently saving but it most likely won't happen until I am out of school and can get a full-time job), but I need some sort of freedom and separation from them.  I feel suffocated, trapped, and embarrassed, but also anxious and worried that I'm going to jeopardize my education if I try to do something that they deem 'drastic'. How can I establish my independence without going overboard?

TL;DR:

My parents treat me like I'm sixteen even though I'm twenty four.  They won't let me have any type of freedom and privacy, and although they might be trying to protect me, I think it's going overboard.  How can I break away and attempt to be more independent?",01Mar2020,1

183,"TLDR: Give me a reason why I really need to move out of my city despite meeting some really cool people at the last minute.

Last year, I was in a rut. I was graduating with no job prospects, I couldn't afford the city, and I had lost one of my closest friends for damn near no reason at all. When my landlord proposed a rent increase, me and my sister (my roommate) literally considered moving to New Jersey to make ends meet. In NYC, we're already living way below market price and it's still too  expensive. Luckily, my landlord lacked enough initiative to actually draw up a new lease so we're now on a month-to-month. But in the midst of my emotional/financial crisis I realized a couple of things:

a) New Jersey, including Jersey City, will never be a desirable location for me. In spite of the cheap rent, it hardly emulates a true metropolitan area in the creative sense, and for me, commuting just doesn't seem worth it.

b) I've been to many cities before, but by far NYC exudes the largest attitude of relationship disposability-- the idea that people aren't worth staying in touch besides short transactions or networking. Romantic or not, there's plenty of fish in the city.

c) I hate gentrification. I can't even look around my neighborhood without feeling incredibly discontent and anxious. I also simply can't afford to live here. 

d) While most major metropolitan areas are gentrifying, few are doing so at the rate of New York.

e) I want to live alone. My sister and I don't even remotely share the same cleaning habits and I hardly sleep at night because she likes loud music and watching anime into the AM. I've lived with 2 other roommates before and my passive nature has forced me into being a silent sufferer. Even if I do confront issues, they're never resolved and an argument or unspoken grudge presents itself.

f) Living so close to my family members makes it really hard to be who I am and express myself accordingly. Whether or not they're with me in the moment, I feel immense pressure knowing that they're not that far away.

All these points led me to Philadelphia. Close to New York City both in culture and physical proximity, but far cheaper. I've researched Philly for the past year, visited, and I'm determined to move there. Regardless of my failing job search, I began searching specifically for remote jobs so finding a new job after moving wouldn't be an obstacle. As an English major, copywriting would provide the stability I needed in the moment.

Well, I finally got the job. My paycheck has increased dramatically, and I'm working from home. I decided to moved to Philly May 1 because I'm afraid if I wait any longer my anxiety will debilitate me.

But in the past few months I've met or strengthened relationships with some awesome people. For example, when I told my coworkers I was quitting, we organized monthly brunches as a group to keep in contact. And on an individual basis, I meet up with one or two of the group every other week to just chill and hangout. At least two of them have the potential in my mind to be really compatible, long-term friends. We really love and respect each other, and share the values I appreciate in a friend.

Then on the other side of things, I met about three people whom I have romantic/sexual relationships with. Usually this doesn't matter much to me because I don't take romance as seriously as most people do. Except these people have put in a lot of effort into getting to know me and I feel like our relationships with one another could be long-lasting and meaningful. I don't get easily attached and I'm not, but I can always tell whether a new partner will ghost in a month (which happens quite often to me in NYC) or will be one of the greater experiences in my lifetime.

The problem is I need to move. I'm not usually the one to blame my mental wellbeing on an arbitrary place or locale. But even if it weren't for the general feeling of suckiness this decision started with, there are concrete characteristics of this city that are pushing me away. Even if I made a salary where I wouldn't have to worry about money and savings so much, I would feel like a traitor of sorts living in a city where a certain standard of living that is pervasively inaccessible is normalized. My local grocery store is an ""organic market"" and my food stamps for the month cover only some eggs, milk, and sandwich ingredients.

Maybe someone can offer a motivational quote or two that reinforces the notion that I need to get the heck out of here no matter what. Any advice is greatly appreciated.",01Mar2020,1

Hi,
So I have bad neighbors. We live in a duplex with paper thin walls so we hear everything. They fight all the time. Like bad. They scream they’ll throw stuff at each other and run the sweeper at all times of the night/morning because whatever it was broke. I’m talking like between 1-5am are the hours they’re most active and they’re doing these things. They’ve woken up my son and when he asked them to stop fighting so he could sleep for school the next day they yelled “be quiet little boy.” There was another time they were fighting and the wife was screaming help me call the police and BANGING on my 8 year old sons wall at 3am. Now, normally I would call 911 if I heard things like this, however, this is normal for them. They’ve called the police on each other and say everything is okay once they get there and the cops go. Also, my boyfriends cousin lived here before us and anytime they would call the police same thing, so we don’t bother. They like to move heavy things at all hours of the night. Not sure what it could possibly be or why they move it so often clearly they don’t have carpet. Their daughter likes to stay up until 5 in the morning laughing loudly and yelling at her game she plays all night but I don’t mind that much since she is a kid, but she’s also the age she should kind of like idk... understand how to be respectful to neighbors, but I digress. I put up with all of this, but today they did something that really pissed me off. I am not claiming to be the perfect neighbors but we are pretty quiet. We don’t bother people, we tend to keep to ourselves. This brings me to today. Yesterday was garbage day so we took the garbage out to the corner, and my bad I completely forgot to bring it back over so it sat outside for a day. Earlier I hear the neighbor yelling about trash blah blah and the garbage cans being slammed. He threw the cans into my yard.  I would understand if it were a reoccurring theme with us, but this is the first time that has happened. Even if it were a reoccurring thing with us I feel like there are better ways to handle it? Like not throwing my property onto my property wether it’s garbage cans or not? That may be how they treat their belongings (and I know they do because I hear it all of the time) but that’s not how we treat ours. Should I say something or do something? I don’t think that’s right at all. Am I being over dramatic? I don’t like them, but I’ve always remained polite to them so I’m at a loss.

I’m not allowed to talk to my cousins or see my cousins. My mom has always thought they were bad influences even when she babysat them as kids and I was a baby or not even born yet. 

I’m not allowed to talk or see them since 2016. They both took pictures of my house and everybody in my house when nobody was looking and made fake accounts about everyone in my house all over social media. My mom found out and accused them and their mom defended them and their mom sent my mom a really mean email telling her off and it’s just a whole mess. So my sister and I have been banned. They are not allowed at my house. I think my mom kinda deserved it cuz she’s mean imo. 

Anyways, Brianna and Jessica reached out to me a few days ago on Instagram. 
I’ve been talking to them on the DL.

Brianna wants me to sneak out of my house next Friday and say I’m going to a friends house (we live in a crowded small town). And Brianna said she would come pick me up and drive me to a trampoline park where Jessica lives and we can all hang out. 
Nobody in my house knows I’m talking to either of them. Not even my sister. 

Brianna doesn’t go to college and works part time at a gas station near her house. She has a bunch of piercings and tattoos. Her own mother thinks she’s a terrible influence on her younger sisters but gave up on her I think. I know she has PTSD and used to get in trouble as a teen. She lives at home with her parents and her boyfriend lives there’s too. She used to get bullied at school and I don’t think she has any friends besides her boyfriend. (She’s always not had many friends). 

Jessica lives at home with her parents and is in therapy and has been in/out mental hospitals. She doesn’t have any friends. She doesn’t have a boyfriend and sits at home a lot. She doesn’t go to school either. I think she is bipolar and depression and maybe Aspergers. She got bullied a lot too when she was younger but she has no friends because she has bad pms or some thing I forget what she said. 

What’s funny is Jessica and briannas moms actually didn’t want them to see eachother when they were teenagers because they were bad influences and now they are like best friends. 

Anyways should I lie and say I’m going to a friends house and go with them? What if my mom calls my friends mom? How can I prevent her from doing that? Or how can I get my friends mom to lie and say I’m there? Or should I just say I have to stay at school longer for tutoring or something?",01Mar2020,1
188,"So I only have one friend in real life but recently we got in an argument cause she sent pictures of me to my online friends knowing i'm very self conscious I tried to talk to her about it but she made it sound like I was over reacting even though my online friends don't know what I look like.. and this isn't really the first time she has done something like this, she causes me a lot of stress and doesn't really care about how I feel and I know I might have been overreacting a little bit and maybe I should just say sorry to her but if I say sorry for overreacting i'm afraid she is gonna keep causing me stress and ruining my relationships with people and honestly I kinda wanna wait for her to say sorry since she usually doesn't but I wanna know if it was my fault for what happened, I really don't know if I should say sorry or not... I really need advice on what to do in this situation..",01Mar2020,1
189,"Hi guys. This post might be more serious than other AITA posts so bear with me, but I'm really not sure if I'm in the right here. In short, my mother has a terminal illness and is reaching the end of her life. Her and my father have always fought about his porn use and just recently I came home to them fighting because she found a thumb drive with some porn on it. She kept telling me he was a pedophile because of the nature of the porn on the drive (""teen"" porn, not actual child porn) and urging me to do something about it. I told her its not my place to fight her maritial issues to which she told me it was a ""family issue"" and then indicted me ad an accomplice in his ""pedophilia"". I just tried my best to explain to her that although my father has been bad to her its not illegal and that I will try my best to support her. But unfortunatly things got heated she said some nasty things to me and I said some nasty things back which I deeply regret having said now. In the end she told me she doesnt want me at her death bed and essentially disowned me. She also revealed to me that my father inadvertantly exposed me to porn when I was young which I don't remember. I'm not trying to make my mother seem evil, clearly she is under an amount of stress I cannot begin to fathom, nor am I trying to make my father seem ok, but should I have taken my mother's side with this one? Keep in mind I am 21 so I am not a minor. In the end I just feel hurt and confused. I'm not sure if I did the right thing and would appreciate a second opinion.",01Mar2020,1
190,"I'm finding it difficult to accept the reality of my situation and move forward. That's where I'm at right now.

Over the years I've dealt with some pretty bad depression that frankly stunted my growth as a child/young adult and only now (I'm 23) have I really had the... mental awareness and support to treat it and maintain a mentally healthier lifestyle.

Which is great, but now I've entered a world in which I am becoming aware of my shortcomings sans depression, and frankly... it's pretty bleak. 

Without denigrating myself, it would be fair to say that I am not ""good"" at anything right now. As someone who needs money to survive, this worries me. If I was an employer, I would not hire myself--I am unkempt, rebellious (not that woke, I just don't like being told what to do, and I don't think anyone else should either), and generally a bit off (or so I sense from other people). The difficult part is that I actually quite like who I am, I have no desire to be part of anything or achieve in a physical sense, and while I've occasionally tidied myself up... it's just not who I am--I can't look in the mirror when I'm like that. My friends, family, and  significant other are great--I couldn't ask for better. I don't really WANT anything.

And yet, I know I am heading for a cliff. In the past 6+ years I've only had two real jobs, and frankly... shit scares me yo. I'm terrified of working, it makes me feel like shit, and found myself becoming worse than ever. The rest of my time I've spent going to school--in fact a part of the reason I went to grad school was to avoid working. Engineering, Writing, Art, Architecture--I've tried A LOT of things, and they've all interested me, and I've been unable to... succeed in any of them? I've tried to use passion and interest to elevate my various works, but it's always short lived, and I end up burnt out after only a few months. And then there's the opposite, I try to be dispassionate, use structure and methodology to get my work my done in a ""professional"" manner--and it's equally ineffective. Executive dysfunction creeps in slowly and destroys any good habits I set for myself.

In my program, I'm fairly motivated, but I look around and it's obvious that I'm one of the worst in my class--I work too slow, my quality is lower than others, and I just don't click with the rhetoric that they're teaching us--I don't even have to time to get out and network because I'm just exhausted by the time I get home (even when I get nothing done). It just feels like everyone tolerates me and I'm not learning anything or making an investment.

I've gone to therapy, and it's helped, and I got a prescription for an SSRI which has made my mood considerably better, but hasn't really helped otherwise. I went to a career counselor, but I'll be the first to admit that it's hard to direct someone who ""doesn't really want to do anything"" (and when I pressed I told him I really just want a cottage with a garden, to which he snickered and told me that that's just ""waiting to die""). I've tried x, y, and z approaches to maintaining some kind of self discipline or productivity, but they just don't work.

So I don't know what to do any more. 

I don't have any real skills and when I try to develop them I either fall on my face or don't reach a level of competence that I can rely on.

The thought of ""working"" terrifies me, doing (almost) anything for 8 hours a day is almost impossible for me, plus the pressure, and the expectations--it makes me shiver.

And I don't really want to change, but I know that if I don't I'm going to end up homeless eventually--and im ESPECIALLY scared that even if I do pull something together I'll end up homeless anyways because I can't keep anything together for more than 2-3 months at a time.

I just want to be left alone, to my own devices, to explore, to build a hut on some land somewhere and just... exist? But that's the one thing that our western society says you pretty much can't do--you can't check out, you can't leave the system. 

I'm scared, and angry, and lost. Please help me.",01Mar2020,1
191,"I've been browsing Reddit for a little over 4 years and finally decided to make an account since I can't find anything about this online, maybe I'm just not looking but there is little to no information on this subject that I've seen.  
I'm 14 right now soon to be 15, I absolutely love birds! Not just the ""I've held a cockatoo once and now want to adopt them all"" love but I've been around them most of my life and have fallen in love with the animals, I have a lot of free time being a homeschool student and no longer attending a co-op.

I've been thinking of things to do with my time instead of sitting at my desk playing Skyrim and overwatch 24/7, then the idea of resuing birds came into mind just randomly, I actually have three birds of my own and love them to death. Though I wouldn't mind taking in some that are in need of a home I needed more information on it since I would probably rehabilitate, hand tame, train, hand feed and raise them from eggs and eventually rehome them. 

I have been looking online if there is an age requirement or a license you need but as mentioned before I haven't found anything, I have space and access to vet care though still, I'm not sure how many requirements there are.   
Thank you for taking the time to read this, I really appreciate any information on this! Have a great day/evening/night.",01Mar2020,1

193,"So my kitten. Oh boy, I’ve had her about 5 months and she’s somewhere between 7-8 months old. If you’re going to give me the advice of “she’s a kitten she’ll grow out of it”. Go elsewhere, just because she’s a kitten doesn’t mean good behaviour shouldn’t be instilled into her. INB4 how do you know it isn’t your other cat? My other cat I’ve had for 4 years and I’ve literally never had an issue with her doing any of these things. 

She is also a bengal X

Now I want to clarify, it DOES NOT matter how much attention we give her or how many toys she is, she will still do it. We could give her attention the entire day and she will still find something to chew on. 

Example, boyfriend and I are big gamers, so we have a designated cat spot for both our cats. One cat sits on his desk at a time, the other will sit on our of laps, when the kitten is on either of laps, she will bite our cords, she gets smacked, she goes back to it and takes another chomp until we put her down. 

Scavenging for food. She always has fresh biscuits and water whenever she wants. At night time they get tinned food. I always OVER feed the kitten so I know she definitely isn’t hungry (she leaves at least 1/4 of her bowl with wet food), and not even 10 minutes later she will jump up on the bench trying to find the food we cooked up for dinner. 

Our garage is seperate is to our actual house, so whenever we have to go do washing we have to go into the garage, she will sit at the front door and meow, it’s not a calm meow either, it is a high pitched meow to the point where the neighbours have made a noise complaint about us. 

She has everything, imagine going to a house with 2 kids and their children’s toys are everywhere. That is my house but with cat toys. Our cats are strictly inside cats and I will not be an irresponsible pet owner and have my cat go outside to terrorise the wildlife. 

But some form of effective punishment please. We have tried smacking her but, we have a spray bottle, I’ve even tried giving her a time out so she just settles down and nada.",01Mar2020,1
194,"TL;DR: 24f facing the prospect of forced marriage, miserable and unsure of my next steps. What do I practically need to do, given that I'm waiting on a few possible work opportunities (which I can't speed up) to solidify? In this ridiculously difficult time, what should I focus on for self-care and well-being? Can anyone share similar experiences and what they learned from them? 

I think I need to provide a full account to help you understand my situation. I'm just about to finish up my teaching degree in Canada. My parents (immigrants, religious, extremely traditional) expect me to start teaching as soon as I can and to go through with their plan to find me a husband from our religious and cultural community ASAP. In their minds, there is no wiggle room to postpone this or for me to explore options beyond marrying a guy they approve. I've been raised to be a good daughter and do what my parents think is best. It's a very different culture, but they hold onto it even more tightly now that we're in a different country. 

I've been raised in Canada for the most part. I have some issues from my family for which I've sought therapy for years. I've tried many times over the years to ""just say no"" to my parents - but to them, either you give up your autonomy or you've shamed the family and you are cast out (presumably, that's what I've been threatened with over the years). For instance, I can't go on vacation by myself. It has to be with family members, and even then only immediate family really ""counts."" I was told my entire life that I'd better become a doctor, so that was what I thought I wanted. Then, when my dad realized how long it took to become a doctor, he started to worry that his daughters would be too old for marriage by the time they finished medical school. He switched promptly to teaching as his preferred profession. We're from a very small religious community, so there aren't that many ""good men"" to go around, according to my dad. Hence the need to rush education. 

I thought I was getting into teaching for the right reasons (not just because it aligned with my dad's wishes), but I feel like I was manipulated. I've never been able to voice negative emotions in a healthy way. I've struggled an insane amount because of the stress I dealt with throughout my childhood and teen years. I watched my sister become a shell of who she used to be and cry every night for weeks before she was married off 2 years ago. It wasn't ""forced"" using physical violence - it was instilled into her throughout her life that her opinion didn't matter and that it was her duty to marry a man her parents chose, and at some point, I couldn't even see the real her anymore. We used to be best friends and now we're almost strangers. 

My parents tried (over a year ago now) to pressure me into becoming engaged to a guy I'd met twice. They got my sister on their side. My dad explained that I was getting old and ugly, etc. and I needed to marry, my mom joked about having to kick me out of the house, and my sister told me, ""You can never be 100% sure when you get married anyway, and this guy is pretty good."" It was a long, painful wearing-down of my right to choose and I cracked under the pressure. To them, that's not a forced marriage. That's just our culture. I said yes, but then I went behind their backs and met up with the guy, who was a decent person and didn't consider us to be engaged anyway, so nothing came of that. I was in an extremely dark place afterward. I felt like my family had betrayed me in the worst way. They preyed on insecurities that they'd created by having criticized me during my childhood. I made a big fuss and told them that they couldn't bother me about marriage. After a long while and many more arguments, they agreed to leave me alone, but only until my program finished. I ""agreed."" 

There have been many ""discussions"" (one-way conversations) about major life events with my dad. He thinks we need to talk about them, and I'm not allowed to refuse because he's my elder. These start with my dad wanting to know my opinion, after which he circles back to himself and what he wants. He doesn't let up until I have agreed to what he says. I've become better at handling him in conversation since the near-engagement, but I still feel rotten afterward because he knows exactly what he is doing. He talks in a certain way, acts a certain way, and he looks at me a certain way in order to get what he wants. He's manipulative and it makes me feel physically sick. Having said that, it's still very uncomfortable to acknowledge that this is abuse and that I'm a victim of my own family. It weighs me down.  

I'm feeling pretty down about the future. I am finishing my degree in April, I have a part-time job and my boss is okay with me staying on for the summer, but I need a solid exit strategy. Rent is expensive in this area. I live pretty far from the school and I'm currently in a student teaching placement near home with a monster of a mentor teacher. I have my therapist, a school counselor and one of my instructors. It feels like my friends from school are busy and stressed out about their own lives, but they have people to fall back on and I don't. Most of the time, it's just me. It feels like I should have a solid exit plan already, but there are so many paths I could take and I won't find out for certain about some of them until weeks from now. All I want to do these days is sleep and cry. What should I do (practically and in terms of self-care) to help myself through this dark time?",01Mar2020,1
196,"So basically as the title says, my dad is a guy that wants challenges, he doesn't do business for the money, but he does it because he wants to be in a tightrope/stress situations. It feeds his nature. Basically he grew up in a house with no walls, water or electricity. He made a lot of effort to get out of the situation, and he did. Today he is kinda well off? He owns a lot of real estate. But his usual business of home repairment is boring him, the profits increase each year, but he is the type of human that needs day to day challenges(imo he kinda crazy). Basically he wants to do something with me... And this is where our problems begin. He will support both financially and work on any idea I have, about anything.

198,"I have been working at a pretty small startup for less than a year. At some point I was in the bathroom, and I heard the door to the restroom open and saw the shadow of someone sneak silently by into a stall. I then overheard what sounded like someone throwing up. 

This happened many more times while I was in the bathroom and I saw who the woman was entering/leaving the stall when it happened. She seems to think she passes off the vomiting as peeing and regular bathroom noises, as she consistently does this even when others are in the bathroom. I saw her feet facing the toilet on several occasions, so I know I am not imagining anything.

This has continued for months, and I'm not sure if it's my (28F) place to do anything. This woman is older, in her 50s or so and is extremely thin. My company is pretty small, and we don't even have a real HR department. There is just some guy on the Finance team that also acts as the de facto company HR.

I have not addressed this woman, nor told anyone else that I work with.

204,My body and joints ache all the time. I can never find a comfortable position. I get weird rashes on my eyelids that never fully clear up. My mom has lupus so sometimes I wonder if I have an autoimmune problem. My mind often feels cloudy and I cant focus. I went through some very emotionally difficult events when I began noticing these problems. I was seeing a therapist but she didnt believe I had depression just going through a difficult time. I had been diagnosed with PTSD years ago. But I have gotten better at not overthinking and managing stress and anxiety. I still struggle to motivate myself and keep a routine due to feeling to achy or tired to do the things I need to. I really need some help. I've read so many self help articles and even reddit posts. Sometimes they help temporarily but the physical and mental pain always comes back. Usually I can get my mind on track but my body is still so tired and achy that I still cant get simple things done. And if my body feels ok then my mind runs out of steam quickly and I no longer focus. Basically I feel physically and mentally exhausted all the time. I know that mental health can effect physical health and vise versa. Could use some advice as to what it could be and what if anything I can do. Doctors frequently blow off symptoms like these because it could be so many things. I know it took my mom years to get her lupus diagnosed.

210,"Okay, so I made a Tinder account a few months ago. I first made a joke account of a cartoon character, then it got banned.

I didn't take it seriously, and I used a name similar to my name instead of my real one. 


I have since deleted the account since I've realized it's a waste of time, but I've been texting and meeting with a guy I met on the app and I kind of like him.

213,"So I have Snapchat right?  There’s also this yolo app connected to Snapchat where you put out a message and post on ur story and people can send u messages and u respond to them publicly.

So I sent out a message saying “Ask me anything” and I got some good questions and some odd ones I shouldn’t have answered.  “Dick size”, “who would u date”, etc.  questions I regret answering.  One asked if I would have sex with this person or this person and I said (jokingly) “three some” and some people took it literally and some took it as I was being funny, which was the intention.  

I understand people don’t understand the tone you talk in when on the Internet.  One of the brothers of the girls got concerned about it and told me to stop using the app since it’s creepy and disgusting.  I had to agree with him even though I tried defending myself saying it was meant to be funny.  He said they were laughing at me, not with me.  So with the only choice I had, I deleted yolo.  

The next day, I talk to my friend who is close with the girls from the yolo.  I asked him what they though about it and he said they thought it was funny and that they still think I’m cool, which is a good thing obviously.

My father had a physically/verbally abusive relationship with his father(Italians are crazy sometimes). He has always been very impulsive, overreactive, verbally abusive, and has
a history of drug abuse. At his age of 70, he is becoming increasingly senile and aggressive. He is not capable of correctly taking care/raising a child. He had her with a 21 year old who is obviously not around and watched by CPS. It was a mistake and in his eyes he’s going to make things right by taking care of her until the day he dies. Every afternoon/night I come home from class or work, I hear yelling between the two of them. I’ve mentioned many times that he needs to slow down and stop yelling because it will just provoke my step-sister to do it too. There’s no changing it because he either forgets or has a stigma about yelling being effective. Any time he asks me to do something he almost yells/screams up the stairs and I feel bothered by it every time. Because he takes his anger/stress out on me. Essentially, he’s overly aggressive and has mental issues with depression/anxiety etc.

For me, I’m a junior in college going for Public Health(very high employment rate in Buffalo). I work about 20 hours a week just to be able to pay a car payment ($320). My father is the “buyer” of the car and I’m the co-sign. I have cut down my hours recently to 12-15 in order for me to focus on my heavy workload at school. Also with my financial aid situation, I can only make at most $5000 before the aid is taken away. 
I have ADHD and I need more time for things than the usual person. I am not by any means mentally declined, but it does take me a little bit extra time because I get distracted. 
Unfortunately I have not been able to come up with the $ for the car payment this month, I’ve had no time for anything besides studying, normal daily life activities, paying for gas, and trying to have a social life. I have 9am classes every weekday so I cannot be up too late or else I sleep through class. My father presses me about avoiding him every once in a while. I avoid him because he never has anything positive to say and is always critical. Additionally, I try to focus as much as I can on school because that’s what he’s been preaching to me my whole entire life and now it’s “I don’t give a fuck how you get the money” even though has has thousands saved. 

Wrapping it up:
I have a long-time on/off “girlfriend” that lives 1.5 hours away that I visited for the beginning of february &amp; haven’t since. The EZ-pass bill for toll booths racked up $30. I came home from work today and got screamed at because I didn’t tell him and I don’t have the money to pay when I forgot because it was so long ago and I would be broke anyway because of the car payment. He basically said that he’s going to kick me out, but I think I have time before he’s actually serious. But I also NEED to leave this toxic environment for good so I can graduate and make a life for myself. 

This is my predicament. My college is debt-free right now, but I want to get a federal college loan to be able to dorm/have a meal plan. I’m not sure if an ON-campus apartment is smarter because of cheaper groceries. I’m just contemplating: How can I live on campus without any parental support? What will happen come summer time? Internship? I have a very supportive best friend, but that’s about it until a certain extent. Any advice will help &amp; if ask any questions. Thank you so much.",01Mar2020,1
218,"Basically I’ll (try to) keep it short: my father basically abandoned me at 4. He was in trouble for a lot of heinous stuff. I had no contact with that side of my family since (18 years) all by THEIR choice. It’s always been something that bothered me and I wanted to reconnect with that side of my family, so last october I wrote my paternal grandmother a letter. I guess I should have seen it coming, but instead of getting a response from her I got an email from my father (I had included it in my letter.) 

I was reluctant to respond to him, like I said he was in trouble for some serious stuff when I was a kid, and I’m honestly a little scared of him. But, I also felt like this was my only option to go forward with trying to connect with the rest of my family, so we started exchanging texts. I obviously have a lot of questions, but I feel scared to bring up anything serious (most of are texts are just “how are you doing” “good” kinda stuff) in case he cuts off contact with me or tell my grandmother not to contact me either, or something worse.

Recently he told me he’d like to “spend some time” with me. I’m very nervous about this. For one, I am terrified of him. I’ve been having nightmares  about him for weeks and now they are getting worse. Plus even if I did agree, I have no clue where or when we’d meet. At this point I’m a woman in her 20s meeting a man who is basically a stranger.

Not only that but I feel like if I met him in person I’d HAVE to confront him about all the things he has done or neglected. Why did he never contact me, why did he leave, why he never even bothered to pay child support (I grew up very poor all my life, but he is very well off), why did he do all the terrible and disgusting things he did, just so many WHYs. I have pretty bad anxiety and I’m not a confrontational person but I feel like I need these things answered.

So I guess my question is should I meet up with him and confront him? And if I do, how do I approach it without coming off as purely resentful? Should I try just a phone call or email my questions first, or would doing it in person be better? I just feel so confused and I don’t really have anyone here to help me figure this out.

Thanks in advance.",01Mar2020,1
222,"We’re all 17 and seniors, there’s a guy that’s 18, who had to repeat a year).
Anyway, I think my friends are bad. Here are my reasons why:
-Whenever I say something serious, they shrug it off, or change the subject. Whenever they talk about something serious going on in their lives, I’m their shoulder to cry on. I don’t mind this at all, I just wish they would do the same for me.
-There’s this guy in our squad that bullied me mercilessly, so I stopped talking to him. Except my friends. They love him: they won’t shut up about how funny and great he is. He has fought me in our group chat, with all of our squad watching, so it’s not like they can play dumb, because he knows. Hell, one of my friends started dating him right after he called me a bunch of slurs.
-Whenever we talk about politics, I’m the “feminzi” (that’s their way of saying feminist).
They brush me off as a crazy feminist because I talk about social issues quite often. 
-They don’t care about me: whenever I talk about my ED, they brush it off. I think maybe since I’m not “thin” they don’t believe it. Whenever my thin friend says something about an ED, they worry about her and shower her with positive affirmations and advice. I do the same for her, but she doesn’t do that for me.
-Whenever I say something in our group chat, they just leave me on read. 
-No one will ever take my side. I know that taking sides is toxic, but at least I’d like to hear that I’m not the bad guy that my bully paints me to be.
-They’re friends with an ex-bully of middle school. She bullied me mercilessly too. They won’t shut up about what an amazing and kind person she is!

Most of these things happen in our group chat on messenger, but they also take place in school.
I don’t know if I’m being dramatic, but I’d appreciate if someone gave me their point of view.",01Mar2020,1

On top of that, his reckless and unprotected sex has put my sexual health at risk. I've started resenting him. I want to leave but I'm afraid to.

it wasn't for a relationship or anything like that. they had made a post saying that they wanted friends with the same interests, so i decided to message them but now i'm too afraid to respond.

i haven't really had any friends since i was about 9 or 10, and i try my best to talk to other people when i have the chance, but i always get afraid and end up either ghosting them mid-conversation or take so long to respond that they stop talking to me. i suspect that i might have some form of anxiety, but i haven't talked to any professionals about it.

i'd usually just leave the conversation and keep living my life, but i feel like i might come off as an asshole if i do that? i messaged them first, so i feel like it'd be a jerkass move to abandon the conversation like that. honestly, i don't even want to talk to them anymore, not because there's anything wrong with them, but i just realized that online communication isn't suited for me.

i've also refrained from posting in any way, or even logging on. my account is semi-popular, so i'm afraid that if i post they'll see it. i both liveblog about games i play and make actual posts on there, so i've put multiple hobbies on hold over this.

231,"Throwaway account because this situation is kind of specific.

So, I am a college freshman who lives at home, and is best friends with two other people who are roommates on campus, and live in the dorms. At the beginning of the Fall semester, I decided that I wanted to live closer to campus, and asked my two friends who live together if they would live in a 2x2 double occupancy apartment with me next year. We all excitedly agreed, and began looking. I found a few places and we toured one, before deciding to look in the Spring semester, when prices would be a little cheaper.  We also were looking for a 4th roommate as well, and at this time, it was agreed the roommate A or B would get to live with me and whoever doesn't, would stay in the other room with the 4th roommate we find.

Fast forward to Spring semester, roommates A and B talk amongst each other as they live with each other and I guess roommate A decided she wants to continue living with roommate B and leave me with the random 4th person. I remind them of the agreement we made earlier in the year, and roommate B says that I could live with roommate A and roommate B continues looking for an apartment and a 4th person. At this point, I had mentioned to them that I wanted an apartment closer to campus, which they were fine with, but I guess before they thought I wanted a cheaper apartment and were looking for them. Roommate B got in contact with a realtor and the realtor agrees to show us around on Friday. On Friday, I have a sudden issue with the lab I am working with, and have to go take care of it, which causes me to miss the apartment touring. At this point, Roommate B asks me to come pick up some stuff I left at her dorm, and I told her that I would pick it up later, as I had to take a bus home that was coming soon (important detail for later). The next day I get a call from B, saying that A and B decided to live together, and that I would have to find a roommate on my own. I had to hang up as I was going somewhere and I couldn't talk to her about it. Later on I get a text in the gc we had that basically says that if I don't find a roommate by spring break (which is in 2 weeks, and those 2 weeks are filled with tests and what not), they would sign without me. 

At this point I was so upset that I burst into tears. From random people I would expect this, but not from people I consider my best friends. It wasn't even the fact that they were signing without me, but rather that they made multiple decisions without me, and basically said ""fuck you if you can't find a roommate, we are signing without you"". I ended up calling them later on during the day and A tries to say ""oh you didn't do anything to help anyways"" and I remind her of the time I spent last semester looking for an apartment, when she had done nothing. B says ""you didn't want to live in that apartment"" and I told her that I had said I didn't want to live so far away, not without them. A also says that I was always too busy to meet up, but never had she said in explicit terms to come meet up with them with the exception of the apartment tour on Friday. A said that she was becoming anxious about finding an apartment if she waited, but the thing is, is that apartments are in higher demand than there are students.

I told them I was hurt, and they never apologized, and I told them that close friends wouldn't do that, and she said we aren't perfect (but did not discuss it further). I am meeting with them tomorrow to talk about it in person but I need some advice on a few things:

a) What should I say to them? I don't want to break years of friendship because of this, but they seem like they don't care about me at all which is really making me feel conflicted. I really want to bring up the fact that A didn't do any research and that there are so many apartments always available even after spring break, and that if we make the decision together about roommates and 

b) Should I even consider rooming with them? If they hurt my feelings this much now and make decisions without asking me, then what will they do in the future? I really like the apartment they are thinking about, it seems nice and is close to campus. 

I just feel very conflicted and hurt and upset and betrayed because they're my best friends.",01Mar2020,1

238,"So me and my best friend are both sophomores in college, we have been extremely close since the beginning of freshman year and have been there for each other through some really tough times. We spend a lot of time together, whenever we’re free we do stuff together and I love her a lot. The thing is she is very distrustful and pessimistic about others’ intentions. Whenever I talk to her about my other friends, she always seems to dislike them before even meeting them. 

Example: I told her about a coworker who was playfully roasting me and hurting my feelings somewhat. She said he sounded like an asshole. I felt like he just didn’t understand that he was hurting my feelings, so I told him. He apologized and bought me a ($5) gift card to say sorry. My best friend’s response was to assume that he was just trying to make a move on me, despite the fact that I know he is interested in someone else.

Another example: I recently befriended a girl who is extremely sweet, bubbly and personable. She can be a little gossipy sometimes. In my opinion she is genuine and just doesn’t have much of a filter, but my friend thinks she’s fake and untrustworthy just because she has a lot of friends and has been known to talk some shit.

It’s the same with people I date. I tell her my honest opinion of people (the good and the bad), but she only ever seems to see the bad while I try to focus on the good. She has been screwed over a lot in the past while people have generally been nice to me in my life, so I understand that we might just see the world differently.

241,"This is my first post so forgive me for the poor writing and formatting, just really need some direction on how to handle this situation. 

So as it says in the title, we are concerned about my friends ex, who during their relationship was emotionally and physically abusive and has actually been tested and shown very low signs of empathy. They lived together with her sister back when they were dating and he has been very creepy to her sister as well, to the point where she didn’t feel safe at home with him without someone there. Her sister(my s/o) is currently living there with their brother for context. 

Since they have broken up he has been randomly sending her texts every month or two, and lately has been contacting her brother and making sexual comments about her and her sister, along with asking if they were single. He has also super liked her roommate on tinder just to get her attention. While she no longer responds to him, she is afraid to block him because there is a possibility that if he finds out he might be unstable enough to harm himself or show up at the house where her two siblings live(thankfully he doesn’t know her new address). 

He hasn’t showed up in person to my knowledge but we are worried telling him to leave them alone might cause him to do something, and ignoring him might have the same effect. He hasn’t done or said anything concrete that we could show police to get a restraining order so we are kind of in a bind on what to do. She has considered telling his mom in hopes of getting him help and so that she can keep tabs on him, but this could also backfire and make him angry.

243,"Hello everybody! This is whole situation is a bit of a doozy so I hope I can explain it clearly.

My ex and I broke up about 5 months ago. It was a four month relationship with a lot of ups and downs. It reached a point where I had to choose between myself or the relationship. I chose myself and I broke up with him. 

The break up was messy. We were both angry and upset and pretty much blocked each other on everything. I even went to therapy because of how badly it messed me up. I was then informed by my therapist that he was emotionally abusive. I was in shock and could not believe it. So I promised myself I would get over him and better myself. 

I was actually doing really well. I was happier, laughing more, and I barely thought about him. I even quit drinking and vaping because I realized I only did it to cope. But then things went downhill very quickly.

Last week we both went to the same party to see some old high school friends. We avoided each other but after the party he contacted me. He messaged me and said he wanted to check in, to make sure I was doing okay. And this is when I made the biggest mistake of my life. I responded. This was the catalyst that caused us to talk for 4 hours.

We talked about everything and reminisced about old times. I realized how much I missed him. And I missed the feelings he gave me. It shocked me how easy it was. We agreed to be friends and added each other back on Snapchat.

We snap everyday and are quickly on the way to being mutual best friends. We flirt like we used to which has led me to be extremely confused. We agreed to be friends but we don’t talk like friends. I even started to drink again and vape again because of how much this is weighing on me. 

I know he’s not good for me but I can’t seem to let go. I know I’m only 18 and this is a small blip in my life but I just feel so alone. My friends around me are sick and tired of hearing about him. My family doesn’t want to see me that hurt again so his name is pretty much banned in our household. 

I just don’t know what to do so I hope some random kind Redditors will give me the advice I need.

244,"I was recently in a long bout of depression. At the time I tried to make myself feel better by helping strangers even though I was jobless and could barely afford it. I met a friend this way, who actually ended up being genuine and in a rough place herself. I won't go into heavy details, but she has bad relations with all of her family, and has been trying to get over her first and only romantic breakup for almost a year (she also in her mid-20s like me, which I hope implies without saying that she is not explicitly at fault for her family not getting along with her.)

One night, after she moved out of her old address to live on her own, she asked me if I would be willing to date her. I tried to make sure this is what she really wanted, and eventually said yes.

The next morning she apologized saying she still hasn't moved on from her previous romance, and is sorry she asked me to date her the previous night because she had been drinking a little. (Shes not an alcoholic though... Or at least wasn't.) She said she needed to disappear from the online world entirely until she was in a better place. I did not react with anger it bargaining. I wished her well and said I would be here until she returned. But she hasn't returned.

Over the past several months, I've sent her occasional messages on Skype and over email, updating her on how I was doing, but they have all been left unread. I am not blocked. She just hasn't been online. I don't have her new address or any of her phone numbers. She also uses an alias everywhere online and only told me her real name after she trusted me, for her own safety.

251," My little brother is 12 right now. He has lots of free time in the weekends but instead, he just spends his time playing Roblox. Thing is, he's only ""awake"" for like 6 hours during the weekends. He acts like he's sleeping but in fact he's just watching whatever it is on his phone.
 
 According to my observations, he doesn't have ANY real life friends and only plays Roblox with some kid from India. There was an incident where the teacher herself had to call my mom to alert him about something. Not even the teacher had his direct number not to mention his classmates.

 I have never seen him play with someone in real life and I'm just too concerned about him. Can't just let him waste his time playing Roblox. I just want to see him interact with someone. He should be texting his crush, not chat in Roblox 24/7. He's not even engaging in some athletic activities. His routine is just wake up, play Roblox, play on his phone, sleep again, rinse and repeat. 

 I feel like he's ruining his life. He could have played soccer with his friends and could have gotten some real friends + healthier lifestyle. Instead, this kid just won't budge. What can I do to help him?

253,"My grandmothers old cat is getting bullied, I might have to adopt him so he lives a peaceful final years.

My grandma has 3 cats and a dog. One of them, Martin, does not get as much attention as the others and ends up getting bullied by the other cats. 

Martin is pretty close to 13-15 years old right now. We aren’t sure his exact age. He’s just got his skin cancer taken care of, he might be diabetic, and he’s getting more and more deaf as the days go on. My grandmother wants the best for him and has agreed to pay for his vet and food bills(I’m a broke college student). 

I am able to home him. He’ll stay at my boyfriends house until I’m able to get an apartment that allows cats. I basically live at my boyfriends anyways so he’d get much care and attention from me and his animal loving roommates(I have their permission). 

I know that my housing situation isn’t the best or most consistent right now, but I know this cat very well and we love each other. He isn’t able to snuggle much at his current home because of the other cars and I just know he deserves better. 

I want to know if I’m making the right decision in taking him in. He’s old and changing homes would already stress him out, I don’t want him to be surrounded by strangers as well. He’ll be loved and taken care of with me. He’ll have a backyard to play in, he’ll be able to go on walks with me(he enjoys walks with other people), and most importantly he’ll be able to snuggle someone and feel the love that he deserves everyday. I just don’t want him getting used to all sorts of strangers all over again, he doesn’t deserve that.

The problem however is is that this girl did have one of my old friends catch a case I think he was 17 at the time and the story that he had said was that they were fucking then her younger sister came in and he fingered her then he went and told her grandparents that they live with which led to them filing charges. Her story is quite different tho she says he was cheating on her and even slapped her one time and was fooling around with multiple girls and one of them was her younger sister which got around and found its way to her grandparents. With me being close friends with this guy I can see why he would maybe want to make up a different story than him cheating and everything to avoid social stigma but at the same time I want to believe that he would tell me the truth, I haven’t talked to him really since then because he changed schools and left town . I’m 18 years old and this girl is 16 but we are protected by Romeo and Juliet law from anything legal happening since we live in Texas.

262,"Sorry this is really long. But please read it and tell me honestly what you think. 
So to start this out, I have always had friends that were way more needy that I was. And it’s not a bad thing but I’ve got used to hanging out all the time while doing nothing and not even talking to each Other. So with my new roommate she is different from any other girl I have been really close with. I don’t know if it is just i have been lucky to have really close relationships with all my friends and she just isn’t the type or i am making something out of nothing. 

I met this girl about a year before we moved in together. We hung out all the time because we worked together and had a lot of same interests. Well this last April i was living on my own in my first apartment and one day my apartment completely flooded and i had to move out immediately. So as my number one person, behind my parents, I called her and she offered to move in together and find a place. Some time passes, we move in and everything is fine. But recently I have noticed that we aren’t as close as we used to be. 

Keep in mind, she has depression and sometimes just locks herself in her room until i knock on it. If i didn’t make an effort to talk to her I’m pretty sure we wouldn’t even talk for like a week straight. Recently i quit the job because I got a better offer to go somewhere else, and when all my other friends congratulated me on it, she didn’t say a single word. I know it’s not huge but it means something to me. Today even i knocked on her door to give her a lollipop and say hi and she didn’t even get up to open the door. It hurt my feelings. I just feel like I am always there for her every time she needs a pick me up or she goes through a break up but when I need her just to sit down and talk with me for like two minutes ( and she does open the door) it’s like i am a complete pain in the ass. But then other times she comes busting into my room eager to talk to me. 

Should I just move on and stop trying to continue the olive branch? Or should i give her time ( i don’t have depression so i don’t really know what it’s like to go through that) and let her come to me? 
I just miss the closeness of what best friends have. Maybe I’m just getting older. It’s very confusing and honestly it hurts my feelings sometimes.",01Mar2020,1

I've tried several diets and workouts over the years but never have the willpower to stick to them and like fast food too much and that frustrates him.

I have a couple of cavities that really hurt and some eroded enamel because of constant puking due to being seriously ill over the last few years.

A tl;dr is: I had an upper respiratory infection and that triggered asthma in me, which got severe because of some fires in my state that caused bad air pollution, so I'd end up coughing until I threw up, could not breathe, and I was brushed off by doctors until I ended up in the ER due to severe dehydration.

I was brushing my teeth every chance I got, barely drank soda and consumed sugar, but these episodes would also happen at work so there was some damage.

Along with that was I have endometriosis and the pain was nausea inducing and only got more and more severe within the last year (and ignored lol), and my mental health seriously deteriorated, so I ended up neglecting my health in general.

I've clawed my way to an okay state but I've come out of it with consequences, and haven't been in the best financial situation and need to see a dentist because of a few cavities and general pain. But I can't afford to see a dentist, I don't know if either of my insurance plans cover dentistry for adults, and the sliding scale option is too backed up. And even if I do find one, I'm really ashamed and really afraid of judgement.

I've always hated going to the dentists, even as a kid because they were always too rough and my mouth would always be bleeding.

But I found through bad experiences and some therapy that our relationship was too unhealthy and enmeshed for me to feel safe relying on them. I’m now mostly financially independent, and our current relationship is tenuous.

For Christmas they offered to get winter tires for my car. I hesitantly accepted, since it was a one-time purchase, I wanted them and their support in my life, and I’m accepting their support for something I want not need

When we got to the store, my dad started insisting my tires were probably terrible and I was probably duped by the car salesman into thinking they were ok, and that I probably never had them looked at (untrue), so I should get all-season instead of winter. I wanted to stick with the plan, so he insisted on inspecting them and getting the tire salesman to inspect them too. I insisted on sticking with the winter tires, so now my parents are planning on getting me the winter tires, and regular tires, and wheels to go with the second set and maybe sensors to go with the wheels and possibly tire storage for the off-season set (they don’t like my idea of storing my tires in my full apartment). And evidently they had planned on having me keep the $130 in rebates as a gift too.

It feels like too much. I feel put down, and that my comfort and perspective has been dismissed in favor of their own. I don’t think they’ll listen. 

So far, the old tires were thrown out, the new winter tires were put on the old wheels, and they plan to finalize their decisions for the other stuff in April, so the winter tires will be switched out before summer. 

I want to sort out my feelings and know where I stand before April. I know how I feel but not how I want to approach this... I wish I could both accept their help and reject their condescending attitude. But they seem connected...

Ok so we have been friends for about a 2 years now (he was 15 and I was 14). I only started having feeling for him about a year ago. It was funny how it happened it was a spefic moment it happened we where doing wood working together and i didn’t know how to use the sander so he showed me how and said I just don’t want you go get hurt. That’s when I started to fall for him. Our relationship is weird we play fight also and tease each other. But he’s going through a hoe phase that started when we he was 16. Which I mean is fine but still. He goes through about 1 relationship a month basically. His girlfriends have always been a bit wary of me. But I reassure them that we have nothing between us. (And also I would never get w him when he already has a girl). Also he’s only really ever playful w me when he’s single. He talks about all the girls he has on his snap which really hurts.

For example she will come home and say we will watch a movie but immediately fall asleep. We don’t talk cause she’s exhausted. I understand that she needs her sleep and I respect that but I think it’s taking a toll on me. 

How do I stop this clingy feeling? She is going to be gone all summer out of the country and I know I’m going to have to deal with this either way but I would prefer to tackle it now.",01Mar2020,1
282,"So, please forgive me cause this is my very first reddit post and it's also kinda long cause theres a bit of backstory about this in order to understand the full extent. Also I wasnt sure if this should be put in r/askreddit or not but without further ado, please bear with me.

Background:

So I had this friend, I'll refer to him as V, and V and I had been friends since second grade, so he was my oldest friend I had and I considered him to be one of my best friends. 

Well, in 7th grade, I finally got Steam and was able to play video games (my mom didnt really like too many video games in the house prior to that), and so I got a few to play both by myself and with all my friends. Well, i mainly played with V, and not long after that, he introduced me to his group of internet friends (IFs). Things started out okay at first. But then one of them called me a Jew once (cause I asked why people were chasing us on an open world server and said IF said that ""they were nazis chasing after Jews like you""). I brushed off the comment, but then a different IF caught wind and that's when it really blew up.

We called this kid ""Sky,"" cause it was a shortened version of his gamer tag. From what I could tell, sky was only a couple years younger than me, but he really hated me from the first moment we talked to each other. (We were all in a discord server btw) Well anyway, from that point on, he used to harass and verbally bully me by calling me a Jew. Now, I legit don't know why i was bothered by it, but i was at the time. Sky, and soon after everyone else, called me ""Jew,"" ""Jewish Joey,"" and then ""Jewy."" They all also called me ""gay,"" ""f*g,"" ""r*tarted,"" and ""autistic."" (I'm not Jewish, gay, or autistic btw). No matter how much I asked them to stop, told them I'm not any of those, etc., they kept calling me names and stuff. Often times, V would join in with this stuff. V even told everyone at our school which only made it worse cause now I was facing it on two fronts.

Anyway, this continued from 7th grade all the way to my freshman year of HS. I thought I escaped it and had a fresh start, but it still followed me. I eventually said ""fuck it"" and cut all contact with V (cause he wouldn't stop calling me shit and he wouldn't stop everyone else) and his IFs. (V later apologized and I later forgave him, but we still have limited interaction to this day.)

I have another friend, I'll call him C, and I'll make this quick. In middle school, C and I didnt get along very well but we put up with each other cause we were friends with each others friends (that and they were the only people who didnt push me away :/ ). C and I became better friends once highschool started and we even became closer friends last year in sophomore year. At lunch, C and I play mobile games that have multiplayer capabilities so we can play together. Well in this one game, we created a new group for all our friends to join and interact. Well, as we were trying to grow this new group, V joined. And while we haven't talked in like a year, V and I are still civil towards one another whenever we do interact. However, Sky also joined. 

While the whole ""Jew"" thing bothered me up until freshman year, It didnt have an effect on me last year, where i found out when someone called me a jew and I found I wasnt bothered by it. However, just cause it doesnt bother me doesnt mean I dont want to hear it anymore.

Well, ever since Sky joined our group in this game, hes been calling me jewy. I haven't reacted at all to it as of yet, but I told him today that he just hit his final warning (I'm able to kick players with lower ranks than me). However, after I say this, C says ""I'm going to be handling the kicking situation."" I know C and I know he's not gonna kick sky cause hes friends with both sky and V still.

Next time sky calls me anything, I'm planning on kicking him cause i still dont want contact from him, but my friends will most likely react poorly because they dont understand and they dont see any problem with any of that.

I guess this is what I'm asking advice for; Am i in the right for kicking this kid cause i dont want to put up with his shit again? And I know C is gonna be mad at me when I kick sky and I run the risk of being kicked myself, and idk how to respond to that when it arises. Any advice on the subject would be helpful and once again I apologize for how long this was, I just wanted to give the full story.",01Mar2020,1

284,"I guarantee you there’s 5 million of these stories on this subreddit but I need the help. So long story short, I’m not popular, I’m single, got waitlisted for the high school I want to get into and I’m really struggling with homework. This started last year when this one teacher would give like three papers of homework per night (in middle school mind you) and I struggled to get it done, and my grades plummeted. Same things happening this year and I’m just deprived of motivation and most days I can’t even get out of bed anymore.

I can't stop thinking about race. I keep thinking people would stereotype me and it annoys me. I live in a diverse area, but if I travel somewhere that is mostly white, I cannot imagine trying to relax without facing stereotypes. How do I stop being annoyed by this petty thing?

286,"A year and a bit ago me and a girl in my class were assigned to sit next to each other. We talked for months and grew to know each other quite well. I eventually began to have a crush on this girl, and I believe she did aswell. After around 3 months the seating was changed and we were no longer seated together. Since then we have not talked, and have grown apart. I retain a crush on her, but I think she has sort of grew to dislike me. Should I give up on liking her? If no then how can I grow to at least be friends with her?",01Mar2020,1
288,"hi, so i’m going to be a senior soon so i’ve been reflecting on my friendships a bit. last year, my friend and i stopped being friends and it’s kind of a long story:

basically, we’ve known each other for half of our lives and everything was really chill until like 8th grade. but prior to 8th grade, we’d never had any issues and i thought of her as a sister. we would always hang out and would never stop laughing. i felt so comfortable around her and i’m pretty sure she felt the same. 

in 8th grade though, i feel like we started having issues because of 3rd parties. we both started to make more friends and i guess felt insecure that we were replacing each other?? anyways, that created some tension. i definitely had my moments where i was kind of a sucky friend because i’d get jealous. she’s kind of a pushover so she’d do everything the other friend told her and ditch me in the process. my friend also would tell my other friends secrets that i’d only trusted her with which was upsetting. i would always keep her secrets, no matter what, so i kind of felt betrayed. i also just felt really used because she always relied on me for everything but i couldn’t rely on her the same amount because she always had drama and wasn’t very available. i honestly, at that point, would do anything for her and still would but over the years that built up a lot and i started getting really annoyed. we recovered from that and all was good. 

this was until freshman year. a mutual friend of ours and her joined a team together and they became closer. that was chill because i really liked both of them. i decided to join the team because i didn’t have anything to do in high school. at the beginning of practice, we’d have to run but could only run in pairs. they’d always run in pairs and i started to feel left out. they also would always partner up for partner workouts. eventually i suggested that we could switch partners at some points so no one felt left out. this worked for a bit until my friend again started to follow what my mutual friend said and they’d only be partners. i got tired of this and started to make other friends on the team. i also acted a bit distant because it never seemed like it matter if i was there. they’d just focus on each other the whole time and kind of ignore me. this started drama though because my friend was upset that i was ignoring her. i was really just trying not to feel hurt and ended up making really good friends in the process.

this is where our friendship went downhill. my friend started saying negative things about me to my mutual friend. our mutual friend told me this and i felt betrayed. i didn’t tell my friend that i knew that she was talking about me yet. i started distancing myself again because i was hurt that she didn’t feel comfortable enough to talk to me. this was partially my fault because i was distancing myself, but it still hurt. the whole year it was kind of a triangulation thing. our mutual friend continued to tell me things my friend told her and i got sick of it. i eventually confronted her about it and the tensions in our friendship at the end of our sophomore year. i basically just talked to her about feeling used. she’d always use her mental illness as an excuse for acting kind of badly. i would always give her passes because mental illness is valid of course and would read up on how to respectfully treat friends with it. but eventually it just got draining. i also talked to her about the talking behind my back thing and telling my secrets. we stopped being friends after that. 

i think the most negative thing that i contributed in our friendship was that i had so many expectations. i expected her to not always be late to things when we were hanging out and not to talk behind my back and other stuff. i just really thought of her as my best best friend, i literally adored her. but i guess i put her on a pedestal which ending up really hurting me. 

this probably sounds so dramatic oml and like it has no point. but now that i’m almost a senior, i really just want to focus on having long lasting friendships before graduating. i’m sick of the drama that happened because it sounds so stupid, i really just want my best friend back. should i talk to her??",01Mar2020,1
289,"Hi,

Gonna be quick cuz we are both freaking out. Basically my friend (18F) has to block a guy on all social media a couple months ago because he wouldn’t leave her alone and say a bunch of creepy stuff. We thought that was the end of it, but today he showed up at her house at around 10:00. 

When asked why he was there, he said he “just wanted to see her”. She told him to fuck off but is now freaking out because we have no idea how he got her address. He does not live in our city, which means he drove out of his way just to show up. 

Should we report this to the police? He didn’t like try anything but if he’s just gonna show up at her house it’s not good. She doesn’t feel safe knowing that he knows where she lives. 

Thanks",01Mar2020,1

291,"He's been very nice to me throughout my internship at the firm. And I have been a hard working intern. He has taken me to client calls and involved me in big projects which would otherwise not have come . my way. Since there is quite some time left before I graduate (1.5 years), I have been asked to intern there a second time by my mentor. And this request has been reiterated many times. He has mentioned that he really values my work ethic and diligence and my humility and he wants me to come back as soon as I can. 

On my second last day at the internship, he invited me to the swankier office of the the firm because he felt that I should see it. I was working with him at his desk the entire day. At the end of the day, he gave me a list of songs to listen to which featured ""Under Your Spell"" by Desire and a cover of Britney Spears' ""Toxic"" (Yael Naim). He also said that since the next day would be my last day there, we should go out for lunch.

When I got home and listened to the songs, I was a bit weirded out as the lyrics were a bit suggestive. I made an excuse and skipped work the next day. I didn't go out for lunch either.

Am I overthinking this or is my mentor trying to flirt with me subtly?",01Mar2020,1

So like...... seriously what the fuck do I do to keep him from sexually assaulting these stuffed animals, because I can NOT give them back to my kid after this.

293,"My boyfriend(23M) and I (23F) have been together for 8 months now and we have been really happy together. We spent some time apart in our respective homes as school was ending and then we came back together. We love each other very deeply and we were make plans for the future, so I can move in with him after I graduate (in June), where I would move across the country to be him.

At the beginning of our relationship, I found some sketchy messages between him and a girl he used to hook up with, but they were not explicitly inappropriate, so I chose to move past it. He was basically a response to her snap stories about being a reborn virgin asking her if she is going to do anal instead. I almost broke up with him over this, but I chose to stay with him because he is an amazing man. However, after spending a while living with me for about a month, he just told me that he sexted a girl he used to hook up with. He tried to blame it on me by saying that we were in a bad place and we were arguing a lot because that's when we began our long-distance relationship. He said he felt horny and he felt that he could not sext me, so he turned to this other girl. The sexts were about having sex with her again and then they sexted about having a threesome with me in it. After he did it, he felt guilty and deleted her. But then he took a while to tell me about this. What do I do?

I think it is best to break up with him because he knew that I was cheated on in my past two relationships and how much it took me to trust him again.

TL;DR: my boyfriend told me he sexted another girl while we were in different places because we were having arguments and he wants me to take him back.",01Mar2020,1
294,"For starters- my mother and father pretty much split up because of gambling so my mum has sour feelings towards it to begin with.

my dad would go to jail some nights because he would go to extremes. Ruined our credit score by taking out thousands not paying it back, stole 20 thousand dollars from a friend to gamble it. Very harsh past with the topic. 

I just turned 18 about 6 months ago and going to casino for me- has never been a scary thing or something to worry about, I just never thought of going to one- and my friends suggested it about 3 weeks ago. So we all went, had some drinks, I made about 200 dollars and cashed out after playing roulette all night. I was in love that I just got paid to hang out with friends and drink So I decided to go back with them the next day, I gambled it all away- I was now -40 in the hole with the casino and left a sad person. 

Now here it gets tricky because last night I said im coming in with 80 dollars max- to win my money back, maybe make some extra to pay off the credit card. I gambled it all- and asked my friend for just 15 dollars to play one round of black jack- well maybe god felt bad for me because I played black jack for 40 minutes and won $5,000.00 by putting 25 dollars on that little lucky lucky thing and the dealer gave me 2 sevens and everyone at my table went nuts. (I had no idea why) cause I didn't know 2 sevens was the best you can get. 

Now I lay in bed and I want to go play with 100 dollars and see what I win, but my parents have been talking to me about addiction but im just having fun! I love it and what's the harm in losing a measely 100 dollars? I just hate I have to sneak out late at night to do it so my mum doesn't think im an addict.",01Mar2020,1

298,"Last year I (21F) met this girl (22F) in one of my university classes.  We only had that one class together but we sat next to each other on the first day and became class friends because that's how university works.  We exchanged numbers and texted about homework and midterms and to complain about homework and midterms and to give each other notes when one of us missed class.  Typical class friend stuff.  She friended me on Facebook a couple weeks into the semester (we have mutual friends with some people I vaguely knew in high school and I was on her recommended friends list) and at some point we exchanged Snapchats and Instagrams.

Now, we never hung out outside of class, not even to do homework together.  We never talked about anything other than classwork besides the occasional Snapchat that went to like 10 other people and was also posted on a story.  We were just class friends.  And I was okay with that because we really didn't have anything in common other than the class and I she wasn't really someone I wanted to hang out with.  Nothing against her or anything, she just wasn't my type of person who I tend to click with as friends.

The semester ended and she graduated and moved to a different province and I figured that was the last I'd hear from her aside from liking each other's posts.  And I was totally fine with that.

But that's not what happened.

Starting in like August she started Snapchatting me all the time.  Like twelve Snapchats in the span of a minute.  I'd reply because I always feel rude when I don't answer Snapchats (I know it's not always rude but it's an anxiety thing and I'm working on it but it's just a thing), and then her little bitmoji pops up as soon as she gets the notification that I'm typing, and then sends another 12 Snapchats.  If I don't answer her and ignore the notification, more and more just keep coming in every few minutes or hours, probably depending on how busy she is.  A little while later, she started commenting massively every time I post anything and I've just constantly got messages coming in from her on every platform.

And they're about everything.  I know the details of so many things about her that I didn't want to know, and she always talks about how much she misses me.  Half of the time I think she's just using me to vent, but then sometimes I get like ten minutes worth of Snapchat videos detailing her lunch or I get way too much information on something super personal.  Maybe she just hasn't made a lot of friends in her new province, but I know she had people she was closer to here than me, so the fact that it's me just doesn't make sense to me.  We barely talked outside of class and never about anything non-class related.  Why all this messaging now that we're no longer even in the same place?

And it bothers me because I don't want to talk to her.  We were never really friends when we lived in the same place, so why is she so keen on making us be besties when we're on opposite sides of the country?  I feel like our friendship has long since run its course, and she's just not letting it end.

And I want it to end.  I feel like a dick when I say that, but I do.  I don't want to talk to her, and I honestly groan whenever anything comes in from her.  I've gone days without opening any messages from her, but they just keep coming in, and even if I ghost her entirely (which I haven't done yet) she still comments on literally anything I post anywhere.

She's also got anxiety about people cutting her off (it's one of the many things I've learned more than I want to know about her) because she had a friend in high school who did that or something.  Unfriending her and removing her from Snapchat and Instagram (mine's private, so she wouldn't be able to see it) seems too mean to me in general and then especially knowing her anxiety about that, but it's the only thing I've been able to think of.  I'm also super bad at confrontation, even over a message and not in person.  I've cut back on the length of my replies as much as I can without outright ignoring her and I try not to ask questions.  At this point, I feel like the conversation should have faded out and ended by now, but she keeps forcing it.

I just honestly don't know what to do, but I just can't keep doing this.  Talking to her drains me and so does even just anticipating having to answer her messages.

TLDR: I need to cut off a long distance friendship with someone who I wasn't really friends with when it was short distance.  What would be the best way to end this with as little hurt feelings as possible, or at least to get her to cut back on the messages to a normal amount for acquaintances who never see each other and really don't have anything in common?",01Mar2020,1
299,"Hello, i know this is kind of odd but i have a question. I was born and raised in the bible belt, Tennessee. My family is very religious and i kinda just accepted it. So i've called myself a Christian my whole life.

But when i was a teenager, in school we learned about the most popular religions around the world. (Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hindu, and Buddhism). None of them really stuck out to me, i already knew enough about Christianity because of my family, but the rest were just regular lessons. Until we got to buddhism and i was pretty fascinated with it. I actually asked my teacher's more about it and he helped me get some books about the religion.

I don't know, it just seems to ""Made Sense"" to me. Like, i might believe this stuff more then i do my Christian beliefs. I was really fascinated with it and thought maybe this was part of my spiritual path?

My thing is, i feel like i'm turning my back on Christianity if i do fully convert. I'm semi-sure this is what's right for me, but i fear that if it turns out that Buddhism is not right, but Christianity is what is correct, that i'll go to hell. I mean, would it be a sin of me to do this? How would i convert? How could i tell my family? What should i keep in mind before i do anything like this?

301,"We need to hire a house/dog/cat sitter when we travel.  This can be 3-4 weekends a year and maybe one or 2 week long periods.  We work from home and for ourselves, so are with our 2 70lb, \~3 year old dogs and 1 13 year old cat, all the time.  The dogs are brother rescues who are not troublesome, but require a strong presence and lots of love (seriously, holding them).  What we provide and require:

Provide:

* Free lodging (of course) they can stay in the guest room (queen size bed) or master (king bed).  2 bath house, take your pick or use both.  Central A/C, etc.
* Amazon/Netflix/Wi-Fi unlimited, but don't order movies on Amazon.
* We ask for a shopping list, provide it, and then have a full freezer and pantry of easy food.
* Seriously, unlimited food &amp; drink shopping list.
* If they are old enough to drink, we have a stocked bar, and ask for them to be responsible.
* Of course, everything to care for the pets, even treats.
* Rarely, if we are going on a longer trip, we may have them take the mail out of the box that is literally attached to the railing at the top step.
* You can have a full-time job, we just want someone who will spend the night with them, and pay attention to them (even just being with them sleeping) for that time.  And sit up with them for about an hour while they eat.

Require:

* That you be home overnight.  This can be 2:00am-6:00am, but we will take it.
* That you feed the dogs once a night.  Just dry food, nothing fancy.  And give them time to eat it (about an hour).
* Pick up the food when you go to bed.
* Clean out the catbox once a day.
* Make sure the cat has food.  Again, dry and her bowl just sits out, so a few days of food at a time. 
* Make absolutely (we have trouble with this) sure that their (6 qt pot, I think) and the dish outside right at the hose, have plenty of water.
* Love the dogs. Pet them, talk to them, just sit with them in the room.  They just need to know that they are not abandoned.  They are rescues who were dumped.  
* We do ask that they have no more than 3 people over, and that we know those people well enough to not fear for our house.  We have told sitters no before. 
* That if you haven't met/don't know the dogs very well, you come to our house 2-3 times for an hour or two (that we will pay for) to be sure everyone is very comfortable.

General info includes that we have cameras in the living room and kitchen, we always tell them this, even though they are obvious.  We tell them so that they don't walk through undressed.  None of us want that.  Also, we are in a very small, poor town.  The average income is below $30,000/year.  We are in a pretty basic house, in the middle of town.  We are average people, not prominent at all.  Oh, and we call every day to check for any issues and are available by text pretty much always.

I over reacted in fear, after dealing with this for. 3 years. We all the need therapy.  He did nothing wrong but dew to Feminists crap, I can’t defend my bother! Without it looking fishy! Help.

305,Okay ok ok so I have an acquaintance that I follow on Instagram and we sometimes talk in school and I like her. she’s been on Instagram saying RANT: and then things about her being really stressed out and like sad. I want to comfort her but idk if it’s my place to or how to or if I just shouldn’t because it’s a rant that she just doesn’t want anyone to take seriously or if the rant is a cry for help. I wanna say something and try to help or even just be there for her but idk how... please help :) .,01Mar2020,1
306, So I made a profile on Tinder and POF. I am still 17 and turning 18 really soon. Is this okay? Do you think I should not be on the site?×,01Mar2020,1
308,"When I was 17 I formed a dream about my life, i.e. where I would live, what I would do, what my family would be like.  At age 36 I finally achieved my dream job, dream home, dream location, and my dream family.  Seriously, everything I had worked for over 20 years was mine.  I was done and happy.

Unfortunately, the location didn't work for my wonderful and supportive wife.  The location wasn't ideal for my children--one of whom is special needs and was under-supported in the location.  

So, my wife found a good job in a great location and asked if I would support a move.  I said yes because she has always supported my dream and it would probably benefit the kids.  

Three years later the kids are doing better, the wife is happy, and I am deeply miserable.  My career required 11 years of education and isn't in high demand.  I was super lucky to land the job I did and haven't been able to replicate that luck.  It looks like my career is over at 41 and I'll need to either take an entry level job somewhere or retrain for a different career.  

My wife would support me if I wanted to move us yet again, but honestly location isn't the problem.  I'm just not in a position to find my job again.  It really sucks.  I don't blame my family intellectually, but I am feeling distant and occasionally resentful.  Mostly I am just mourning the loss of my dream--a dream I worked hard for and achieved and then watched slip through my hands.  I feel broken and unmoored.  Any advice would be appreciated.",01Mar2020,1
309,So basically I’m a 19m and the past 6 months I went through a nasty breakup and working through some mental health stuff and have had a hard time starting healthy habits again. I’ve been going to counseling and he’s great so mentally I’m definitely on my way. But like physically not very much 😂 I’ve always been a skinny guy but also fit. I’m still skinny but the fit part kinda disappeared. My appetite is minimal. And my sleep schedule is all kind of fucked. My sex drive be low as hell too. I’ve noticed my athletic ability has also suffered. I was hoping for some pointers on getting back into the groove of things. Any specific workouts or recipes to try out and get back. Maybe some supplements to start that might help my calorie intake or sleep aswell. Any habits that would be helpful would be very much appreciated. Ideally I’d like to gain about 15-20 pounds back. I’m just sick of feeling like I look and feel like shit.,01Mar2020,1

312,"I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety two years ago, I was given medication to help and I actively sought after help via a counselor but due to my mother (37f) moving to another state I was unable to make my appointments.

My mother and my dad (37m) divorced a little after I was born and I haven't lived with her since I was young (1-3). Both of my parents have been very emotionally negligent for almost my entire life as well as they just don't take care of me. My grandparents buy all my cloths, pay for the house I live in and give me the food I eat. My grandparents are very old fashion and don't believe in things like mental illness, my grandmother is also incredibly controlling, I wasn't allowed to stay home alone until I turned fifteen and I had to fight her on that, I'm also not allowed to use the oven. Those are just two examples of her controlling behavior.

I want to drop out, I'm failing half my classes and I failed all but one last year. School makes me incredibly depressed to the point where it's difficult for me to get out of bed, even on weekends when I don't have to worry about it. I've been very open of my plans of dropping out to my parents and grandparents. The plan being drop out, get a job, work until I'm eighteen while also working towards my GED and than finally moving out to live with my cousin (17m) and his boyfriend (18m).

My cousin and his boyfriend do not like that I want to drop out and want me to get my diploma, but they still support me and are willing to help me in whatever way they can.

My mother had supported me, opening up a bank account for me, telling me she'll buy my I.D, helping me get my driver's licence, but as soon as I tell her I want to drop out and get my GED she disowned me. Telling all my family not to help or support me in anyway as well as telling my cousin and his boyfriend, the only people who've been there for me emotionally, to no longer interact with me.

I'm very stressed out right now and have been incredibly suicidal lately and I just want to know what I'm supposed to do. I'm horrified my grandparents might kick me out, I don't have a place to stay and my mother told me she'd mark me as a missing persons if she finds out I went to live with my cousin.",01Mar2020,1

314,"I'm married to a guy. We're a gay marriage. We got married about 2 years ago. I'm feeling stressed out because every time I'm trying to be intimate and have sex with my husband, he makes up excuses saying that hes feeling dizzy or his head or body hurts, or he says that hes just tired and end up not having sex or he foreplay with me a little bit and then he just stops. 

He has menieres disease. But when I tell him to do something that he doesnt wants to do or something he doesnt wants to talk about he puts his sickness as an excuse to not do so. I've noticed that hes good the rest of the day until I bring up the idea that I want a good sex time, then he starts making up excuses. 

I can straight up tell hes just making excuses. Hes so transparent and he doesnt realizes that I can see what hes doing. 

We have gone days where we have planned out to have sex at night, but when the night comes, he comes up with excuses and makes me feel disappointed. 

I'm feeling frustrated because as a guy myself I feel like I'm getting blue balls from my own husband and I'm starting to just sigh and roll my eyes at him. I'm starting to have second thoughts with our marriage and wishing I could go with someone else to fix my sexual desires. 
I feel like if I tell him that he doesnt pleases me sexually anymore hes going to get hurt and we're going to get into a fight or even a divorce. 

This whole situation of him making up excuses when I want sex is making me feel frustrated, stressed, and disappointed. 

Has anyone else been through the same?

Any advice? :/",01Mar2020,1
315,"My crush and I texted for years and now that I finally came to visit her we barely kiss...

So I've been texting this girl I like for a long time. We used to be classmates and I always felt there was something there but I ended up moving outta state before anything happened. We immediately started texting every day and the desire to hook up was explicit by both sides. We talked about fooling around, she texted me during the winter saying she'd like to sleep with me to escape the cold, we even had nicknames for one another. This went on for YEARS (like, literally 5 years) and then I finally came to visit her.

Thing is. Now that I'm here. We. Barely. Kiss.

We went to a pub my first night in town and made out. Shit seemed to be going fine until I asked her to come back to the hotel with me and she said we shouldn't rush stuff. I didn't think much of it cause she's catholic and shit happens. The rest of the night went fine. 
But today we spent the whole day together and nothing happened. I tried stepping up and we did make out lightly a few times but that was it. 
Tonight we went to another pub where a good chunk of the town was gathered for a live country show and she asked me not to kiss her in there cause it's a small town and people gossip.

Then I came to her parents' house where I was supposed to sleep after meeting the family. She gave me a quick goodnight kiss and made a comment about my mouth tasting bad (she doesn't like cigarettes and I borrowed one from her brother in the pub).

I'm now lying down in the bed her mother made me in the guest bedroom

I'm really trying to be stoic about this but this shit is crawling inside my head.

Is she not attracted to me or does she actually want to go easy since we've never hooked up before and her family is conservative? Should I be this worried or am I just acting like a teen and overthinking way too much?

I'm going home in 2 days and I'd really love some feedback. Thanks in advance.

P.S. We're both 22. I live alone and she's still with her parents",01Mar2020,1
319,"For context I'm a M20. I hope this is the correct sub for this.

I haven't had a ""relationship"" with a girl since sophomore year of high school. We would go on ""dates"" too the mall and hold hands and such but things were difficult since we lived half an hour away from each other and would only primary see each other on weekends. I was learning how to drive at the time but couldn't yet drive by myself. Long story short things got rough between us pretty soon as I had jumped into the relationship too quickly and ignored the red flags that I saw appearing within the relationship. Thus the relationship ended at just under a month of time. (We didn't do anything except cuddle. We didn't even kiss)

The rest of high school went by pretty rough. I fell really hard for this other girl (who also lived 30 minutes away) and I thought things were going great but she genuinely just wanted to be friends and I honestly didn't know how to act around her because of my infatuation. After I graduated she blocked me on everything because she got tired of me flirting with her. I still think about her a lot but I know deep down that I shouldn't ever talk to her again because of how badly I upset her.

Freshman year of college the first three girls I asked out all ended up being lesbians so that was fun. I ended up getting really close to this one girl, but things between us got super complicated super fast and I honestly felt like I wasn't making her happy and so I dropped the ball.

I'm currently in my second year of college. I have yet to kiss anyone fully on the lips and I feel like now its basically too late for me cause everyone else is already on their 2nd, 3rd, or 4th person. I'm not repulsed by the idea of sex, but I feel like I'm never going to get close enough to someone in order for that to happen. Honestly I just miss the hugs, the hand holding and the cuddling the most.

And thus I feel like I'm worthless to females and other people in general. (Unrelated: Over the summer I didn't get hired for any of the 20 jobs I applied to and I recently just got rejected from a Frat I was trying to join.) I feel like if I was in a relationship I wouldn't have anything to bring to the table regardless as I don't feel attractive, I don't have money, and I don't have sex. Honestly I don't even know how I'm supposed to act in a ""relationship"" or how things like kissing and dates are supposed to work.

TL;DR: I haven't been in a ""relationship"" with a girl since high school and I honestly thought college was going to fix that but it hasn't and I feel worthless because of it.",01Mar2020,1
320,"SO basically, a friend of mine who goes to the same school as me, had her friend come and stay for a couple of weeks while she was on holidays from school in Spain. When I first saw her I was  immediately attracted to her but i was a little bit shy and didn't know how to start conversation. After a few days of talking we soon became some what of friends. Moving on, there was a party coming up and I knew she was only going to be in the same country as me for a few more weeks so i decided i would try to make a move at the party. Anyways, the night of the party came, and we were both fairly intoxicated and we got together, we spent the entire night together and had a really great and romantic time together (even when we sobered up, which is saying something for me). Now luckily reddit is somewhat annonymous otherwise i would feel like too much of a douche to say this but, i consider myself to be somewhat of a lady's man and have been with a fair amount of girls over my time, but something felt different about this girl. She was so perfect in every way and I dont exactly know how to describe it but i became almost dependant on her affection and attention. I hate to sound so simpy. Now I know this is not the best way to be feeling about someone i've known for 3 weeks! I almost feel stupid that ive become so attached to her as i have known her for such a little period of time. I know that she really likes me too, but its evident that she doesn't crave the same amount of attention that i do her. I feel crazy, and i feel crazy that i've resourced to writing a bible sized document on reddit. Is this love? or is this me being love seeking and dependant and controlling monster. Is this even worth posting?

These were the thoughts that i had during the week, but it was the weekend that she left so we were going to spend as much time together as we could. I also felt bad and didnt want to steal her away from her friends as she actually came here for them and not me. On her final weekend, friday, we went to a gathering with all of our friends and us, we ended up having another good night, only the fact that she would have to leave on the soon coming up sunday saddened us greatly. her flight was early sunday, so we would only have saturday to say our final goodbyes. Anyway, Saturday came and she arrived at my house 4 hours later than we had planned (and with her friend too, so it would be a severe case of 3rd wheeling). Eventually, her friend found something else to do and left us alone, and we proceeded to be alone for a short amount of time before we were both more sad than happy because of her impending departure the next day. I tried to focus on the moment while I was with her, but i couldnt help but be overun by sadness. She felt the same way (i think). And I dont know if i did something wrong or I spread my negativity too much, but there was a spontaneous feeling of rush and unease coming from her. She wanted to return to her friend and she wanted to leave my house. Of course i respected her wishes, but i couldnt help but feel like i had done something wrong and was overcome with sadness. I wanted to end things on a goodnote, and on a sense of satisfaction (No, not necessarily sex). She did later message me an apology about leaving so weirdly, but i cant tell if i did something wrong or she just really likes me and doesnt like goodbyes. But it still upsets me that that was the note that we lefts things on.

All of my friends tell me to move on and to find someone else, as i dont know when i will ever see her again. But i dont feel like i could ever meet someone as good as her. I feel lost and stranded for a decision. Am i being too controlling if i expect her to remain faithful to me even though were not technically in a relationship and are in different hemispheres? I would remain faithful even though it sounds completely absurd knowing that ive known this girl for 3 weeks and we live on different sides of the Earth. im honestly just making this post to hear the opinions of others as Im not sure if im thinking straight.

I would read and greatly appreciate each comment if i get any,  i dont even know how this works",01Mar2020,1
321,"im on a phone, so sorry for any formatting issues.

i (high school student) got into a fight with my mom after being angry and moody the whole day about probably something insignificant. i think i do a lot of work in hopes of making my family proud. i get pretty good grades (A's and B's but im working on improving) and im involved in so many extra cirricular activities as well as doing all my work and my teachers like me. i don't think i've ever really gotten into trouble in school but i am a really big pain to be around. i feel like nothing i do is ever enough and they have even expressed that they understand and realised my brother gets more attention. im mostly over it but it still hurts that nothing i do will ever be enough.

for a couple years now, i've had the idea that something is wrong with me. i've tried talking to the guidance counsellor at my school (i went for about half a year 2 years ago) but they are really bad. i've tried hinting at me wanting to see one but i can't bring myself to say it and they believe that whateve r im going through is normal even though my brother visited one for around year regulary. 

back to the problem, i have a lot of problems and things that are building up stress but i just can't get into it because im so stupid. i snapped at my mom after getting mad at something else and basically said she'd rather me leave the house or die and that's why she's helping me go overseas to a school. i was a complete and absolute bitch about it. i made her really really upset and she left in tears. this scared me so much i broke down and started hyperventilating. i don't know what to do or how to apologise. i know she spent a looooong time helping me and i was spouting absolute lies because she did and is doing a lot for me.

i am absolutely the worst and im uncappable of properly fixing my mess. i don't know how to make this better. im currently just hiding in my room and im thinking of staying like this for a couple of days and avoid my family for a bit until i figure out what to do. im the worst and i don't deserve to be here :((((((",01Mar2020,1

324,"Hey, I wasn’t sure to post this in relationship or just regular advice but I’m kinda struggling.

A month and a half ago I came out to her and she turned me down really hard. To the point where I didn’t talk to her two weeks (she was my best friend). She even started dating someone and we’ve been kinda distant with a text here and there other than everyday chit chat. I met some new people and started branching out to newer groups. Just so I could occupy myself and get away from the heartbreak. However tonight, she sent me a ton of drunk texts like “I wish you were here.” And “I think this party would’ve been better with you.” With her sending me cute pictures of herself (not lewd but like her cuddling up in her coat). I feel like I’m getting tons of mixed messages. And I’m honestly feeling my heart falling all over again. 

I don’t want to feel like this. I know she is dating, and that she has no interests in me. And these drunk texts may only be her not thinking straight. But like my head wants me to think she secretly likes me romantically. Even though that’s like 0% true. Have any of you been through this? And how do you get out of this emotional ditch?",01Mar2020,1

I get very mad if someone hurts me. Maybe this is because I never hurt anyone first so it deeply upsets me if someone hurts me out of nowhere. It makes me want them to feel the pain they've caused me. I feel that they won't care or know how much pain I am in until they also feel the pain. I feel like I shouldn't be the only one suffering.

This has caused a lot of distress for me and I wish I could just not do this stuff. I am so spiteful and vengeful and I don't know how to control myself when someone hurts me, sometimes people laugh or just not give a damn while I am crying and it pisses me off and makes me want them to feel the same pain they are causing me.

331,"I've been working at a company in the UAE. After graduating I jumped at the chance to intern because of the decent salary, experience and 1st world life style. However, I have very few friends and no family in the region. My contract is coming to an end very soon and I've been growing increasingly anxious about the future. I dont know if I should stay here and continue working or pack up and head back home.

To be honest, I've been experiencing many symptoms of depression such as lack of energy, no passion for hobbies I once loved, weight gain, difficulty focusing at work and becoming increasingly anxious and reclusive.  I also feel like I'm losing touch with reality. I feel like I can't fully connect with my surroundings and the people that inhabit those surroundings. Life in the UAE is different and I'm not really happy with the restrictions placed upon residents here and the mentallity of residents of the UAE - there are expections, I know, I've met them but they seem to be few and far between.

I get along well with my colleagues but they are all about 8-10 years older than me. So outisde of work we don't share many interests.  
The effects of despression and depersonalization are also affecting my ability to work and in general I've become slower, less enthusiatic and it shows unfortunately. 

The reason I'm struggling with idea of going back home is that  salaries are lower, jobs are somewhat scarce and the currency is weak. Continuing to work in the UAE would mean I could potentially build a better life for myself (financially) , acquire valuable work experience and oppurtunities, and build a strong network to support my career.  So I'm not sure if I should whether the storm and remain in the UAE or go back home to reconnect myself to my friends, family and homeland.

335,"Sorry I know this will be long, but I really need to add the details so it's clear. Please bare with me - I really do need advice.

So to provide background info: I'm a new nurse (LPN) and don't have much experience. For reference; union jobs in Canada for LPNs pay from $27-31/hr, whereas anything not union will pay around $23-25/hr. Very hard for a new nurse to land a union job. I posted my resume online, and got a few interviews to jobs that pay around 23/24 dollars an hour (Canadian). 

Then I got a job offer to a pharmacy. They pay $27/hr. I took it right away, as this is unheard of for a pharmacy. They seemed really nice and LOVED me right off the bat. 

Then it got to the actual job description itself. It's community health nursing - I visit clients in the community (all within the same city) and administer meds/injections. The job itself? Easy. My dilemma? Mileage, gas, wear and tear, etc. So this is where I need help:

In an average work day day, I drive anywhere from 50-100km within the city to see patients. I'll see about 35 patients a day. The manager at my job claims it should ONLY be around 30km within the city if I plan my route correctly, but for the past week my mileage has exceeded 100km WITH planning the route correctly and efficiently. I also fill my tank every 3 days due to this, so $60 goes towards gas every 3 days, and my employer claims he pays me $1/km and estimates there to be $300 monthly - but the catch is, it's already fixed into my pay. So that initial $27 is actually partially going to gas, and mileage. 

I brought up my concerns with the mileage situation to my manager today, and he told me since I just started I took a longer route with further clients to get to know everyone - and that he's actually providing me with a great pay that I won't find anywhere else. I asked a friend who also works at a pharmacy, and she says she makes 21.50 an hour, and her manager pays 45cents/km on top of that but separately. That way, if it varies, she's compensated. 

My questions are: 

\- with all things considered, how much am I ACTUALLY making an hour?! I drive a 2018 Nissan Rogue if that makes a difference. 

\- is this job worth it? Or does it seem sneaky. 

\-  if it's not worth it, should I stick it out for a few months to build experience?

340,"I was in a parking garage and accidentally bumped a car while trying to get out. The damage was extremely minimal. There was an inch dent on my car (no dent on their car that I noticed) and some paint exchange on their car. I couldn’t find the owner of the car, so I decided to leave a piece of paper with my number on it in the windshield wipers. It’s been about 11-12 hours since it happened, and I haven’t received a call or a text from the person. Im only 16 and just recently got my license, so I don’t really know what to do from here (dont want to tell my parents about it yet, and thinking about not telling them if the person never ends up calling). Should I just assume that they don’t care about the little damage done to their car/don’t want to deal with filing a claim...Or should I be worried that they saved the number and might still call later on? Also did I do the right thing ?",01Mar2020,1

345,"I (30M) am in a polyamorous triad with my wife, K (26) and our gf l, R (21). There's been communication issues in the past, R is a bit younger than us so we always chalked it up to maturity differences. 

But lately R has been more distant, only chatting when we message first, toxic positivity regarding our depression and anxiety, victim blamed people who are abused. Most recently I asked R to help take the new puppy for a walk since I had to go into work early. 

I will be the first to admit it was bad timing to get a dog. We should have waited, but K had the chance to get her dream breed, and I knew talking her out of it would break her heart. Potty training has been a mess because we live in a land of ice and snow, and the poor puppy is still growing in his thick coat. Neither my wife and I have ever trained a dog before and it's been a steep learning curve. Also, the wife has been sick for the past few weeks. A nasty bug hit the area and we aren't impressed with how the doctor has been treating it. This leaves just me to not just mind the dog, but our two cats and other household chores. Oh, and then I ended up getting sick too. 

Bringing this back around, R went to my place tonight to check up on the dog, feels compelled to shampoo deep clean the carpet and then complain about the state of the apartment. We literally just got the carpet cleaner and was planning on cleaning the carpet ourselves tomorrow. 

If R had brought up her concerns, we would have been embarrassed, but it felt like she was actively trying to shame and guilt us. To the point she said of this is the way it's going to be then ""we don't deserve the dog.""

I know the first thing K and I need to do is sit down with R and tell her how her language is hurtful. It's going to be rough; K is non confrontational and neither of us want to lose R. I just needed to get this off my chest",01Mar2020,1

He’s pathetic and tries to get me especially in trouble , because I’m the only one who will actually stand up to him when I see him hurt my mom. My mom is oblivious as to what’s going on , and it saddens me,because we try and try to tell her to get out of this “relationship” and try to make her see what’s going on, and how it’s affecting our family. We constantly tell her why she should leave him, to call the police and so on. I’ve already been diagnosed with depression , and I’m on the verge of wanting to end my own life because of this.

348,"This dude I met 3 years ago and is probably my first ""true"" friend [let's call him Danny]. We spend a lot of time together talking or playing video games, mostly not in person because we live far away.

Recently there was a small party where some bad shit happened, where a lot of drama started and all 6 people (including me and Danny]. After solving all the problems, which took about 4-5 days, he kinda dipped and cut contact with everyone (or so I thought). It's been about 2 weeks since he cut all ties. He won't answer calls and deleted all social media (Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat).

I just joined a new discord group, and saw him texting there, with his other friends. I know it's him because of his username, which is unique to him. 

I really miss him (no homo), and want to talk with him again, mainly because I don't really have any other friends I socialize with.

I know where he lives, what times he'll definitely be home. Is it a good idea to visit him unannounced one day? Do I wait for him to contact me? Or just accept that he has had enough of me and let him go?",01Mar2020,1

350,"Recently, I’ve been having issues with my best friend/roommate. We both live at my parents house, which is why I call her my roommate. Anyways a little background info, a little before we graduated high school (we both graduated early), she stayed with us (her parents had kicked her out) until June 2019 and stayed across the state for 4 months and moved back. I had gone on a bus to drive with her back to my city since she was new at driving on the highway and didn’t wanna be alone. Ever since she moved in with us (and then moved back in again) it’s been awful. 


When she wakes up, I have to wake up. She turns on the lights if I don’t. If I want to take a nap, she criticizes me about how much I sleep. Then on the other hand, she sleeps in until 2pm and takes short naps on my bed. When she does that, I tiptoe around the room, keep my lights off and turn everything down to the lowest level of volume as possible. Then, when I bring it up that she sleeps a lot too she tells me that it isn’t like me where I “sleep all the time”

She constantly hits, slaps and kicks my cat and she claims that she hates my cat so much and wouldn’t mind if my cat went missing or died. I’ve told her many times that my cat has been abused, but just shrugs it off. My cat is afraid to even be in the same room as her and hides from her. She has told me before that if I wanted to move out with her, I’d have to get rid of my cat and I tell her that I don’t mind paying a pet fee. 

I’m the one always buying groceries for both of us. Even when I can’t afford two people. She insists I bring her along, and I do. I always ask what she wants and she always gets what she wants. She always compares prices and tries to get me to buy the more expensive option instead of the less expensive option that I can afford (my mom says to her “you’ve got a champagne diet on a beer budget” ). A couple of weeks ago, I bought sandwich stuff (lettuce, sauces, bread, etc) and she wanted Ham lunch meat, she got it and she’s never made a sandwich or used the ham she wanted. 

My parents don’t have very good paying jobs, so they asked me, my sibling and my best friend to pitch in about $150 a month. They’re older, so it’s harder to get jobs and they have medical issues. My friend told me that it was their faults for having jobs that don’t pay as much, it’s their responsibility to provide for us. Then she turns around and gives her parents money (recently it was about $250 and she was loudly complaining) and watches her little siblings for them. While her dad has a poor paying job and her mom refuses to get a job and stays at home.

She gives me shit about how my partner doesn’t have a job, while her partner is still in high school and doesn’t have a job. She ALWAYS takes her partner to a hotel every weekend, paying upwards of $150 a night for about 2 nights. I’ve told her she could be saving that and her reply was that she wanted her partner to save gas (her partner lives in a different city),she couldn’t do what I was doing (my partner lives close with his friends and they let me stay the night), and she “needs” to have sex.  So in my head, I just say “why didn’t you date someone closer if distance is an issue for you.”

I always hold my tongue around her because she shoots me down and gets pissy. We’ve tried to help her by telling her how to do something, but she blanks out and just nods, while saying nothing. She has ZERO initiative, she wants a different job and complains everyday but she doesn’t take the time to apply, or even make a resume. She needs counseling, but she says she “doesn’t want to wake up at 8am”. When she doesn’t have a ride to work, she calls in because she doesn’t want to walk or ride a bike. She doesn’t even plan for a ride either. 

This is all so long, but I don’t know what to say or do. I don’t want her in my house anymore. She sucks the positivity out of me, she puts me down, she hardly cleans up after herself and she hardly ever wants to change at all. My mind goes into fight or flight when she’s here, but if I leave she asks when I’ll be home or where I’m at and then gets pissy at me and won’t talk to me when I get back. I feel awful and every day I’m getting closer and closer to just packing up all her shit and throwing it on the sidewalk. I just need some guidance, or at least just someone telling me I’m doing the right thing.",01Mar2020,1

352,"For context: 
I’m a 16yo in my senior year of Highschool and I live in a 3rd world country(important for later). So rn my grades are not bad, I should end this year with a GPA of 3.6. In my country tho there’s a national university entrance exam that you take when you finish Highschool and it’s only useful in this country. 

I personally don’t want to learn here cuz the education system sucks and there’s only one good university here that I don’t mind going to but it’s insanely hard to get in(cuz the national exam is really hard). I’m also studying for my SATs which is in a few weeks from the time i am writing this. My parents want me to improve my grades(which is understandable) and also be prepared for the national exam. My dad said if I do good in the national exam He’ll send me to learn in another country. What I don’t understand is why he wants me to focus on the national exam. It’s only useful in this country so why does he want me to do good in it? I told him that I should focus more on my SATs but he got infuriated and said that he might cancel my SAT(idek if that’s possible) if it keeps distracting me from the national exam.

353,"Okay fair warning, this is a long post but I feel like I should lay all of the important things out on the table in order for the reader to get the full experience of the relationship. My boyfriend and I have been dating for 6 months. I’m 23 and he is 19, (I know weird age difference). We met when he moved into my college dorm and we had a connection right away. When we started getting to know each other I noticed some instances where he would exaggerate some life stories ( I’m going into the field of psychology, really good at noticing when people are exaggerating or stretching the truth). But I figured he was just doing this in order to attempt to impress me so I let it go. When we became official, I noticed he would get really really jealous. I don’t mean the healthy type of jealous, I mean he would throw fits because I refused to cut off my two best friends of one year and three years (they are male.) — ; background information- I dated women for 3 years before I met my current boyfriend and considered myself “pretty much” a lesbian. Not sure how he slipped through the cracks, but my best friends are men because I get along more with men than females most of the time. —; anyway, he literally tried to force me to cut my best friends off because he “doesn’t like men and doesn’t trust them” (I trust YOU, it’s THEM I don’t trust) blablabla. I refused to do it for the longest, and he would constantly tell his friends when we got into an argument that I was talking to men every day and things of that nature (making the situation seem like something it wasn’t). Finally, after a huge blowout I decided to make a deal with him. I wouldn’t talk to one of my best friends often, and when I did I would let him read the messages. The other best friend of three years rarely talked to me  (that’s the type of person he is) so it wasn’t a problem. He agreed to these terms. Keep in mind, he had gone through my phone before and read all of my messages, even ones from years back on all of my social media platforms. He proceeded to block men who he believed were a threat to the relationship or who he didn’t want me to communicate with, which was pretty much everyone except my two best friends. The deal we made was fine for a while, but eventually, just like I thought it would, he started with the jealousy again. Complaining about me texting my best friend and saying I wasn’t holding up my end of the bargain( I never hid the messages from him, and we rarely talked. He could see the messages at any time if he were to ask, I never told him no, he just never asked), he blamed me and said he shouldn’t have to ask I should just show him. I’m extremely uncomfortable with allowing people to go through my personal belongings anyway, so of course it’s not in my nature to just hand my phone to someone so they can read my messages without them asking. He wore me down to the point where I set a boundary and told him he was NOT to go through my phone AT ALL anymore. He hasn’t, even though he’s mentioned it and I shot him down every time. I silenced my best friends messages so that he wouldn’t know when I got a notification from him, I refused to cut off my best friend for good and felt as though he was being unreasonable. Fast forward to New Year’s Day. We decided to drink (just us two) and have a good time in his room during New Year’s Eve and into New Years. We ended up getting intoxicated, but I can hold my alcohol much better than him so I was buzzed. He on the other hand was DRUNK. (He could walk and talk but would stumble here and there and sometimes slur words). Anyway, we were sitting on his bed and he made a comment that I never had to struggle in my life. Prior to this I had confided in him (months prior) about my upbringing and how difficult it was with drug addicted family, mother dead early and living in a hard neighborhood on government assistance. So him saying this set me off and I started mouthing off. I told him that he lives in a suburb, he has both of his parents in his life and he’s been coddled his entire life, he has no right to talk to me about struggle when he’s so spoiled he can’t stand to hear the word no from anyone. ( he has exaggerated stories about being from the “hood” and going to jail / stealing/ being involved with gang activities. All of which I KNOW are false but just let it go until this night). After I was finished saying all this we got into a small argument. This time, though was different. Before when we would argue, he would get into my face, scream, throw and break things and punch walls. This time, however, he grabbed me by my throat so hard I had bruises. He called me every name in the book, literally EVERY name, accused me of having sex with my best friend, and everyone else I had ever associated with. Told me to shut up before he beats the **** out of me while I was crying, and said I was GOING to be intimate with him or he was going to TAKE it. He then pinned me down on the bed and MADE me lay down (clothed) and said if I get up he’s going to beat the **** out of me. So I laid there crying while he was threatening. Finally I said “why are you doing this to me” and he “snapped out of it”. He began talking to himself asking what was wrong with him, praying to allah( he’s “Muslim”) and apologizing profusely. He kept saying he didn’t know what had come over him and that he didn’t understand why he said all those things. I just laid there silent and waited for him to fall asleep. Once he did I snuck out of his room and to my room where my roomate was waiting for me( I had been texting her telling her that if I didn’t come up by a certain time she needed to call the police). The next day he texted me like nothing happened, asking me where I had gone the night before. I was in complete shock. I said I left, why would I want to stay down there. I was scared for my life.( he’s much bigger than me and could easily break my jaw with one punch). He BLEW THE ENTIRE SITUATION OFF!!!! He said that I basically should get over it because he was drunk and didn’t know what was happening. He said “at least I didn’t punch or slap you around”... as if him not punching or slapping me was justification as to why it WASNT abuse in his eyes. When he saw the marks on my throat he started apologizing and going into his spiel about how he doesn’t deserve me and he’s a piece of s**t. All things I had heard before in previous arguments. Every time we would argue, he would bring up things that have happened in his past. For instance, he would say “nobody understands me. Nobody can see things from my point of view”. He blames his anger on the fact that his father would “beat” him as a child, which I do not believe in the slightest. I think he was disciplined by his father and he does not take well to authority. He would blame his actions on dealing with stress or being homesick every time he would get angry or throw and break things. After the situation happened on new year, I decided to forgive him and told him that I never want to drink with him again or be around him drunk. He agreed that he was done drinking. Of course that’s a lie. He’s drank at least 3 times since then and gotten inebriated. Aside from that incident, there was another where we got into an argument about me texting my friend and he threw me outside of his door in my underwear with all of my things. I was humiliated and had to put pants on while students walked by. Someone complained to housing after seeing it and he got put on a temporary probation. After that incident, I told him I’m leaving if he doesn’t learn to control his anger and keep his hands to himself. He has gotten much better, for a while. However , recently it has started back up again. Just yesterday he pushed me into a mental breakdown. I suffer from clinical anxiety, PTSD and severe seasonal depression. I take anxiety meds but try not to take meds for depression or ptsd because I don’t particularly like how they make me feel. I have been depressed for about a week and a half now, and yesterday I couldn’t do anything except lie in bed and cry literally all day. He made a comment saying that my arm was “sloppy” (give me your sloppy arm) I didn’t find the comment funny although he insisted it was a joke. When I became defensive and told him that I would do it myself (he was lotioning my arm) he became enraged. He literally screamed at me and slammed my door when he left. Then the next day, which was yesterday , he came back up (I was still upset because I never got an apology and due to my depression I am very sensitive), and he continued to explain that he did nothing wrong, it was a joke, I’m the one who took it too far by getting upset and assuming he was insulting me, etc. I had already been crying because depression, and he told me “stop that fake a** crying, it doesn’t work on me”, as if I can control it or I’m doing it on purpose. I cried for three hours, until he came back and continued to ask me” are you done crying. Are you done yet”?. I said no, I want you to comfort me not come and belittle me, so you can leave my room. He continued to talk about how I was acting like a bitch, he didn’t care about my depression because it isn’t an excuse, his mom has depression  and she “doesn’t act like this” etc etc. I was too emotionally numb to argue back I just sat and cried and listened (guys I literally could not stop crying no matter what I did). Anyway, he eventually laid in bed with me and told me it will be okay. I went into a small episode (ptsd) and couldn’t breathe , he fell asleep and I sat up trying to make myself breathe again. Finally, later that night my low passed and my mood improved slightly. He ended up leaving with a friend and has been gone since, he won’t come back until tomorrow. I know this is a long post and you’re probably hoping I can get to the point already. I have a knack for attracting these types of people. The love of my life was my roomate, which lived here and was my best friend as well as lover. She was extremely narcissistic and treated me horribly, but because I loved her unconditionally I stayed until I couldn’t take it anymore. I’m still in love with her, but we aren’t in contact. The last boyfriend I had (2016) was an extremely abusive relationship (physically) I had to break my lease with him and run from my apartment to my grandmothers two months before I enrolled and got accepted into college( in 2016). With that being said, I’m so emotionally drained I don’t know what to do. Of course, there’s a part of me that loves him and believes that he can get better. But 75 percent of me wants to leave and not look back. It is hard, because I do love him. But due to my past abusive relationship my ptsd has worsened , and the things he does causes my emotional state to become extremely disoriented. I know this sounds like a joke because I’m going into the field of psychology, but I guess we all have our problems. I just am not sure what to do. I want to leave, but I want to try and see this through because I do love him. When he’s good, he’s really good. But the bad has begun to outweigh that and I’m not sure if I can take much more. There’s so much more I could go into detail about regarding the relationship, but from what you have read, if you’ve even read this far at all, what do you think I should do? Any advice on the situation? Genuine advice. Also if anyone has been through anything similar or dealt with a similar person I would love to hear about it... I just have to unjumble my mind. 
PS: I forgot to mention that he smokes marijuana literally daily, multiple times a day. He blows all of his money on it (even if he’s in the hole) and has said on multiple occasions that he smokes it to calm down so that he can “be around me without spazzing”. He also refuses to admit he has a problem with his anger, and every time I attempt to bring up him getting help he is dead set on the belief that he doesn’t need it. So honestly, is this going to get better? Anyone went through anything similar ??",01Mar2020,1

I live in the US and my universities spring break just started.

I’m not sure if I should let anyone at my campus know (my professor or campus safety) especially because I don’t want to put him in any trouble or unfair situation. I know this is a sensitive subject with all of the xenophobic attitudes towards this virus and I don’t want to contribute to that nor harm my classmate in anyway.

355,"Hi, guys. I've been having a sort of constant struggle dealing with my overprotective mother ever since I was born. I'm gonna try to keep it vague in fear of her finding this.

Everything I do or don't do she scrutinizes and when I do something she doesn't like (for example, watching something violent or a horror movie) she'll guilt trip me to the point where I stop, get angry at her, then acts shocked and insists I didn't have to stop if I didn't want to. She constantly infantilizes me, refuses to give me space, gets angry when I don't text her when I'm out with my own sister, yells at me or gives me dirty looks for bending over even in just the same room as a man even if I'm just picking something up, tells me the clothes I wear (usually at worst a crop top and shorts?) will give people the wrong impression. 

She also used to do this to me when I was kindergarten aged and once even insinuated I looked like a whore one time because it was pajama day and I wanted to wear pajamas with a tiny open loop on the front nowhere near my chest. 

I've become dependent on her in pretty much every way possible and that terrifies me. She uses any and every justification there is in the book. All of my family including me thinks I may be autistic but I've never gotten proper diagnosis so I try to stay respectful and not call myself such, so she uses that as the main reason and always goes on about how I'm ""more different"" and need more protection or whatever.

She doesn't give me any space regardless of how respectfully or not I ask and if she does she guilt trips me until I feel obligated to just let her be in the same space as me even if I don't want her to be.

I've been trying to get a job, but it's difficult in the area I'm in because of lack of transportation and I don't have a driver's license. There's no jobs I'm really qualified for that are hiring. I don't want to invade my sister's space so living with her is out of the question and my father lives in another state.

I've also only recently been allowed to go into a store alone, even with her in the parking lot, and even then that's only half of the time. The rest of the time she follows me around and gets angry when she loses sight of me. 

I don't have any friends or anything either.  I'm going to be trying to devote most of the time I have to finding a job and saving up money so I can just live on my own even though I'm terrified of doing so, but is there anything else I can do in the meantime?",01Mar2020,1
356,"So I am 19 years old about to turn 20 in a few months and I still can't make friends, let alone talk to strangers. I have only made 1 friend since middle school(7th grade). I went through high school without any friends really until my senior year where I was in a friend group but it was only for like 2 months until one of the guys in the group found out I wasn't gay and wasn't into him so they basically dropped me. Now I am in my second year at community college and I have yet to make any friends. I have yet to even really talk in my classes. Usually when I do talk it is like 1 sentence or it is me talking to the teacher. Otherwise, at work I have known the people there for quite a while but even then when it comes to new employees I don't really talk to them. Otherwise, I only have friends from middle school which is cool and all but I don't live near them and I can only play video games with them. I do have a girl whom I recently met within the past year but that was on Tinder and I really like her but you know she has a whole bunch of her friends while I am sitting here with no in-person friends. I hang out with her friends sometimes but I always feel like an outcast since I don't really know them that much and I am not talkative. I would like to make new friends but I don't know how to. Everyone who I am friends with has usually come up to me and start talking. Even my girlfriend was the one who texted me first. But otherwise, I would never initiate a conversation. People also say that I have a mean resting face or that I look super depressed. I think this is why some people don't come up and talk to me sometimes, they think like I am pissed off and everything but, I am not pissed off. I think I am a nice person and laid back person. Also, I know what people might say ""Join a club for college or activities at college"" I really would not like to join a club because I would rather work at that point. And at work, I would try to make friends there but the majority of the kids there are like sophomore/juniors in high school since it is a grocery store. There is this one girl in one of my classes at school who seems really laid back and doesn't talk ever in class. She seems like a nice person but I don't know how I would start a conversation with her. I would try to talk to her outside of class but she stays in the same classroom for her next class.

357,"This is a story about my friend who loves money more than anything in the world but has never been loved.  
He\`s 39 and he still hasn\`t got a wife and he has never proposed to anyone. He thinks that all women need his money and don’t love him. He had many relationships with different women, but not a single one lasted for a long time. He's never had his own flat or house or car. He prefers to rent everything. He likes to travel, but he doesn’t want to buy expensive tours. He lives in 3 star hotels, even though he has several million dollars in his bank account.   
He is not greedy, so I don't think he if afraid for his money. He helps his parents a lot, gives money to his friends. He just wants true love.

Any advice where to find a loving wife for such a man?",01Mar2020,1

But this girl has a boyfriend and I've been trying to think of a way to ask her to just be friends without making it super awkward but I cant think of a way that wont make her think I'm trying to ask her out.

360,"I need some advice, y'all. (Yes, I wrote a novel)

So, our neighbors a couple of houses down have this big, pretty, sweet dog. They let him run loose, and he's always in our front yard. Which is fine. I love dogs, and I like this dog in particular...he's very sweet. He comes up on the porch to be loved on and everything, and I'm more than happy to comply.

Tonight, he followed me in my car all the way to the road and got IN the road, which is a busy highway and there were a lot of cars coming. I was freaking out. I ended up putting him in the car and driving him back home.

I knocked on the owners' door. I heard them talking, laughing, etc. Knocked some more. And more. Finally, someone looked out the window. Kept knocking. Yelled ""Hellooooo??"" No one ever came to the door.

So, I went back home, and we put the dog in our fence long enough for me to leave and go to the store, just so he wouldn't follow me. Then my husband turned him loose again.

Now, this dog whines and cries at the front door to be let inside. He figured out a way to infiltrate our backyard fence and goes to the BACK door to cry.

He is a very healthy seeming dog, seems to be well-fed, nice, shiny coat and pretty white teeth. And we live pretty far off the road. So I'm not gonna go as far as to say his owners don't take care of him. But...

He cant stay here. We have 2 dogs and multiple cats. I dont want to call animal control because he will go to a kill shelter. I also dont necessarily want drama with my neighbor, although I am really annoyed that they didn't come to the door.

What do we do?",01Mar2020,1

363,"Im not sure how to take this whole situation. Long story short is I’ve been with a girl for a little over 2 years now and we took a break due to us letting our heads get over ourself in the relationship. We decided to take a break on our relationship(we also live together) and we agreed that if either of us wanted to “venture” out with other people we could and couldn’t get mad about it. I did go on tinder for just the hell of it and she went on my phone for something unrelated and saw I had tinder and kind of snooped. She got upset/angry and basically met up with her ex with the intentions of having sex for “revenge” for what I did, even though we agreed like previously said. The moment she got there she felt really guilty and her ex is still basically wanting her back but she knew it would hurt me. He ended up kissing her but she supposedly didn’t kiss back. He tried to cuddle her when they just watched tv and she wasn’t having it. 

Idk if Im being too upset about this or not but I am hurt. Just don’t know what to do about it. She lied pretty bad about the entire situation and i just had the suspicion.

He has a collection of shot glasses (he travels for work and always gets one from all the places he visits). I told him that instead of cumming in the condom he should cum in a shot glass. So I put a shot glass between my boobs and he came in it and I drank it lol. It's not the first time I had sex with him but I just feel so awkward and weird especially the whole shot glass thing. After we were done we laid in his bed and we kissed and he told me that he loves me then he fell asleep. We have always jokingly said I love you to each other but I'm not sure what love he means anymore. We are both in our late twenties.,01Mar2020,1
367,"I apologize in advance, it's a long read. Background: I (female) am 23 years old. I have had severe anxiety my whole life but i am getting treatment with medications currently as well as therapy.
So I pretty much make up ridiculous scenarios in my head and run with it until it puts me on the edge of a panic attack. 
Recently I met this really nice man, let's just call him B. So B and I have been talking for over a month, and we really hit it off when we first met. Everything was perfect and still is. I can see myself getting serious with him, although B is 3 years younger than me so for now I am just staying chill and casually date him. No labels for now. He graduates college in 3 months, so I hope to take things to the next level when he is settled down and has more free time. B's college is 6 hours away. He would drive down to see me on the weekends as well as work on the weekends back home. We always have an amazing connection when we are together. He treats me amazing and is definitely into me if he drives 6 hours one way just to see me. He says he really likes me and I really like him too. 
But my mind will make up different scenarios; like he couldn't come home one weekend, and I got worried he was going to see his ex instead. Which he didn't even see her. They broke up a week before I started talking to him anyways, however I still worry if B would have any interest in me after dumping her such a short time ago.
About two weeks ago I glanced down at B's phone and saw there was a notification from 'girlfriend'... I asked him about this and he said it was one of his close friends that everybody thought they dated but they really don't. He said it was a joke that they both ran with... B seemed nonchalant about it, but I can't fully trust B. I do think it could have been a close female friend but I just don't know. It gave me a weird feeling like I was betrayed. I am not officially dating B yet so that had me on the rocks about things. He expressed he wanted to be my boyfriend before, but I have been holding off to make sure he is 100% ready.
 My past relationships have been terrible and have given me bad anxiety and insecurity. I have been cheated on multiple times and have been verbally abused. I really like B and don't want to get hurt over B if he is not ready for someone serious. I can tell he really likes me and we have soul mate chemistry but something is holding me back. My insecurity in relationships is so terrible I always pull away. And I don't want to let go of something good. 
I think I will have to sit down with him and talk to him about how I feel and what I need from him, if he wants to move forward with things. 
Do I have any real reason to be insecure here?

1) relationship advice would be great but
2) please help me calm my insecurities. Please. I don't know what to do at this point. I used to meditate but want to get back into that. I started yoga up again, and watch some ASMR videos before I go to bed to calm me. I also paint. I think my insecurity stems from thinking about the ""what if's"" but I need help just focusing on what's in front of me. I'm not sure what to do because I do not want my mental health ruining a perfectly fine relationship. What helps you with your insecurities?
Thank you in advance to everybody for their input.",01Mar2020,1
368,"so for starters, i’m a 19 y/o F. I’ve been away at college for about 2 years now. I never really struggled with being away since my (now ex) boyfriend always made it a point to come here every weekend. Since our horrible breakup, I’ve been going home more. Each time I go home, it gets even harder to come back to school. My parents literally have to force me out the door or i’ll just keep putting it off. If I am unable to go home on a Friday because of work or school, I’ll still drive 3 hours just to go home for a couple of hours. this isn’t normal. 

I find myself doing things in my dorm that I haven’t done since I was in the 10th-11th grade. Like i’ve starting watching an old tv show that I watched almost everyday after school in the 10th grade and it is the only thing that is making me happy right now. 

I feel as if I am stuck in the past. In my childhood. Nothing in the present makes me happy. Only when I am doing something that a younger version of me would have done. Idk. It’s hard to explain. I graduate next Spring and I’m afraid. What if i’m not ready for the real world? Im so stuck in the past.",01Mar2020,1
369,"I (M21) have been really great friends with someone (F24) for the last couple years. We're both currently going to school at a small college in California. We hit it off soon after we met, and developed a really strong friendship over our common interests, and learned to deeply care for each other as time went on. So about three weeks ago, she starts acting a little cold towards me. Mild passive aggressiveness towards things I say, stuff like that. I just assumed she was going through something and figured all would be well within a week or two. She then left to go on a short missions trip to Mexico. I thought the week break would be good for her, and that she would come back refreshed and we would pick up right where we left off. Yet I was wrong. All this week she was super distant from me. Oftentimes wouldn't even acknowledge something I said, or if she did it would almost be like she was scolding me. So today I asked her, ""Is there some kind of tension between us? You've been really distant as of late."" She essentially said this: ""Yes I have been putting distance between us, but this requires a much longer conversation. But know that it's not because of ill will towards you.""

That does offer a little bit of relief to the situation, but I'm still finding it kinda hard since we were so close not even a month ago and now its almost like I barely even know her. I guess what I'm looking for is how I can cope with her coldness, as well as try to reconcile whatever it is that is driving her away from me. I just want my best friend back.",01Mar2020,1

371,"Hi. I'm a recent high school graduate, and well, I feel pretty lost. 

When I think of going to college, I just feel like it's not for me, personally. I've thought about it for a long, long while, and I just ended up being that kid that needed something different. I've tried to explain to my family how I feel, and they were shocked, as I was the ""smart"" one (although I don't think I'm intelligent or special at all just because I did well in school. Heh.). They expected a lot from me. They begrudgingly accept that I don't want to go, but at the same time, they still put pressure on me to go. 

My entire life, I feel like I've lived without being able to breathe quite enough air. My entire life, I've felt like I've just followed what other people told me, just drifting along day after day. From blur to blur... I've lived so many years putting on a mask for my family and for other people just to please them. And now that I'm confronted with making these major life decisions, I feel like I'm drowning. I grew up without learning how to really... stand up for myself, and without learning how to *speak*. I haven't given my real self enough time in the light... So I don't know what's going to happen if I follow my heart and make my own decisions. I'm trying to be brave and do that right now, and it's freaking me out. I just wish I knew what steps to take. And sure, accomplishing life goals doesn't happen all at once. But sometimes I feel an overwhelming sense of hopelessness, or like I'm really not making much progress at all. I wonder if all of my passion and effort will amount to anything in the end. 

It's my goal to start a business. I want to do something to inspire people with my heart, to make people's lives better. I'm a creative, artistic-type person and have been since I was a kid, but as I've grown up I find that part of myself has been pretty repressed.  I'm trying to heal that child in me now, and I'm steadily working towards my goal. But to add to that, now that I've chosen this path of the heart, I feel totally lost and on my own. And the more I choose my heart, the more alien I feel to the world around me. 

I'm the first person in my family to try and attempt something like this. And I guess it's accurate to say I have a vision of my future that the people around me just struggle to see, or can't see at all. Because they don't understand... my heart, I often feel alone. Very alone.

And now I've come to wonder, *how* exactly can I trust myself now that I'm in this adulting process? How do I learn to stand up for myself even when everyone and everything else around me makes me feel like I'm in the wrong? 

If anyone has any thoughts on this or helpful words at all, any stories, I'd be happy to read them. Thanks.. :)",01Mar2020,1
372,"This is my first post on this subreddit and i need any kind of advice either i should continue pursuing Computer Science or not since I'm really bad at mathematics. 

I'm currently 19 and studying in computer science and currently I'm in semester 2. During semester 1 i have to take pre-calculus. Unfortunately i never understand a thing in that subject and i failed it for my final. We have 2 quiz for that subject which can help me with my carry marks. Quiz 1 I scored 0/10 and quiz 2 I scored 2/10. Meanwhile, we also have 2 test. Test 1 i managed to get 12/40 and test 2 i got 16/40 which is still i failed all the tests and quizzes. This causing me to have a very low carry mark for my final to pass the subject. I got an E for the subject and the requirement to pass a subject in this university is C+.  


My other subjects are, fundamental in coding which we learned basic C++ like looping,repetition, arrays and functions, and multimedia. I managed to scored B for my coding subjects and A for multimedia. Still my GPA for semester 1 is 2.98 and i have to repeat pre calculus cause i need to pass it to take calculus I during semester 2.  


However, I found out that during semester 2, the subjects are making towards to more mathematical, critical and logical thinking. I have potential of failing again in semester 2. I even frustrated with the environment here since everyone is like having no respond in any kind of discussion. Everyone seems to be selfish.   


IF anyone ever thinking about asking me like *Did you ever study for your own self?, Did you ever try to seek other people to help you with your studies?* 

The answer is yes, i tried to study on my own but it didn't seems to make any progress. I tried to approach friends and people to help with my studies but still i end up failing. Also whenever i tried to ask someone for help they kept saying ""*Chill bro i also don't understand""*, but end up scoring and passed their exams.

&amp;#x200B;

I also tried to discuss with my parents, but they end up keep pushing to continue my studies in this course and keep saying *keep trying.* Imagine i keep trying and failing and extending my semesters? Isn't that just going to be just a waste of time? Better I just drop off the university and went to other courses which is more  theoritical and reading right?

I'm open with any kind of advice, i just need a guide or motivational support from anyone here in this subreddit. Thank you for having your time reading my post.",01Mar2020,1
373,"So a few months ago, I got what I thought was the job of my dreams that would finally send me down the path I wanted to go, after years of work, applications and rejections. It turns out my unicorn was just plain old donkey. On my first day, the first thing I had to do was sit down and listen about all the issues with each person on the team and who can’t work with who... that raised serious red flags but I thought with support from my boss we can manage it. On top of that I am not doing what my job description says and I’m basically tidying up all day (mind you I’m in a senior role that has nothing to do with tidying up!) with no mention of me doing my actual job - I’ve brought it up several times and it keeps getting pushed back and not even mention of training or anything like that - I asked about it but was brushed off. To make matters worse, I’m supposed to supervise people without having any actual official authority which has of course created a lot of resentment, although they haven’t exactly been welcoming. Up until December things were at least civil so I didn’t mind it so much. Since we came back from the break, my boss has changed completely. Yells at me in front of people and  blames me for the culture(!) cause he’s busy and doesn’t want to hear it or deal with it. He thought he’ll  dump it all on me and not having to hear about it. However, the rest of the team doesn’t want to cooperate and he doesn’t want to upset anyone whatsoever so, I’m stuck being a punching bag between the two. To make matters worse, since the last screaming session, my boss is using someone else to communicate with me and patch things up, which is also not a good sign in my book for 2 reasons: 1) when I started he wanted to make sure I could go an talk to him at any time - which he stopped and 2) because it looks like he doesn’t know how to manage people or solve problems. I am still on probation so I’m thinking this is a lost cause and I need to move on. Am I exaggerating?

384,"Honestly, I didn’t know where else to go. Ive been way over my head lately that... I just need advice. 

I had a pretty crappy childhood. Absent dad, always working.. verbally and physically abusive. Selfish. Because of this.. mom had to work. Which means, I didn’t have her much either. More crappy things happened and now I’m medicated to live a “normal” everyday adult life. 

So... my dad wasn’t that great with my mom either. He provided a roof over our head and food. But that’s it. He was never there for my mom either. She was always alone, from what I remember. Fast forward to my late teenage years... she cheats on him and ends up pregnant. My dad took this as an opportunity to find his way out and blame her for everything. 

He found lawyers to help him with the divorce and the agreements. While me, my siblings and my mom tried to get a lawyer to help us ... for him to provide for us. It wasn’t our fault they had marital problems. But no. No one helped because we didn’t have money. He got it his way. Got a lawyer to harass my mom daily over the phone until she signed the divorce papers stating that he was only responsible of giving us $80 weekly for my little brother only. He also didn’t fight for custody. Just handed us over. 

Fast forward to my now adult life. He’s walked in and out of our lives (mine and my siblings) multiple times. He does help us with rent but it isn’t enough. He expects us to somehow make it work. I work full time but it’s my wage feeding 4 additional mouths, utility bills and other necessities. And he just keeps on adding more to my shoulders. 
He used to throw it in my face... that my mom should work. Yes she should. But eventually, I explained to him why i didn’t want her too. I was raped as a child and I’m afraid that if my mom leaves to work... my baby stepbrother would go through the same in the wrong hands. No baby deserves this. 
He didn’t care. He never questioned me... talked to me about it. For him it’s all about the money. Now he’s giving less rent money. 
I don’t have enough to buy groceries this week and barely to make it to work. And somehow.. he expects me to pay even MORE rent. 
I don’t want this man in my life but I feel like I have no choice but to continue letting him step all over me. Today... he gave less rent. And I have no additional money to put there. Again... i don’t even have a family of my own and overnight.. I’m taking care of a full family. He’s sleeping here tonight too... because unfortunately ... he pays rent too. Also, he likes to barge in like nothing and drag my brother (who he gave full custody to my mother) wherever he pleases. 
Is there any hope for me? Like... financial help? I’ve checked but it states that I make too much for the amount of people I take care for... I live in New York and it’s expensive as hell. (I’ve lived here since I was born)
I can’t move because I can barely afford my own bills and my credit score has gone to shit and I have absolutely no savings. 

... here’s the kicker... I’m engaged and wanted to get married by next year. Seems so far off.
He never even gave me a chance to get on my two feet before fucking me over.

387,"I've been dating my boyfriend for about 9 months now. We started off slow, but about 6 months in we were getting to a good place and testing the waters of how we would do living together. He would come spend the night once a week (always my place because he lives with his parents).

But about three months ago his dad fell ill and had to go through several treatments and surgeries. He's a fighter and pulled through, but needs constant care. Because of this my boyfriend no longer stays over and constantly checks on video monitors in his home to see what his dad is doing when we're on dates. 

Of course I don't think anything he's doing is wrong. Family comes first and he's the only one of his siblings that lives close so he's the one to take care of him.

But I'm so lonely all the time now. I miss spending time with him, and even when we're together, it feels like he's not really there because he's checking the cameras. I would spend time at his house but it's kind of weird, he's never let me in his house because he says both he and his parents are messy and he doesn't want me to see it.

I feel like the scum of the earth because I keep feeling further and further apart to the point where I don't even look forward to the time we spend together anymore and feel lonely and depressed a good chunk of the day. I'm starting to almost feel miserable in this relationship but it's not his fault.

What can I do? It wouldn't be right to end things for something like this because he didn't do anything wrong but I feel so sad and lonely almost all the time, and the doctor said his dad will probably be like this for the rest of his life, functional but needing constant care.",01Mar2020,1

One that involved my dead grandma telling me how disappointed she was in me, that I didn't turn out the way she wanted, she had a score chart and I scored very low and I was trying to justify myself to my (also dead) mom and grandpa. 

I woke up crying, knowing it wasn't real at all and that my grandma was so very loving and supportive and never would have said or even thought any of those things but dream feelings can be tough to wake out of.

394,"I'm in a very complicated situation and I just can't seem to figure out what to do. I'm going maybe you guys can help me. Oh and, by the way, I'm a 21 year old female, but I'll be 22 in two days.  

Here's the situation;  
I come from an abusive family and I've always been pretty independent although I have various mental health issues. I ran away from my alcoholic mom when I was 15 and I was promised that I would be emancipated if I moved in with my grandparents. What I didn't know is my grandma is very controlling and very toxic. She lied about the emancipation, but I pushed on past it.  

I ended up applying for Make A Wish kinda for fun because I didn't think I'd get it when I was 17. I had a brain tumor and multiple surgeries when I was 14. I used my Make A Wish wish to visit and meet my now fiance in person for the first time in Australia. My grandma ended up making the whole trip about her and wouldn't even let me see him after the first day.  

I ended up deciding to save up the money and move to Australia with my fiance the first chance I could get, the second I turned 18. Unfortunately though I didn't get accepted for the thousand dollar visa I applied for, they wouldn't tell me why I got rejected, and they kept the money. I was having a really bad time mentally at the time so I decided to just get a visitor's visa and get the heck out of there then renew my visa when I got to Australia.  

Everything went pretty well getting to Australia actually, it felt so freeing to finally be independent, but within the first few days my fiance's mom ended up moving in with us and it all went downhill from there. My fiance would get upset at me constantly saying I upset his mom and he kept spending all my money. I knew it would be hard to be on my own for the first time and our or was nowhere near the best, but I expected that.  

My fiance ended up spending the money I had saved up to renew my visa on a video game console so I eventually became an illegal immigrant. I had no way to get back to America and nowhere to stay and no way to get an income. My mental and physical health took a nosedive as I didn't have healthcare or an income.  

My fiance convinced me to move in with his mom who had moved out after a few months. I just wanted to see him happy so I figured I'd just suffer the move. Let's just say the move was the worst thing to happen in my life besides dealing with my abusive mom.  

We finally moved out to a really nice place (still with his mom unfortunately) in October of last year, but my fiance's mental health is still the absolute worse and he's not getting help for it. I basically feel like I'm his caretaker as I cook, clean, and make sure he's looked after. This is very hard for me because I have terrible mental health myself. He's done everything from getting physical and verbal abuse to guilting me that I'm the only one to stop him from committing suicide.  

My grandparents offered to let me stay at their house and they'll pay all my bills, but it won't be until June and it'll be in an area I don't know and my grandma won't let me even talk to my dad if I move in with them. My dad offered to let me stay at his second house so I'll basically have my own place, but it's in a large city and I'll have very little transport plus I don't know my dad that well so it might be a little awkward especially with my social anxiety and he's not nearly as financially stable as my grandparents.  

I love my fiance so much, but I honestly feel like I could be doing so much more for my life and that we just rushed into this living together thing, we both could be doing better getting our lives together if I left. I can't stay, but I can't leave. What do you guys think I should do?",01Mar2020,1

I currently have very few friends, extremely valuable, but very few. I'm wanting to expand my social circle. Not just through my boyfriend, I want to have my own group of friends. 

How I socialise is very dependant on my mood. I would say I'm quite introverted, but can get along well with those I know, generally I like to keep to myself. I could make work friends, but I constantly talk to people all the time as part of my job; breaks I use to slow down.

I was abit wary because there was some sexual tension and although I'm in an unhappy relationship I didnt want to do anything inappropriate. My boyfriend is very jealous so I didnt tell him and I wanted to keep it that way. He was married so I thought he would automatically be discreet.

At 11pm  a mutual friend of ours has called me and said that he's been wanting to know where I'm at for hours and he was pleading my friend to get me to call him. I was shocked cause this was meant to be kept under wraps. Did he want me exposed as revenge for canceling on him? Or was he just desperate to meet up? 

I messaged him at 3 am pleading him to not contact me. But still I'm wondering why he contacted a third person and is there a chance he would reach out to more people incase he cant get through to me? I really dont want him to do that.

405,"I’m feeling so lost and worthless right now. I’m studying at a Russell Group (but not particularly prestigious) U.K university but have had to take leave from my studies until September (putting off my graduation until 2021), due to poor mental health and admitting to my university’s counselling service that I was feeling suicidal. I have diagnosed anxiety, depression and O.C.D. I’m also managing an eating disorder (diagnosed anorexic at 14 due to bullying which developed into bulimia after “recovery”). Since taking medical leave from my studies I have managed to abstain from bulimia for just over a month (small victories) and have started on medication. I got straight A’s in high school and despite my difficulties am averaging a middling to high 2:1 in my degree. I also volunteer for a charity which works with refugees and asylum seekers, but my participation has declined substantially as my mental health has worsened.

My issue is, for such a long time managing my mental health has taken almost all of my energy, and whatever was left just went into maintaining my grades and personal relationships. I have never had passions or hobbies that would offer any guidance as to what career path I should pursue. I applied for my current degree (Politics) during one of my worst periods of depression and so didn’t put as much thought into how it would influence my career prospects as I should have done. Now, I’m realising I have next to no idea of what I should do for the rest of my life, and the options available to me feel largely unappealing. I don’t know what to do and feel paralysed by indecision and a lack of motivation. I feel like I have no prospects and no shot at a happy, fulfilling life as my journey has eroded my self-confidence down to practically nothing. It makes me want to kill myself rather than keep drifting and failing, constantly a burden on my loved ones and palpably inferior in comparison to my peers. The only jobs I have had are minimum wage (1 year as a receptionist and brief periods in catering/tutoring roles). 

I don’t know what to do. I have no direction or passions and even if I did, I don’t have any confidence that I would be able to succeed at anything. I feel like I might as well just end it all because I am so so tired of trying so hard and failing; I feel like I’m just being knocked back again and again and I can’t take it anymore. When I was younger, even when things were hard I had hope that things would eventually change and everything would fall into place. I don’t believe that anymore. I attempted suicide last year by overdose but immediately made myself sick because I knew it would devastate my loved ones if I killed myself, and as desperate as I felt I couldn’t bring myself to do that to them. 

Any advice as to how I can turn things around would be hugely appreciated as honestly I don’t know how I can keep going as things are. Thank you x",01Mar2020,1

407,"He's someone who grew up getting everything he wanted no matter what, his parents never refused him anything. I'm someone who grew up with the classic ""I'm sorry, it's too expensive."". So clearly, from the get-go we would be different.

But even though I'm financially better now than I ever was in my life, I strive for a simpler life, with only the things that I really want and need, and I consciously stop myself from buying stuff I don't need. I'm not perfect about it, but I'm doing my best.

My boyfriend though, you'd think he was dirt poor and then came into a bunch of money and he just HAS to spend it to show everyone how much money he has now. He got a job at a sporting goods company a year ago and he advertises a lot of sneakers. Before this, he didn't get the sneaker hype and thought it was dumb, but now, he has 13 pairs of sneakers. 13! And he still wants to buy more. Just cause he ""can't just wear the same 3 pairs to work, it's lame"". Like he's a teenager who needs to show off status to the rich kids. He doesn't just buy sneakers, he buys other stuff that he definitely doesn't need (he has upwards of 16 jackets or something, there's barely any room for me to store my own things because of how many he has) 

Besides the money being thrown into this instead of idk, us putting some money aside to go on a nice trip or something (he laughed when I proposed this), or hell, even putting money into a retirement fund, he has to spend it all. Because ""money was made to be spent, what's the point of putting it away""........ No need to touch on how dumb that statement is, I know.

He hasn't run into issues about not having enough money for rent or bills or whatever, this isn't my main issue. It's this idea that he needs to have *STUFF*, and it's never enough *STUFF*, you have to always be accumulating more. This just goes against so many of my views on life and beliefs and I find it appalling. I hate that mentality and it makes me angry and sad that the only way he thinks he can make his life richer is by literally making it richer.

I don't know. Am I crazy for feeling this way? I just think he has a really unhealthy relationship with money and I *can not* see it as okay, no matter how much I try to ""not care"" cause it's ""not my problem""

TL;DR: Boyfriend wants to buy things all the time and have as much stuff as possible; I want to simplify my life and strip it down of stuff as much as I can. I don't know if I'm crazy for being angry at him for being this way.",01Mar2020,1

409,"I want to begin with this isn't some ARG or something that I want to blow my account up or whatever. This is something that terrifies me and I have been having more and more nightmares for the past few days... It's honestly really a weird story that sounds like it came out of a wattpad fanfiction, but I swear to god that what I'm telling is true.

I recently found out that I had a half-sister back in 2015, while I was a freshman in high school. We ended up having a lot in common, but she told me this one story about a family that she used to be family friends with back when she lived in the United States (in 2015 she lived in Mexico.) The family consisted of a man who took care of about 5-7 children. The thing is though, they all ""died"" back when she was younger and it caused a huge tear in the hearts of her, her sister, and her mother. They never found the bodies. 

When she told me the story, I knew right away that they weren't dead. And guess what? THEY WEREN'T.

After a year of my sister and I talking, they came back into the lives of my half sister's family lives by suddenly having a ""random"" encounter with them. They never made it clear what happened, but my sister felt betrayed... **I feel like in order to explain my issue, I needed to explain all of this.**

My sister made it clear that she didn't want any contact with them whatsoever, but they began to intrude into our lives. My sister and I both began to have issues with our phones and jokingly we began to blame the family, up until a few weeks of us not being able to communicate without having the call drop or the messages not notifying us when we got a new one. So over a call, I was 15 so that's why it's edgy, I began to curse out one whoever was messing with our phones over a call that I was having with my sister. She left the room, so, from me telling this person all this shit, I got a response through her messenger. 

I don't recall what it read, but I'm now 19 and my sister is 20 and we were discussing this today and she still claims that she never texted me when this happened. I acknowledge that I'm paranoid here and there, but there has been many incidents since then... 

The thing is though they stop for a few months and then start all over again. They go from hacking our devices, accounts, or just straight up stalk us. My sister, since 2015, has moved into a city away from me in California, but she claims to have seen them a few times... 

I admit that my sister and I are both paranoid, but we have nowhere else to go to, and she doesn't even know their real names, so I can't go to the police and report anything... I'm scared and confused and I know my sister isn't playing some games with me because she's more scared than I am about this...

410,"I’m going to try to keep this as short as I can while also getting everything across clearly. Basically, I was attending a big university in my home state while also paying my own rent and bills. I was struggling really bad without support from my family. Like, I couldn’t buy textbooks and homework access codes that were absolutely necessary to pass my classes. My GPA slightly tanked but still recoverable (I think. 2.7) I could not take out any more loans than what FAFSA would give me, since I had no credit at the time and my parents had terrible credit and couldn’t co-sign loans. 

During the start of my sophomore year (August of last year) I got in a long distance relationship. He lived 6 hours away and would come visit me for a weekend a few days a month. I was madly in love with him. However, I was naïve. It was my first long(ish) relationship and I believed that what I saw of him every month was his true personality. 

Fast forward to this January. I started my 2nd semester of sophomore year. By this point, I have literally no friends because I never have money to go do things with them and they’re always too “busy” to come over. I’m very sad, worn out, and lonely. All I have at this point is my boyfriend. I only had enough money in federal loans to take 3 classes. I couldn’t afford a necessary book for one of those classes. This was becoming too much for me to handle and I was shutting down. 

During my boyfriend’s visit in January, we were both so so sad to separate. On a crazy whim, I say, what if I just come live with you? (Remember, he lives 6 hours away, out of state). He agrees excitedly and we quickly pack my things. I drop my classes, quit my job, and I’m gone. 

Fast forward to now. My boyfriend is showing abusive tendencies and red flags everywhere. Makes fun of me for not having friends, takes my blanket and pillows if I won’t tell him why I’m upset with him, spit in my face, threw water on me, holds me down and tickles me knowing I hate it, constantly insults me (I wish you had never come here, my life was so much better before, you’re lazy, you’re gluttonous, you’re fucking crazy). Ive been very scared he was going to physically abuse me a few times. I could literally go on and on but I think you get the picture. 

I got denied from the college I needed to get into to have free tuition and live a stress free life. Now my other option is going to be just as expensive as my old school if I cant get in-state tuition. 

I don’t have a car. If I move back in with my family, I won’t have a way to get a job since they only have one car and my dad needs it for work. It’s in the middle of bumfuck nowhere so I can’t walk to anywhere I could work. 

So here’s what I’m working with: I currently have a job at a daycare. It’s within walking distance of where I’m living. I have a 642 credit score. My family lives 6 hours away. I have literally no one within 6 hours of me who can help me at this point, besides my basically abusive, soon to be ex-boyfriend. Cost of living is low here, so I could get an apartment and have some leftover money after bills with my current job. However, not enough to save up for the car that I desperately need. I NEED advice on the next step and what I should do. I need reassurance. I know I fucked up by doing this, I don’t need to be told that. I’m so scared. Like so, so scared. I don’t know what to do now. Please help me.",01Mar2020,1

The bathrooms were not super tidy and it was scary at night to go there. So the second night I felt like I wanted to poop, and i held it in bc I was so scared to go. Like my classmates were all asleep. My best friend was the only one in our tent with me and she was also very asleep. So i held my poop in until the morning (10am) and when i started to poop a boy came into the bathroom bc there was no lock. So there were 3 cubicles and the one i was in was the most functional. I yelled at the boy Dont come in! Somebody’s here! and he left but he was laughing, probably bc he knew i was pooping. I couldnt concentrate so I couldnt poop, waited until we went home and thats when i finally let go of the contents lol.

The toxic trait comes from me and my ex had each other's logins to almost all our social media. I was naive back then, and I thought it was okay, as long as both parties consented with it. Though I was sort of uneasy when he started going through my DMS with friends, reading all my private conversations, he ensured me that it was normal to do in a relationship. So, being me, I thought I was just overreacting and I did the same for him. It caused trouble, he was being very controlling on who I spoke to, and we basically made a deal where we both were tied to each other, that we couldn't talk to anybody of the opposite gender, constantly tell each other what's happening etc. One of the shared accounts was discord, and during the period of our relationship, he started to talk to this one girl, I saw and started to be insecure about it. By the time he broke up with me, not even 5 days later, he got with said girl, and now I'm just really insecure about my current relationship.

My current boyfriend goes on discord often, where essentially he talks to a lot of strangers on the internet and enjoy their presence. But I've gotten so insecure about it because I don't know anybody that he talks to, and just the fear of him leaving me for another makes me want to cry. I've been trying for the past couple of months, but I really am struggling, I just get the constant urges to literally stalk him, join every single server that he's in and just lurk in the background like some toxic person.

I want to trust him, but I'm honestly terrified with the concept of him talking to strangers, and there are so many more attractive people and more interesting people he could go for.

He ensured me multiple times that he isn't going to leave, but that's exactly what my ex said. I know I shouldn't compare him to my ex, but I just can't help it.

So I’m an 18 yo dude and my close friend is 20 years old. (You can skip to TLDR if you want, but it isn’t as informative as the entire post) 

Just some background info: We graduated college last year in April (private college) and we’ve been pretty close during our school time. When she was in school, she was in a long term relationship of 4 years. 

I always saw her as a close friend / bestie. She was kind to me and always helped me out. 

Recently I found out she’s single via her insta story and I just decided to talk to her and ask her what’s up since we haven’t met since we graduated. 

I always found her kinda attractive but I never thought of anything else with her. So when I spoke to her, we just spoke about how we’ve been doing after college. 

She’s a Tik Tok influencer (yes Ik it’s cringy) but she’s a lovely person. And a lot of her followers on insta have been requesting “Ahegao” insta stories from her (basically a sexual face kinda thing) and she’s been showing it.

She’s kind of a geeky girl who likes Animes, comics and stuff like that. But recently, she’s been like wearing “hot clothing ?” 

Anyways. In the message, after I told her about how I was she said this “Good for you I Guess 😛” 

And then I asked her about the Ahegao stuff, then I asked her if she would like to grab lunch and maybe hang out at the arcade. And she replied with “Anythang” So I told her cool and I’ll let her know about availability and timing 

From what I know. Its that she’s kinda heart broken from her tweets. 

Does this mean like she’s down to have a fling since she’s getting over her relationship ? 

*If* she’s down to fuck, should I ? I mean, she’s attractive and all, but I’m afraid that might ruin the friendship ? 

TLDR: Graduated college last year. Haven’t met my friend in almost a year. She’s single now after being in LTR for 4 years. On insta seems like she’s “horny” in some way. We spoke and we’re planning to meet for lunch &amp; arcade (which we’ve never really done before coz we used to only have study dates) I think she might be interested in having a fling w me  (based on her relies to me) 

All inputs are appreciated !",01Mar2020,1
424,"I have seen him in his yard three different times, hitting my fence with soccer balls, antagonizing my dog.

The other day (at like six am) I was in the front yard, waiting for my car to warm up before I left for work, &amp; I saw him standing on the side of his house with his phone pointed at me...I looked right at him &amp; he just stared. I told myself I was being paranoid. When I got in my car, he got in another car with an older man &amp; left at the same time I did. They drove behind me for about two miles before turning off somewhere.

Since then, I have seen the boy &amp; another man standing on a trampoline in their back yard &amp; looking at me over the fence. I called to them &amp; they got down &amp; ran in the house.

I tried to speak with the mother about my dog but she said she didn’t speak English. I hate that my dog has to be supervised in our own back yard because I’m scared of what they might do.

Any suggestions on how I handle this?",01Mar2020,1

426,"I'm worried that I ghosted this person. I'm 19. When I was 11-12, I used to talk to this guy I met on a forum. He was in his late 20s I think. He never asked for my exact age but based on what I told him about my life, I'd say he knew I was probably in middle school, and at one point he was wanted to make sure my parents knew we were talking. He said I was like a little sister to him. Eventually we began to mostly message on deviantART.

He was really sick, so he would go a long time sometimes without sending me a message. At one point, while he was for a few months, I became very depressed and suicidal over difficult real life circumstances. The toxicity I found on the dA platform was also overwhelming me and I announced that I was taking a break from it in a journal. Then, I eventually deleted my dA account. I can't quite remember if I sent my friend a goodbye message, but I figured if he wanted to contact me again in the future, he could probably just message me on the forum we originally met on.

Years passed and he never did. About three years ago, I started feeling really guilty about all of this. I sent him an email through the forum's email feature. He never responded, and a few months ago, the forum was shut down. I deleted the email account I sent it from afterwards, as it seemed futile to wait for an answer at that point.

I continued to feel guilty. Out of curiosity, I recently googled his old username. I found a pinterest account and some other things related to his interests. I know this all might sound creepy, but I just really feel bad that I never gave this guy a proper goodbye. I am horrified thinking that what I did might count as ghosting. On one hand, I am worried I am overthinking my importance in his life, but on the other hand, I feel like a jerk for what I did. Would it be weird to shoot him a message on Pinterest? Or should I just leave him alone? I don't want to make him uncomfortable/creep him out. I want to do the right thing because believe me I know I've fucked up. 

In all honesty, I feel really hopeless over this for about three years now. When I was 17, it contributed to my suicidal thoughts greatly. I couldn't stop thinking about it. I've gotten a little more used to it and now it's just grouped in with everything else that makes me suicidal, so I really need advice as I don't know how much my depressed mind is warping the situation. I have asked friends about this and they all basically say ""He probably doesn't remember you/care"" but I don't know if they're saying this because they know how guilty I feel and just want to make me feel better. I just don't want to hurt him. Should I or should I not reach out, what's the right thing? Thank you. :(",01Mar2020,1
428,"My dad has an employee. He’s reliable but it’s very obvious he’s functionally illiterate probably due to dyslexia, which is impairing his ability to advance in his career. My dad has found ways to work around this but this guy is always going to be limited in what he can do if he doesn’t address his disability.

His Facebook is full of vitriol against Middle Eastern immigrants. The thing is my mom’s is Palestinian family fled the West Bank after the 6 Days War. Because my dad has an Anglo-Saxon background and name and my mom has fair skin we look for all intents and purposes a white, middle class family.

My dad has told this employee that his comments are hurtful (he is aware that my mom is Palestinian) and to not reference my dad as his employer on his social media platforms. My mom agrees with this but is still upset that this man is so disrespectful of her family. 

My maternal grandfather spoke, read and wrote 6 languages and worked his butt off doing jobs that were beneath his intellect and education when he came to Canada in order to support his family; he loved Canada and the opportunities it gave his family.

431,"I have a friend group of 3 friends. One I will call Mary, generous and reasonable but trusts her friends more than common sense. Another I will call Jake, the best I can describe him as a mix between the stereotype of a gay man and a strict Spanish mother. Last is Hannah, she acts like a Social Justice Warrior that pushes 13 year olds to commit suicide because they drew a Steven Universe character’s skin 1 shade lighter.

Let’s start from the beginning, Hannah wasn’t always this way, she used to be the kindest person I’ve ever met, sweet, generous, and caring. Until her mom died suddenly, I have never lost a family member before and I can’t even comprehend how it would feel. I didn’t notice it at first but she completely changed. 

The first problem occurred with a mutual friend we will call Jackie. Hannah was joking around with Jackie and her friend group when Jackie said “ I’m going to kill you in your sleep,” (This is an inside joke and she said it in an unserious, joking, tone.)
Hannah immediately told Jackie her mom died in her sleep. Jackie started apologizing profusely, explaining how she didn’t know and was sorry.
About three days later Jackie says the same thing again (Keep in mind this is an inside joke that she regularly says to her friends) Before Hannah can even say a word Jackie starts apologizing, explaining how she was sorry for slipping up. 
Hannah complained to her friend group that Jackie keeps telling her she would kill her in her sleep. I found this hard to believe so I confronted Jackie about it. Jackie then explained her side of the story to me, it seemed a lot more reasonable then Hannah’s. 

Over the next month, Hannah would pick up sand and dirt and throw it at Jackie and occasionally pour it down her clothes. Jackie’s friend group kept telling Hannah to stop, each time she would reply “I don’t want a friend that wants to kill me,”

A few months go by and me and Jackie grow close, I kept thinking about that story and denying that Hannah could be a bad person.

Another story is with a boy we’ll call Bruno. The trouble first started when Hannah was bossing him around. (Another thing that changed about her) He turned to Hannah and said “Would you stop, You’re not my mom!” Hannah Immediately starts crying, Mary and Jake go and comfort her. As we leave school Jake turns to me and explains the story. I say that Bruno is using a metaphor and doesn’t have to keep track of everyone’s parental status. Over the next month or so My friend group would find random reasons to pick on Bruno, this was easy because he had a mild form of autism. 
They would tell on him for things like coughing during performances and calling people ma’am instead of their names.

The last reason is the worst. One day Hannah asked me if I have a crush on anyone. I responded “I am not discussing this” She immediately started asking me who it was while I tried to ignore the questions. I came to school the next day and I quickly found out she told people. She told people I had a crush and she knew who it was, she also told a few people it was Jake. I confronted her and she said “But it is Jake isn’t it?” I told her no “Oh come on, you’re just lying.” She responded. Mary told me to stop asking her about it. I later found out damage had already been done. People would walk up to us and tell us not to “Fuck in front of the children” I could see Hannah behind them laughing.

I honestly don’t know what to do. Should I tell a teacher? Confront her? I know losing a parent must be hard but she can’t keep doing this. I know if I don’t do anything she won’t stop teasing me. I’m starting to get very uncomfortable by her actions and she won’t stop when I ask her to.",01Mar2020,1

435,"Hey y’all. I have lurked on reddit for years and finally made an account a couple of weeks ago. However, I have been thinking for many years that my father may have been either involved in my mother’s death, or he stood by and watched her die while he did nothing. Here’s why...

When I was 19 years old, my mother passed away (I am currently 33). It happened over Christmas break during my freshman year of college. I had already been at my parents’ house for a couple of weeks at this point, as she passed on December 30, 2005. For at least two weeks leading up to her death, my mother had been sick. She thought she had the flu, as she complained about nausea and vomiting, and what she thought were gas pains in her back and shoulders. We begged her to go to an urgent treatment facility or even the ER, but she refused because she didn’t think her illness warranted such a visit. 

Since I was in town visiting for Christmas break, I spent most of my time with my friends. The night before my mother passed, I had spent the night with my friend Aub. The next morning, I awoke to my phone ringing. I saw that it was my mom’s phone calling me and I thought to myself, “why in the hell is she calling me at 7am?” So being the asshole teenager that I was, I ignored it. Then her phone called me again, and again, and again. Finally there was a voicemail, so I listened to it and immediately knew something was wrong. It was my dad’s voice on the message, saying to call him back immediately because something was wrong with my mom. I called him back as soon as the message was over and he told me to get to the hospital ASAP, but not to drive my car. Luckily, Aub’s house was a mere 3 minutes away from the hospital. When we pulled up at the ER entrance, I saw my dad standing outside. I got out of Aub’s car and immediately ran to my dad. He held me close and said, “Honey, I’m sorry, but I don’t think she made it.” I tried to comfort him and told him, “Oh no, daddy, she will be fine. Don’t worry.” But he insisted, “No, darlin’, I don’t think so. I’m sorry, but I think she’s gone.” I told Aub I would call her when I knew what was going on, and as she pulled away, my father and I walked into the doors of the emergency room. Within a few minutes, a nurse came to us and said that the doctor needed to speak with us, and she began to lead us to a “consult” room. We sat in silence until the doctor came in and informed us that unfortunately, there was nothing more that could be done; my mother was dead. He then went on to explain that her flu-like symptoms had actually been symptoms of her experiencing minor heart attacks in the weeks leading up to her death. Apparently that morning, she had a massive heart attack that ended her life. He then asked if my father wanted to donate her organs, but my dad told him that my mother (who was 56 when she passed) had had ovarian cancer at some point, thus the only organs that could be donated were her eyes. He also declined an autopsy, since it was obvious to both him and the doctor that it was the heart attack that killed her. I knew my mom wasn’t the healthiest person, but I also knew she had never had any cancer of any kind. I remember just staring at my dad after he said that, thinking “wtf?” But we were both upset, so I let it slide. 

On the way home from the hospital, my dad told me what had supposedly happened that morning. Apparently, my mother had made biscuits and gravy, but then decided to lay down on the couch and rest a bit before eating.  She got up from the couch and began to walk towards the kitchen, but collapsed on the floor before she made it out of the living room. At first my dad thought she was messing around and yelled at her to “get up.” But when she didn’t, he went over to her and rolled her onto her back. She wasn’t breathing and he said he had seen the same look in his father’s eyes when he passed of a heart attack when my dad was an adolescent. He called an ambulance, which according to him, took almost 45 minutes to arrive (we lived less than 20 minutes away from the hospital), and he supposedly had to go outside to flag them down... even though our house number was clearly marked on our mailbox. Once we finally made it home, I found the spot on the floor where my mom had passed... I could tell where it was because there was a distinct sheen on the hardwood where her body had laid dying. Once I cleaned it up, I noticed that there were no biscuits or gravy anywhere to be found, nor could I locate any evidence that she had even made breakfast that morning. 

A few days later, my dad and I met my brother and my half-sister at the funeral home to plan my mother’s service. While there, my father had all three of us sign paperwork that he claimed was necessary. I was to distraught to even read the paperwork and at that time had no reason to not trust my father. I found out years later from my brother that we had signed many documents, but the most intriguing one was that we agreed to give up our claim to any money or property that had belonged to my mother alone, which meant that if we ever uncovered anything that had belonged to our mom, it now would belong to our dad. My brother mentioned this to me about 12 years after my mom had passed, so I asked him if he thought that was odd. He did, but he also didn’t think that our mom had any money hidden away, or anything else hidden away for that matter. I asked him about the version of events that my dad gave him of the morning my mother passed, in which everything was the same, except there was no mention of her having cooked breakfast, nor did my father tell him that he had gone outside to flag down the ambulance. We compared notes, but we thought that maybe our dad was just getting older and more forgetful and skimped out on some of the details when talking to my brother.

However, what made me really begin to question my father’s actions on the morning of my mother’s death was a conversation I had with one of my parents’ old friends... we’ll call him C.J. I just so happened to run into C.J. In the summer of 2018 and we started talking about my mom. C.J. had been friends with both of my parents, but he had actually met my mother years before she married my dad, thus making them much closer than he and my father. During that conversation, C.J. informed me that my mother had been planning on leaving my father when she passed. So much so that she had been stashing away money so that she could leave him. My parents were married my entire life, but they didn’t get along very well. To be honest, my dad was always an asshole and cared about money more than he cared about anything else. So when I heard that my mom had been hiding money from my dad, I began to rethink her death. 

Do I think my dad murdered her? Maybe not outright, but I do think he sat there and watched her die, and waited until he knew that it was too late to help her before he called 911. See, I think my dad had somehow found out that my mom had been hiding money in order to leave him... how, I am unsure, but I think he knew. Could he even have given her something to cause her fatal heart attack? Possibly, although I doubt that. But unfortunately, I think he somehow found out that she had been hiding money from him, which would have been mostly “his” money because he was the only one working at the time... so since money is the most important thing in the world to my dad, I honestly think that when he realized she was having a massive/fatal heart attack, he stood back and did nothing, thus allowing her to die. 

The kicker, of course, about two months ago, I received a letter stating that my mother had a bank account with almost $17,000 in it. Since my siblings and I signed away any rights we would have had toward her money, I honestly don’t think there’s anything we can do about it. However, I got rid of the letter, so as far as I am aware, my father has no idea how much money my mother had hidden from him.  I would really like to say something to my dad about all of this, but I don’t think any good would come from it. He would probably just lie to me, but we haven’t really spoken in almost three years, and I’m not sure if I should bring it up or not.

What do y’all think? Am I being paranoid in believing that my dad just let my mom die? Should I say anything to him? Is there anything else I could do? I just don’t know what to do about it at this point, or even if I should do anything. 

Thanks for reading my ridiculously long post.",01Mar2020,1
436,"  Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked kinda sad/moody about it so idk what to. Then ever since I did that: 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised  and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and in person so she was probably surprised I did something in a bad way :/

2. You need not worry about break ups.(No depression)

3. You need not spend a lot of money on kids.(You earn, you spend money all on yourself)

4. You need not get into fights with your wife.

5. You can enjoy all your income and go to tour all around the world.

6. If you want to have sex, you can hire prostitutes.

7. You need not live 100 years,
you can die at around 50 years. But in those 50 years, you would have enjoyed your life like anything.

448,"I’m 14, a freshman in high school. I met her the start of freshman year and we quickly became close and I started hanging out with her friend group and her. We talked everyday, hung out in and out of school. I have 2 classes with her, but since we have some mutual friends it’s hard to avoid her.

I cut her off February 1st. It’s been a month and it’s driving me kind of crazy? I kind of ghosted her out of no where. 

So, here’s the whole backstory. Her friends bullied me.  Bullied me to the point of almost suicide, and they still do considering we have classes together. I was severely depressed and hurt by their actions and while she never directly said anything, she laughed and accepted their “jokes” towards me and when confronted basically was like “Well I’ve been friends with them a long time, sorry.” and never did anything to change/stick up for me. I know this is some petty teen drama, but it hurt. It really hurt and the final straw was her making fun of me and ditching me at a school dance. Keep in mind I had brought this up 3x before and nothing had changed so I resorted to flat out ignoring her. Another reason for me wanting to cut her off is her laughing at her friends racist jokes towards me and my friend who is black. 

For the first week, it was hell. By the second week I realized how much easier and less stressful life got after cutting off her and her friend group that bullied me. By week three it was hard because I kept thinking I needed to give her a reason/closure and it was hard avoiding her during classes because we sit near each other. So my request for advice is should I talk to her? Give her closure on this? I was thinking about writing a detailed letter or something because I know it’s going to be awkward and I hate physical confrontation about serious shit. Anyways, if you have read this whole thing thank you and I know it’s kind of stupid to be posting it on here because it’s really not that serious. It’s been driving me crazy constantly knowing I’ll never be able to fully let go of this unless I talk with her before but I don’t know how to go about it.",01Mar2020,1

452,"so this guy i was with exclusively for 4 months decided he needed a “break” to figure out his personal issues. me being the nice &amp; understanding person i am, i understood and was willing to give him space. he knew we both were not supposed to be sleeping around on each other. this was easy for me, as i love him (never told him that), only want him &amp; what is best for him, and what will make him happy. we kept in contact, just not a lot. tonight i went to a party at his house. a couple girls i had seen over there before were there and told me their friend had slept with him last week. instantly shocked. he was a sweetheart to me and i trusted him after my 3 year manipulative, emotionally abused relationship with me ex who cheated on me. it was hard for me to trust this new guy, but i did. i approached him in a mature matter and asked if he was sleeping around on me. he denied it and kept asking who told me that. i said it doesn’t matter and i know you’re lying to me because i has heard it from not only that girl but his roommate also told me, and one of my friends who went to high school with him. tonight as i was about to leave i see him in his room with another girl. i had to walk through their room because the stairs lead to that room and i was upstairs. he smiled at me and started spooning her, grabbing her butt, and grabbing at her hips. it hurt. after everything i did for him. like i said, he was going through a lot. still is. there are countless nights where i would hold him in my arms while he cried, sleep next to him when he felt lonely, make him dinner or bring him little things i saw that reminded me of him, gave him my all. he told his friends i was something special and he eventually wanted to make things official. was so loyal to him. still am. i am heartbroken. he was really drunk, but it still really hurt to see him with another girl in his bed after he denied everything i heard and lied to my face. thank you r for making me feel worthless.",01Mar2020,1
453,"I accidentally stumbled upon a thread on twitter by an account that exposes sexual harassers in my country and part of the thread was about my cousin. 

Many girls posted screenshots of conversations with him and confirmed that he harasses girls online (as far as I know no physical harassment). 

I am really shocked and I don’t know what to do or say. His family is religious and you’d think he is also religious by the things he posts, so it really surprised me. 

I don’t know if I should keep this to myself or tell someone. I was thinking about telling my close cousin or my older sister but i’m not sure. Or maybe dming the account who posted the thread and asking them for advice. I obviously can’t tell my mom because she’s going to want to tell her sister (his mom) about it.

458,"I was at a DC restaurant/bar enjoying some beer and appetizers with a friend during what was a busy Saturday afternoon that a soccer match was being played. The seat I’m sitting in is located in the dining room behind a low wall separating a walk way from the dining room so people are standing in this walkway, waiting on rides or to be seated, directly behind me. I lean back in my seat and realize a woman is leaning on this low ledge but is leaning almost entirely into my space and sitting normally in my seat caused me to bump into her which surprised me. I tapped her on the shoulder and said “Excuse me, you’re leaning into my space, just wanted to let you know.” as polite as I could. I’m not looking for an argument or a confrontation I just want to have a good time with my friend. She turns around and replies “are you really that much of a privileged white male that you need this whole space?” and it catches me off guard and it’s obvious she’s had too much to drink and I think ‘Oh jeez, she’s looking for a fight’ and I immediately say “Ok you’re right, I’m wrong. Sorry” and I go back to trying to converse and eat with my friend. She continues to berate me from behind about “white male privilege” and how I’m “so insulted a woman is near me” and all when I just didn’t want her to be using me as whatever wall she’s normally using to support herself after a morning on the bender. She turns to the guy she’s with and goes “he told me to get the fuck out the way” which is quite a bold faced lie. I’m beginning to get very annoyed and that statement causes me to turn around and engage her by saying “That is NOT true. She was almost completely laying on top of me and I wanted it to stop.” Hoping her partner maybe was more sober and would intervene to deescalate the situation. He responds with “What? You expect me to bail you out? You’re in the wrong” which infuriates me but I try to keep my cool “ and I say “How is that the case? I just want her to leave me alone. I’m not looking for an argument” all the while the woman is still berating me about being privileged and insecure and other projections of her own shortcomings. I just keep going “Ok. Alright. You’re right, ok” for another few seconds before they go outside to wait for a ride to go find more people to spread their toxicity with. 

I have never had something happen like this. I was raised to say please, thank you, excuse me like anyone else and the most I know about conflict management for a situation like this is to accept blame and allow the other person to win so it can end as fast as possible. This did not work in this case it only invited further insult. Luckily the man she was with was most likely as trapped as I was with this woman and was t looking for a fight but under different circumstances she would 100% have instigated a physical altercation. *What should I have said or done in order to completely avoid this awful situation?* I don’t ever want a fight or an argument, I just want to be left alone. It stuck with me and my friend for the rest of the night and has really been bothering me. 

This occurred at Bluejacket in DC and our waitress and the management there were so incredibly nice after we informed them about the incident. I highly recommend the place as it is a very nice brewery and restaurant with one of the most delicious spreads my friend and I have tasted, so don’t let this story discourage you from going.",01Mar2020,1

465,"First off, Our asian/american family lives in a asian country (mother is asian)
I have a very alchoholic and abusive father who tries to justify his actions, words through religion (ex. When we were young he would hit me and my brother till we got bruises all over our bodies and if we try to say something against him he would say ""God said honor your father how dare you talk back to me""and hit us more.)
After me and my brother grew older he couldn't control us anymore so he will verbally abuse us by calling us all kinds of bad things and giving us stress about everything and anything.(even one day my brother used listerine in the bathroom and my father smelled alchohol from that and accused my brother of drinking, he still believes to this day that he drank alchohol when it was clear he just used listerine.)
Basically He's one of those parents from r/insaneparents.
This will continue on and on everyday which leaded to my brother's depression.
Once my brother turned 18 he went to the US for college(he could have went to a college in the country we are staying in but he told me he wanted to get away from our father) 
After my brother went to America he got a job to try and pay for his college, but it wasn't enough so he had to rely on our parents for money.
Because of that my father would call his phone 2~3times daily to give him stress about how much my father had to pay for college, and my brother had no choice but to keep answering my father's calls to get support from my parents.
But one day my brother finally got fed up with everything  
And stopped answering my father's calls. My father got so mad he stoppes giving him money and would text my brother daily saying to my brother that ""he's a failure"" and that ""my brother never listens to anything my father says"" and many other bad words that I would not be saying in this post but they are very bad words.
My brother's depression went straight down hill after that, stress from his work, keeping up college classes,student debt, and mostly stress from my father.
It was so bad he had to prescribe some medication for his depression.

This lead to my brother's suicide which made all of us very sad. 
It personally made me very angry at myself that I couldn't do anything for him.
After my brother's death we had to goto America and bring back his body to bury him here.

After this I became secretly very angry at my father because I knew that the main cause of the suicide was him.(sure, it was my brother's decision but it was my father that lead to his depression)

A few months after the funeral my father tried to force me to goto a university major which I wasn't interested in (I wanted to goto a different Uni, major) so of course, I decided that this was my life and I would choose my path. So I told him that I'm going to a different Uni for a major I want.

This made him angry (which was totally expected) and he started calling me all sorts of names. And then he said what made me very angry and violent, He told me that ""your brother killed himself because he never listened to me, guess what's going to happen if you don't listen to me""

I couldn't believe my ears 
He definitely crossed the line, I was so angry that I threw anything and everything on the ground, things like plastic cups, bags, books just everything.(but I made sure to never throw it at the direction of my father)
I was freaking out and everything felt like a nightmare.

While I was doing all that my father called me a ""dumbfuck"" and casually went back to his room and locked the door.
This made me more angry that I grabbed a broom stick (don't ask me why) and started banging at his door.

I guess this made him scared, so he called the police and told them that I (me his own son) has a knife and is trying to kill him(wtf?) 

I heard him call the police from his room so I had to calm down. I went back to my room and called my mother who was at work and told her that my father called the police on me.

I was crying the whole time this was happening.
My mother had no idea what was going on and asked me what was going on, but I was just crying the whole time and repeated that I wanted to die. I was very depressed and sad at this point I just ended the call and cried. 

My mother came home all freaked out, right before the police arrived. She explained to them that it was just a family fight, the police had to check if my father was alright and then they went away.

Right after my police went away I could hear my father calling his friends from his room telling them how I tried to hurt him (which I never tried to) and telling them how much of a asshole I was. 

After this incident (which was 5months ago) I've never spoken to him ever again, I ignored all his calls and texts (which stopped 1month after the incident after my mother told him to stop) and I try not to bump into him even when we live in the same house.

So I was wondering If I was the asshole for throwing stuff, getting angry and banging on his door with a broom stick(which my father for some reason thought it was a knife) 
And if I was the asshole for avoiding him.

Now all of his friends(I come across them at church) thinks I'm some kind of potential murderer who tried to kill his father.


Sorry If this post was too one-sided, and it was mainly me complaining about my father 
But I just had to get this off my chest and I have no one else to talk about this to.


ADD IN: I forgot to mention that my brother and I were homeschooled(basically forced by our father to be homeschooled so he can keep watch on us) our entire life and was never once sent to school, homeschooling isn't very common in our country so we could never really find any other kids we could become friends with. I think this was one of the main reasons me and my brother had depression, we never really had any friends. ( I mean really, we only had like 1or2 friends our entire lives) because of this I never really had proper education except for my brother, he was always read books and was very smart for his age.
My mother always feels guilty that she couldn't send us to school.


Tldr;my father's abuse led to my brother's suicide, after my brother's death me and my father went into a argument, my father said something that upset me and I became violent by throwing stuff on the ground and banging doors, my father called the police on me.",01Mar2020,1
466,"So I’ve had two really good dates with this guy (i think they were good). After the first date, well even on it he  was tipsy and saying he had a really good time and would like to see again.

467,I’m 19 and female and this guy is probably like 50 ish male and i feel like he may be stalking me. It started like 3 or 4 months ago when he came in and gave me a drink and some gummies and I accepted it like the fool I am. I asked why he is giving it to me and he said I’m nice so I accepted (I’m nice to all customers so I just thought it was a nice gesture) then he started coming in every Sunday and giving me the same stuff and I thought it was fine I really didn’t think much of it. I chatted with him sometimes but then got back to my work. Then recently he came in to give me a chocolate heart and I kindly said no because I have a boyfriend and I really don’t care to take it but he kept insisting and insisting. I was at the register so I was just like ugh fine and then he kept saying “put it in your car” and I got really uncomfortable. That day he waited like an extra 30 min just for me to ring him up so I’m kind of getting a little freaked out. He knows what my car looks like and he comes in every single Sunday just to see me. My store manager was right next to me when he kept trying to give me chocolate and I kept saying no in hopes she would help me but she didn’t. I asked her if I could just say she doesn’t allow me to accept anything from customers and she said that is the rule where we work anyway so I’m hoping he can leave me alone today if I say that to him but he always wants to talk and I just want to be left alone but I also don’t want to be rude or cause a huge issue that could put myself at risk.

472,"So I'm not sure what I need more: advice or a space to lay out my thoughts and put them out to the universe in someway. Regardless, I think my mother's husband is being abusive to her and controlling her life. When I say abusive, I don't mean physically, but through financial control and fear (in the sense that when he doesn't get his own way he is incredibly moody and verbally hostile). I blew up today when I heard he stayed out all night leaving her with only a little money that he had 'given' to her and now my mum won't speak to me. 

A little backstory. My mum suffered horrific violence and mental abuse at the hands of my father when I was  growing up, and she developed severe mental health difficulties partly as a result of this and partly due to years of abusing alcohol. At this point in time, she is very vulnerable, she takes strong anti-psychotic meds as well as other meds which leave her spaced out most of the time. She relies on him to take care of her in a lot of ways: cooking, cleaning and encouraging her to do the basics like showering etc. He does do these things most of the time and I'm grateful that she has someone to help her.

My issue with him comes from the fact that he has no respect for her and he seems to be abusing her financially. He recently basically forced her to try and open a joint bank account. At first she said no, then after he wore he down she agreed. They had trouble opening one, so he 'suggested' that she close her own bank account (take out the thousands in savings) and have all of her money paid to his account. She now has no bank card or access to money without his say so. As soon as her money was in her account he splurged on a new garden shed and a run for his dogs. 

He also does not respect her opinion about anything to do with their living arrangements. Before they were married he brought home a dog without asking her first. She struggled to cope with the dog when left alone. Despite this, he brought home another dog..... and then another. One of the dogs died of old age and my mum told him no more dogs. As she cant cope with them on her own. She was left alone with all 3 at one point when he was in hospital and she almost had a mental breakdown. Despite her feelings he's now encouraged the two remaining dogs to mate and plans to keep a puppy from any litter.

I can't stop thinking about this and I drive myself crazy with it. I'm definitely traumatised and overly sensitive about this stuff as a result of my childhood. I keep bringing these red flags up to my mum in the hope that she'll wake up. She just digs her heels and tells me to mind my business. I can't have her in my life knowing this is going on because I really want to hurt him. At the same time if I leave her in this situation I know she'll be only be more vulnerable. I really don't know what to do for the best here. Part of me thinks fuck her, she made her bed and she can lie in it. She was never a good mother to me, and was incredibly abusive to me and my sibling herself. Another part of me feels sick with worry over this situation.

I could use some advise from anyone who's been in a similar situation. Thanks.",01Mar2020,1
473,"So my mom had a pretty emotionally abusive family. Her parents were firm believers in conditional love and liked to compare her and her 3 sisters all they time in front of them. Because of this they are all pretty messed up in their own way. Thankfully my mom had my dad and his family when growing up and they are super loving. My mom is my absolute best friend. She has always been there for me and we are extremely close. Honestly my parents are my two favourite people in the world. I recently moved across the country meaning that I am now super far away from them and it's been really difficult for me. I was recently diagnosed as bipolar which means I have long stretches of depression (to the point of being suicidal) and random manic episodes were I don't make the best decisions. So this move was really difficult cuz I lost my immediate support system. 
Now enter my aunt. She wasn't really a participant in my life from birth until I was about 18. We would get random cards or Christmas presents but I never really knew her  even though I was her only niece because she lived on the other side of the country and she was involved in her own life and honestly wasn't a huge fan of kids.
One summer she randomly helped me get an internship when I was 18 and I lived with her for somewhere around 4 months. We got pretty close during this time and I realized she never had anyone really care about her and show her what unconditional love and support is. She had her flaws, mainly because of her upbringing, but I was determined to show her how family is supposed to act.
The last four years we have gotten closer and she has made a few changes for the better.
Now I live relatively close to her (about 8 hour drive) and we work for the same company so I see her about once a month. In the last year she has started commenting about how unhealthy she thinks my relationship with my mom is and that I should be more independent.
My mom is planning a trip out to see me in march which I am very excited about. (She was here in January with my dad). I found out that she told my aunt to see if we could get together and my aunt straight up told her to cancel the trip, called her a bad mother and told her that she is stifiling my ability to be a real adult (even though I am completely financially independent, have a job working 50+ hours a week and have been living in my own since I went away to college).
My mom was so upset by this she has been crying and depressed for the few days. She told me not to tell anyone she was coming to visit (especially my colleagues) lest it get back to my aunt.
I am incredibly mad about this but also super conflicted for a few reasons. My aunt doesn't get my relationship with my mom because she never had that growing up. She had absolutely no one in her life to show her genuine caring and she has had to fight for everything she has. So on one side I get it but I am also incredibly defensive of my mother. My mom never wants to cause problems with her family even though they treat her like dirt most of the time. It breaks my heart to watch her try so hard for their approval and always come away hurt. She told me not to say anything to my aunt about it and I honestly don't know what to do.
I know my aunt is looking out for me in her own weird way but I want to let her know that she can't decide when my mom comes to visit me, how often or how close I am with her. And she also has no right to call her a bad mother or comment on her parenting style especially cuz she has never had kids nor been apart of most of my life. I don't want to upset my mom any further and even though I am grateful for everything my aunt has done for me the last few years and do love her, when it comes to my mom there would be no question who I would choose.
I honestly have no idea how to handle this situation so any advice would be helpful.
TLDR: My aunt was mean to my mom about how close we are. Mom doesn't want me to say anything. Idk if I should or not cuz it feels like she overstepped her bounds.",01Mar2020,1

475,"Hi everyone,

Firstly, thank you for reading, and possibly replying in advance.

I am new on reddit, I have been lurking around for a while but have made an account just today. I am not entirely sure where to put this, r/advice seemed fitting.

My situation is as follows, dutch male 24 y/o. Cum laude graduate, steady job, started as an intern became senior in no less than 4,5 years. I live in a city 10 minutes from Amsterdam, which is where I commute to for work every day of the workweek if not weekends as well.
To anyone on the outside it would appear as if I have it all figured out; you could not be further from the truth. I am, or rather feel, damaged, defect and down right not fitting in anywhere. I consider myself totally lost, directionless, floating about in the currents of life.. 

What I struggle with the most is my most recent brush with 'love'. Roughly in the spring of last year I met a couple in a bar. The guy asked me what I was having, I bought them both a drink. I had no intentions whatsoever, I was just happy to have talk with someone. We talked most of the night, the woman asked me if I was single. I explained my situation, single, only experience I had was a long distance with a depressed 11 year older woman. This was when I was younger and frisky.. Though very caring at young age already. Long story short I didn't know how to talk to her anymore she felt indifferent about everthing. 
Back to the bar, she proceeded to talk about her daughter, and showing pictures. She rang her daughter and before I knew it I was outside talking to her daughter and exchanging numbers.. 

Days of texting go by, I wanted to meet up; we did. Had a wonderful time, although I thought she had unpolite behaviour to a waitress, but she had served a wrong dish. I will refdr to her as S. (24F).

More dates go by, no physical contact, just hugs. But I am all fine with that, as I am looking for a long time not a good time. 
While dating S, I befriended the couple in the bar, they regularly invited me over S' mother, often made the best meals for me. It felt genuine. 

A couple months go by it is now july of last year, things between S and her mother go sour from time to time. S would ask me ask me to pick her up and drive her to her aunt some hour and a half away to stay for the weekend. 
Her aunt has 3 kids, I took them and S bowling, dinner and to a playground and to the beach on 3 different days over a span of a few weeks. Those kids adore me, and I adore them. 

August last year, S and her mom had a fight, S said domestic abuse was involved. I became protective I had feelings for S and we spoke on the phone for hours. The day after she pleaded for me to pick her up, asking me if she could stay with me for a little while. I happily obliged. I had never taken her to my home. A few days later we are watching a movie, resting my head on her lap, loving my life, working for a future together. Going home to somebody as opposed to being alone for the previous 5 years of my life, having a sense of purpose. I get a call from a number she recognnized as her mothers. She begged me to not pick up eventhough it's in my nature to listen to others people. I felt guilty of declining her call, and she said I need not worry about everyones feelings - adding to that that if I contacted her mother we would be done. I never heard from her mother or boyfriend again during S' stay at my home.

Fast foward 2 months, I wonder if she's been looking for her own place. She had, but no luck as of yet. Offered her to register at my adress and move in, she declined in tears explaining it would be a disgrace and we should be married before she was even supposed to set foot in my house. I loved this girl wholeheartedly, eventhough she never gave me a dime for rent though used utilities and was at home the most; I was and still am OK with that, I think of myself as traditional. It seemed like a small gesture of my love to her for me to offer, I'd get plenty in return, her presence, cooking and she had been doing most of the chores in the house for me. I could never tell anyone she was here, family would dissown etc.

She often gives small cues about not feeling good enough. She knows I want kids in the future and mumbles she will give them to me if she is healthy, I wonder what she means and ask her. She diffuses the situation by replying not all women are gifted with fertility and we should pray we are compatible.

Another month it's her birthday bought expensive necklace, her friends have organized a party for her  she invited me to come. I drove her and 2 friends to said party. She introduced me as a friend to others. I wanted to leave as I was totally exhausted, mind you it is 4 AM. She wanted to stay till the end which was 5, I said I'd stay then. She goes in to argument mode and says she cares to much about me and that I should go home her friend would drive her and she'd stay the night there. I get tired of her telling me to go home and actually went home. She cared so much about me, but the 30 minutes remaining she cared even more about; I guess.
A few days go by and I'm upset about how she nagged me to go home. I start getting suspicious it's been 3 months she doesnt mention her own place or developments thereoff.. I went through her stuff, found Tivicay and some other name which I forgot. (HIV meds) I referral note from the Gp to mental healthcare for ptsd, depression, a small invoice of some overdue payment. I get worried sick. I told her what I did and she got mad for 2 minutes for going through her stuff, she forgave me and I didn't press on about her meds or the reason thereoff, she said she would have told me in good time. 
I felt sick of guilt for doing wbat I had done. 

Things proceed alright, she does chores, and works late shifts in healthcare for elderly. She typically got home when I was asleep. I only see her in the mornings when I wake up for work. I call her oneday, and get a this number is unavailable tone, I asked her what was wrong with the phone. Something with the provider she said, I should call through whatsapp, as that did still work. 

She mentions she's found a place and will be moving out when the previous owner had moved out. I am dreading the day she moves out every day for the remainder of her stay. 

Fast foward to Christmas, she's working both days and can't come with me to my parents. Can confirm she had been working I have seen work slips with autographs for both days as I went through her stuff one more time... I am ridden with guilt. 

She told me she's moving out on first of january... I feel alone.. Dec 30th she's asking if she can borrow money for a trip to her homecountry to see her granddad in Africa, €750,- is what she asked for. I declined as it was the wrong time to ask, over the phone, and she was moving out so soon after.

NYE she's also working, I spend it at home alone, knowing what follows the next day.
1st of January is her she comes home, goes to bed for a nap, packs her belongings. She paused at the door, blessing the home, and carries on. I help her load them in to my car and we drive off to her new place. The landlord drops price tag of her new room, €750,- it doesn't hit me just yet. We go for lunch. Her landlord called he forgot to explain a few things about the house, he asked what we were to one another. S and I pause, you could hear a needle hit the floor, friends she mumbled, again. 5 months you have lived in my home, I have cared for you. I am hurt  once again. Landlord left, she instantly said she had told him no men in the house.. I hugged her one last time, picked my stuff and left, gutted.

The day after I called her mom, met up with her. Ecplained her where her daughter was for the previous 5 months. She was overjoyed until I told her she had left the comfort of my house. 
She had not known where S had been living for the past 5 months. Explained me that she had debts, insurmountable debts. That she had had debt collectors at the door because her daughter had been registered there and this is why they had fights. She had wanted to come clean and tell me who I had been dating when she had called me 5 months ago.

Texted S with my discoveries. In a caring manner tried to get her to talk to me for days. I snapped and told her Id be waiting in front of her door one night, she could either talk to me or never see me again. She replied I had broken her heart by talking to her mom and aunt, saying I was the only one she could trust and how she has no one anymore now. Removed her whatsapp not much later and never heard from her again.

January and February have been horrible, I have been getting take outs or skipped meals all together my house is a mess. I have a psychiatrist whom tries ACT therapy with me, but nothing seems to make my feelings of missing her bearable.

It all looks like she used me, and I seem to be the only one that thinks she is webbed in lies and deceipt with no way out. If she truely had malicious intentions she would've just accepted my offer of registering at my adress and I would have been responsible for the debts as well. She did caring things for me, chores around the house and we have had amazing dates. 

I have no closure and her mother, aunt and nieces and nephews are trying to stay in touch with me. It hurts to be around them, I adore the little kids and don't want to dissapear...  They have not heard or seen her this year yet either. I am sick to my stomach with worries.

Have fantasized about taking my own life for the pain to end, I feel physically sick of missing S... I do not know how to cope. 
I have tried to drive myself up a tree but could not bear the thoughts of my family hurting because if what I would have done. 

I have lost my catalyst and purpose. Everything up untill now has not had the effect I wanted. 
I have achieved many achievements but it is only emptiness when I achieve my goals. 
I do not know my values and can only do things for others... I have lost the will to live because it feels like I am fundamentally defect if someone with so many issues or challenges can leave me like this. 

I am so sorry to be yet another moany millenial.. Please understand that I am not looking for your sympathies although appreciated, I am looking for actionable advice or similar stories with happy endings. I have explained my family what I am going through and they worry for me, I do not want them too. Thus I will commit to fixing myself so they do not have too..

478,"Back story; I have a weird family, a while back I disowned and was disowned by my mother, over the years we now have a business together with her boyfriend/husbands kid. I am meeting her husband in person, someone who's name I am changing my last name to for her.  


She has been talking non-stop about me for years apparently, they think of me as family already, it's been 6-7 months since we started talking again. Things have gone well, she is with her boyfriend/husband since I was 17, and I like him but I am not sure how to react, I am meeting him while he is working and my mother is thousand odd miles on other other side of the country where he is from while me and her are from here on this side. I need advice on meeting new parental father figures? I never really had one so this is new territory here.",01Mar2020,1
480,"I came here a few months earlier to talk about a small issue with my boyfriend and you guys really helped me out.
But now we have a bigger problem. 
I am currently going through a rough situation with my home life and my living situation. So naturally, it’s a lot of stress on me right now. 
My boyfriend by nature is not a sympathetic person. he tries his best for me, but he usually gets frustrated because he’s not sure how to help me. we’ve been working on this, and it’s been getting better. But, a week or so ago i came to him (texting, he was at work) talking about my relationship with my parents and how much is sucked and how i really need to leave. (my mother will not let me get a job, so i need to move out so i can. but i can’t stay with him at his parent’s house and i don’t have anywhere to stay if i want to leave). He, got angry. and frustrated. right from the beginning. so he left me to deal with all of it by myself, because he didn’t want to. 
that day he tried to leave me. 
he tried to leave because it was too much stress for him to deal with. he said he loved me, but he can’t be my boyfriend. so he genuinely broke up with me. during that same conversation i did what i would normally never do, beg. like an idiot i begged him to stay. because i know in my heart that my situation will get better. 
but now things aren’t the same. he says he regrets breaking up, or trying or whatever, and can’t forgive himself for it. he says he won’t leave me and that it was a mistake to try and leave me in the first place. but it’s getting really hard to live with the fact that he tried to break up with me because i was too much, and he didn’t want to handle it. it’s made me really insecure about myself and it’s made it even harder to go to him about my problems.
so, i don’t know what to do. i love him so much and when we’re together everything is great. but i’m so afraid of him leaving now that i cry about it almost every night since it’s happened. i’m hoping it gets better since this fight was super recent. but days go past and it makes me not so sure.",01Mar2020,1

485,"I work retail. I've been with the company for about 6 months now. Up until a month ago, it was going smoothly with the only issue being with incorrect holiday entitlement. Now resolved. 

We're currently short-staffed, and have been so since November. Now another colleague has left and we're even more short-staffed. I have a considerable amount of annual leave to take before the end of March, and I'm concerned that I won't be allowed to take it. If I don't, I won't be paid for it. We're talking a good 300 quid here. I've requested it well in advance, as with all previous days off and I've had no response. 

The other concern is that due to our understaffing, I was told that I might have to work outside my availability. I'm extremely flexible as it is and can work up to 45 hours a week. During an abrupt conversation 2 weeks ago, one manager told me that, ""We're desperate."" followed by a series of questions as to why I can't change my availability. Then stated that, ""I'll be having a meeting with the area manager and if your availability does suit the needs of the business then well you know..."" followed by a shrug. 

Fast forward 2 weeks, I was told to fill out a form of my availability which was overseen and signed. Then another manager said that I might be, ""forced by the area manager formally"" to work outside my availability. Can a company legally do that? I can't help but wonder if I'm being singled out here. I'm available for 45 hours a week, and graciously accept any offer any opportunity for overtime or covering shifts. I don't understand it? Is this a bullying tactic? 

The way it's going, I'm leaving. That way I'll be paid for the holiday leave too as stated in my contract. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

So I wake up this morning, sore and tired after spending all of yesterday packing up loose ends, moving furniture, etc to my daughter on the phone telling me her dad is dropping her off in an hour. Normally I'd be fine with this, he never keeps plans anyway so its expected.

But all I have at the moment is some rice, seasoning, and random condiments. Which was cool when it was just me. I work as a waitress so I pretty much sustain off tips, was planning to pick some things up after work tomorrow, but I'm at a loss as for what to do now. I have like $2 on my debit card and just enough bus passes to get to work and back tomorrow, but that's about it.

Does anyone have some ideas on how to make a few dollars for some emergency groceries? I've tried a few sites for surveys, etc, but the payout for most of them seems to need to reach a certain dollar amount first, or they're just blatantly not legitimate.

I wish we could just be friends that ask how each other's day went or talk about what we've been up to. But we just keep fuckin around and talk shit and it's slowly eating away at me. Sometimes we just chill and have a good wholesome time but the thought of those good times just pushes me down harder when days of banter just bombards the discord call. How can I voice my opinion to my friends without being too much of a dick? Just snapped at one of my friends an hour ago after he pulled a string about how no one wants to play because I went online, which is obviously a joke because most of our group was out because there was a party.

* Taxation
* LGBTQ+ issues
* Disability rights
* Mental health issues
* Privacy vs. security
* The existence of God
* Abortion

...among other heated topics. Now for obvious reasons, I know darn well why its risky to have a debate or dialogue with people about these topics, particularly online, since one, these discussions usually lead to usage of loaded language, trolling, *stirring the pot*, mudslinging, false analogies, etc. I have been more preoccupied with getting my life on track rather than learning about argumentation and worldviews. While I do agree that argumentation and debate is fascinating and can help people know more about the world at hand, at the same time, I need to focus on finishing college, making money, and learning how to manage my life well as an adult.

What I noticed recently is that some of these people are saying things among the lines of ""well, how would you ever know the opposing side's arguments, and how to defend your beliefs if you constantly turn down offers?"". While that is a valid point, at the end of the day, I have lived more than long enough to know that having debates/discussions pertaining to these topics usually doesn't end well, and I don't want to waste my time nor my mental resources on these things ***at this time***. 

I don't want to come off as ""not appreciating diversity of thought"", however, I don't hold that view of disregarding diversity of thought. Rather, I have more important things in my life to focus on and I don't want to squander my resources, and relationships over these topics. **I think that if I don't have the time or energy to debate, then its justified since I don't owe anyone my resources to ""debate"" them.

I'm blessed to be a leap-year baby, so I literally don't even get a real birthday until once every four years. I FINALLY turn 6 after 24 years of life...all my good friends, none of them actually give a shit at all.

I'm sitting here trying to rationalize it all. Is it karma? Is it fate? Is this a dip just before it gets better? What's the deal? I feel like I got cheated dude. The truth is that I've been going through some mental distress in 2019, and haven't seen many of my friends often. It was a rare occasion that anyone bothered to set anything up. Everyone is out doing their own thing, going to school, starting a career, and even getting married.

Where am I at now? I'm 24, but I'm still single, I've gotten fat; last year I used to be super thin and fairly attractive to most women (or gay men) AND now I barely ever talk to anyone. I have a bachelors degree in accounting coupled with a minor in philosophical ethics. I'm musically talented, and I'm fairly intelligent. Many people have told me I'm a good conversationalist. But here I am, the pathetic slob I've become, wasting my life living in a college town with people who are in college, with a degree in my hand and a thumb up my ass, doing nothing but smoking pot, working lyft, working out, or sleeping, none of which are in any particular order but nothing ever ever changes. No exciting adventures, no cool girlfriend, no loads of friends and parties. And it's all because of me. 

I'm making changes to better myself, but I'm still in the process. I'm just wondering, did I really fuck up THAT bad last year that no one could make room for one night at my house? Literally, everyone I asked had told me they were either working, got called into work, or had something the next morning to wake up for. But a week ago they had said that they were going to come. Someone PLEASE tell me, am I just being hysterical for no good reason? Is the Pisces in me truly showing or what? Or do I just have shitty friends? What the honest fuck?

1. Everytime she goes out for dinner or to a party she has the greatest time but comes back and yells at anyone for anything, she full on switches personality! 

2. She constantly thinks everyone is against her, even mentioning a slight issue with something after being promoted for advice say, ""how is the dinner, it is slightly undercooked"" If you answer honestly or if you agree with her, she goes off on a tangeant about how everyone is ungrateful or ""are you saying my food is shit?""

3. Sometimes she's so horrible and cruel to you and she goes to her room, then the next day wakes up and acts like nothing is wrong and that nothing happened yesterday. This happens so often it's the worst! The next day she's so sweet and cheerful?

514,"The three of us live together in an apartment abroad for uni/ work. The two of them are siblings and all three of us have actually spent a lot of time together since we were toddlers so you could say that we are close. Our parents are siblings and our family is really close with each other (the adults tell everything and anything to each other). 

However, I don't think that it's suitable for me to live with them cause our lifestyles and personalities differ so much. For example, they stay up really late (past midnight and sometimes even until 3 AM) watching TV, playing games, etc even though they need to get up early the next day. On the other hand, I sleep quite early and am very sensitive to light and sound, making it hard for me to fall asleep. I have to wear my noise cancelling headphones every night and it makes my ears really sore in the morning. 

They are also very dirty, messy and disorganized people. All my family members know and always scold them about this, even their mother doesn't know why her kids are that messy. I'm a clean freak, cause my parents are clean and organized people so it rubbed off on me since I was young. I always end up cleaning after their mess cause they don't clean up as they go. They are the type that do not care about mess or dirt at all but I'm the type that can't stand even a bit of mess and have to clean it right away or I'll go crazy. I once told one of them to throw away some candy wrapper after eating instead of just letting it sit on the sofa but she yelled at me for being so annoying and telling her what to do.

Another thing that drains me emotionally is that whenever the older one comes home from work, she always has something to complain about, whether it be her day, some car that took her lane, her boss, her coworker or something she found on the internet. I get tired of her complaints so whenever I heard her insert the key to the door, I quickly go into my room and don't bother coming out till it's dinner lol.

They are also kinda close-minded and very judgmental people. One of them doesn't want to watch korean movies just cause the movies are korean. They also always talk shit about people behind their backs and make assumptions about them. I never join their convos cause their words irritate me. I'd rather just stay in my room and listen to my music rather than listen to them gossiping.

Oh and I don't think I can ever move cause my family wants us to stick together. I don't tell my family either cause they tell each other everything and I don't want misunderstandings to occur and make them think that we fought cause we never did. I also don't want my cousins to think that I'm a fake person who acts calm and normal in front of them but is actually really unhappy behind that I have  to 'tell on them' to my family.

Probably partly because of me, next year I have pretty important exams so I made it a point for myself to study hard and not be too distracted by people. I'm also introvert-ish and I don't really know much about how to interact with complete strangers and I'm more comfortable with people I know.

Talking about homework, he's recently been asking me for homework answers. He asked me to send him math homework answers, and I sent him the answers typed out. He asked me for my working. He asked how to brainstorm for an essay, and asked me to send him a picture of how I did it. I asked him why he said he doesn't know the format, but our teacher has already told us there's no set format we just pen our ideas down. He's also done some really annoying things, like drawing a huge heart around my teacher's name on our exercise books which we're going to hand in.

521,"Disclaimer - I don’t know if this is the right place for this.

I find myself at a strange point in my life where I feel like I must actively choose a direction. 

A little context first - I’m 23, moved out of my parents place in 2015, 200 miles down the road to a university, been here 5 years, working on a degree I have no love for. Year 5 is a second attempt at year 4, which I didn’t complete due to mental health issues, which I’m kinda still struggling with. I fear history is about to repeat itself, my dissertation deadline is the end of next month and my word count is 0, I also have two other modules I need to work on. My motivation for academia is next to nothing. I’ve been working part time at a restaurant/nightclub bar for 9 months, a few months ago I was made supervisor but still only working the busy Friday and Saturday night shifts. For the last few years my bank account has been horrified by my student lifestyle, so the 7k or so I’ve earned since starting the bar job has helped my finances out enough to live comfortably - rent on my student accommodation is covered by student loans. My last loan drops in April. 

There was the context, now the ‘conundrum’ (I don’t know how else to describe it, even in my own thoughts) I think I’m going to list them out, kinda like parameters - then organise them.

&amp;#x200B;

* I failed an exam in January, so must resist it in August - if I fail the exam in August I fail the degree.

&amp;#x200B;

* My dissertation is due at the end of April, I’ve had no contact with my school about it so far. 

&amp;#x200B;

* I don’t think I want a career in the field my degree is tailored for. (Pretty fucking sure, actually)

&amp;#x200B;

* I am adamant on not moving back to my parents place / town, it’s a soul destroying backward town.

&amp;#x200B;

* I’ve recently found a passion for cocktails, bartending - but my current job doesn’t offer in much of progress or development. I’m one of the stronger employees there, and would likely be granted more hours if I asked.

&amp;#x200B;

* A good friend / co-worker is keen to move into a flat together in June. 

&amp;#x200B;

* Another good friend is opening up a hotel with a bar in S/E Asia and has offered me a position to run it for her. It will likely be a low paying gig. 

I really don’t know how the next few months are going to pan out, and I feel like the dissertation is a fat blockage to everything, the elephant in the room that I’m refusing to look at because it will make me uncomfortable. My logical mind is telling me that the following is the correct course of action; do the academic work, graduate, go full time at current job. But my overwhelmed, stressed and anxious mind is telling me this; how the fuck are you gonna graduate? You haven’t done any work, you’re unmotivated, you’ve wasted 5 years, imagine what you could’ve done with those years doing something you actually liked.

My situation isn’t actually that bad, I know that, I have options, which many people don’t have. However I can’t stop the worst case scenario rattling around in my head; failing the degree, losing the job, needing to move back to a town I hate, losing control over my life. But really, I haven’t been in control for the last few years, I’ve been riding it on autopilot, going with the flow, and it’s been comfortable. But the autopilot system is about the fail and I can see that - it’s what happened last year and why I botched year 4. So I’m just looking for clarity and control. 

I’m continually pondering my options;

&amp;#x200B;

* I could run away to S/E Asia and change my lifestyle completely while still doing something I love 
* I could commit myself to developing my bartending skills and find a good full time gig somewhere nearby at a place I’d love to work at - it’s a career, and the only field I have any experience in (I’ll also be living with a close friend)
* I could pass my degree, graduate and make my parents proud 
* I could fail, and disappoint my parents and feel like I wasted 5 years
* I could quit university all together and wipe it all away 

What’s glaring about that list? There are no outcomes that are directly effected by anything to do with the degree. Yet, it remains the biggest source of fear and anxiety in my life. Something is off, but I don’t know what - my own internal thought process? My active ignorance that my efforts for my degree are heartless, pointless and negatively impact me? 

I genuinely feel like I’m being swept out by the tide, but I don’t want to be.

I have a part of my mind that’s beating up the other part saying ‘why are you wasting time writing hundreds of words on a reddit post when you could be doing something productive.’ But I’m just feeling stuck - maybe I already know the right path and I just need some stranger to take a look at my situation, call it out for what it is and tell it to me straight.

If anyone has had similar experiences or any advice - I’d like to hear.

Apologies if this post seems wishy washy.

tldr; I want to take control fo my life and move in the right direction, but I don’t know what direction that is, or even truly what I want. Quit university after 5 years? Commit to a bartending career? Change everything up and start fresh?",01Mar2020,1
522," 

So, I'm not really sure where to start because I like to think of myself as quite an open person but this one thing I just never talk to anyone about but I'll try my best now.

My parents recently got a divorce, it was for the best I think all they ever did was fight and it makes me feel a feeling that I can't explain, which is annoying because I can usually figure out my emotions really well. Whenever they'd fight I would always be on my mums side and never on my dad's.

Back to my point, I've not had the best relationship with my dad since as far back as I can remember. I can never pin-point why I don't like him though. Since they got the divorce my dad has moved out and he now lives by himself in a small apartment while my mum, my younger brother and I stayed in our house. Long story short I don't see him very often but when I do it's just so awkward.

There's some weird tension and I don't know what it is but he tries to be so nice and I can't help but push him away and just feel so awkward. I act really cold towards him and I don't know what to do. In my mind I like to think I'm almost scared of him because he used to beat me but this was ages ago and we've moved on from that so I don't think that's what it is.  
I just don't know what to do. I have no clue.",01Mar2020,1
523,"Man...I don’t even know where to start...

Let me just begin by saying currently I’m a M 19 years old and am 6’4 195 with a 32 inch vertical so mildly athletic. I’ve been playing basketball all my life with a goal of earning a division 1 scholarship and getting a free education. Now that goal seems like a dream... my middle school career was pretty good I was considered a top recruit in my class. High school came and the first 2 years were terrible, I had some petty injuries but most importantly 2 weak coaches. I barely got in the game because of being an underclassmen despite being better than some of the seniors. Both coaches got fired even though our records were good that season... I think that says a lot as to how bad they were.

Last year was my first real opportunity at playing in high School for a coach that believed in me. I had interest from Columbia &amp; Brown University and some Cal state schools. I avg’d around 13 pts a game and had a decent season until I had a fracture and had to miss the rest of the season and lost interest from those colleges.

This season my family thought it would be a great opportunity for me to go to prep school for my senior season and get more exposure since now I was only being recruited by a D3 school. So now they spend all this money and I come halfway across the country because a coach has made all these promises to my family and I how he can get me division 1 offers and make me a better player...just to sit on the bench and hardly play. So now my senior season is over and ruined, I still have the option to go d3 but that costs money or maybe Junior college for 2 years which is free. 

Ultimately, the coach not only lied to me, but he promised all of my teammates similar things and really only helped 2 of them get scholarships when they already had some before here and didn’t help anyone else. 

Honestly I am devastated and feel terrible, I see all of my childhood friends committed and going to play at division 1 schools on scholarship. While I am stuck here being told by a coach who lied to me, and is now saying I’m only a D3 kid. Which I know isn’t true because I had division 1 schools on me before. I don’t want to let this situation define me. 

I know this isn’t the end of the world but right now I feel terrible and am really struggling to stay positive throughout this situation. 

There are a lot more problems than I am letting on but that’s the summary...

I was like?????

In my opinion, I don’t think that makes sense. People are attracted to what they are attracted to. As a cis straight woman, if I decide to date a man who I later find out does not have a penis, I would be turned off. Sex is an important part of the relationship for me and if I don’t get what I initially expected, I don’t think it’s wrong to end the relationship. For example, It’s like dating an asexual person. If I have a high sex drive and my partner doesn’t have any at all, that’s fine. We are just simply incompatible and it would be wise to stop dating. I have nothing against trans people and I support them. I think they are men and women but the way people are saying things like that, it’s crazy. 

It shouldn’t be forced on someone.

BLUF: I've come to an esteemed forum for the advice and opinions of slightly anonymous strangers on the internet to help weigh in on my decision of whether or not go get a second pupper.

For some background, I currently have a 13 month old doggo that I've had since she was very smol (puppo pics upon request). I like to think that for my first doge, I've raised her very well. I'm not really big on teaching a ton of tricks, I like her to be free thinking. She knows the basics, but I don't pressure her to do anything out of her way. She's still growing, but is currently medium sized and 54lbs. 
I live on post with one roommate, and we're both working the same job in different departments. I'm injured, but finally getting necessary treatment so hopefully I won't be broken much longer, but this means that I'll be able to go out to the field more when I'm healed. Or if the treatment takes too long, that I'll be looking for another job in a while.
My pupperino is very good at keeping herself entertained while I'm at work (or she'll nap/stare out of the window till I get back and we head outside). She's very people and dog-friendly.
My SO has a dog and the two of them get along very well, but my SO doesn't think that I should get another pupperoon for a while. I'm just wondering if adopting another pupperoni would be a good idea. I have the means to take care of two, and if I do end up losing my job for medical reasons, it'd be easier to move along to a new job and environment with a second doggoon if it already has some training. Of course not having the second doggeroon would be easier, but I don't have all the questions, that's why I'm here.

One is in the Air Force, which I'm not against, but he says some pretty racist, homophobic, and tone deaf stuff on social. Plus, it turns out his fiance left him, and when I asked his brother what happened, he said ""he has anger problems. A lot of them. I'll leave it there.""
Another is a drug addict who tries to sell what are obviously stolen pets online.
Another got divorced recently because she cheated on her husband with a porn actor.
Another is constantly posting racist and gross memes on Facebook, and reposts InfoWars garbage all the time. Conspiracy theories, white nationalist rhetoric, you name it.
Another is just straight up in prison and I can't find out why. 

I was able to find one normal person among the seven people I hung out with in high school. She's an insurance agent and she goes to school part time for nursing. She has a great boyfriend, their dog is cute, they recently went to the Grand Canyon, and so on. It was nice to see. 
I shot her a message, telling her it was nice finding her profile and seeing how good life seems to be going. I casually dropped that I'd checked up on the others as well and she says ""oh yeah, I cut them off a long time ago. After I found out about X I looked into the others and it's just a shit show.""

I'm not on any social media besides reddit anymore, so I felt disconnected from all the people I grew up with. But now, I'm kind of glad I logged off for good and went on with life. 

I need advice, though. I feel like the company you keep says a lot about you. Knowing now that my high school friend group is a disaster now kind of makes me feel like maybe I fucked up somehow, too? I'm not anywhere close to perfect. I'm three months or so removed from a suicide attempt, I hate my job, my current relationship isn't really seeing traction, and I routinely feel like I just hate myself and I want to die. Am I a failure? Are my past friends a reflection of who I was/am? Should I be worried about my trajectory after seeing how they turned out?",01Mar2020,1
545,"I(20m) recently went through some really tough times and made some mistakes on my own. I was in college and paid for my own apartment about 15 miles away from where my parents live. Now, I no longer go to college and I live with my parents again. I went to church a few times after I moved back home because I was a broken person at the time, and honestly was at a point where I didn’t know what I believed. Now though, practicing Christianity doesn’t make me feel anything. I tried reading and praying, but it gives me no peace or will to practice the religion. My parents want me to be in the church anytime the doors are open, and I’ve been resistant toward it. I told them I don’t believe and I don’t want to go, but they still say “what do you have better to do?” or “It’ll get your out of the house.” I know if I go I’m not doing it for me, and I feel like that’s all the wrong reasons anyways.",01Mar2020,1
546,"hello guys, i need your advice, im facing the ""devil tells me do it , angel tells me dont situations"" !

 so i live with a room-mate, he is also my personal friend.  me and him move to virginia a year ago, and rented an apartment, but back then i was broke and had no money, so he paid the rent and security deposit for me, but i did maneged to pay him back through time. each month i gave him 700$ for my share of the rent, and i never missed it, always on time, and he collect it then pay the rent. the rent is 2000 (there is another person live with us, he also pays 700). 

now fast forward to 5 month ago, somewhere around September [2019.one](https://2019.one) day he told me because of his personal problem, he didnt have enough money to cover the rent, so he asked me to lend him 2000$ cuz he knows im in a good finance status. i gave him out of trust, and he swore to give me back next year. but along the time i never felt nor he give me any sign of paying me back. until a month  ago, our building administration told us to move to another apartment due to renovation. and so we did. after we moved, one day i saw a check in my mailbox. that is the refund of the security deposit for the old apt, it has 1500$. and now im thinking i should just keep the money to myself knowing that he will never pay me back what he owned. but on the other hand i feel this is a bad idea. cuz this refund is technically his, since i didnt pay security deposit when we moved in(but i did pay my share few months after ).  i really want my 2000 back, cuz i really need that money. but i know that guy, he will keep the check for himself and come with a speech. hes really good at brain-washing people. so now i dont know i should just cash the check myself or be honest with him, and chances are he wont let me keep it, then i would never trust him again. right now im battling with myself, and he doesnt know anythin about this check yet. what should i do ?",01Mar2020,1
547,"I signed up for a weight lifting coach about 9 months ago. I'm a pretty serious lifter, but I wanted programming (training routines) and somebody to help me improve my form to optimize progress and not hurt myself.

At first it went great, we had 3 hour long sessions and my form went up quite a bit. After that we moved to model where I would upload videos of my lifts and my coach would send me lifting programs. Unfortunately, he is always late getting me updates so I will go weeks without hearing from him. I'll run out of things to work on for weeks and he has only ever looked at one video I've uploaded in 9 months. He gave that a one line comment that essentially said ""looking good.""

I ran out of my latest program two weeks ago even though I had sent him an email asking if he could get me something soon. I ran into him a few days after that email and he acknowledged that he needed to reply.

548,"First, let me start by saying this is my first time making a post on Reddit since I created an account, so all I ask is please tread lightly because I'm kinda nervous. Social anxiety, even over the internet, sucks. I would genuinely appreciate it, I'm just looking for guidance. 

I decided to make a post because I don't feel comfortable talking to my parents about life and my girlfriend and friends have said as much as they could with what they know, so now I'm turning to outside sources to see if I can get different insights. 

I don't even know where to begin because my mind is a garbled mess, but to put it simply, I've been feeling stuck for months. I'm about to turn 27 in a couple months and I'm in a place in life where I feel I have to choose between two options because the clock is ticking.

1. I either can stick to my current course as a helping professional (I am a behavioral therapist for children diagnosed with autism) where I can pursue a masters and triple my income. 

Or 

2. I can change paths to something completely different in a trade and make way more without having to go back to school, but it would mean I'm giving up on my passion. 

Little backstory, I've been in the helping field for 5+ years, it's what my bachelors is in, but I have experienced a run of misfortune since entering this profession. 

After I graduated with my bachelors, it took me a year to get a job in my field, when I finally got one, I was desperate for anything, so I accepted the first offer. Unfortunately the company, (CJAB) I accepted the offer from was as desperate as me and I could tell this was the case as soon as I met my colleagues and saw the building I was working in. This place was ratchet. For the first time since I started working when I was 16, I was harassed by a coworker who threatened me in front of all our clients in public, the company was also understaffed and was run unethically from top to bottom, so I quickly began looking for a new job while gaining experience as a mental health counselor with CJAB.

Eventually, I landed a job at one of the flagship mental health companies in my area (Compasiòn), and while this company was better, I could tell after some time that there were similar unethical problems going on as there were at CJAB. They were very shady. They kept info from the employees and there were instances when we were not paid on time. This company was more about paperwork and profit making then they were about providing quality services for the clients. I stayed there for a year, but towards the end there were rumors going around from the staff that the company was going under because of the payroll and unethical issues. Well, the rumors were true. I tried to stick it out with the hope that things would turn around, but I made a mistake in staying because the company was audited and ended up getting shut down, so everyone was laid off. 

Luckily, a parent company (AIM), who worked in the same school as my colleagues and I did with Compasión, heard about the layoffs and within 3 days, I was picked up by them. They were able to see my work ethic because Compasión and AIM often shared feedback and we also worked right next door to each other in the school. BUT there was more bad news to come…. This company was even worse than Compasión and wound up getting shut down too within 2 months. Everyone was laid off, so I was laid off twice in 3 months. I collected unemployment for a couple weeks until I decided to just apply to any old job available to make up for lost income. I took a job at a pizza place and worked as a delivery driver for about a month and a half. 

FINALLY, after searching and searching for another job and deciding that I wanted to try something else in my field other than mental health because I didn't trust the companies, an old college friend reached out to me about becoming a behavioral therapist. I asked her a ton of questions and did my own research about the company because I was so paranoid about my job security. The company was solid and I learned they were going corporate, which meant they were growing. My friend told me before I was hired that the job was salaried and I would be making more than I ever had at my previous companies with benefits as well. I was super excited and thought, ""I'm finally going to earn what I deserve after facing over a year of adversity"". The only part I was nervous about was learning something new because behavioral therapy and mental health counseling are a little different, but I ended up learning it quickly and have been performing great. 

Present day and I'm disappointed once again. Of course as soon as I was hired they changed the payroll structure from salaried to hourly and at the time I was like, okay no biggie, I'm still going to be working 40hrs a week and making more than I ever had before...WRONG. I was completely mistaken. What I didn't know about the job before accepting was that my hours are contingent upon how many clients I work with. 

So yeah when I started, I was working nearly 40hrs a week, but once I started getting clients discharged from my caseload, I wasn't getting new clients added to replenish those hours for weeks or months at a time. Not only that, but I was under the assumption when I was hired that I was going to be making over at least 1K a paycheck every two weeks, but nope. I've only reached 1K once since I started in July of 2019 and that is mainly due to client cancellations. When a client cancels, you don't get paid and you only get paid when you are working directly with clients in their homes. I made more as a mental health counselor at those shitty companies making less hourly, but because I worked 40hrs a week, I made over 1K every check.

Recently, I was informed I would be getting a new client with 10hrs added to my schedule a week and I was regaining some hope but just a couple days ago, that hope was lost because I was told the client's schedule is not compatible with mine so now who the fuck knows how long I will have to wait again until I get a new client and it had been nearly 2 months before they contacted me about that one. 

I am just so entirely fed up and it seems I cannot catch a break. I have been living paycheck to paycheck for a while now. I have no wiggle room to even get my car washed, buy my girlfriend a birthday gift, or anything like that. I get to watch my savings slowly dwindle as I continuously pull money from it to pay bills and my credit card bill go up. 

I have a job opportunity that was offered by my best friend to learn a trade where I would easily be working 40hrs a week, using a company car (instead of my own to go to client's houses), making bonuses, having benefits, and a nice hourly rate, but the big kicker is I would be giving up on my passion to help kids and I have no idea if I would be happy or miserable in a trade job. I love what I do now and honestly this company is the best I've ever worked for in terms of team camaraderie, support, and understanding. I can be upfront with my supervisor and tell her I need a mental health day without her giving me a hard time or making me feel weak (this job has a very high turnover rate because of burnout). I also hadn't had a job where I hung out with coworkers outside of work since I was a teen, so I have that too, plus I am very good at this job, but the hours… 

I'm considering having a face to face meeting with the clinical director to basically say, hey, I absolutely love this company and I'm considering going back to school to expand my role, but that consideration is vastly diminishing because I cannot afford to live. I would reconsider if I am quickly given a new client or given a pay raise. And I can make a case for a pay raise even though I haven't been there for a year yet. I have my reservations though about talking to my boss about this because I think presenting an ultimatum to your boss looks really bad. 

I just don't know what to do anymore. I even thought about starting my own business by making an app or a website because I am so sick of being a slave to other companies, but once I figured out my idea was taken, I gave up on it and frankly, I don't want to put in extra time doing more work on the side of what I already do, which is extremely mentally taxing. 

If I get a masters and pass the state test to get licensed, I would become a supervisor and my company would promote me. I could make upwards of 70K a year right after school, and that's pretty damn good in the helping field, which is highly underappreciated. That's about 3yrs from now though and there's something that is making me hesitate every time I revisit this option and I think it's the fact that I don't want to spend thousands for a raise. 

So sorry for the length of this, but I really wanted to paint the right picture so that everyone knows what's truly going on. ",01Mar2020,1
551,"I brought it up with the teacher thinking it was a simple mistake.  She directed us all during orientation (parents and kids there) to the Instagram she uses for to put pictures of the books she recommends on there.  She has just randomly in all these books a pic of her in a swimsuit (can’t remember if it was bikini or one piece but she had great tits sticking out the top I remember) so I brought it up later, privately, and she said no, we shouldn’t be ashamed of our bodies and she didn’t see anything wrong with it.  Yea bodies are fine but I told her she puts up a photo like this and ends up in every kids dads spank bank it’s a problem.   Kids know how to use a printer and save the photo and poster size it.  Sorry seems creepy to me that she wants her students and parents to have this.  Was I out of line? I know I was vulgar but If she thinks everyone’s mature enough to handle seeing their teacher half naked than she should have been adult enough to handle the word spank bank.  Now I’m banned from the school even though I was very nice about it and just thought maybe she was so dense that she didn’t see why teachers don’t put their vacation swimsuit pics on an Instagram she directed everyone to....how do I approach this with the principal now that I’m being told I’m banned (I’d like to go see my kid perform there)... I’m not being all old fashion saying we shouldn’t see bodies I just don’t think it’s appropriate to shove right in their faces.  Have it on your own personal shit not the one where students and parents are both gazing...",01Mar2020,1
552,"&amp;#x200B;

For some background: my older sister (23F) has aspergers, but wasn't diagnosed until we were both adults. I'm a year younger than her, so my parents held her back a grade so we'd be in the same class. They wanted me to ""help"" her.

&amp;#x200B;

My Dad didn't believe in Autism or Mental Health back then, so she never got help. My older sister abused me in some pretty horrific ways, to the point where my grandparents let me stay with them in the mountains for a few weeks one summer ""for my health"" - after my grandfather witnessed my sister trying to break my kneecaps by jumping on them. She began abusing our classmates when the teachers weren't looking. Her only friends are online friends even to this day. 

&amp;#x200B;

I had to share everything with her so she wouldn't feel ""left out"". My birthday. My sleepovers. Field trips. I always had to bring her along because my parents didn't seem to realize that I needed my own social circle away from her. 

Fast forward fifteen years. I'm 22 and set to graduate next year. I have a job lined up that I'm very excited about. 

My sister won't stop complaining about this. My sister never went to college after we graduated *(she nearly ruined my graduation, too)*She never learned to drive, and when we ask her about it she makes excuses. ""It's too hard."" ""The internet won't load, etc."" We live way out in the sticks so not having a driver's license is a bad thing. 

Whenever I talk about the city I'll be living in, the same city my parents will be moving to, she starts complaining about ""liberals"" and how the crime must be incredibly high and how we'll all die for sure and regret ""not listening to her logic"". 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a written contract with my parents; we have agreed that I'll stay with them in their house throughout college and once I find a job and move to the big city up north, I'll help them move up there and get settled. They want to retire near the rest of our family there. I want to live closer to my cousins.

&amp;#x200B;

This is where things get scratchy. My sister is digging in her heels and refusing to go into the programs her doctor recommended. While my Dad had some backward views of mental health years ago, her diagnosis showed everything in a new light. My mother has apologized for making me basically raise my older sister. My sister refuses therapy. She refuses group clubs and organizations intended for special-need adults. 

I get it? It's her life. 

However. 

My parents have started asking if my Older sister will have a room in my apartment while they're settling their retirement things. 

I spent so much of my life raising my own sister, getting in trouble for her misbehavior, and being physically and mentally abused by her  that I have no love in my heart for her. I get it. She's special-needs and got fucked over. Well, so did I. Even to this day my parents don't call her out when she's hurting me or my younger sisters. They don't want her to scream at them.

She recently had a tantrum so bad she started threatening to ""grab a shoveL"" and start killing our pets because the internet wasn't working. My younger sisters locked themselves in my room with the pets, because at the time I was with my mother at the hospital while she was at an appointment. My younger sisters and I wanted to call the police, but my Dad got on our case about ""bickering"" with each other and ""Starting fights"" .

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the thing. I will never allow my sister a place in my home. I will help take care of my parents, and I will assist my younger sisters when they start college, but I will never raise a finger to help my older sister. 

I've been in therapy for a few months to address the anxiety and depression stemming from my sister's treatment towards me, and my therapist advised that I have a ""*""Come to Jesus""""* talk with my parents regarding my sister and how I feel about my own personal safety and the safety of my sisters.

&amp;#x200B;

563,"Back story a bit, I'm male 17, on October 2019 a girl proposed to me. I appreciated her feelings to me but I genuinely do not have feelings to her. So I believe I have made a mistake when I denied her (I didn't want to hurt her feelings so). The way I deny her is by saying I don't think I would be a good partner as I don't have interest in her(I didn't say this) as well as I wouldn't be a good enough partner, so I just wanted to be friends (But I didn't say this too). She and I have a lot of things in common, too many I believe (I can read her thoughts from time to time and vice versa), she would be a good ""Soul mate"" tbh (I said this but she said she wanted to be more than that once). 

Back to the present, I now figured out that she might misunderstood me when I denied her so she's been treating me like her partner (without my acknowledgement), we've been hanging out, chatting, do things like that but I didn't realize that before. 

I now want to tell her the truth without hurting her feelings or things like that as our relationship has gone through a very long time and I would feel like a dick if I just straight up never tell her.

574,"I (F21) will be graduating with my bachelors degree soon. I currently work full time and make $16/hour. Based off of available jobs I’ve seen I can hope to make ~$20/hr upon graduating. I want to move out, but the price for a decent apartment, in a decent neighborhood, in the state that I live in is usually $800 and up. I feel like for that type of monthly payment I could be paying a mortgage for a house. However, I’m not sure if I’m ready for the responsibility of a house. There are co-ops that have cheaper rent, but the membership fee is around $4,000 to enter (which could be but toward a house). I’m kind of stuck on what I should do and would appreciate any advice. Thanks in advance.",01Mar2020,1
575,"TLDR: Friend often say things that hurt my feelings and ego, and I kinda had enough of it despite of her having helped me a bunch. She doesn't have a lot of friends other than me. Is it wrong to leave her? What should I do?

So this friend L (27F) has helped me (24M) through a rough patch (depression and suicidality) and kickstarted a really positive change in my life - she helped me email the office of a psychology clinic and that of a psychiatrist so that I would begin therapy. I remember vividly this one time I was just crying on the floor at home, for no apparent reason, just some depression casually welling up, and L came to visit me and comfort me.

It's not one sided of course, I am often there for her when she needed someone to talk to/company/help. We were even sober buddies (alcohol) for a little while coz we trust to keep each other accountable. And we say I love you to each other too! And that was a genuine sentiment, at least until recently.

I believe that L is a kind person, but often times she's not very nice. She could also be quite judgmental when it comes to social justice, animal rights, or really just any topic that she has an opinion on. She's pretty opinionated, I've learned.

Some examples (Sorry in advance for details that might be petty or trivial):

\- I used to say that I really like Ariana Grande's music in front of L, and she would say things like ""She's such a hypocrit, pretending to be woke and then singing at Coachella and would queer-bait. No one needs her slurred diction singing anyways"". I never really said anything back.

\- Just on a random conversation I mentioned to L that I wasn't using condoms with people, and she gave me a massive scolding saying that I am liable for increasing the risk of my sexual partners getting STDs before I calmed her down and told her about my thorough sexual health and consent discussions with these partners. She apologized for yelling afterwards.

\- There's this lady N with her guide dog that visits the university queer space often. N is a bit intrusive and often dominates conversations in the social space. I told L in private that sometimes I almost care about the welfare of the dog more than I do about N's, in the context of me having washed N's dog because her disability carer is really shit and the dog was really starting to smell and have skin conditions. (Am I horrible for for feeling that way?) I got a scolding that that's a really awful thing to think and I should be ashamed that I don't care about her as a person.

\- I was at her house and she showed me her freezer. I saw that it had no food and suggested ""Oh next time you're doing groceries just get some frozen veg, they're like cheat code for adding veg to your diet"" (I intriduced her to veganism and she was saying how she struggles with food prep sometimes) The next day she said that comment made her really uncomfortable, said I am so privileged that I didn't realize she had no food coz she had no money. I apologized, and she said someone like me who has Mommy and Daddy's financial help wouldn't understand, and that she's definitely better than I am at budgeting and controling her finances because she's grown up poor. (A 1kg pack of frozen veg costs 1.5 AUD where I live)

\- Most recently, she messaged to tell me that she needs to bug bomb her house and be away from the house for 2 hours. So I suggested we go see a movie coz I got 2 free tickets.  
 While we hung out we talked about current affairs and I happen to say something about our government and commented on how anarchism could work hypothetically (thus ditching the government). Without entertaining me sharing my full thought she said it's stupid and incredibly naive. I tried to explain my hypotheitical position but something came on screen and she just talked about that over my attempt to explain, I felt shut down. I fell silent, and tried to ignore it until after the movie. That's the instance that I felt the most unheard in our friendship. I brought it up later, and she apologized for using the word ""stupid"".

There are a lot of other instances like this, though I've always been told I'm a sensitive person. I've felt like this for some time, and always tried to ignore it until that final recent exmaple, because of the good things L's done for me, and that I'm one of her very few friends. L's complained about having a limited social circle, that nobody seems to stay in her life, and feeling lonely.

I feel really bad, as if now that I'm emotionally and mentally a bit more sorted I'm ditching her. Most of the time she ends up apologizing if I bring it up, but 2 out of 3 times I hang out with her I end up feeling pricked here or there.

Is it wrong to distance her or straight up end this friendship? Otherwise, what should I do?",01Mar2020,1

578,"I’m second month into a 6 month contract. Ad said that the place would suit young people wanting to go out a lot and things. Well who does the landlord bring in. A near 50 year old man who has kids who are in their 30’s. Now this roommate is getting too close to comfort. He asked me if he could come out with me and my friends one Saturday. I said no and he shut him self in his room and didn’t speak to me again that night 😂then every time he comes in the house he’s shouting “hi babe”. Then THIS MORNING because I told him I was going to circuits early he knocks on my door to wake me up to remind me I’ve got the gym (when I already fkn know!) how do I get out of this contract.

580,"I’m about to turn 24. I work 5 days a week, short shifts as a server / bartender at a nice-ish restaurant in a yuppy part of town. I make enough to take care of myself and not worry, I’m able to save money too

Lately I’ve been feeling pretty shitty about what I’ve done with my life so far. I didn’t get to get out a lot when I was a teen so the past 3 years of independence have been full of partying and fucking off. But as I care less about partying I begin to consider how I haven’t really done anything meaningful with my time 

Eventually I would like to have a partner and maaaaaybe kids (if the US doesnt fall over and we’re all still alive in ten years) but I feel like nobody is going to take me. I don’t have the most exciting lifestyle, I am not the most exciting funny individual and I work serving food and drinks. A lot of the guys in my city come from wealthy families (I moved here from a poor midwestern town) and are becoming producers / doctors / engineers. I consider the competition and I feel like I am the least of options and I ask myself why any of the girls I’m interested in would sustain a relationship with me and I can’t think of anything. I feel pretty invaluable and I don’t know what to do now 

I’ve been having a lot of rash thoughts moving ahead. While I’ve come a long way I struggle socially, I’m pretty introverted and I feel like I’ve proved to myself on nearly 100 different occasions that most women don’t want shit to do with me and most only give me a chance because I’m really good looking 

What the fuck do I do? I keep telling myself that if I can’t improve or figure something out by the time I’m 25 I’ll just kill my self. I’ve struggled with self harm in the past and I don’t wanna go back to that but I’ve been crossing that threshold recently. 

I just want some sort of meaning, or purpose or somebody that will accept me and my lack of charisma and not leave me for the next best thing",01Mar2020,1
581,"Hi 18f I went on vacation a couple of months ago and my brother met a girl on this trip, they hit off and the whole trip he spent it with her and not us. I dont know why but it made me extremely upset. I dont have a girl in the family so whenever he dates someone i get close to her and she becomes like a sister to me. His last gf was awesome it was like having a sister i never had but then they broke up and it felt like i was going through a break up. I want him to be happy but he always breaks girls hearts and its weird im not scared of him getting hurt but im scared for the girl who is going to be with him. The girl he met on vacation lives in the same area as us and shes really nice. I dont know what to think anymore.",01Mar2020,1
582,"This is probably the dumbest thing you’ve ever read and I know that there is probably only one correct answer, but I really do want a new opinion on this situation. Basically, Ive been talking to this guy I met off of Tinder for a little while and we’ve been on one date. That one date went extremely well. I’ve truly never felt chemistry like I did that night and I definitely developed an intense infatuation for him. 

We planned on seeing each other again the next weekend (he’s stationed at a military base near me but comes to my city some weekends). We were going to hang out on Saturday and just explore the city, but Friday night he called me and asked if I maybe wanted to come down to the base for the night. We went back and forth for a bit since I dont have my car on my campus and the uber was around $100-$300 (surge pricing). He said he’d py for the uber and we could hang out in his city the next day too. Dumb me said sure after some consideration and the first uber was supposed to be $100. That one cancelled and he called another, I didnt see the price for this one.

The uber was around a 2 hour drive and I called him when I was 20 min out because obviously you cant just roll into a base. I know it was dumb of me to agree to even come, but maybe Im a hopeless romantic. He didnt answer then and didnt answer for the next like, 45 mins. Mind you, it’s maybe 2 in the morning at this point and Im stuck in an uber 2 hours from my place. My uber driver agreed to just take me back to my city for a reduced price since it was doubtful anyone would be there to pick me up within the next few hours.

So I get home and basically just text him that this whole thing really hurt my feelings and I dont know if it’s some kind of joke or something but it sucks. He texts back a few hours later and I find out that he was drunk out of his mind when he invited me and also has PTSD (yeah wtf) and is an alcoholic. He said if I was willing, he’d come up and see me in my city, I said sure, fine, I want a real date and you owe me. Turns out, surge pricing hit when he ordered the second uber and it was $300 and he’s out of money. Im pissed, I go off on him, tell him he’s irresponsible, yada yada yada.

Here is where Im conflicted. I do really like this person. We connected really well and have similar interests/goals. He was extremely apologetic, has promised to pay me back and I honestly kind of pushed him to try to compromise with me on still talking because he felt it would be irresponsible to keep talking to me after all this. I’ve asked if he just wants sex in this, and he’s said no. I dont think I could form a longstanding relationship because of his problems, but I havent enjoyed being with someone so much in a while. However, I also think Im being young and naive. Should I give him another chance just to see if we could even just be FWB? Or am I being stupid here. Sorry for the long windedness of this and congrats for making it to the end.

TL;DR
Guy stands me up in the worst way possible but it very apologetic and I still want to pursue something with him. Should I go with the flow and give it a shot or leave it where it is now?",01Mar2020,1

584,"Okay, I screwed up. I am a pretty nice person, met someone in a entry level class last year, and responded to his conversation attempts with nice stuff. Eventually, we’d go behind the school and talk for an hour or two about stuff, because he was knowledgeable. Next semester, he’d always chat up the guys in my academic program, and when I mentioned how long he talks to someone in my class who was older, they said, “ahh, you’re not obligated to talk to him.” Well, me and the man had exchanged numbers, since he liked asking me things about industry I was in and the school program. 

He’d text every so often, every few months. And then eventually it got to be hundred or two hundred texts everyday, talking about how feminists sucked (I actually agree with Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminists on classical feminist points), to talking about MGTOW (don’t even get me started on my poor beliefs in this cause), to talking about the field and industry I’m in. Well, fast forward a couple months of me talking about philosophy with him, he starts saying I’m a sociopath and that I need to get help. Then he also starts saying I said I sucked dick for coke, which I never did. I’m not a drug addict and anything I have done has been really infrequent, besides alcohol in college.

I don’t think he’ll ever get into my field, given his timeline for graduating and the fact that he’ll socially isolate himself, but I am worried about these ideas he’s formed about me. He talks nonstop to anyone that’ll listen and I’m worried he might seriously make me out to be some sick twisted degenerate. He thinks he’s obligated to kill me, should I ever run for a public office or do anything he deems sociopathic. And keep in mind, he just thinks watching porn sometimes and confining the time I spend with my kids to weekday dinners and weekends is sociopathic. Like I’m a pretty levelheaded, perhaps too nice of a guy, and I am getting kind of aggravated with these accusations.

I know he’s now certifiably crazy, but I’m wondering how to peacefully disengage and what to do. If he applies to work at my company, is it okay to just tell HR he is nuts? I don’t want someone who has a loud mouth like that and a penchant for extremism bad mouthing me.",01Mar2020,1

587,"Today, I received a call from my nephew. He and I don’t really talk so I was quite surprised. I took the call because I figured that he wouldn’t call if it wasn’t important. 
He called to ask for advice, he’s pretty lost right now and he doesn’t know what to do. He just separated from his girlfriend (who just terminated her pregnancy). He doesn’t have a place anymore because once they broke up he had to give up the apartment since he couldn’t afford it on his own. And he doesn’t have a job. He’s looking for a fresh start and he confessed that he’d like to stay at his grandpa’s place for a some time until he finds a job and is back on his feet. 


His parents had a nasty divorce and his dad doesn’t speak to him anymore because my nephew didn’t side with him in the divorce (his dad is an proper a-hole). My sister is not better. She never properly took care of her four children and doesn’t really care. He doesn’t want to ask them for help. 


He called me because he knows it’s easier to talk to me than to my dad (his grandpa). I’m 27, there’s a big age difference between my siblings and I and I’m close in age with my nieces and nephews. 


The thing is, I called my dad and he’s not really open to the idea of helping him. My nephew had a ‘wild’ phase a few years back and my dad is stuck on that. He doesn’t trust him and he doesn’t want to open his house to someone he doesn’t trust (understandably). 


I called my other sister for advice and she told me she talked to my nephew a few times and she feels he’s really tryin to change but just doesn’t know how. I was quite surprised because she wasn’t my nephew’s biggest fan so for her to say that, it must really mean he’s changing. Also, she said that for him to call us must mean that he’s really desperate. And when I had him on the phone, I felt that. I actually think he must be homeless right now (even though he didn’t say anything about that). 

My dad said that we needed to discuss that together as a family and make a decision. So here’s my dilemma: how can I help him without putting at risk my relationship with my dad? If I convince my dad to help him and he screws it’s up, I will be responsible. But at the same time, it’s really breaking my heart right now, and it makes me cry just imagining what he’s going through.

594,"I am near closing on my duplex for a primary residence while renting the other unit, but they require that I have employment in close proximity to the new location (aprx 120 miles distance). I currently work at store chain similar to Walmart that I could transfer to fairly easily, so I told them I would do that. They said they need a letter of transfer, and a paystub from working there. 
The problem is, I planned to stay working in this store throughout the the next few months while I work on fixing up the 2nd unit to be rented and just stay with my parents in my current town until I’m ready to move there officially. Additionally, it seems unrealistic to work 120 miles away for a week or two without having a living arrangement. 
So, I asked my boss if he would write a fake letter saying I transferred, and he’s on board because he wants me to stay at this location, at least through the summer. Then, we checked the paystubs to see if they had any indication of what store you work at, and it did not. It only shares my home address, and the company headquarters address. 
Could I get away with lying about this? Is there any other possible way of verifying if I ACTUALLY worked at said location? 
I don’t know how hard they would look into this, and if I did get caught, could I get in real trouble?
They said that I just need to have a full time job in this city at closing, afterwards I could find a different job, or whatever, stating they couldn’t monitor me afterwards.

595,"Hey, everyone. I don't know if this is the ideal place to post this, but I am in a humongous rut right now, and I just wanted to post something about it because I do not know what else to do. I apologize for this being long.

In September, I will be going to college, and I have been looking forward to this for my entire high school career, but just recently, I feel simply depressed about it. I do not want to study anything at college; I feel like nothing interests me anymore; to me college would only be useful if I get to study something I am passionate about, but as of now, there is not really a specific thing.

The most fun I have in my day is simply surfing the internet, while in my second year, I would read books, write, watch films; I was really enjoying life. I wanted, in fact, to be a writer; additionally, a year later, I became fascinated with philosophy, but now I do not really find enjoyment in anything meaningful. I have no passion anymore that I can translate to a major at university.

I also feel a lot more angry at, really, everything. I isolated myself from my friends because I do not derive anything from them. I hate my teachers at my school, and I feel so resentful, for seemingly minor things. I get really, really sad whenever I have to wake up for school.

I pay attention to the world, and I view that there are many who die for no reason, many who do not get to live the relatively privileged life I have, and I feel pissed off, that, despite this gift of life that I was given, I do not seem to be in a position where I can do anything fulfilling. 

I mean, I am so privileged, and in fact, probably around a year ago, I wanted to study politics, because I was interested in activism, but I have no major desire to pursue it now because I feel like it would only make me more sad since obviously nobody derives any enjoyment from thinking about how bad the world is, especially not me.

I can get really descriptive about how bad a place I am in right now, but that would be excessive. Has anyone gone through this? Anyone have any advice? It would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for reading.

I tell my friend I’m gonna go finish watching anime and tidy my desk (which I WAS LEGIT PLANNING ON DOING) so i tell him i will talk to him later. I then open this snap from this other boy and this therefore makes my snapscore go up.

They claim it’s just from washing our hands too much, but the doctors say otherwise. My friend suggested I sue.

610,"My father is a Jackle and Hide kind of alcoholic. He's super great when he's sober, but he's a fucking nightmare inebriated. On Tuesday he was black out drunk @ 4pm. He shit himself in the main floor powder room, went into the laundry room, put his clothes in the washing machine (didn't run it,) then walked through all 3 hallways to his bedroom shower leaving a trail of shit/shitfootprints. 

I found out by leaving my room and smelling the worst thing I've ever smelt. I thought maybe the basement floded and was ready for the worst. I wass not ready for this. I then see, from his back, my father walking up the stairs with shit coating his legs. I ran into my room, opened the window, scrambled to get the screen out, and vomited out the entirety of my stomack and 4 very strong and painful contractions.

I didn't know wtf to do. I thought my mom was out. She was sick (cound't smell anything) and asleep in the front TV room. So I waited for my father to get out of the shower. I then found him asleep on the couch while the whole house was still covered in shit.

I went into the front room and found my mother asleep. I then work her, paused for a min then started explaining what happend. She put her hands on her face and staarted crying saying ""this wasnt the first time,"" and i forget what else but I let her vent for 15 mins. We then cleaned up all the shit. (Her downstairs and me with a carpet cleaner that I happened to buy last year.

My mother and I then sat down and decided how to handle this ""tomorrow when he's sober."" She wokeup earlyer then me and confronted him without me. He went batshit crazy and blamed us saying we poisoned him and it's our faults because we make him sleep on the couch.  The next day he had a dozen roses on the tabe so obviously he knows HE fucked up.

I havn't said one word to him since this happened. All he has said to me is ""The chicken is good"" ""Are you feeing well?"" ""Did someone have an accident?"" &lt;&lt;&lt; (this is important) and ""you have plans this weekend?"" All of these I just ignored him and he stopped.

I've been stewing in anger, embarassment, disgust. I've never been so emotional in my life. After he said ""did someone have an accident"" (refering to my cats) I've never been so livid in my life. I went into my room and felt violently sick, almost having a mental breakdown at how insane i felt that this was happening.

I've been going over and over what to say in my head when it finally happens. This is where I'm asking for advice. What I've come up with is the following and I'd like your help. ""What you did was unacceptable and completely disgsting. Mom and I had to clean up YOUR shit while you took a nap AND BLAMED US FOR IT? What the actual fuck? I want nothing to do with you. If you want any hope at a relationship with me you can go to rehab and when you're 3 months sober You can appologise to me and mom and we'll actually be proud of you.""

611,"I want to go deeper than that.

Our minds and the effect that we have on *ourselves* is SO important. We can convince ourselves of literally anything and although that can sometimes be a good thing, it can also be detrimental.

Before a relationship or marriage - don't settle on liking someone that you know isn't right for you. Even if your options are limited. Even if you have no idea how you'll ever meet anyone. If you know they're not right for you, then please don't waste your time convincing yourself that they are just because they're in front of you. It only leads to you literally hurting yourself by mentally trying to mold them into your version of the right person until you realize (maybe months, or even years later) that they're just being who they were all along; and that they're still not the right person for you. If they end up not liking you, well... you've just put yourself through a lot of needless self-inflicted heartache and pain, and if they do end up liking you, that's even worse.

Don't settle for mediocre friendships. We all deserve to receive the same amount of effort and care that we put in. We all deserve honesty, respect, and loyalty. And I get that our society doesn't run on that anymore; which is unfortunate. Most of us just spend time with others because we think that's better than being alone, right? But trust me, don't spend time with those who drain you, who manipulate you, who use you, who don't motivate you. This may be an unpopular take, but it *is* better to be alone in those circumstances. 

Don't settle for an entry-level job. If that was your goal and if that's what you're happy doing; then please don't take this the wrong way, be happy and proud of where you're at! However, if you aren't happy, if you're unmotivated and depressed and feel like you could be doing more, or you *want* to do more, then don't force yourself to statically stay put. Allow yourself to envision the possibilities the future could hold for you, and then make the choices that will put that dream in motion.

**We have to control the narrative of our lives so we're not written out of it.** 

Don't allow yourself to think that your current situation is where you'll be forever. Only YOU have the power to create a change. Only YOU know the steps you need to take, and only YOU can motivate yourself to take those steps.

It's so worth it, when you get to the place to want to be? IT'S WORTH IT. I promise you. The first step is convincing yourself that you can get there, and then trusting yourself to make it happen. You can do it. 

**What you want exists, don't settle until you get it.**",01Mar2020,1
612,"I’m 18 and I’ve been working at a game/buffet place for 4 months. It’s my first job so I have no idea how anything works lol. I got sick on Friday and went to work Saturday and could barely breathe towards the end of my shift. I have a cough, runny nose, dry throat, body aches and a high temperature so I’m definitely sick. Not a good idea to be around little kids especially with coronavirus fears spreading. 

When I first got an interview there I was told I’d be called back in 2 weeks, but something happened to my drug test and it took them a month to call me back. The whole time I was calling them like crazy but they have an automated greeting system that doesn’t give me the option to talk to a human being. 

I tried calling them again today to call out sick 2 hours before they open since I know management is already there. The call went directly to the greeting. I know for a fact no one is going to answer that phone. 

I don’t have any managements number except for my old supervisor, but I don’t know if I’m allowed to tell him since hes no longer my supervisor? Or if texting him is unprofessional? 

Obviously I’ll get in trouble if I don’t show up without calling in sick, so I really don’t wanna get in trouble. What should I do?",01Mar2020,1
613,"  Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked kinda sad/moody about it so idk what to. Then ever since I did that: 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised  and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and in person so she was probably surprised I did something in a bad way :/

614,"I have had a rescue for about 6 years now. She was with me through college and has lived in three different states with me. She is the sweetest and most chill dog I could ask for. Last summer she developed a tumor around her eye and was diagnosed with Osteosarcoma which is bone cancer. I couldn't afford to pay 5,000 to 7,000 dollars for the surgery to remove it, so she was given life expectancy of September last year, and it is now March of this year. She is on pain relief medication and I attempted oral chemo, but stopped the chemo due to it causing her to drastically get worse. The tumor has completely grown around her eye and the eye has disappeared. It is basically a baseball sized mass in her skull that moved the eye out of the way.

It looks like the most painful thing in the world, but she has still been managing to breath, eat, and drink throughout this. She is definitely not the same and she is not as affectionate and happy as she used to be. She is only six years old so I just thought we would have so many more years left.

I am struggling with, and need advice, on if I need to consider putting her down or not. I don't know if it is selfish of me to have been keeping her alive this long, or if it is wrong of me to put a dog down who is not clearly on their last breath. She has an appointment this week, but I just would like as many opinions as possible.",01Mar2020,1
615,"So a few weeks ago I realized I liked this guy. We’ll call him Ben. I realized I liked him and then I got to know him even better by walking with him to a few classes (he’s a senior I’m a junior (female)) and it felt super flirty whenever I’d talk to him. He would sometimes initiate text conversations and seemed pretty interested.

This weekend I decided I’d ask him out because I was so stressed I just wanted to know how he felt. I asked him what he was doing this weekend and he said “I’m busy Saturday but not Sunday” which I kind of took to mean he was letting me actually know his availability like he was interested, instead of just saying “I’m super busy.” I asked him to go ice skating and he said “I might be down, I just have to figure some stuff out first but I’ll let you know.” I took that to mean he actually might have to figure stuff out or he was trying to seem cool about saying yes. However I also was afraid it was him trying to be nice about saying no. This was all on Friday (today’s Sunday). Yesterday it seemed like we were pretty chill he responded to my texts and I think he snap chatted me good morning but it also might have been a mass Snapchat. I thought I’d ask him if he was still down to do something but now it’s been 15 hours and he hasn’t responded. I think I’m taking that to mean a no? What should I do? Should I just leave it alone?

It’s making it extra hard knowing I have taken a gap year from university and I see everyone else living their lives on the path I wanted to take but I’m not doing that. I understand I have to go at my own pace though. 

Obviously depression makes it hard to want to get up and get motivated because I always question why and what am I going to do. This is pathetic, but it seems like the things I’ve been looking forward to the most lately are going out to eat for lunch or something, because yes I love food but it also gives me something to do, seeing my boyfriend, and picking out an outfit in the morning.

I have not attended any funerals as an adult and I’m not finding any advice about the etiquette for my particular situation.

The office is pretty close nit and about half of the office has been with the company for 10+ years.

I know the general stuff, like sit in the back, arrive early, don’t draw too much attention to yourself. 

Advice I’m requesting:
Do I go alone or can I bring my boyfriend?
Should I bring a card and flowers? Or is that too much?

Thing is we’ve looked at houses but didn’t have luck and now we’re looking at apartments that allow for 3 cats so we’ll be hiding one and no real disclaimer on the smaller animals.

636,"Due to a lot of bullshit that happened about 4 years ago, I and my father started staying with a family member. One of the biggest issues was that our home had bedbugs and as we were severely poor and unable to get the house treated. Well we left my mom behind in the home because shes not fond of her inlaws and there was not enough room for her here, so she basically abandoned the master bedroom and has been sleeping on a mattress on the floor in the livingroom (the bed bugs were in the livingroom couch until it was thrown out.) 

Almost all of the infected furniture except in the abandoned bedroom has been gone for years, but im afraid that in that bedroom the bugs still reside despite my mother insisting she hasn't been bitten in a couple years. The house is very run down, and my father is currently looking for restoration grants, but I don't want to go back and bring in furniture if we're going to have the same issue again. Should i try to contact an exterminator first? We are not as poor anymore but still living paycheck to paycheck and I'm a college student working in retail post christmas so I don't have much income at all myself.

637,"My father and I were never close, we live together and it feels like he's a random roommate. Heck, we never even sat down and talked just to talk. I don't know anything about him, and he doesn't know anything about me. He taught me how to bike when I was 8 and that's the only memorable part of our relationship that I can remember. He never spent time with both my mother and I (well, mainly after they had me) unless we are eating with him and he's drinking.

My father is subtly verbally manipulative/abusive to my mother when he is intoxicated. I'm not sure exactly what he says but he twists his words to make it seem like my mother is at fault and he is not. This happens when he is drunk, and then once he's sober he acts like nothing happened and is quiet.

A few months ago, I decided to write a long text to my father talking about how I feel like we're not close and that we should talk and spend more time together and that he can feel comfortable with talking to me about his problems. It took a lot of courage to send this, because we never talk or call or anything. He replied with a smiley emoji and nothing else.

I believe that my father has deep-rooted inner issues from a combination of environment, life experiences, traditional toxic-masculinity mindset. (like when he says: ""daughters should listen to mothers"" as an excuse to not bother talking to me or caring about my life)

I'm not sure, but it feels like my relationship with my father has affected my personal life such as self-confidence, self-worth, etc.

It also feels like it's affected my dating life. I am afraid of long-term commitment and control by another person and tend to get bored of those who are ""good"" for me, yet I also crave the feeling of being loved, especially from those who are ""bad"" for me and those who don't actually value me. I end good relationships, yet I always seek for reassurance and affection from bad relationships. This is why I always seem to end up in short-term relationships, unsure of how I feel, which leads to endings. I put physical affection more value over emotional, because I'm afraid of long-term commitment, yet I also want the emotional aspect at the same time.

I want to learn about any of your experiences, advice, etc. Very much appreciated.",01Mar2020,1

I know, I know, a lot of people are going to be saying this is a troll. It really isn't and I really do want legal advice to see if the police can actually do anything against him. He definitely deserves to do some community service and maybe pay a fine for slapping me on the face",01Mar2020,1

647,"my mom has always been very humble so she never rlly asks for birthday gifts, and ever since I can remember we always go out to eat in a fancy restaurant when her bday comes (generally at my dad's expenses). sometimes he buys her a material gift too like a fancy bag or shoes.

the thing is no one ever taught me how to give a bday gift, or any gift at all in any celebration, and even though I always received something,  neither of my parents ever encouraged me to buy/make a gift to them. like I supposed this is something that happens right like one of the parents give the money so the child can buy a gift for the other ? 

anyway, as a child this never rlly bothered me because I didn't rlly care about anything so it never crossed my mind that I should do something special to my parents on their bday to demonstrate my love etc. I mean, my parents never rlly say they love me or anything so I've gotten used to it being implicit like. of course I love you, you're my mom. and of course you love me back

however, as I grew up and developed common sense this started to bother me immensely and every year on her birthday (and mother's day too) I get super anxious and guilty and I do want to buy her something but I don't work yet so I don't have my own money and I'm kinda embarrassed to ask my father for money to buy her something because I've never done that ever... and it implies I'd have to buy him something too :/ but I'd be willing to do it or save money through the year specially for it
this feeling got worse through the years and now I'm 18 and it feels ridiculous that I've never given her anything ???

tl;dr I have no idea how I should start gifting my mom on her birthday. do I just start doing it? out of nowhere? what do I buy her? how expensive should it be? do I have to say something heartfelt when I do it? :(",01Mar2020,1

651,"Ever since I was young things between me and my mom have been hard. Even as a child it was hard. 

I'll skip what was said and done in the past But we were both at fault at times. (I.e me lying about not having homework, being overly punished, being kicked out many times,....)

Last year I lost my job and while looking for a new job my mom kicked me out. She came home one day and I was listening to Lorde. She called me a loser out of no where and I lost my mind, yelling. This was after a few months of us not talking because I lost my job.  She called the cops on me because I was being a nuisance and they kicked me out of the apartment. All because I was yelling. I ended up being homeless for about 4 months and then found my own place where I live now. 

Things with my mom are better now but she's acting like nothing happened and it really hurts me because I went through a lot in those 4 months. She still acts like I deserve what happened to me and that she is completely faultless. I really feel sweeped under the rug. 

 She wants a relationship with me but it's hard pretending that I don't have any resentment for all the drama that happened between us. She wants me to hang out with her and be her friend and listen to her problems and even go on vacation with her. There seems to be a disconnect where me and my emotions are void. 

I definitely don't want to talk to her about this cuz I know it will be an argument. 

I want a relationship but I don't want to do anything more than see her once or twice a month for a short visit. shes been asking to do more with me but I need space.

654,"Alright, 18 year old HS Senior here, and I have gone to a few tours and one liberal arts college in particular (I have gotten into it)  has stood out to me. The atmosphere of that college feels just right, the cafeteria and other student resources outstanding, it has an amazing outdoors community that appeals to me, financial costs at this college aren't a major concern, the location and campus are ideal for me, the sports team at this college regarding the sport that I have loved for 4 years is something special and it the college overall definitely seems like one of the best places for me. But, there are a few things that worry me:

1) (less important). This college has had a 2.5% budget cut to the operating budget recently and it's endowment is pretty small. I heard from reliable sources on campus that... 

An entire department (which I don't care about nor intend to take any classes in), is going to be cut next year.

Many classes that aren't critical to one of the majors offered are being cut.

The school is having issues keeping class sizes consistent without lowering the quality of people it accepts due to the general downward trend regarding liberal arts schools.

2) This college has a lack of degree options. It has around 25 degrees to choose from, but it is a liberal arts college and a lot of the degrees focus on the arts which I am not interested in, given that I know with high confidence that I want to get a major that is related to STEM. It also doesn't have a Geography major, which is something that I'm interested in given that I have made and viewed maps on my free time for numerous years. My options regarding majors that I might be interested in are pretty limited, and I have a suspicion that regardless of what I originally intend to do when entering the college, I will inevitably switch majors. 

I am almost ready to commit to this college and would do so if they had a good geography program, but the above factors are giving me doubts sufficient to call me to hold off. I am an IB diploma student and have taken a few extra AP classes atop the IB ones, but my grades are Cs and Bs, so I could probably get into other places, and I have already been accepted into state schools and there are a few other schools that I could get into that interest me. My family is pressuring me heavily to commit to this school given their opinions on what I would enjoy. Should I go to this college?",01Mar2020,1

By the end of the night, we had kissed (sort of) and exchanged numbers and she says she wants a second date.  I've been through this scenario before where I'll meet a girl on the weekend, we'll like each other and exchange numbers but after that the relationship sort of fizzles out in about a week.  The thing is I'm not a very good texter and I don't really like communicating with it.  Therefore during the week, we won't talk much and even if I get to a second date, the relationship has almost dissipated completely.  I want to break that cycle this time and see if I can develop a real relationship with this person.

He also comments on the state of our room, which while it's not as neat as his, is not dirty, just has some clutter. Side note: he did help us move in by paying the first months rent himself, with our promise to pay him back. And we have started to make small payments towards that (we are doing our best at the moment, but money is tight), but he still brings it up when we talk about doing something fun every once in a while. And while we talked to him about two weeks ago, and he did stop, this weekend we went out of state for two nights for my husband's doctors appointment. And while we had told our roommate about this in advance, he messaged my husband seemingly angry that we had left without reminding him. We have been home about 2 hours, and I came out of our room to find an empty can of soup on the kitchen table that I had forgotten to throw away before we left (we left Friday morning). That was my bad, I should have thrown it away but forgot since we were in a hurry to leave as to not miss the appointment. The thing that bothered me most was that there was a note saying ""This is not your mom's house, pick up after yourself"". Now, I'll admit my husband and I both leave the occasional trash on the counter, but realize it in the same day and throw it away (we work nights, so sometimes not until we get home, but it does get thrown away within a reasonable time frame).

668,"Middle/high school was a nightmare, because all I did was get bullied. I embarrassed myself so many times that I was considered the cringiest kid in the school. I did a lot of stupid shit and had an insufferable personality, and I was an asshole after trying to stoop down to all of my bullies’ level. 

For example, I made a catfish account and catfished guys around my school to see what bad pick-up lines I would get. It ended up accidentally starting a fight between two kids in my class and they both got suspended, and I was considered the asshole with no life by the whole school the next 2 years. I still feel horrible about this, and I can’t forget how much of an asshole I was. 

Another time, I faceplanted in front of the whole school trying to do a backflip for a dance performance, and the whole school laughed at me and recorded it. Everyone would approach me in the hallway laughing at me after that moment. 

When I thought that people would forget the past, everybody new that I talked to heard something about me being really cringy. One time, I was talking to a girl and my friend said “You know he’s the biggest tweak right?” and she replied “Yeah I know I hear it all the time.” 

A lot of my classmates would tell me I had no life, that I was cringy, that no one knew I existed, how no one would love me unless they wanted something from me, how my home life was a mess, how stupid I was, etc. It’s been 2 years since I graduated and I still feel horrible, mostly stemming from all of my past mistakes and cringy personality that everyone remembers me for. My nickname was “tweak.” 

My whole school saw me as a loser and asshole. People were only nice to me when we talked because it’s just the polite thing to do, but they’d make fun of me with their friends the second I had my back turned. My friend group only let me hang out with them so they could use me as a punching bag for their jokes, and I took every one of them because I didn’t want to be seen alone. 

I can’t go back to my hometown and risk running into anyone from the past. I saw 4 people I knew the last time I visited, and they gave me a look and kept walking. Sadly, I knew exactly what they were thinking when they saw me on the street. 

It’s too embarrassing because I know what everyone thought of me. All of my mistakes and cringey moments were known by the whole school, and I relive those moments every day. Someone from my friend group told me that everyone’s going to remember me as the tweak.

I mean it when I say everything was perfect before she drank. I wanted to marry her and pamper her for the rest of our lives. 

She went to her daughters house for a baby shower, and ended up relapsing.

She beat me twice. She relapsed the last 2 weeks of the relationship and became belligerent beyond description. I never ever in a million years knew this side of her existed or thought that she would ever get violent on me. And the things she said when she was drunk pierced my fucking soul.

She’s a big woman, 5’10” 150lbs, it’s not like I could have just “manhandled” her without striking her whilst she threw punch after punch. All I could do was put my hands over my head for protection.

I was scared to call the cops. Both parties are usually arrested in the state i was living in when it comes to domestic violence. And who would believe a man over a woman?

So anyways; she beat me twice. The first time she only hit me a few times. She did give me a black eye though. The second time, she was pounding me, chasing me, and throwing objects at me for what felt like forever. I eventually did end up getting her to the ground and held her there, called her mom to come over and get her. That is the night I left.

I’m laying here catatonic, 1.5 years out at my parents house. I’m so traumatized and confused by what happened. I thought she’d be my forever girl.

Thanks in advance if you actually read the whole thing. 

I'm a female, 26 years. My mom (62) is a sweet person. I know that's who she is on the inside. But she gets so angry, mean and says the absolute cruelest things to you out of no where sometimes. The trigger for the outbursts is if you have to remind her of something, or if you told her youve already answered the question she's asked 5 times before in the past 10 minutes. Or something like that. She can't remember where I've been working for the past 8 months (I work for a pretty big name company now), and asks me the same questions every day. It's like she has the same set of questions and sentences she'll ask/say everyday. Sometimes when she gets mad at us she'll hide our car keys but then says she never took them because she can't remember where she put them. She forgets to pay bills but when my dad asks her about them (he'll eventually see a paper saying we owe last months and this months plus a penalty fee), she'll get completely on defense and say ""I never got a notice from them."" My dad will have to go through emails/mail to find that they did in fact send multiple notices and he'll point that out to her, she'll completely flip and start screaming, saying no one loves her, starts name calling, mocking his deceased father, and does this weird aggressive kid voice and says sarcastic things.

I should mention now that we have tried to intervene with this behavior on multiple accounts over the past 5 years or so. We have sat her down and tried to be absolutely understanding of what shes going though, saying that we're here for her, she can count on us, we understand that what's happening might be very scary and confusing but she can come to us for help. She will then retaliate my yelling and spiting at my dad, saying that he's trying to get a divorce with her by saying she's got dementia, she'll just start screaming and saying nasty things about both of us.
The thing is, about a half hour after each episode, she'll want to talk to us all normal and nice as if she never told us to ""go fuck yourself and I hope you die I won't come to your funeral."" 

Two years ago, on Valentine's day, I came home from a night serving shift to see police cars outside my house and my dad being walked out in handcuffs. This is what happened: my dad was trying to sleep. He has to commute almost 2 hours to work every day and has to wake up at 4:30 so he goes to sleep around 8/8:30. My mom is angry at him and saying that him taking her out to dinner, buying her flowers, and writing out a sweet card means nothing, so she's being petty and turning on lights in their room on and off while my dad is trying to sleep. She gets no reaction out of him (our usual coping mechanism is to ignore her when she's doing this), so she starts turning on the shower, flushing the toilet repeatedly, turns all the sinks on, starts opening and closing their closet door. Dad responds to her by saying ""seriously, please stop. I need to get sleep."" It's about 11 pm now. She won't stop. He gets fed up and says he's gonna call the cops if she won't stop. She gets LIVID. Starts screaming at him more. He gets up and goes to get his phone because he can't take anymore. He calls the cops and is just exasperated about the whole thing and they say theyre on the way. He's been barricading himself in the bathroom to make this call. She eventually gets in, and grabs the phone out of his hands. He wants to get away so he grabs a bag and puts some clothes in it. She takes that from him too. He grabs his keys because he wants to sit in his car. She takes those too. She's spitting at him and generally acting out of control so finally he snaps. He takes her by the shoulders and yells ""LEAVE ME ALONE"". Shes sitting on the bed and starts screaming and yelling ""oh he's hitting me oh God he's hitting me!!"" and my dad just leaves the room and sits outside to wait for the police. My dad ends up going to jail for the night because my mom claims that my dad strangled her (even though there is no evidence). When my mom actually sees him being arrested she freaks out and says she made the whole thing up. Too late for that. 

Anyway, fast forward current time, I'm still living at home because I'm terrified that if I left them alone then my dad would either snap for real or she'll make something up again. 
She doesn't have any hobbies, interests, friends, nothing. She sits next to the fireplace all day and stares at her phone or sits at the computer and plays solitaire (then claims shes been paying bills). She doesn't remember how to drive to places in town she used to go to all the time. Shes become a compulsive liar to get out of admitting she forgot something. I just don't know what to do anymore. 

There's a lot more stuff/events I left out but this is way too long already to include more things.

679,"I know this maybe isn’t the best forum or thread but I’m hoping to get some help from you guys! 

Hey, about 2.5 years ago i had health anxiety, and I was looking at my body and found 2 lymph nodes or what to call them, maybe they are called hump? And one is located under my chin/jaw, it’s small and haven’t growth at all in 2.5 years and my other is on my right side of my back, and it hasn’t growth at all, I don’t really know since English isn’t my main language, and I was really worried about that, but my health anxiety went away, and then I started getting heart pain and was nervous about getting a heart attack and this was about 2 years ago, but I went and checked it up and everything was fine and that also went away, 

and now for about 3-4 weeks ago I noticed that my left rib was sticking out, and ever since then I have had neck/head pain mostly in the back head  that’s coming and going and my neck feels stiff and that my legs feels weak and arms, (that have been almost gone away) and now I’m thinking in my head that my humps or what to call them is something bad even I haven’t had any problems with them, until now, I still have no problems but I’m worrying about them, and I also feel that I have unbalance, mostly when I’m thinking about all this, the unbalance have I had before when I have panic attacks or long anxiety, so I went up and checked the rib that sticks out, since it was that that started this whole thing, and it turns out it was because I’m skinny and have a small scoliosis! So that’s was nice to hear! But I’m still worried about everything else, and it all started with my left rib and it’s now checked and it wasn’t anything bad! I have a healthy family and everyone that have died is from age! 

What’s wrong with me? Everyone says that I’m healthy? Is this what health anxiety feels like? I was diagnosed with health anxiety also when I was checking my left rib! I’m 20 years old",01Mar2020,1
680,"Forgive me. This is quite long. I tried to explain it best I could because I’m in desperate need for any advice. My younger brothers both dropped out of school about 2 years ago. I (f19) have no idea where to start to efficiently help. One stopped going to a public school when he was 13 (15 now), but he tried doing homeschool for a bit (give or take 6 months) until my mother just completely gave up on him. He has dyslexia and she doesn’t know how to deal with it, so she was doing the homeschool work for him. I was unaware of this until recently, but my father somehow knew. She got caught by the supervisor who comes and checks on my brother’s progress. My mother soon stopped teaching my brother and making appointments to have people come over to check on my brother’s progress. Now all my brother does is play video games and sleep in. He stopped going to public school because of all the bullying by the teachers. He would come home angry and upset often. One teacher told him that he could never amount to anything. He wouldn’t want to talk about his bad day, so no one ever knew he needed help.

My other brother has a different, yet similar, situation. He (now 17) stopped going to his public high school when he was a sophomore (just turned 16). He should be finishing up junior year now. When he stopped going, it wasn’t out of the blue. He could barely go a full week, yet even a full day, to school. He would simply say that he doesn’t want to be there anymore and he wants to go home. I think he has depression, but I have absolutely no idea how to handle it because all I can think of when I see both of them is that they are not going to school. We live in a nice neighborhood in a rather safe small town. There’s no excuse for them to be dropouts because I know for a fact that people dropout for much more important reasons. 

My parents do not care at all. My father is working, so he doesn’t want to deal with it. My mother is an extremely difficult person to reason with. Her behavior gets extreme when someone disagrees with her. She yells and threatens to kill herself/leave. On top of that, my parents are getting a divorce within a year. My brothers do not know, but when they find out, it’s going to send them in a spiral. I think this because our mother cheated on our dad for the past 8 years. Yes, she still does it to this day. I just want them to kind of have their lives together before that happens. I have no idea how they are going to get a divorce because my mom refuses to believe it/doesn’t want to talk about it with my father and they are breaking the law with my brothers’ situation. 

We live in California and the legal dropout age is 18 without guardian permission and 16 with guardian permission. The process works like so (from limited research): the school calls, arranges a meeting with guardian and kid, and figures out a plan for their education. If the kid fails the plan, the guardians have to pay $100 fine and the fine goes up every time they don’t go to school. I’m not sure if I explained this well so my apologies and I’m not sure if my information is correct for my specific situation. We are just so far past that, I think it’s worse than I think it is. I do know that what my parents are doing is against the law and will result in a fine. I do know that my youngest brother’s (15) school called to arrange that meeting and my mother ignored those calls. 

Of course I’ve tried to step up and help. I stopped because my brothers are already difficult to deal with. They are mean and are determined to never set foot on a school campus ever again. That’s why we want them to at least get their GED. That’s the somewhat plan. My parents yell and scream at each other all the time about other things and my brothers. My parents do not efficiently help them, whenever we talk about it my parents fight with each other until someone throws something at the other. They cannot work together, not even for their kids. They yell at me for trying to take my brothers’ situation as my responsibility because all they do is fight about it. They do not like it when I tell them that what they are doing is wrong and they need to help their kids. I just want them to push through because I cannot do this by myself.

When my brothers first dropped out of school, I ignored it because I thought my parents had it under control and it was temporary. I admit that this is a fault on my part because now it is worse. I have no idea how to start or where to start to get my brothers to at least do their GED without having to raise my parents in the process. Advice?

Also, my parents would kill me if I ever went to another family member about my brothers. 
I hope this all makes sense because it is a lot and I’m sure I forgot important information.",01Mar2020,1

I accidentally left a audio recording on while I slept. I almost deleted it today but decided to playback the contents.

I told him in a rather uninterested way that I forgot something. When I came back the third time he went out again like ""thank you"" and I said why are you coming out to say that? He didn't respond.i though t it was weird he was waiting for me to get home therefore my uninterested response.

684,"Hey guys, I'm really desperate and therefore i'm on reddit now asking for help. First, a little background. I recently had a friend stab me in the back (I don't want to go through this in detail). This whole thing is a little complicated but i'll simplify it: she did something behind my back. Currently she's ashamed of it and refuses to talk to me. I can't get over her.
 
After another friend of mine convinced her to talk to me, she didn't seem serious at all. In the end, she was the one who ended it off by saying that she had ""nothing else to say"" and just left me hanging like that. We haven't talked since then. 

My friend is a person who cant talk seriously in serious situations. She's the type of person to constantly run away from her problems. 

Now, the problem: even though I feel betrayed by my friend, I miss her terribly. We've been friends for 3 years, which I know isn't a lot compared to some people, but we've gone through some tough times together. I feel that even if we do manage to be friends, it wouldn't be the same as before. Therefore, it would be nice to have closure with her instead of her cutting me off.

I have other friends and i've talked to them about this but they tell me not to text her saying ""she's not worth it"" etc.

685,"Last night I was driving myself and a friend back from a bar. I was taking her to her car (which we left at a restaurant we were at earlier) and attempted a k-turn and backed into the car behind me. She freaked out and said “are you okay?! Are you alright?!” And I said “yeah I’m okay why? Are you?” I knew I hit the car behind me but didn’t think it was a huge deal. I thought damn like it’s okay stop bugging out. Two people who work at restaurant came out and told me not to call the cops just to leave a note. I thought again why is everyone freaking out so much? Why can’t I call the cops? I just backed in to a car I misjudged the space I had and hit the gas a bit too hard. I of course left a note with my contact information and called my insurance company as soon as I got home. Waking up today I realize why they were all freaking out. It’s because I was drunk. I had about five beers over the course of 4 hours or so. I didn’t feel drunk at the time but I definitely was. 

I’m realizing now this isn’t the first time I have driven drunk. This is just the first time I’ve ever hit anything. I am completely racked with guilt and shame. I only cracked this other person’s front bumper but what if I had reversed into a person? What if I hurt someone? I feel like such a worthless person. I don’t want to self harm or do something worse but I don’t know how I can move forward from this. How can I live my life knowing I drove home drunk? How can I just go to work tomorrow knowing I could have killed someone?

687,"A few weeks ago i started to become friends with this girl who was flirting actively with my BF's bestfriend at the time at work. (We all work together) Things have been going on, has our relationship got closer.  Last monday, I asked a dumb question to my BF about if he was ever attracted to someone while with me. Then nuclear bomb fell on me. 

It took 2 day to get the whole story. But here's what I've gathered. She was actively trying to get my BF harassing him for his phone number and was flirtatious and all Then there was the christmas party at work, i was too sick to go but my BF went anyway. Fearing to be too possesive or something I spent the night crying regretting not to have gone. Turns out that night the girl made up an excuse to stay with my bf until the first bus and teased him hard. He didnt want to respond but still put his hand in her hair and did some ""necking"". Of what both told me they never kissed. But all this had been going on behind my back for more than 2 months. there was some text message i saw of her making the plan to convince me to get into a polyamourous relationship with him up until a few days ago(BF mostly didnt respond to her text). This is where it hurts the most because I had became good friends with her and she works right behind me all day long. 

As for my BF and I managed to go through this together and it had a positive outcome on our relationship on most part. It's really hard since we are two very anxious people but all this time just helping each other go through this really has brought us closer.


Here is the problem:

So at first i wanted to be chill with the girl and understanding since she became my friend and we had a whole new circle of friends.  So when i went back to work with her sitting behind me, I really tried hard not to  become emotional, thinking about positive thing or focusing into work but nothing worked. I became an emotional wreck before the end of the day. i ended up telling a few people since they actually saw me cry and asked me directly so how could I even lie in that state. I feel like an AH because I guess it can or will spread rumours. At the same time, i believe it might be good that it became more known has she has been doing this to many other guys in relationship. Often in DM of the chat at work. When I talked to one of my boss about all this he said that nothing can be done about her (we had also arrangements to change shift so that i dont run into her at work) but that I cannot do anything against her myself. One of the guys that have been harassed by her will have to put in a complaint. My BF doesn't mind to lodge a complaint but is waiting for my descision before to do so. I dont know if i want to do that. I want to go by the peacefull way yet again a part of me is mad and tired of having to deal with all the consequences of this when she wouldn't even tell our friend why we have been ignoring each other. She bears no consequences at all. Its been a week that we had to deal with crippling anxiety and emotional trauma. 

Would i be a bad person if i got back at her with complaints from guys that she flirted with at work? How should i deal with this I actually have no clue.

Im terrified to ask my BF the conversation from the chat at work since I've seen her talk to him often. Should I ask him in order to get over it once and for all and not live with any doubt or is that childish of me?",01Mar2020,1

693,"This is serious as I'm in real trouble. So what happened is, I was planning to travel early April, and was applying for visa to the visiting country. The visa application required me to show a hotel reservation and flight bookings. At my work we have a third party travel management/booking system and I have always used the system to create dummy bookings to attach to the application. Usually I cancel them after getting the bookings. I always thought that the request on the system goes to the agency and then they approve it or process payment by asking details - so I never really paid mind to the payment method or anything. Today I was doing the same for this trip. The flight bookings went alright. Everything as usual. When I was booking the hotel bookings - I found only one hotel coming up in the system. An expensive hotel but I was like meh I dont have to pay or anything. I didnt even bother reading the details. I think I saw somewhere it was non refundable but tbh I didnt pay any mind because we only have an invoice and a company credit card on the system; and I was like 'I'll cancel it'. I went through with the booking. And within minutes I got an email from the travel agency copying me and my manager to approve the request. I emailed back, that this is a personal trip (thinking they were asking for approval since they thought it's a work trip). The guy from the Travel agency emailed back 'Please advice on payment as this is a non-refundable booking'. I got an immediate panic attack and went on the system and cancelled the hotel reservation and flights. To which this guy emailed me again saying the same thing; 'advise on payment, this is non-refundable.' This hotel reservation is one of the most expensive hotels - About $650 - which to put into perspective is 12% of my monthly pay. (This is about 70% of the my budget for the trip). Plus this was a random booking (I booked all days in one city only for dummy, this is not on the real plan to stay in one city). I'm freaking out since then, praying in my heart nothing happens. I dont know whether these guys will dock the payment straight out of my pay or take this to finance or HR. Plus I have already cancelled the reservation so I might be charged for something I didnt even use. I'm freaking out I just dont know what to do! I cant afford to take this financial set back. What are some of my options here?

PS: TBH I didnt even know this tool was a live booking tool, I just thought whatever I book, the request goes to the agency and then they approve it or process it.

TL:DR: I used my work's travel agency to create an expensive dummy hotel reservation, little did I know, this was an actual booking. I panicked and cancelled the booking, but the booking was non-refundable and now I may get charged for it.",01Mar2020,1

I met this guy at a summer camp 2 years ago. He was best friends with my then boyfriend.We exchanged snapchat names before we left and continued to text each other every now and then for a few months. During that time he told me lots of personal stuff he hasn't told anyone else. He also made some ""jokes"" which to this day I'm not sure if they were jokes or him being a dickhead and bullying me. I like to think it was just him joking cause he does have that kind of humour. 

One day his snapchat disappeared. I asked my ex boyfriend if he could text him for me because I had no other way to contact him and he said he doesn't want to get involved. So I lost contact with him since.

I recently moved schools and it turns out hes in my class. When we first saw each other he had no clue who I was until I told him my name and that we met at the summer camp and then we talked for a bit before I had to go. (it was the begging of lunch and I had to get some stuff done to register at the school) . At the end of lunch he ran up to me and walked and talked with me until we got to his class (mines was on the other side of the school). He seemed friendly and like he wanted to talk to me.  (he could've ignored me because I was a good few feet in front of him, barely heard him call my name when he ran up to me) we had our last class together and I was the only one who he said ""enjoy your midterm"" to and he smiled at me and whatnot. 

But hes always been a really nice guy and that's where my problem starts. He's had plenty of ways to get into contact with me over the past year but also all of his socials that I know of are gone. (I knew of his FB) he could've told my ex boyfriend to send me a message on his behalf.

This happened around 3 or 4 years ago, so sorry if my memory is not the best.

I have these two male friends(lets call the A and C) who i still talk to and we hang out with my other friends sometimes. Back then we were teens 15/16 years old. It was between classes and we were waiting our teacher to arrive, the three of us were joking around when A decided to tickle me, i already didnt like that bc i dont like being touched but due to the tickling i was laughing and asking him to cut it out. All of the sudden i felt him touch one of my breast and i immediatly tried to hit him, he got surprised but quickly laughed along with C, both of them saw it as a joke and i continued to tell him to fuck off; i was a shy anxious 15 year old who never experienced that, so i didnt straight up said ""hey this is not cool, you made me uncomfortable"", wanted to say that but all that came out was me telling him to fuck off and swearing at him. He apologized(that thype of apology where you dont know what you did but you're like 'whatever') and we all continued with our day.

A and C both kept bringing that up after it happened for some days, laughing and making the motion of threatening to tickle me, and every time i got really uncomfortable. 

Maybe A didnt realized? Was it really assault? Or is anxiety getting the best of me? All of these questions were and still are in my mind whenever i remember that moment, 

I feel anxious thinking about it, thinking that maybe my friend was assaulting me and that will affect how our hang outs with our whole group will be. I never told this to anyone and im embarassed to bring it up

I then tried calling her and she wasn’t picking up, started messaging her till she was like “don’t treat me like a charity case snap chatting isn’t gonna help at all”

I ended up going round hers, bandaging her scars and talking to her about all that and she started going on abt how she didn’t want to be here, felt like a burden etc. I stayed the night at hers cuz I didn’t want her do anything worse.

705,"I graduated from college a year ago and have been working in residential care for over a year. I want to go back to school because honestly the job prospects are not what I was expecting and social work does not pay well. Also I’m not passionate about this aspect of my field and it has a high turnover rate because of how mentally taxing it is. If I go back to school and get a masters or PhD I should have more options.

I’m concerned that I won’t be accepted to grad school because my GPA in college wasn’t amazing (I had one semester that was abysmal and it really screwed up my average). I didn’t make strong connections with my professors and I’m not confident they would give me stunning letters of recommendation or even remember me. I haven’t taken the GRE yet either but I plan to in a few months.

I’m thinking I might apply to programs for organizational psych, neuroscience, or something to do with research. I did really well in statistics, research design analysis, and everything to do with cognition and perception. I feel very discouraged because of my gpa and lack of solid references outside of work. Is it even worth it to try? I really need honest advice.",01Mar2020,1

One of my best paintings I signed on the front and I regretted it because the signature was just too big. The letters in my name are just a bit obnoxious honestly lol 

I just worry that my signature is going to distract from the piece. This piece has a very complicated composition and the place where my signature would go is black so it would clearly stick out with a white signature or really any color signature. It’s kinda driving me insane lol my mom always grills me about signing my paintings but I’m starting to prefer my signature to not be on the front.

709,"To start off I (23F) am vegan. I started being vegan in highschool and I've just graduated college, so about 7 years. For the first 2-3 years of my diet I was super strict. I only drank water, ate no sugar, no processed food, no carbs (not even potatoes). I was basically eating mostly raw veggies and some cooked veggies. My diet made me feel really good/happy. I had high energy, was active, but I needed to eat small food items frequently. I lost a lot of excess weight and my digestion was no issue.

As I studied through college, I noticed that I always felt uncomfortable from bloating and constipation. It was distracting and sometimes ruined my day. Lunch for me was typically kale, mushrooms, or tofu, but it made me really gassy. I mean I would have to let out big ""farts"" about every 4 minutes. I was really embarrassed about it because I wasn't going to fart in my lectures, so I held it in and my intestines made noise. On the days I had to work or go to class, I didn't allow myself to eat during the day, only in the evenings. I appreciated being on the go because it made less time for eating which meant I could go about my day with ease. 

However for the past 2ish years I've stopped that routine. I discovered tofu and ""meat substitutes"" like wheat gluten sausages. I realized I could eat that along with bread and sugar, so I added it to my diet. I stopped being gassy and started being more constipated. I used to obsess over my weight and now I don't have the energy to keep track of everything. When I eat I feel like it takes my body forever to digest it. I can eat one meal and won't ""need"" to eat the next day. But if I eat more than one meal I feel too full and it's uncomfortable. Back then I exercised at least 4 times a week and was active, now I don't do as much. I want to lose weight but a part of my diet is also trying to minimize my discomfort. So to be my ""healthiest"" I must severely restrict myself to *very small* portions. If I don't have many distractions I feel like I eat too much. Yesterday I ate two meals of green beans, corn, carrots, &amp; mushrooms, 5 oranges plus 3 bananas. That was too much and I promised myself I wouldn't eat today but I did, and I feel horrible. Not because I ate, but because of how my body feels.

Yes, I know this sounds weird but eating too much could leave me uncomfortable for days or even a week. I am considering going back to my original diet so I can get my body back in sync, but that requires so much commitment. Perhaps the wheat gluten and carbs may be hard to digest. I don't have many distractions right now so I'm prone to eating more than I should. I drink plenty of water (3-5 bottles a day). I'm not sure if I need to drink more. I don't know if eating is the problem or if I have stomach issues. I don't have a lot of gas and that worries me. My bowel movements are intermittent and I often feel stocked up. I could literally not eat until next Wednesday and I'd be fine. No hunger, no low insulin levels, normal blood sugar. I don't know what's wrong and restricting myself feels like an eating disorder. It doesn't help that I also want to lose weight. Advice?

My classes at school are basically online-only so I don't really have any chances of meeting people but I am in a club which is not super fun but it's not terrible either.

She is obsessed with MLP and has admitted to having a crush on me in the past which makes me pretty uncomfortable.

739,"I'm not even sure if this is the right subreddit, but my 4 year old son ""Ryan"" has recently been displaying and vocalizing a serious disinterest in wanting to play with his Dad, and I need help with what to do about it going forward.


Backstory is needed to understand my confusion so I'll make it as short as I can:

When Ryan was 7 months old, David took me to court requesting 50/50 custody out the gate. Because hed never seen Ryan before that day, the Judge gave him supervised visitation 3x week (at my parents' - i lived with them) to get to know Ryan: 2 week days and 1 weekend day. The Judge also said after Ryan turned 1 year old, David could come back to court and get the 50/50 he initially desired (and ask for his child support amount to be lowered).


From the beginning, David was a nightmare to deal with. He'd routinely show up late; would sometimes miss days and then ask to make them up on a different day only to no call/no show that day; stuff like that. 


Then when Ryan was about 2 or 3 David claimed his car broke down and would need to fix it. This ended up taking about 7 months, during which time he never once called or texted to ask about his son, or showed up to his visits.  I had honestly assumed he was dipping out. But when he came back, he started only showing up on his 1 weekend day despite him legally having 3 visitation days. It's been this way ever since. 


David has told me multiple times that he wants to be involved and eventually have Ryan come over to his house but his actions have never shown that he actually wants those things.


More examples:

If I tell David Ryan is not feeling well and is just going to take it easy on a day hes scheduled to visit, he simply says ""ok."" he has NEVER asked what was wrong or if he could make up the visit at another time.


David plays on his phone most of the time they're together, claiming Ryan ""just doesnt wanna play with me"". He also rarely initiates playing and kind of just let's Ryan take the reins. 


At first I thought it was just because he doesn't know any better or is inexperienced/embarrassed, and we've all (me and my parents and grandmother) tried to help him out on our own accord and teach him what to do but its evident now that he just doesn't care. He has never reached out to us on his own to ask for help/advice.


David doesn't know anything about Ryan. And he doesn't ever ask to know. 


Keep in mind, Ryan is 4.5 years old now. He has recently starting to tell me he doesnt like playing with Daddy and that he ""wants to go home"" as soon as David comes over. And I understand why, David is boring and not fun. But what am I supposed to do here? What would you do?

We never really just casually talk, so the next day we didn’t interact except for me watching his snap story.

Since we were just hooking up, I assume that just means he’s done with me, but I never hit him up or bug him on snap so I just wanted other perspectives of why he might’ve blocked me.

747,"This is super long and I’m sorry. 

Okay, so here’s a little a background. I was sexually assaulted by someone I’d only known for a week, maybe 2 about 2-3 years ago. March 17th actually makes 3 years so it’s really hurting me right now.
When my grandmother found out about the assault, she was clearly very hurt, as well as the whole family. When it was reported, we had gone through the whole process of the rape kit, the police station, a detective and finally the D.A. When the D.A asked my mom and I if we were considering jail time, she told him, “no, he’s young and it was a mistake. We don’t want to ruin his life.” It was a downward spiral from there. I wanted to put him in jail so badly. He hurt me, physically and emotionally. I’ve developed PTSD, and it only worsened my anxiety from there. It started to cause problems in my relationship with a man who has done nothing but cared for me and respected me. When I try talking to my grandmother about it, she tells me, even now, “oh, it could’ve been worse. He didn’t rape you, he’s a young kid who made a mistake.” It had gotten to the point where I stopped talking about and just held it in. To everyone, but me, him assaulting me was a mistake and he has his whole life ahead of him. I shouldn’t “ruin” his life by sending him to jail. He hurt me, he hurt me physically and mentally. Everything he did, every word he said sticks with me 3 years later and all I do is carry around guilt because I reported him for something terrible he did to me. My family thinks I should move on from this “mistake” and he grateful he didn’t rape me. I don’t know how to kick this feeling of guilt, the feeling that if I had done something different he wouldn’t have assaulted me. As if I overreacted and ruined his life. He ended up getting sent to sexual offenders classes and had a restraining order slapped on him.
How do I get my family’s voices and opinions out of my head and stop this guilt I’m feeling? I truly don’t believe it was a mistake. He heard me say no, he felt me pushing against him, he saw how uncomfortable I was and still continued. Even when I got up to leave, he grabbed me by the waist and pulled me back in bed.
Did I overreact? Should I feel guilty for reporting this? I’m still struggling 3 years later. I’m just stuck.",01Mar2020,1
749,"Sorry if some of this doesn't make sense, I don't even know much about the situation, apps, etc. 

Most of my mom's side of the family lives in rural china.  My niece's father is disabled and a single parent. He's the only one making money and their year's worth of salary is ~$1000 USD. My niece who is 11 somehow got her grandma's credit card and sent $1000 USD to some fucking streamer on Kwai. A *year's* salary. 

According to my niece she was chatting with the streamer and he told her to send money to him. Her father doesn't know what to do because he doesn't know anything about technology. I don't know what to do because I'm pretty sure Chinese streamers are not accessible to Americans on kwai (I tried clicking on his page on the web but it just redirects to the homepage of Kwai).

750,"I have been raised by a narcissistic parent and am therefore still suffering from it. I‘m having no contact to my mother for a year and am recovering, but it‘s going on very slowly. I‘m thinking about a psychologist, but had no time to get one so far. 

Since January I am an a state of total change. I realized that I am not such a career person as I thought. I study chemistry and will have my bachelor in April. I planned to do my master first and PD after that. I literally planned my whole life, but then I realized it‘s not what I want. I am 21 now, turning 22 and spend my whole life studying. I rushed through the university with no time for friends, partys or anything similar, but had very good grades. 

When I look at my future I‘m frightened. I am afraid of the things coming, I don‘t like my study and don‘t want to continue it, even though I‘m one of the bests. But I also don‘t know what else to do. I am in a state of confusion, I have no idea what‘s coming next. Everyone is urging me make a decision, but I just don‘t know. I don‘t know where I see myself in the next years. 

I feel like my time is running out and every second I don‘t know what to do, I‘m wasting important time I could have spend studying something else. I feel like a burden because my father has to support me financially. I‘m under such pressure, I just want to be free. I want to be a instructor in a beautiful paradise or travel with a caravan through the world with no liabilities. I want to support poor countries or something like that. But even if I would really do that (I don‘t think I will because it‘s too risky and financially insecure) I couldn‘t. I‘m bound to my family which I can‘t let alone, I‘m bound to my boyfriend of 4 years who would never live such life. I‘m bound, I feel captivated. I feel like I have to be another soulless gear in the machinery of the capitalist economy.

I’ve been asking for more shifts for about a month now, and nothing has really come out of it. In the past 3 weeks, I think I’ve only had 2 four hour shifts.

Living paycheck to paycheck is hard, and it isn’t what I wanted for myself. I quit my last job where I made great money because the job was soul sucking to the point that I felt sick coming into work every day. I wouldn’t go back, but I do miss not having to worry about money and being able to spend money on things I enjoyed and wanted, not just things I needed.

The job I was offered doesn’t sound like it would be as terrible as that one. It sounds like something I could manage to do, but it also doesn’t sound like something I’d enjoy. However, I can’t really know for sure until I start doing it. If I didn’t like it, the trade off would be that I would be making much more money than I am now.

I don’t know what to do. I wish I could do a trial - work the new job for a few months, see if I’m okay with it, and if not, go back to my current job, but obviously that’s not an option in real life.

I don’t know what to do. I want to be happy at my job - I’m not good at compartmentalizing like some people can, if I don’t like my job it starts to affect the rest of my life - but I also want to be able to save money and pay off loans and spend money without having to follow such a strict budget.

The problem is I was working seasonal while going to school. I’ve been looking for a job in between but I’ve not had any luck.

I doubt I can get any sort of loan to find somewhere to rent, and I understand I am an adult so it’s pretty much on me that I have no money or credit score. I might have to drop out of school if I leave my house too, because I don’t think osap will give me a loan because I was a dependant of a decent earner family.

I only really get to see him on weekends, as work and school kind of gets in the way during the week. But I spend the weekends at his house and we cuddle/sleep the entire time and just enjoy each others company. And that’s pretty much been our routine for a little over a month now. Boring weeks - and then we see each other on the weekend.

All of his friends say i’m doing really good things for him. like one of his friends said that “i’m healing him” and even that he loves me. (but i think he was just over exaggerating). Another said he “really likes me” and i should talk to him.

but the idea of pushing him on it or saying something wrong terrifies me. And as sad as it is, i’d much rather keep him as it is right now than risk loosing him. he’s far too precious to me.

772,"My (27m) partner (24F) has had trouble with her undiagnosed IBS for around 3 years now, causing her extreme difficulty to leave the house in case she needs the loo, this has become a phobia for her and as such she now has no social life, no friends, no job and depression.

she is living at home with her toxic family which are no help and she has recently been given a hospital appointment for a sigmoidoscopy, the prep for this was a self administered enema which she found INCREDIBLY difficult to do because of her developed phobia but she managed to get it done. This was then all cancelled while she was in the hospital in her gown ready to go and change to a colonoscopy a couple of weeks later.

The prep for this was to essentially starve herself for 24 hours which gives her issues with her stomach, shakes and migraines and then the night and morning before the operation, she needed to drink 1 litre of liquid that would work as a strong laxative. She did not manage to go through with this and i doubt she will ever be able to.

So now with no sign of an official diagnoses and any help that comes with it we are now losing hope. We have been together nearly 5 years now but the stress of having to be there for her and support her at all possible times is suffocating as I can't offer any real help and constantly having to stay positive is exhausting. In all our time together we've had maybe 4 fights that ended a few hours later because I am such a pushover when it comes to her which i am now seeing could have been detrimental to our relationship as I'm beginning to feel more like her father than her lover as weird as that sounds.

We are long distance at the moment as I am at university and she has managed to visit twice in 7 months whereas while she was at university i would visit every other weekend.

She is currently still looking for jobs but I don't think they'll help but only isolate her more as they have done in the past.

I am looking for any help for her as is the root of it all, if she felt safe to leave the house she could get a job, make friends, go out, visit me and enjoy her life again which is all i want for her as i do love her very much.

we're each other's ""bros"", basically. now, just today we were talking and he texted me ""i love you"" and my heart JUMPED but then he added something about me and him really vibing with each other, so i think he just meant it in a ""bromance"" way. i told him i loved him too, and he sent me some heart emojis and stuff. we're very affectionate with each other, and he's told me that im his ""top priority"" when i said that i didn't want to bother him while he was doing something.

the thing is, im honestly starting to love him. but, i dont know if he's interested in me in that way. im really scared that my feelings are going to hurt our friendship.

what should i do?",01Mar2020,1

786,"Basically title. I'm 17F and my parents have NEVER let me have social media because everyone online is a pedophile according to them. I've had it for a while and do freelancing work over it, I'm at no risk to myself or others. However my mom believes I spend too much time on my phone and wants to look through it when I get home. I went ahead and deleted Twitter, Reddit and Discord off my phone but is there a way I can talk to them to get them to ease up? I have hardly any privacy with them (my dad wanted to put a two way camera in my car and I'm pretty sure there's a tracker in there) but this rule bugs me the most.

If it helps I'm a good student with a 4.3, I don't ever sneak out or do drugs or anything like that, I have a circle of friends at school. I just enjoy talking to friends online and doing art for spending money. I looked at my phone and I spend maybe two hours average on my phone every day. I understand I'm being dishonest but I have NO privacy, no private life and no private *social* life. I can't be open with her about anything because she explodes every time.",01Mar2020,1
787,"Basically, I (16M) took a girl on a date and it went well on my end, however I guess she didn’t reciprocate the feelings.

That’s shitty and all but what I need help with is I invited her to my birthday party on the 8th this month before she “wanted to be friends”

789,"My boyfriend lives with his grandparents, we’ve been together 4 months now so I know them quite well. I’ve stayed over at his a few times and can hear his grandad (assuming it’s him) snoring really loudly at times. Sometimes I’ve heard him stop for a few seconds then start again as if he might of stopped breathing. 

I’m a bit of hypochondriac so have researched a lot about illnesses. Also watch a lot of documentaries about medical stuff. So because of this I’m always diagnosing people in my head. I’m probably wrong half the time anyway but I can’t help it.

His grandad also falls asleep really easily while watching tv even in the middle of the day which I know is a symptom. When I was round last time he was also telling me he’s going into to hospital because somethings wrong with his heart and they basically need to stop and start it. Sleep apnea can affect your heart also and chase high blood pressure.
 
I feel like I should say something because sleep apnea is quite dangerous but also feel like it’s not my place and bringing it up might be awkward. I also have pretty bad social anxiety so overthink these things and wouldn’t even know how to approach it. Maybe I’m just being weird here and it’s silly to mention it? How would I even bring it up?",01Mar2020,1
791,"Hi so I’m slowly trying to be pescatarian for health reasons but I live in a house full of meat eaters, two of which (my parents) will probably tease me to end for not wanting to eat meat. I was wondering if you guys have any recipes or just general advice for me? 

In my house we usually get fast food almost every Night so not eating meat is kinda hard for me and my mother hates anything that smells good (garlic, onions ect) so cooking is hard without upsetting her. Please give me some advice!",01Mar2020,1
792,"Me and my sisters parents are coming back to the states and expect us to stay with them

About 5 years ago our parents moved to Europe and left me and my sister behind because they wanted a “fresh start in life”. I had to live with my dad’s brother and my sister had to live with his sister.

Well during that time my sis was abused regularly and last year she moved in with me. Yesterday we got a letter from our parents saying that they were coming back and that they wanted to stay with us for a while. Me and my sister hated this idea because they abandoned us and unintentionally caused my sister to be abused.

We don’t want them back but they won’t be happy to know that they moved here for nothing, what should I do",01Mar2020,1
794,"Hi. I don't really know where else to put this, so I'm just gonna post it here.

We've been together for a while and our relationship has been unhappy for a decent portion of it. He shouts at me constantly and insults me, threatens me (as well as other people) whenever I do something that upsets him and gets hostile every time I disagree with any of his opinions.

I've been depressed since my childhood and how he treats me definitely doesn't make it any better. I consider suicide quite often and I've tried to speak with him about it, but when he promises to treat me better, nothing changes. I struggle to stand up for myself any more because I feel mentally exhausted.

I've tried blocking him before, but he's very stubborn and looks for other ways to contact me even when I do. He always promises that it'll be better next time, that he regrets what he's done and says he wants to help me improve my mental health.

Whenever he talks about wanting to kill himself, I try to encourage him to get therapy or talk to his friends and family. I've also given him self-help websites and phone numbers to call whenever he feels suicidal, but he doesn't want to use any of it because he feels like he can't make any progress without me.

What should I do?",01Mar2020,1
796,"I am a tall, slender, fairly muscular man with long dark hair and a naturally angry face. When I am not either genuinely really happy or consciously making myself smile, I am mistaken for being angry. I wear a lot of black and red clothes because they go well with my hair and eye colour. Many people who are now my friends have told that they initially found it difficult to approach or talk to me because they found me intimidating or thought I was angry at them.

The thing is, i'm not like that at all. I am rarely, if ever, angry and can be quite sociable once I get to know you, but I find it difficult to start conversations with people I haven't met before.

I'm pretty happy now, and have a decent group of friends, but next year I'm going to university and leaving all but one of them behind. How do I make myself less intimidating and more approachable to strangers to make the transition from school to university easier and less lonely?",01Mar2020,1
798,"Should I reach out to my aunt who hates me to tell her that my cousins account is hacked?

So I have two cousins, one who is 13 and another one who is 20. Me and the 20 year old have been banned from talking to the 13 year old or seeing her because of past cyber bullying incidents involving my aunt and her family. My aunt thinks we are terrible people and bad influences and has banned us from ever seeing her kids. Now my other cousin who is 11 has been following me for years. The 13 and 11 year old live together. 

A few days ago one of the 13 year olds accounts decided it wanted to follow me and talk to me which I thought was weird but ok. All of a sudden it kept bringing up past issues and how it was sad we never get to see eachother anymore and how she hates the 20 year old and how she even hates her own mother (she’s a mamas girl). And she’s sneaking around on her phone during school and yadda yadda. Weird...

And then asked me questions if I ever snuck around to talk to somebody and got in trouble (yeah with you when I was 14). 

Then she’s like nobody in my house knows I’m talking to you don’t tell anyone (who am I going to tell your mother hates me)
I thought it was the 20 year old for a while but idk.

My Instagram account is a private account. 

So then she said she was going snow tubing yesterday, meanwhile the account wouldn’t send me pictures of snow tubing or any selfies. Very one worded responses. I asked her sister if she was snow tubing with her sister and she said that her sister was at musical practice and she doesn’t think that’s the 13 year old. 

Today I said how’s my favorite cousin doing? Let’s share selfies with this filter. She didn’t even read it.


Then I called her out saying
“ listen here asshole, I know this is *20 year olds name* this is completely pathetic that you are hacking/impersonating our little cousin to try and talk to me. I knew it was you all along. You wouldn’t send me any selfies. My family is done with your drama. Leave us alone. It’s not funny. It’s not cute. I don’t want to talk to you or have anything to do with you. Yeah we both have made mistakes growing up and did some pretty shitty things to destroy this family but even I know impersonating/hacking someone is a crime and I wouldn’t do it. This is ridiculous. This conversation is over, goodbye” she still hasn’t read that yet but the account won’t load. I think she deleted it. But the messages are still showing. 

There are 3 other accounts out there....and I’m not sure if my 13 year old cousin knows she has access to them or not. Completely ridiculous. They haven’t tried to talk or follow me yet. 

My aunt hates us both with a strong passion. So idk if I should just let it go or bring it up but I feel like if I bring it up it would cause more drama.",01Mar2020,1
799,"I had a conversation with my parents about 2 or 3 years ago about my religion and what I believe in, and I told them I’m an Atheist. I don’t remember their reaction, nor do I really care to (because it’s my belief not theirs), but ever since that conversation they seem to be much more religious now, ESPECIALLY around me. Every single conversation we have in any which way, shape or form they bring up God or something in that regard. How can I respectfully tell them to “shut the fuck up, I don’t care about your religion?” Because I honestly feel like my beliefs are being respected.",01Mar2020,1

801,"Hey guys.... I wanted some advice. I tried texting my boyfriend why I have been feeling down and distant. I have a panic disorder so sometimes how I communicate doesn’t always come out well. Anyways I accidentally sent want to break up instead of saying don’t want to break up. I even sent a text after saying sorry explaining the error. It didn’t matter, he was angry, rightfully so. Anyways he said he wants to break up and wanted me to move out. I really tried explaining myself, having anxiety makes you not want to talk. I feel so stupid for not checking my text after I sent it because it led to a problem that I never intended to happen. I just wanted to talk about my feelings and aniexty. He was still adamant about breaking up, I feel so stupid right now, I keep wondering what’s wrong with me. I really do feel worthless, dumb and ugly. It’s such a horrible feeling and the anxiety makes it worse. What should I do now? Honestly I just wished I didn’t exist. We been together 4 years and have had our ups and downs but we always pull through. I cannot believe I lost a relationship over a typo. Now to be honest I’m quite scared ever opening to someone again because I will always feel like I’ll be wrong. He kept complaining that I never show him love, and to get my emotions together or get out. I feel like if even stay together he will be harsh on me so now I feel like I cannot express myself without feeling like the bad guy. I really do care about him but sometimes I think I’m not worth being loved but today....I will always believe that now.",01Mar2020,1
802,"I am the 21 F and I am stuck. PLEASE READ ALL BEFORE COMMENTING. 

I was 16 when I met him. He was 18. He was not the most attractive or had the IT factor. I was young, skinny, and beautiful. I just got out of a 1 year relationship in which that guy cheated one me 9/12 months. I just dated and wasn’t looking for anything serious. He was one of the guys I was dating and he wanted to become serious, I was hesitant because I didn’t want anything serious. I did get into a relationship with him but I didn’t think it was going to go that far. Neither did he. He treated me like I was a queen. He would do anything for me. If I needed hand lotion he would go grab some. If I wanted a drink he would bring it. He would help me with school work. He would love to spend anytime with me. It was amazing until I graduated (May 2016) and was going to attend a school that was 2 hours away so I could be closer to family. He said he was okay and we would make a long distance relationship work. I stayed a year to work and get more money. I had my own apartment and he never officially moved in but he would help pay for utilities and had a lot of stuff over. He lived with his oranges will. In Nov of 2016 (we started dating March 2015) I had found out I was pregnant and he changed. When I told him he was upset and didn’t want a baby. When we got more serious and talked about future I didn’t want kids or for awhile since I grew up raising 5 kids with my mom. He didn’t want kids either. I miscarried about two weeks later. It was January 2017 and I was still with him, this is one of the few times I resented him because he didn’t want the baby and I was so distant and resentful I knew we needed to split. But things got better and I stayed.

I found out in March 2017 I was pregnant and once again he wasn’t happy. When I told him I was keeping the baby he broke up with me. I went away for a few days and when I came back I had found out he had lied about telling his parents. He knew he messed up and wanted to be in our lives so we got back together. It was a mess but I stayed. He was depressed for a long time and skipped out on the first few appointments but his mom attended. He finally came to one and listened to the heartbeat and I could tell it changed. He really wanted a boy and when we found out it was a boy he sobbed. When I had our son I had never seen him so in love. In the midst of my pregnancy (I was 18 and he was 20 when we found out) things took a turn. It was his 21st birthday and I took him out to eat and first legal drink. I had found he signed up for dating sites that night. He also would stay over at my apartment and leave at mine. I saw his computer history at his moms and he would leave and go watch porn for a long time. I told him I wasn’t okay with it because he wouldn’t have sex with me and it seemed excessive. He then wouldn’t add girls and like their pictures. He got caught again watching porn. He would lie a lot about stupid shit. We had our son in Oct 2017 and even after the first week it was rough it was fighting because our fixer upper house wasn’t done and he didn’t help take care of the baby. 1 year was hell with us as a family. 2 year was better but we fought. I worked a job that didn’t pay a whole lot but for being 18-19 with no degree and a new mom my job as a paraprofessional is the best I could get. He did have the higher financial responsibilities but in May 2019 I got a very good job I work at now. We were going to close on a house in October 2019. We had a fight and I went to see family for three days and in when I came back he broke up with me. I moved out immediately into the same apartment from 2 years ago. I went to court and established paternity and child support. I had a surprise miscarriage in October 2019. In November he wanted to try again. This whole time even when we dating I had a suspicion he was cheating. I was his first everything btw. In January 2020 I found his second secret Snapchat and logged into it seeing all the girls and some of the chats. (Approx 20
Girls over the years) I confronted him and he admitted. It started in September 2016. I remember September 14 2016 I fell in love with him when we went to the state fair and we got a promise ring. He started a week or so before that. 

He said he missed the attention, excitement, and the chase. He would stop for a long time but do it again when we were fighting bad. He would ask for pictures and send stuff back. He swears he has not had sex with anyone else even when we broke up for two
Months. The girls he would talk to were easy and our small town ‘hoes’. When we broke up he went on four dates. One with an old coworker
which it was a date and truck deal (he owns a truck business). Two with a new girl and one with a girl when we met he had a crush on. She is older with two kids. When we met he only had a crush. I didn’t want them talking because of her reputation. I had asked all his girls for the truth and some were honest and others not. He was mad I went to them for the truth but he wouldn’t talk. She said they have always talked but nothing until we broke up. I knew about the three other dates with the other two girls but not with his long time crush. He said they only hung out nothing else. She said they ate some food and kissed. He tried saying after it he saw what she’s really about and he wasn’t interested. But she said he kept asking her out. They talked everyday until I caught him. He also had this friend at his work who has a bad reputation. He agreed to deleting and blocking everyone except for her. I said okay. They were friends but back in October they flirted and tried to be more when I found old texts. I was hurt that he once again protected another girl. He did block and delete her until he saw I liked a quote by a guy (the coworkers ex husband) he hates. That guy has been nice to me and has been helpful. He actually spotted them after our breakup a week later chilling in her car. Anyways, he sent a screenshot of the picture to the ex wife and started shit between them. (This is not the first time this has happened). He was mad and jealous  I liked a post. Anyways, he removed all females from facebook. Deleted Instagram and Snapchat. I have access whenever to whatever and the last check was good. But I’m lost. There was barely any trust and now there is none. I love and care for him but I’m scared I won’t be Able
To fall back in love. He may have stopped the cheating for now but I’m scared he won’t stop the stupid lying. He refuses to give up. He knows that means our family is at risk. That he could lose me and his son. He has bad anger is trying to work on it and wants to be a better father as well. I do see a therapist about all of this and we have talked it’s just I’m wanting some advice or thoughts. I’ve talked to guys who have cheated and they match with why he said he did it and helped shine a new light. We don’t talk to other people or see other people but we aren’t in a public relationship because we want to work on this privately away From family and friends who already have a stuck opinion. If you have any questions about this please ask as I’m asking for some thoughts and insight. Thank you!",01Mar2020,1
803,"Since January I am an a state of total change. I realized that I am not such a career person as I thought. I study chemistry and will have my bachelor in April. I planned to do my master first and PD after that. I literally planned my whole life, but then I realized it‘s not what I want. I am 21 now, turning 22 and spend my whole life studying. I rushed through the university with no time for friends, partys or anything similar, but had very good grades. 

When I look at my future I‘m frightened. I am afraid of the things coming, I don‘t like my study and don‘t want to continue it, even though I‘m one of the bests. But I also don‘t know what else to do. I am in a state of confusion, I have no idea what‘s coming next. Everyone is urging me make a decision, but I just don‘t know. I don‘t know where I see myself in the next years. 

I feel like my time is running out and every second I don‘t know what to do, I‘m wasting important time I could have spend studying something else. I feel like a burden because my father has to support me financially. I‘m under such pressure, I just want to be free. I want to be a instructor in a beautiful paradise or travel with a caravan through the world with no liabilities. I want to support poor countries or something like that. But even if I would really do that (I don‘t think I will because it‘s too risky and financially insecure) I couldn‘t. I‘m bound to my family which I can‘t let alone, I‘m bound to my boyfriend of 4 years who would never live such life. I‘m bound, I feel captivated. I feel like I have to be another soulless gear in the machinery of the capitalist economy.

Has anyone else experienced this? What do I do now? Many jobs I think about sound nice, but nothing makes me excited about my future. I‘m sunk in the ocean of options, well-knowing I could do nearly any job I enjoy, because I am extremely ambitious.",01Mar2020,1

809,"I'm 15 years old and I feel like such a screw up. I'm a below average student (1.2 GPA) and am honestly considering just giving up. I used to go to counseling for what happened before I moved in with my aunt almost 2 years ago. This was mostly because CPS (Child Protective Services) found out about what had gone on in my old house. I never really thought that had affected me in anyway whatsoever but it seems like everyone says it does. Anyways, I went to counseling because it was obvious I had serious confidence issues. I also had social anxiety and my counselor thinks I had some depression and ADD. I don't think it's necessary to talk about exactly how my childhood was. However, I wouldn't mind going into more depth if anyone wanted me to. I used to enjoy reading books and playing just about any sport. However, for some reason since I moved here, I've lost interest in reading and the only sport I still enjoy playing is basketball. The only thing I've really enjoyed since I was really young was listening to music and video games. People always tell me I'm very smart if I actually applied myself but I usually just disregard it. By the way, I'm just typing whatever comes into my head so I apologize if it's a little all over the place. But back to me having social anxiety, it's weird because up until grade 7, I was really social. I was always the ""class clown"". When I moved here I used to make jokes about my past and even though it was some dark humor, I still made people laugh, that was all I cared about. I think I just wanted to actually feel accepted. I never really got that with my father. As long as I made other people laugh it didn't really matter what I felt like. I've also never really been an emotional person so it's not like I ever vented to anyone. I probably should also mention that I used to be for the most part, an A or B student until 7th grade. So it's not like I've always been like this. I decided to make this because the mid-term report cards came in and as of right now, I'm failing in just about every class. I was getting yelled at by my aunt because of them which is another reason as to why I made this. I tell myself I tried to get my grades up but deep down, I honestly have no idea. If I really did try, wouldn't I be passing in my classes? If I'm being honest, I've contemplated suicide before. But I don't think I ever could. I'm absolutely terrified of what comes after death. I just feel like I'm not good enough for anyone. And I've ruined a lot of friendships. I used to be friends with pretty much everyone, even the ""weird kids"". But now, I have a very select few I even talk to anymore. I'm tired of being the kid that doesn't care. I want to have children someday. I want to do for them what my parents couldn't. I want to have children who don't have to worry if their dad's going to come home drunk the next morning. But I can't do that if I keep going on how I am right now. At this point I think I needed to just tell this to someone more than anything. I constantly find myself comparing myself to other people. I start to think, ""Why can't I do that?"" I feel insignificant compared to others. I just need help. If anyone actually read to this, I appreciate you so much. I think I just need advice on what to do. Because obviously for some reason I just can't feel motivated enough to get better grades. Anyways, I won't take anymore of your time. Thank you so much for reading this.

Waited 15 days, resent the email, waited another 15 and hit him up on instagram, where he apologised and responded to my email, which was now outdated since I made plans for the dates I first considered. Reply back a couple days later asking some questions, he replies back a couple more and I email him again asking when he'll be free in the month and some minor changes to the tattoo.

That was Feb 19th.

820,"I’ve been independent for a long time. I tried college out of high school but didn’t like my major, dropped out and decided to get a “real job”.

The older I get the more I feel like I’m just spinning my gears keeping things going but not moving forward. I’ve always had aspirations of...mildness at least lol. Not just a paycheck to paycheck life. But it seems like it’s one thing after the next that gets in the way, and keeps me right where I’m at. I need a real career. The few people I know who have them, got established with a base of support that got them through school or training. I don’t have that at all.

821,"Hey guys, throwaway since my boyfriend is also on Reddit.

Over the past 5 years, the sex has been rather bland. He’s not one to really initiate, and when we do have sex, he’s very quiet and indifferent. I’ve been in two long-term relationships in the past, and haven’t ever run into this problem. Other than the sex, our relationship is incredible. He’s genuinely my best friend and we still get giddy and excited about each other. There’s not a doubt in my mind that we’re still head over heels in love and very attracted to one another.

It’s also important to note that I haven’t really seen a decline in his sex drive since the beginning of our relationship. He’s just always been this way. I’ve had multiple conversations with him over time hoping that an opportunity to voice his feelings would solve the problem, but I always get the same answer: “I’m tired” or “sometimes I just want to come home from work and decompress.” When I was worried that there was possibly some sort of physiological issue, he brushed me off and refused to speak to a doctor.

After having sex last night, I brought up my concerns again to which he responded, “well sometimes you flinch when I touch you or you say negative things about your body and it’s frustrating.” I was sort of shocked because I felt he was deflecting the root of the issue on to me. I’m very ticklish so sometimes I do tend to laugh or flinch when he touches me unexpectedly. And yes, as a female, I’m not always super confident about my appearance, but I wouldn’t say either of these things are out of the ordinary or happen frequent enough to be that bothersome. I was actually pretty upset that he called out those things as the reason for his lack of sex drive and I ended up going to bed pretty upset. It just doesn’t seem to add up.

I’m at a loss. As I mentioned, our relationship is really great beyond this issue. I don’t feel sexy in the bedroom anymore because I get zero reaction or emotion when we do hit the sheets. How do I move forward when I feel like I’m sacrificing my sex life for someone who doesn’t care to address the root of the problem?",01Mar2020,1
822,"My cousin and I were best friends. She’s a couple years older 4 to be exact. We bonded roughly 8 years ago when we both broke up with long term boyfriends. And built a relationship on partying and going to bars. Over the last couple of years we’ve both evolved dated people/changed jobs/changed careers. But still continued a relationship of parting together. I landed a once in a life time career opportunity a couple months ago and decided to clean up my act. Which she gave me shit for working so much. Was passive aggressive I took another friend to my Christmas party. She would never text me to hang out during the week but would blame me for the fact we didn’t have a friendship anymore because I left to visit my parents on the weekends. She threw a fit one afternoon on my friend and I cause we didn’t want to drink and party at a festival. I finally called it quits when she dragged me to a guys house for a dinner party who was a total loser and she was into the fact “he had money” which he deff did not. I told her I thought he was a joke and she told me I should not be so opinionated. She never respected when I would say no. Or I would say I wanted to cut back drinking and do healthy sober things together. As drinking wasn’t just a couple casual drinks. It was getting completely fucked up till 4 am or a day or two bender. I’m not interested in that lifestyle anymore. Am I wrong that I expressed we don’t have the same interests/taste in men/ priorities anymore?

836,"So. I'm 28 in a few days (F). I have atypical autism but most people don't really notice. This means I can't just take whatever job and succeed. I simply can't concentrate and do it well if the work isn't interesting to me. I'm very frustrated by this but don't seem to be able to do anything about it. On top of that my interests is very niche and hard to get a job within. (props and other creative jobs. They simply don't have money to hire). I've had jobs in the past like dishwasher and salesperson, but they've all ended in failure. Either because of miscommunication (apparently that happens more than I'm aware of) or I'm just not made for that job (I'm not a born salesperson for example). I've had a job at a theatre for a short period and I LOVED making this stuff. 

Anywho. My dad keeps harassing me about it. Tells me I'm lazy. Tells me to just pull myself together. I've explained the situation more than once but it doesn't seem to get in his head. I've even cut contact several times and told him I have to do it for good, if he keeps doing it. It's so destroying. 

I'm lucky I have my mom as a neighbor and she helps me a lot (she's a psychiatrist so it doesn't ruin her). This is of course not the optimal solution and I'm bored when I don't have a job. And of course I want to be self sufficient. 

The big problem is my dad. As explained above he keeps going on and on about and I really don't know what to do anymore. He doesn't seem to understand that it's destroying me. On top of that he can be chauvinistic at times and just not listen, cause it's just not important to listen apparently. Last time I visited him I told him his cat (my cat I can't have because of my dogs) is hurt since she gets mad when I lift her, which isn't normal. I told him calmly and he just brushed it of and ignored me. I did it again to no avail. He only listened when I started getting mad at him and finally took her to the vet. Then he complains I don't behave nicely and is always mad and in a bad mood. No wonder when that is the only time he notices. 

Also. He will harass my mom if I stop answering my phone. I warn her ahead of time and told her not to answer since it's destroying her too. 

He doesn't get that I'm only like this with him around because he's like this. 
The only reason I've stayed is because of guilt and the fact he can help me/us with projects like repairing stuff and painting (he's a craftsman). I can't get myself to call him dad, so I call him by his name. I guess that tells something about our relationship. 

I hope this is enough information. I don't know what to do from here. (This evening I yet again had an argument on messenger with him and told him not to contact me again and not to contact my mom either...of course he didn't listen)",01Mar2020,1
837,"Hello guys. I’m in a bit of a pickle.

I would appreciate your insights and opinions if you decide to read my piece. It is rather lengthy. But here’s my story.

Background:  
My girlfriend (27F) and I (27M) are together since 2013 (7 years) now and before this period we had a relationship for 2 years (2006-2008) before my family moved to another city. We were each other’s first girlfriend/boyfriend and eventually, lovers. Partly because we were in high school, had no money or any mode of transportation, our relationship slowly withered away when I moved. But the main reason was she wasn’t allowed by her parents to see me or have any contact with me. The reason: I was not white/ethnically not Western/foreigner/muslim. I didn’t even practice Islam. But how should they know, since they’ve never talked to me or seen me. Our relationship was therefore almost completely secret those 2 years. Fastforward to 2013, we both went to college in the same city, but not the same school and eventually got in touch. We were both older now, had more money and transportation options. So we starting dating and both realized and admitted that we never forgotten about the other and still cared deeply for each other. That commenced the start of our relationship, once again a secret one. After a couple of years, we both grew tired of the secrecy and the lies and one day she told her parents and her family. They were very upset and angry with her. Her mom even ignoring and neglecting her at times (when she came home after having spent the weekend with me). And her sister calling her a traitor to the family. Her dad also did not approve, but was less active on the mental aggression part. However, she stayed strong and every weekend came over to my place. Time chipped away at her family’s hate, since we showed them that we were serious about one another. In all those years I only visited them a couple of times at their home, and only in the last 2 years. I only did this for my girlfriend. To get her unstuck between a rock and a hard place. I had to overcome my pride to make this sacrifice, because I wanted to see her happy. Those few times were very awkward. Her mom ignored my presence altogether and her dad made snarky jokes all the time (his way of bonding according to my girlfriend). It was a first step and those are often the most uncomfortable ones. But they were a necessary investment I believed. I did that for a couple of times and once we got a shallow relationship and they knew a bit about who I was, I stopped going there. Because I was completely uncomfortable/on guard the whole time there. 

The pickle:  
Like most couples, we also did want to eventually live together. My girlfriend was financially in a better position than I was. So much so, that she was able to afford a house (of course with a mortgage) on her own. So we talked about the situation: that we wanted to live together, but also that I could not get a high enough mortgage with these inflated house prices, but she could. So we talked and talked and she kept getting more enthusiastic about buying a house on her own (of course her parents influenced her in this decision). Eventually it came down to the point where I told her that if she wanted to buy a house, I wouldn’t stop her, because it is her money. I did not want to limit her freedom. However, most importantly, I told her that I would not want her to buy a house in her parents’ town, considering our history and that even now, her parents and I have the most weird and stunted relationship one can have with their in-laws. She was free to do so if she really wanted, but I would not want to live there. I told her this numerous times. I assume you can guess where she bought a house. Yep. In her parents’ town. Initially I was happy for her, because it was so hard getting a house, but I also immediately felt disappointed. I knew she had hoped that I would eventually move in with her. The house she had bought was an okay house, nothing wrong with it, but my girlfriend wanted an ultra-modern home, with lavish conveniences. So together with her parents, her sister and her sister’s boyfriend (who is a carpenter, but knows how to build a house), they decided to completely renovate the house. They would do this in the evenings and the weekends, and it would approximately take 1.5 year to get everything done and for it to become habitable. My girlfriend asked me if I would please come in the weekends to help with the house (of course I wanted to help her), but more importantly, to build a relationship with her family (we also slept at her parents’ house during the weekend). About this I was hesitant, because again of the history. However, once more, I gave in for the sake of her happiness and our relationship, and I decided to help her (and them) out every weekend. O boy what a grave mistake! The first two weekends were awkward, but survivable. Her parents and I decided to give each other a fair chance of getting to know each other (thanks to my gf mediating that process) and her mother and sister, whom first ignored my entire existence, were awkwardly super friendly. However, then came the third weekend. I arrived on a Friday and we worked a bit in the house, and then went to her parents’ home to eat and sleep. The following morning things escalated. We were having breakfast (my gf, her dad and I) when her dad began to ridicule my parents and my family. His way of making jokes and ‘bonding’. He joked that he was paying for my parents’ existence because he paid income tax and they were on welfare (my dad suffers extreme PTSD and has physical limitations he got during the war in the country where we are from, while my mother takes care of him). He joked that my sisters should look for other jobs since they help non-western foreigners in this country (one sister helps foreigners integrate into the society and another studies law and did her internship at an institution where foreigners can be aided when they have questions etc.). I was fuming on the inside and wanted to hit this man so bad. I couldn’t make out a word and could only look at him with furious anger. Sensing this, my girlfriend tried to de-escalate the situation and change the subject, which she did successfully, but the whole thing was done for me in that moment: my girlfriend who didn’t really stand up for me, the house, her parents, everything. I thought about leaving that moment, but was too angry to leave peacefully. I was physically shaken. I eventually helped that day in the house, which gave me time to decide what to do. When it was time for dinner, we went to my girlfriend’s parents house, I packed my stuff and left without saying a word, while everybody was at the table, ready to eat and waiting for me. My girlfriend came running after me, but went back inside when she realized she couldn’t stop me from leaving. Since then (a year ago), I have never spoken to or seen her parents again. She told me that they also don’t want to have anything to do with me. And now that the house is nearing its completion, my girlfriend is on the daily trying to convince and persuade me to come live with her there. Her parents live 1KM away, and her sister 500M. I told her that I will never feel at home or comfortable so near her family, and that I can’t just abandon my parents (I help them with their finances, administration, and much more) to go live in/near the lion’s den.

I am not sure what to do. Leave my girlfriend (I do feel some betrayal from her)? Live with her there and possibly save our relationship, but abandon my parents? Don’t live with her there and risk our relationship, but be there for my parents? What do you guys think? Have you guys have had any similar experiences? And what did you do?

tl;dr  
my girlfriend bought a house in her parents’ town, who despise me for who and what I am. And now she wants me to live with her, which also means leaving my family behind. What should I do? Has she betrayed me by buying a house in her parents’ town and chosen them instead of me?",01Mar2020,1

She acts like a complete jackass to my friends opinions, doesn't take any helpful advice, and is hurtful a lot of the time. One of the main reasons I broke up with her, was because of her radical right opinion. (I RARELY have an issue with people expressing their political opinions) (I also don't completely blame her for this because this is how she was raised) She would often talk to me about how she dislikes the LGBT community, which I very much disagree with and she would express these opinions in public, which made me very uncomfortable. I also broke up with her partly because of her personality, but I obviously didn't tell her that. Whenever I would give her advice to not say stupid things, she would completely ignore me and do it anyway. Whenever someone in our friend group expresses something she doesn't like, she goes off on a tangent about how she hates it and it's really annoying and it's pissing me off. It's especially bad when someone expresses a democratic opinion within ear range of her. She will basically go off on that person's opinion with the most ""colorful"" vocabulary. I want to essentially just tell her how much of a jackass she's being and tell her if she wants to be friends with me, she needs to change, because I've had it. The problem is is that shes always with my main friend group, and it's kind of difficult to get away from her.

850,"This might be an incredibly inane problem for a lot of people but here we go:

I have a good understanding of politics. I follow news, and have studied law systems, constitutions, political theory, etc.

I am a liberal leftist. I'm not really looking to change my point of view, but I have always striven to maintain an unbiased consumption of media. I've usually read BBC News, but have recently switched to Reuters as I have noticed a loss of objectivity, especially regarding the Conservative Party. I also don't subscribe to any Youtubers with a particularly obvious political bias, I follow almost every party leader on Twitter, etc. 

My point is that I try my best to have an unbiased consumption of political news, or at the very least a balanced one. I've recently bought Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand to what all the fuss from free-market-freaks is about, and to see if she could convert me. I feel that over-consumption of partisan media is a tremendous threat to democracy and one of the main problems with a majority of voters.

But in all this I can't help but feel like I'm not giving myself space to develop my ideas. I don't really allow myself to listen to people I might agree with to maintain objectivity, but therefore don't have access to new ideas that might improve and develop my beliefs. I know this all might seem inconsequential to some but I come from a very political family, and care greatly for global politics. 

Should I compromise my objectivity to inform my opinion, or should I inform my opinion as best as I can from objective-as-possible sources. I expect the answer will be balance - but what kind of balance?",01Mar2020,1

I’ve been rather worried recently. I have a friend that will occasionally hold conversations with me, but from time to time, he’ll kind of drift away. One worded responses when texting, shutting me out, and overall just a drift. It depends on the length of time when this happens, and I tell him that it’s alright and I’m here if he needs me. He just kind of shuts me out, and I get that he doesn’t have to tell me, but it just worries me. I brought it up to him that I don’t talk to him as often, and that kind of sparked a tiny, rather (once again) dead conversation, but I’m not sure. It doesn’t necessarily help that I’ve liked this person for a couple of months, and that may just be causing me to not react in the same way that I would a normal friend.

He was nice at first, just talking about food and how he was going to visit a friend. But then he creeped into asking me if I was dating anyone, how old I was, told me I looked like a model (I really don’t lol), saying he wanted to see me again sometime etc etc.

I was a dumbass and told him what street I lived on (not my address or anything) and now I’m freaking out because 1. I can’t go back to the library for awhile because I’ll probably see him again and 2. What if he starts hanging around my area and sees me and finds out where I live?? I’m moving soon but it’s literally one building down from where I live now. 

I want to believe he was just doing the whole “older guy that thinks he’s being flattering and is also probably lonely” routine and doesn’t actually have anything malicious planned but the stories I’ve heard have made me so paranoid. I just wanted to be nice to this dude because people can be so horrible to homeless people but older guys ALWAYS get creepy with me. :/",01Mar2020,1

859,"Exactly what it says on the tin, but let me elaborate.

I am a nineteen year old girl living in a country where the age of consent is sixteen. I have known a friend for three years, who is now thirty going on thirty one. I have very recently been intimately involved with him, though for unimportant reasons have stopped, though we are still friends. Today we were talking about sex, and he asked if he could share an experience that haunted him for years. I don’t quite remember all the details, but I will try to recall as best I can.  
He told me that when he was twenty years old, he met a girl and became rather close with her, though tried to back off when he learned she was fourteen. Nothing physical had happened between them at that point. There was a point where she had followed him home, and had threatened that if he didn’t have sex with her, she would tell everyone that they had, and that he would receive jail time. Being twenty and scared, he did what she asked. It only stopped after a little while when she decided that he wasn’t into her anymore (he never was, and did what she asked only under duress).

I was horrified when he told me, and I wished that back then he had refused, as I don’t think he would have gone to jail with only rumours. He is part of a minority group in my country and I believe thought that in part because of this people would take her side of the story as fact. I want to believe him and I know that the situation is plausible, but part of me thinks that even being as young as he was, *she was still fourteen*, and couldn’t have been that powerful. I don’t know what to think of him. I had an attraction for him recently, and have been his friend for a while, but how do I move on from this? CAN I move on from this? What should I do?

For example, if I see something interesting on Reddit, I'll immediately want to send it to somebody instead of taking a moment and appreciating it. If I take any action in life, such as deciding what to do, it'll be influenced by who I am with at that point in time. So if I'm with that friend who recently got into MIT, I'll immediately think of going to the gym because I somehow want myself to be related to that friend and going to the gym is something I can realistically do that terms as being ""productive"". 

If I'm with that friend who spends his nights playing online video games, I'll try to play games as well. I'm easily influenced by other people and I feel alienated to my own self. I also can't focus on activities in life.

My big bro just recently passed away very suddenly at the young age of 46. I'm at a complete loss and my mind is absolutely racing with trying to understand this situation.  One thing I keep thinking of is setting up a scholarship fund for kids who want to take music lessons locally.  My brother was an avid guitar player and instilled a deep love of music in me my whole life. He would play with his friends and helped teach a coworker to  how to play guitar well enough to get a college scholarship.  I think this would speak volumes on the kind of person he was and to be able to share his passion.  
Does anyone have any experience in setting up a small fund locally? Or could point me in the right direction.

Note: English is my first language, i'm just bad at it. I'm also shit at using a keyboard.

I am really struggling to write this but I feel like it is needed.

Me and my friends (15-16), all play playstation together. We also play with a random person who is 23, who we will call harry for convieniences sake. Recently, I got onto my ps4 to find that I had recieved a 3-day ban. I was completlely confused as I had only messaged 2 people for a few months, one of my real mates, and Harry. So, I went onto my phone and messaged my friend to ask if he or Harry (I only talked to him on playstation), had reported me, even if it was just meant as a joke. My friend replied to my message and said neither had done it. Although I didn't think it would be them, I thought it would be best to ask just in case as they were literally the only people who could be suspects. Nothing personal, just they were the only logical suspects.

The 3 days go by, and I get online to find messages from Harry. He was being extremely aggressive and telling me stuff like that I was chatting shit behind his back, and ruining his name. Obviously, I was completely taken back, especially considering that all that I had done was ask my friend to check with him to see if he'd reported me. He asks me who it could possibly be (who had I spoken to in messages in the 9 days before being banned) and I explained that it was literally only him and my mate (Who we shall call Tim from now on). He stops talking and I assumed that he had calmed down).

The next day, I am talking to another friend when I get a party Invite from Tim. I check the party invite screen to see if Harry is there, and indeed, he is. Tim sends me a message saying that Harry will only talk to me if I appologise. Now this is where I potenially became an asshole. I said no. I said that I did nothing wrong, and that he blew everything completlely out of proportion. I didn't join the party because A, I was playing with my other mate, and B, the atmosphere would be absolutely awful. I know that giving him the apology would have solved it but I guess I just didn't want to make myself look like a bad guy for asking a simple, non-aggressive question. I didn't say this, but I personally believe that he just wanted to feel powerful and in charge for making someone appologise.

Talking to my friends the next day, I found out that he believed that I was making an exuse to play on a minecraft pc realm with some other friends (Before the whole ordeal, I had disappeared from playstation for a few days to play on a realm which one of my best friends had made, as I have never played with him outside of school before as he had always had xbox), and using him as the scapegoat. This is completely untrue. In fact I didn't even play Realms during my ban, I just didn't feel like it.

Now, My friends have to balance spending time with me and Harry (I'm not completely destroyed by this as it gives me a chance to play some single-player games), but it has split us up quiet a bit and i'm nervous we will end up drifting from each other because of it. Harry apparently told Tim that he would stop playing with them if things weren't sorted, but I told Tim to tell Harry that I said don't worry about us being split up. I also explained to Tim that if I went into a party with Harry also being there, the atmosphere would be absolutley dreadful and it was best for the happiness of everyone that we did not mix again.

In July my dad passed after a long battle with multiple sclerosis and a shorter battle with cancer. He was always an active guy but this caused the last part of his life to be spent paralyzed in a wheelchair and unable to care for himself.  It was difficult, but he always kept his spirits up despite the situation he ended up in. 

Now that he’s gone longer and longer I feel myself having a harder and harder time coping or just able to live my life. Two months after he passed I was laid off from my job, and I’ve been unemployed since. I know it hasn’t helped, and I am starting a new job at the end of the month. 

This doesn’t seem like it’s helped the awful feelings I keep developing. I feel like I’m in a rut, I’m home a lot to save money, and as a result I feel like my less than cheerful self has pushed away friends as I seem to require more help than just a “sorry for your loss”.  It’s affected both my relationship with my roommate and my long time boyfriend and now I just feel stuck. My dad was my favorite parent as I was an only child and he always gave the best advice I took to heart. We talked candidly towards the end of his life about more grown up topics, like his first marriage and my relationship and getting old, etc.  My mom and I have a great relationship, but it’s hard as my dad was always the peacemaker if we ever got into a spat. Now that there’s nobody there between us, I feel like our relationship is going sour too and that breaks my heart. 

I guess I’m just hoping for advice from people who have been through a similar thing. I feel like I lose everything I touch and I’m a cancer of sadness that can’t seem to pick myself up when I need it. A good majority of my life (relationship, housing situation, etc) is in a transition period where I know I’m not in the final outcome and therefore I’m just not happy where I am. And it feels impossible to be happy in a situation I know isnt what I really want right now.

My  father and I live together and I provide the most income to keep us in  our house. We found someone that would live with us which is supplanting  my income for rent which lifted a huge weight on my shoulders. Recently  though, this housemate has been driving us crazy (we think they have a  couple of bolts loose)

1. They  showed up with a uhaul truck of stuff and dumped it on our driveway  without ever asking if we had space to put it somewhere. They said they  knew we have garage space, and we reluctantly said yes because of how  bad it looked to have all their shit on our driveway.
2. They eat our food relentlessly. We've resorted to hiding various snacks because they are gone when we aren't looking.
3. Lately,  they have been very passive aggressive. We ran out of toilet paper in  their bathroom, and instead of asking politely to restock, they sent  both of us an email of a picture of the bathroom with the caption ""Looks  like we are out of toilet paper, wonder who's gonna fix that"" with tons  of laughing emojis.

The  last straw was that they have accused us of going into their room and  stealing their things like bracelets and clothing. The only time I have  ever been in there was to set up the TV connection.

894,"I'm 26 years old, currently unemployed. I didn't do well at school, but there always were subjects like art, literature or languages in which I was one of the best students in my class. I was one of the kids who either got Fx in something or an A. There was rarely something in between but the classes where I did well where usually the As for me. I have always been the anti-system kid, I learnt what I liked and ditched the subjects I considered to be boring. 

After high school, I decided to continue my studies at a university. I got good A-levels at my native language, English and the history of art (voluntary subject at my school), while I did worse at others. It was good enough for me to continue my studies, but not enough to get into a really good university. So, I was accepted to a university which at the time was new and seemed to be mediocre, but the not the worst. I studied journalism, partly out of frustration that I couldn't really study art and partly because I wanted to be a journalist. 

I finished my bachelor's degree there, but the university went downhill pretty fast. It went from mediocre to a really bad one and I wanted to continue my studies. At the time, I hung out with a lot of intellectuals. People who were interested in philosophy, maths, physics etc. and I felt myself slowly growing out of the stupid rebel  phase and slowly finding my way into academics and its different fields. 

I decided to move abroad and follow my dream of being an artist and my love of literature and the written word. I finished my studies and did a decent job studying in my third language. But I met a guy, a guy who promised a lot and made me move back to my country of origin. 

Now I've been stuck here for 2+ years, and I have been struggling so much. I think those high school teachers who gave me those Fs were all right and I should've become a freaking baker or whatever... I have a good master's degree from a decent university but it's not helping at all. 

After coming back to my country of origin, I tried my luck at journalism. I've changed 3 jobs since and all of them were absolutely totally awful and made me so desperate, I just wish I could change my whole career. 

My first job made me hunt the mourning families of the ones that have been killed or committed suicide, because those articles brought the news the highest numbers of readers. I broke down after 4 months, feeling like an absolute human trash that shouldn't even be alive. 

My second job made me copy articles from others, because I was supposed to write 5+ articles a day, and there was never enough time for any decent work. My boss always made me write more in less time, while coming up with my own topics and methods of investigation. There was no editor everything was just up to me. Nobody could check the articles and even if somebody did, every smallest mistake was followed by strong language, humiliation and mockery. My ""boss"" at the time was 17 years old.

I switched to another platform after 9 months, and it had been great at start but became the same after some time. The two media platforms are basically the same, only have different bosses. I thought that writing similar articles with different people would be okay for me, but after 10 month my ex ""boss"" from the second platform somehow appeared there and they gave him a job. I left shortly after he got his job there. I spent there my 11 months. 

Now I've been unemployed for 2 months and I don't know what to do. I don't know if it's me who is the problem? Have just been unlucky? Am I stupid? Should I switch my career focus? Should I move abroad again? I just...don't fucking know. 

People are starting to look at CV and ask me, why I switch my jobs so often and it makes me feel like a trash. I fucking don't want this. I worked so incredibly hard to improve myself, become better, smarter and more educated and it was all for nothing,",01Mar2020,1

Not that it really matters, or that it's that much but it's a little background to why I am how I am. I grew up mainly in Florida (I moved around between 2007-2010 quite a few time) and ended up in upstate NY where I have been since I was in middle school. I like it here and I have made a lot of friends and I met my boyfriend here who I love but every year I think about going back to Florida and lately I've been wanting to even more. I know my boyfriend isn't too much into it but I haven't gotten super serious about leaving yet. But especially during winter here I really miss it and it's a lot like homesickness but more intense. It's been a thought in my subconscious that I will actually act on it, but I'm worried about cutting the relationship off even though I would want him to find someone here he can settle down with and stay where he likes. Also, I have a full time job here and I don't have a car her, but mostly I have established myself as an adult in NY.

899,"Hey guys and girls

Me and my ex girlfriend of 5 years have been off and on for the past 5 months since we broke up 

We both love eachother and have a daughter together but have been through a bit of a rough patch that made it hard for us to work together 

This is the second time we have been broken up now and last time I didn’t want to lose her, I had pretty bad depression and pretty much depended on her for my happiness 
I’ve pulled myself out of my rut now while we were broken up the first time but she’s still pretty depressed (she had a really tough pregnancy which made life hard for the both of us) 
She has started seeing a psychologist which seems to be helping and she is getting better and I love the person she is becoming 

All this being said though I’m 23 years old and not sure if I’m ready to settle into a relationship now, I’m not going to abandon my daughter before anyone jumps onto that I still spend 50% of the week with her

The problem is now that I’m single again and feeling almost on top of the world I’ve discovered a life that I want to live as a single person that I can’t live with her and I’m really stuck trying to make a decision because I really do love her, if I could have it my way I’d take 1-2 years to myself and then pick up where we left off but that’s not really fair to her 

I really don’t know what to do, we had a talk the other day and I agreed to remove all dating apps from my phone so we can work on our relationship and try to fix things but I’m not sure if that’s what I want anymore

Any advise will be appreciated I dont really know where else to turn aside from the wise folk of reddit",01Mar2020,1

I want to keep the relationship, but she told me she wants to fit in (I’m sorta the therapist of my group, everyone tells me their problems), and I just don’t understand. She’s sort of becoming a try hard now, and I don’t know how to tell her. The last time I tried to tell her something was when she opened all my stuff without permission, and I said, “look, I’m fine with you looking through my stuff, but perhaps you could ask me first? Some of my stuff is private and I don’t know who else might see it.” She replies in the stereotype teenager tone, with an “ooookkk!” And she’s then tilted her head back a bit and walked away to talk to others.

906,"I've been having a severely hard time since I was diagnosed with depression by my psychiatrist alongside some psychotic delusions, it has been a terrible experience for me overall.

I love people a lot, I am very needy when it comes to relationships of any kind. I need to be in contact with others, otherwise, I'm not very happy and I don't function well, however, I can ""live"" with it.

I went to my psychologist on Friday (I go to the psychologist too) and we spoke about how I love people and how I like to be in a relationship. Since I told her that I had a ""good"" relationship with the people I am surrounded with, she thought it would be a great idea to tell them how much I loved them, so they answer the same thing back and show me that I have support.

Now, my parents and my very few friends didn't really care when I told them about the depression thing, they also didn't really care when I cut contact with people for around a month due to the depression. I didn't hear from any of them in that month, too.

I suspected that I wasn't really important in their lives, but my delusions made me believe I was something important. How wrong I was.

I contact my 4 friends and tell them that I love them as my friends along with this long message expressing the situation I'm going through right now, however, 2 moved on and didn't react to it, 1 told me that I was exaggerating and that they didn't really love me back because I was the least important one in the group after all and, my friend, who is also my crush, thank me and said that he didn't love me back. He also stated that he didn't want any drama so it would be better if I just backed off and came back when I was ""feeling better"".

I haven't felt so heartbroken in my life...I went as far as to create a fake account just to write shitty messages to the girl my crush liked, she didn't take it well obviously and she stated that she would find out who I was.

I did it due to a fit of rage.

I felt so shitty in that moment but it wasn't her fault, I really want to apologize to her...this will make me to to hell probably.

But, returning to the main point, when I told my parents about it, they didn't care either. They told me that it was probably an attempt for them to give me more money, because I would never say anything like that and blah blah blah.

They also said that they didn't love me back.

The truth is, nobody loves me, and I might never get any love from anyone in this state of being. I dislike everything about myself and the fact that no one loves me is probably my fault.

I will tell my psychologist and psychiatrist about this, but I don't see any hopes at all.

I don't want to keep going if I'm never going to be loved.

908," Hi all, first time posting.

Quick summary: My sister's girlfriend is toxic and abusive to everyone and I never want to deal with her again.

Abusive girlfriend will be AB, sister will be sister, we'll call my partner john and my mum is mum

Today, an altercation came about between my partner and my sister's partner. It happened because my sister was screaming at me like an utter banshi for simply saying 'I heard AB yelling too.' Apparently that was me talking out of line and getting involved in their argument. (which woke me up, and all I could hear was AB telling my sister to shut her dirty fucking mouth, and that she's a fat trampy cunt. (I know, lovely right?)

So anyway, I said that and AB EXPLODED with anger, screaming at me and blaming me for their argument. So, I sighed, and went downstairs to make a cup of tea. Then, out of nowhere- The skies ripped open and all anyone would could hear was my sister screaming that I come to the bottom of the stairs and sort this out. Her voice was so aggressive, that it startled John. Causing him to come out of the kitchen and stand with me, to witness my sister screaming about how it's my fault. (I don't know what was my fault, but there we are.)

So John, already vexed, opened the front door and shouted that AB leaves. (AB often tells my sister to scream at me, hit me, etc.) She refused and began to shout at him. He began to climb the stairs to hook AB's collar and drag her out of the house. (I know it may not have been the wisest option, even if he was angry.) My sister stepped into the middle of them and slipped, falling on her bum but she was perfectly fine. As John went to reach for AB's collar again, his nail caught her neck and left a red mark. She called the police and told them she had just been assaulted.

My reaction was to call my mum and get her to come home. Mum came and then eventually so did the police.

John was taken too the police station for a non-custodial interview. AB lied in her statement and said that John had hit her in the face 5-6 times and pushed my sister down the stairs. The case was thrown out because AB and my sister had already admitted she slipped, and she had no marks but the single red line.

After John left with the police, AB and sister were still here and trying to start more shit. 'I got video evidence on my phone'. I also have video evidence of times prior that she has just exploded and showed signs of being a danger to herself and others. She has a record of being a public nuisance, racism, threats with the intent to do damage to mental health, reputations and my tenancy.

What can I legally do to keep her away from my family, or get my nuclear revenge?",01Mar2020,2

I've had quite a few moments of doubt in the relationship, but lately I'm starting to feel resentment because he has completely run out of his savings and it doesn't seem that he's putting much into finding a job.

His parents have sent him a bit of money, but I'm so frustrated that he hasn't started applying until November when he talked about finding a job last summer. I'm a 23 year old student and have supported myself completely since I was 17 and am quite ambitious. He is 31 now and  doesn't seem to have any goals that he wants to work towards. 

Is it wrong to break up over this? I don't care about money, but I want him to make something (as I am and I believe in contributing equal regardless of sex). He is applying and to be fair, it's hard to find a job here but if it were me, I would try a lot harder. These days I am urging him to try harder and it makes me feel like I'm the bad guy.

Throwaway account. So heres the situation: me, being a dumb teenager looking for something to smoke, rummages through my mom's purse for cigarettes. First I find a shit ton of lighters, which I mean isn't all that unusual considering she does smoke, but I think 10+ lighters might be a little overboard to just have in your purse. 

Anyway, I move on to another pocket and I find two packs of cigarettes, nice. I grab one and open it to find... a plastic bag. Not like a little ziplock bag that weed usually comes in or shopping bag, just a plain clear bag. I pull it out a little further and see a pretty big, clear, shiny looking rock with the plastic bag wrapped around it. It was about maybe 2 inches tall and looked like a white quartz. I just stared at it and put it back in the cigarette box, didnt even bother checking the other box for actual cigs. 

How can I tell if this was actually meth or if it might be something else? It really doesnt look far off from pictures of meth I see on google, but most of them show smaller sized rocks, not something like what I found. My mom is kind of into all that crystal healing and energy auras bullshit so theres the possibility that she might just have it in there for good energy or some shit, but why would she hide it? And why would it be in a bag? This is also not the first time I've found stims in her purse, she had some adderall in a pill bottle with her diet pills that I'm pretty sure she got from her friend.

Both my mom and dad had drug problems around when I was born. My dad was a hardcore meth user, and I've found out from my mom's friends that she used to have a bad heroin problem. I know that my mom definitely has connections to get pretty much anything, but I am just so shocked that she would be using meth, after all that she's told me about how she tried to save my dad from it. 

I could try and snap a picture of the rock next time I'm able to, and look in that other cig box to see if theres a pipe or something that might confirm that this is even a drug. Or should I just confront her about it, damning myself if I'm wrong, since she'll probably be pissed I'm snooping through her shit, but possibly opening up a conversation about what it is or what shes been going through to make her use? Both me and my mom have gone through a very traumatic experience recently (whole other story, we were being stalked, had our lives threatened and had to move two states away), and that could definitely be a reason she decided to use. 

Fuck. I hate this, I'm concerned for my mom and I just need some advice. What do you guys think I should do? Any help is appreciated.",01Mar2020,1

Is it a healthy thing career-wise to have this kind of attitude? Is just being dynamic and changing my career path at the first drop of an offer a good thing? I'm not necessarily someone who has a static career goal in mind. I like to change as the circumstances/career offers present themselves.

I'm still alive and healthy, my siblings seem to be fine, and I don't get belittled and insulted \*every\* day, so would it still count? And it's not like I have solid proof.

924,"So, some background. 

I am a female minor who is also a weeb. I'm into roleplaying with my OC's and live for romantic roleplays. I join BSD (Bungou Stray Dogs) Amino and start roleplaying. I meet this girl, lets call her Ivy, and I am really enjoying our roleplay. She becomes one of my best friends despite our very different timezones, though, I stay up late so the problem is semi-solved. We haven't known eachother a long time, but I'm sure she also views me as a good friend. Everything is good until the Coronavirus hits. Now, Ivy lives in China, so I become fairly concerned. It brings us closer together and she decides to celebrate her father's birthday with her family and they go somewhere to eat. All good. But then he passes from Lung cancer. I give her words of support and try to be there for her. We start roleplaying again and this is where everything gets a little crazy.

She didn't roleplay with me today because she, in her words, wanted to celebrate her father's birthday and she bought him a bouquet of flowers, or, in her exact words, ""It's my father's birthday today and I bought him this really big bouquet, I hope he likes it"". Now, her father's birthday, or when she went out to eat with him, was only like a month ago. So I texted her asking what did she mean because her father's birthday had already came and went. Now, I do understand I could have misread, but here's the thing. 

If she was telling the truth about her father's death, how would he have an opinion on them? And she can't be telling the truth about his birthday. And she has never mentioned having a stepfather, so I doubt it could be that. And I'm fairly sure her father's birthday was about a month ago, not her brother's, not her mom's, nope. 

She still hasn't responded, but I'm asking for advice on how to stop worrying about this and it could all just be a big misunderstanding. And if she was lying, she should already know not to lie about that stuff for a 15 year old. Anyways, until I get a reply, any advice on what to do if what outcome is what, or how to calm my nerves? I'll post an update when she replies.",01Mar2020,1

928,"So in the past, when I get blackout drunk, I've noticed that I urinate in random spots on the floor of my room. I thought it had gotten better over the past few weeks but I just opened up my closet and saw that I had peed in a storage container that's in there. 

This is a problem that has become both annoying and embarrassing for me. I know the obvious solutions would be to drink less and use the bathroom before I go to bed, but it sometimes happens when I'm sober enough to pee before bed.

933,"Hi, this is my first time posting here. I've hit a point where I was desperate to get this off my chest and I had no one to go to. This is a long request, it requires backstory for you to understand how I've ended up where I am today and why I am how I am. People probably wont beleive me about these things but this is my life, and I'm living theaw things every day and it's becoming to much to handle. I'm sorry in advance if my words jump around. I'm not good with working my ideas and I'm pretty emotional right now.

So I'm a 20 year old female. I grew up with my mom and dad. My dad has 3 sons and 2 daughters (the girls wont matter to the story much) from a previous marriage. My parents are sickly enjoyed people. My dads been fighting for years for disability because after 8 back surgeries, a shoulder one, knee surgeries, and much more the state said he didnt deserve it due to his age even though he cant walk much or sit or lay down long. My moma sickly and losing the ability to walk and use her arms. I myself suffer from Polycystic ovary syndrome which has made my health bad my entire life and it's a struggle to manage. 
We have also been poor since I was born. We have never had a house and have moved many many times. I switched schools 2 times between ages 3-5 with pre-k stuff. 4 times in elementary school. 3 times in highschool. I've been homeless for short periods of time. 
So basically I've grown up sickly and poor my whole life. I've struggled in school with add/adhd but doctors denied me diagnosis unless I took pills which has let to me struggling in all class including now in college. My parents are separated while fighting for disability and we all are borderline to be homeless. I cant drive because I have no car. I cant work because the state is threatening to take away our insurance and aid because if I make any cash my mom cant claim me as a dependent. 
We live with a roommate who treats us like shit and can kick us out any day she likes. I'm struggling in school and sickly and I'm exhausted and stressed all the time. I cant even afford to get a diagnosis at my age now for add/adhd nor to see if I have PTSD, anxiety, or depression from everything I've gone through. I've been beaten, raped and almsot murdered, I've tried committing suicide several times but I never go through with it because I'm afraid of the medical bills and if I succeed I'm afraid to make my parents pay for the funeral. 
The only good thing in my life has been my bf of 3 years, but he like me has suffered a great deal and I dont want to put my daily struggles onto him. I love him and he loves me but he physically nor financially can support me or my mother. He still lives at home and I'm afraid his family may look down on me for asking for help
I have no friends or family to go to. My brothers abandoned me while I was a kid and we are on no contact. I've told people before my store but no one believes me. I've been told its not possible for anyone to suffer as I have. I havent even said here how much I've really gone through because I'm afraid people will not beleive me. 

I just dont know what to do with myself. I've considered dropping out of college since I can barely succeed now with all my personal live problems. I've tried getting a job and after 2 and a half years I havent gotten any luck and I've tried every place I could that was within reasonable dostsnce to get to. My family wont be reunited for another year and a half bit any day now my roommates kicking us out and we cant afford any place here to live. We've been looking for 4 years.
With my hormonal issues and potential depression combining I'm finding myself getting into pits of serious despair. I've given up all my hobbies and interests. I dont feel happy ever now, and I'm always afraid I wont have a home. I've lived this way my whole life and now that I'm an adult I'm afraid I cant recover and I'll be stuck in this loop of struggle. What can I do? How do I calm down or look for any positivity when my life is always on a borderline? What would you do in my scenario? Is it wrong of me to be stressed out about these things at my age?",01Mar2020,1

I don't blame myself for being in the so called survival mode because I moved to another country, I am moving now for the third time trying to find a place to stay a bit more long term. Next to that life is just confusing and messy for many reasons.

936,"Ok so for context, I am a 18 M living in the Bay Area that goes to one of those insanely competitive public high schools.

Truth be told, it is pretty common for most people to aggressively cheat. In fact, rampant cheating is a problem addressed by pretty much everyone in my high school. However, the disparity between teacher difficult and the rat race to the best college has suppressed all our morals, including mine.

Now to clarify, I feel like I cheat and have been told that I cheat excessively and more than everyone else. I used to be a good student in the 8th and 9th grade. But now I feel like I lost my work ethic and just lie and cheat to get good grades. Reflecting back on my high school career, I feel as if I haven't accomplished the things even though in many classes I didn't cheat or couldn't because of competent teachers. Or I have legitimately done many extracurriculars. **Am i going through imposter syndrome or something??**

For instance, during sophomore year and junior year, I took copies of the test from my teacher who wouldn't teach to get an A. I would use my phone in my ap history and ap physics class at the back of the room during exams to get high grades. Things like that where I wouldn't do the homework, and just cheat my way out of so many things bother me as I am about to graduate.

Just a confession. But in regards to extracurriculars, I tried my hardest, and even then I lied about stuff I did in my college apps. I never did some extracurriculars honestly, but still wrote about to boost my ego on college apps. The notion of ""not doing enough"" but still trying to do it by lying with the rat race has consumed my thoughts for some time

I really have become lazy and lost my previous work ethic from years ago to now this. As I await my college decisions, and graduate, I feel truly bad, and want to improve my work ethic, and stop having the urge to rely on cheating or paying people to complete my work and pass exams.

Now, I know this is a confessions page, but do you guys have any ideas on how I can turn around and be a true grinder with an amazing work ethic and accomplish so much more.

Or if anyone else faced this, please lmk! Would love to hear your guys' stories",01Mar2020,1
937,"Hi all, first off I'm on mobile right now so sorry for any formatting issues.

A little backstory, i work at a retailer that has on average over 200 customers i interact with on a daily basis, this includes shaking hands on deals or service etc.

The new coronavirus has been going around here recently ( specifically in the hospital nearby), and it's worrying for me, since i have severe asthma and am on immunosuppressant medication for my allergies.

Now what i wonder is what you would do, do i try and stay away from work, since everyone who went to the hospital is at risk of infection, or do i stay and risk it?  

The government response here has been a little underwhelming, and my company does not have any policies in place regarding this.

Any advice would be very much appreciated!

I am 15.

My situation : I have been bullied for over a decade. I find it very hard to connect with my parents and they react to things in the worst way possible thus. Not going down that path. My friend think of me as a joke. My year is bullying me because I humiliated myself during an assembly where I crawled to my reward as my dad's were completely dead. People call me weird names and punch, kick and hurt me on so many levels. 

I am very sensitive but put out a message that I am I joke and can take insults very well but I am dying inside from emotional pain. I am so lonely. People ignore me a lot when I am talking to them and I am last to be picked in class. I am not even uglie, fat or anything bad. I have no idea why I am being picked on.

Loneliness

940,"Sort of a long story. I'm a WLW, and my girlfriend, D, is going to move to Florida next month. We currently live in PA. I've known her since September, but only started to be romantic with her since January. She's been planning to move to Florida since December. She'll be moving into a house where she has to pay no rent or mortgage. Only utilities, so financially speaking it's a very smart idea. She had mentioned to me before about moving with her and I was adamant about it being no. 

After talking with some of my friends, they all think it's a good idea. I have no kids and I'm renting my place. I do have a career here but the place I work at is corrupt and there's really no growth for raises, etc. I could probably find a better paying job and have more opportunity somewhere else. I do have friends and family but I can always visit.

I was kind of toying with the idea of doing long distance until I pay off most of my debt. I want my only debt to be my car payment before I decide what I'm going to do. I was planning on working a lot this year, do a lot of overtime, and pay off some debt and buying a house next year anyways.

943,"I’m have a majorly hard time deciding on what to do about my current housing situation and finances. I’m a 22yo student that moved out at 18 due to feeling suffocated by family, mental health issues, my sexuality, and being far from school/social life. Money is tight and adulting is overwhelming, so now I’m trying to decide if I should move back in with family or stay where I am. Let me break it down for y’all:

1) My current apartment is shared with my best friend in the whole world. We’ve been living together for 4 years and have never had a major conflict. The rental is 500sqft and in the middle of the city so its easy to access school workout appointments etc. However, were both broke af and I’m using disability and student grants to try to finish school. The apartment has a bad landlord, is infested with roaches, is actually a 1 bedroom so my roommate lives in the living room, and only just has a kitchenette so theres little food prep space and mess adds up quickly. House upkeep is a major struggle for us because were both mentally ill. We have 2 elderly rats who I love so much and I would happily get more when they pass. I’m happy with what I have but I’m getting overwhelmed trying to balance school, home upkeep, and my health. I’m also easily depressed when I have money trouble, landlord trouble, school trouble, or don’t see my roomie and get really lonely.

2) My mom is willing to let me move back in with her, my step dad, and my sister. We get along but I do need my space or I go crazy and we don’t always agree lol. I would save a lot of money not paying rent but would lose a lot of free time since I’d have a long commute as it isnt a very accessible location. I’d have my own small room which would be fine, but my possessions don’t all fit in it so I would have to majorly downsize. I can’t bring my rats with me but the family has 2 cats and a dog. The house is open concept so I’d always be exposed to my family unless in the security of my own room. I’m hoping having family around will help me with upkeep and healthier lifestyle choices but I’m worried about privacy. My mental health may also be at stake due to feeling trapped/suffocated and having very different views than my family. My girlfriend or other friends wouldn’t be able to visit or stay with me. 


Thanks for reading all that. My main issues are the daunting labour of adulting, my turbulent mental health, my brokeness due to small government money cheques, and sacrificing a lot of my independence. I hope I don’t sound too whiney and you get where I’m coming from. All advice is accepted.",01Mar2020,1
944,"I suffered from depression and ptsd for some time. About 3 years ago, I couldn't handle it anymore. I broke down. Afterwards I removed myself from the stressful environment that made me more suicidal and started therapy. I started finally feeling better last year. I was proud of myself for being able to lead a normal life pretty well again. 


However recently I feel dissatisfied. I feel  urgrateful for this because I used to be grateful for all the little things, like actually enjoying going out, drawing, not having suicidal thoughts and just not dreading the future overall. Yet this perfectly good life honestly just sucks when compared to the one I could have had, if it weren't for my ptsd/mental issues. I know thinking about this is meaningless because what happened happened, but I still think about it a lot. 


Before depression, I was goal driven, hard working and liked social things. I could actually get things done. I had many goals/plans for my future that I was working towards one by one. I wanted a lot of things and I thought I could do it. But I let go of all of it. I didn't think even think I would be alive in 5 years. Which makes me happy that I came so far as to start wanting things again. 


A rare oppurtunity came up that could allow me to become the person I once wanted to be and put me back on the track I left. But it also means lots of stress, hard work, high expetations, and moving far away from my friends, family and boyfriend. Also leaving the little, but many special things I have right now. I want to get things done again. But I am not confident I am strong enough. The last time(3years ago) I was under a lot of stress, I broke down. And I can't mess up again. I mentioned this to my doctor and he said while stability/no big changes would be the best for me, he wouldn't stop me since I seemed to have gotten a lot better.


I am torn between the easy, happy yet somewhat mediocre life, and the challenging one. All advice is appreciated. Thank you for reading this long rambly thing :)",01Mar2020,1

946,"I made a post here about this situation a while ago, but here’s the summary:
I (17 F) has a brown spot appear on the left side of my breasts. I told my mom (52 F) about it, and she wouldn’t take me to see a doctor unless she looked at it. So I gave up, and showed it to her. She told me she would make an appointment with the doctor. Time passed, and whenever I would ask her about the appointment, she said that she would make it, since she often forgot about it. A week ago, I lied about said spot: I lied to my mom telling her that my spot grew bigger. She would tell me to let her see it. I told her that I didn’t feel comfortable. She said that it’s natural for mothers to see their daughters naked. I told her no, once again. She stormed out crying, and told me I was disrespectful towards her. The next day, we were at the doctor’s office. I told her I would pay for her appointment, but she told me that she would pay for it. We’re not filthy rich, and since my dad left, things have been rough in the economic side of things. At the end of the appointment, I got diagnosed with vitiligo and keratosis pilaris.
Today though, is when she confronted me about it. She told me that she had called the doctor, and the doctor told her that I didn’t have “a big brown spot” like I told her I did. I forgot to mention, my mom entered with me to the doctor’s, if it wasn’t for the wall that gave me and my doctor privacy, she would’ve seen me naked. I felt her gaze in the appointment, but I thought I was being paranoid. I’m a little paranoid about it since my mom has often watched me change/go to the bathroom/ etc.
I told her that I lied, but I lied to just see a doctor, so it wasn’t that bad. Mom told me that I should’ve just told her the truth, but I told her the truth the first time.
She said that the appointment cost a lot of money, and that I’m ungrateful. She told me that I should’ve just told my dad (mind you, she forbids me to talk to him about personal stuff, since they’re fighting about our custody, and my mom’s afraid he’s going to caught something against her, thus he could win custody over my brother and me)
She stormed off crying, again. I think maybe she’s lying about calling the doctor (she told me she called him the next day. But like, why would she do that? Isn’t there a patient confidentiality?) 
I know this is a lot of lying, and I don’t usually lie, but I was worried sick about the spot. I know I can’t justify my lying, and I’m truly sorry, but I had to do it.",01Mar2020,1
