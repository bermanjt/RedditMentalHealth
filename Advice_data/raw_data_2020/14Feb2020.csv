1,"I’m in love with my bestfriend and I don’t know what to do, ever since I met him Iv just had such strong feelings for him and care about him very deeply the only problem is I dated his bestfriend. And he dated mine. my friend is very hypocritical when it comes to dating and will date her ex’s Friends but no one can date her ex. Just for the sake of the story we’re gonna call the dude I’m in love with Apple lmao, we’ve always been super close and at the time we met my friend was dating apple and had a pretty steady relationship but my friend soon cheated on him and still continues to cheat on anyone she dates. They broke up and apple talked to other people and so did my bestfriend.  I had gotten into a relationship with apples bestfriend and it lasted a while but ended due to him not being ready for a relationship and I had just didn’t have the feelings that he had and apple was always there from the start and still is. my friend started dating someone and got into a relationship with one of apples friends but she gets mad when Apple shows any interest in one of her friends, I’m literally in love with him and have been since I first laid eyes on him but I don’t know what to do, he shows the attraction back and we do almost everything together and he even got a job where I work so we’d be closer with each other Bc he didn’t want to grow apart since my job has me working 38 hours a week and still attending school for 8 hours, I don’t know what to do Bc I love my bestfriend very much but I don’t agree with what she does and at the same time I’m in love with her ex :/",14Feb2020,1
2,"I’ve had my fair share of depression, I’ve had multiple suicide attempts, landed in a psych facility, currently dealing with postpartum but this post isn’t about me, it’s about my sister(22,F). We recently found out my dad molested her when she was in junior high. I found out through here on reddit &amp; we had told my mom over two weeks ago I think I’m not too sure but my sister lives about an hour away due to her being in college. Before we found out, she was having panic attacks about it and just having random thoughts. I’ve been talking to her now that it’s all been put out there and she isn’t doing well now, &amp; I feel like it’s my fault because I found out and she just wanted to take it to the grave and not tell my mom. She sees a therapist but I don’t think it’s helping her. She told me her therapist made her give all the knives and pills she has to her friend and all she wants to do is sleep. Coming from experience, I know she shouldn’t be alone, but I also know I don’t want to annoy her but at the same time I need to make sure she’s okay. I have no idea what I can do for her. My mom and I thought we should plan a trip so she can get away from everything but my mom didn’t want to do it till March but I think we should do it this weekend or next week. I’m just super worried about her.",14Feb2020,1
3,"Hi, 

I have been having an ongoing medical problem that I thought was resolved. Unfortunately, I have had to miss class before (once) to go to an appt at home. The problem surfaced again and I now have to go home for another appointment. Due to the nature of this problem, it will require *another* appointment after to clear me (weeks later). My doctor works at the office I can get to only on Tuesdays, so I truly have to miss my class (and my home is hours away). 

To the point: the syllabus said that missing more than two classes results in a drop in letter grade. I explained why I missed class (prior to missing) and approached her again explaining the medical appt and how I will be gone on a coming Tuesday. She declared that I take away from learning from not being there and I will have my grade lowered. 

I truly don't think this is fair. I don't *want* to be at these appointments and I would much rather be in class, but it isn't a choice. I find her rule fair if there isn't reason or prior notice, but to be punished for a medical problem seems radical. I also find it unfair that spring athletes can miss the class without being penalized. 

Am I delusional? Does anyone have any advice on how to resolve this? Thanks!",14Feb2020,1

5,"I was flirting with this pretty girl who happens to be my coworker. She seemed to be very attracted to me, I would see her looking at me and then look away fast. She even gets nervous around me for no reason and turns red when I say something sweet to her, she’s even offered to buy me coffee once. 

That was going on for 3 weeks or so, Eventually she followed me on instagram and I followed her back. I started talking to her to build the attraction more and she admitted alot of stuff to me. She said she finds me really attractive that it’s killing her inside, She even admitted that I make her nervous and i’m always on her mind. 

She sent me nudes on the second day of talking. It got sexual very quick, That never happened to me before. 
We had deep conversation about our lives and our past. That was in just a 2 week period. I’m thinking wow this girl is the one, but eventually it turns out she just wanted to talk and have fun with me but she still has feelings for me, I was very devasted. she blocked me on instagram after telling her I have to let go because we weren’t on the same page. 

I wanted a relationship with her but now i’m regretting saying that to her becuase we never got to hang out or have sex, I didn’t even get to kiss her, i’m so heartbroken.

I feel like if I would of went along just having fun with her, she would eventually be in a realtionship with me and fall in love, what do I do?? I have to work with this girl please help this hurts soo much!",14Feb2020,1

She said that would be hot, and we had some more dirty talk. She then says, ""You know you could always send me some thing for me to get my own Valentine's gift. Haven't I been a good girl""?, and I said, ""Wym""? She replies ""Like money, or I could sho [sic] something I want to buy and you could pay for it?"". I made and an excuse saying that I can't buy her anything because I'm on a tight budget bc I'm a student. She responded, ""So am I [shrug emoji] but ok"".

My girlfriend (20F) and I have been basically best friends for the past 5 months and we are fairly close. Yeah I've had social difficulties but they were never too bad. However it's been really bad lately because this is my first time in a relationship and it's a new social role (which is causing me to completely blank). I'm also having difficulty with body language, mainly that I'm thinking one thing but my body language is doing the opposite (like I want to be close and intimate with her but I back away whenever she gets close). Its really bothering me because it's getting to the point where I am hurting and upsetting her. I don't want to do that and I feel terrible about it.

I don't know how to get better at communicating but I wanted to ask for some advice. How do you get out of your head and say what you're thinking? How to do start a conversation? When do you know it's a good time to start a conversation? How do I fix my body language to convey that I am super comfortable around her?

8,"I don't know the exact condition my mom has, but this has happened 5 months before. My mom is healthy but has an extra vein in her heart that causes arteries to clog. I am a 20 y/o engineering student studying in Toronto, not a Doctor, not a Nurse, not even pre-med. I don't know CPR, heimlich maneuver, etc. I was studying and I heard my mom gasping for air, and she told me she is having a heart attack. I frantically googled what to do, and got results of just ""quit smoking, lose weight, avoid salt, etc."" but nothing for an emergency. My mom told me her surgery to get rid of the extra vein is tmrw and I kept telling her i'm calling 9-11 but she said that she doesn't want to re-schedule the appointment dude to being in the hospital for a week like last time this happened. My mom kept telling me it'll get better and to not call 9-11. I found nothing on google in case of an emergency, Except, I found a subreddit that said that for an emergency swallow aspirin. So I quickly grabbed aspiring and told my mom to chew it. This helped. This slowed down her heart beat gradually and helped release her airways to breathe better. This happened 10 minutes ago.

If I do anything it seems more like I’m just following around, and whenever I suggest or contribute anything (or ask a question) I get ignored unless I say it multiple times, and when they respond it’s usually to shut me up (Why can’t we do XYZ?

14,"Hi everyone,

I'm at a bit of a crossroads in my life and need some outside perspectives. Anyone who was pursued or is pursuing a career in astronomy or physics and can comment would be greatly appreciated. 

First, by way of background, I am a 22 year old about to finish a bachelor of law/politics degree. As I was finishing high school, my father was terminally ill. He was a well-known barrister (for Americans: a lawyer who wears fancy robes). He was keen that I should be set up and on a path before he died, so I got into law school, but it was never something I was passionate about doing. I'm now in the fortunate position of having a bit of money and some time to pursue whatever it is I want. 

I have a deep passion for science. I spend all day in my law admin job listening to science books on audible, and much of my free time watching college science lectures online or reading. I write pieces of science journalism and book chapters for fun. I'm the sort of person who has pictures of Carl Sagan on their bedroom wall. I've recently gotten into planetary and deep sky photography. 

Late last year, I was offered a spot at a fairly prestigious university to do an advanced research degree in astronomy and astrophysics. I haven't done any math since high school, but received the offer based on a letter I attached to my application explaining my passion for science and astronomy, and the hard work I'm willing to put in, as well as my results in law. The degree includes a research internship as well as specialist selective physics classes, where I have to produce actual research. If I do well, I should have an easy path to a PhD. 

My question is, should I stick with law, make some easy money and pursue my passions in my spare time? Or, is it worth me taking a leap of faith and trying to pursue astronomy as a career? 

Thanks.",14Feb2020,1
15,"One of my best friends, whom I’ve been friends with for two years recently became friends with this other girl. Her name is Lexi. Lexi is younger than both of us, but she acts very mature for her age. In her profile, Lexi states that she “is very blunt” “dislikes people” and is “antisocial”. I had an encounter with her recently and I accidentally sent her the wrong text message and she was showing a very rude attitude to me. My best friend, no longer calls me his best friend and calls the girl he met two months ago his best friend all because he got jealous that I was spending more time with my other friend Liv. I truly don’t understand how he could be friends with Lexi seeming from her rude behavior. Lexi always says she’s toxic and fake. I believe she is insecure and very sad. I really don’t know it she is fake since me being witb her is severely affecting my mental health and I don’t know if I’m overreacting. I have a fear that she is only using me to get to him, since my best friend has had a history with fake friends. I want to protect him. But, Lexi have him lots of money.

16,"I work in a small store with one other person.  We work opposite shifts, so I literally never see him.   Our store is pretty dead --- all of the time.  The owner lives about 4 hours away and doesn't ever come visit our store, as he has a few others to tend to closer to home.  He has made it pretty clear he doesn't like our store because it isn't profitable.

We have bar height desks and barstools instead of normal desks.  The owner built these himself to save money.  A few months ago, I asked if it was possible we could build a shorter desk and get a regular height chair because this setup was hurting my back and cutting off the circulation to my feet if I sat longer than 30 minutes.  I was told ""sure, we'll do this within the next week."" Of course, as you probably assumed by the title of this post, this never happened. I reminded him a few times and it was always ""Yes, of course, soon."" It's been 5 months.  I'm not getting a desk. 

I once asked if he would sell me a label printer that was in our storage room. He said yes. I asked how much he wanted for it. No response. I threw him an offer. No response. I'm not getting a label printer. 

This one is my favorite, because it wasn't even something I had asked for.  We were talking about how to bring in more business, and he offered to give me $100 a week to do some marketing on my days off. He said he would get me some cards and flyers, then we could get started. This was 3 months ago and I still have no marketing materials. 

Most recently, I asked if he would allow me to bring my dog to work with me.  I don't currently have a dog.  My therapist has recommended I get one to help with my anxiety, and I am all for the idea.  However, I can't justify leaving a puppy home alone for 12 hours a day.  I was really anxious about asking him, because my previous asks have all been ignored.  I finally worked up the courage to send the most awkward message I've ever typed.... and he says ""we'll discuss it tomorrow"" and gives me his schedule for the next day.  I said I was good for whenever and that I'd have my phone on me all day, assuming he's going to call me in one of his free times.  I waited by the phone.  All of his free times came and went, so I tried to call him.  I get a text saying he's still busy and again, ""we'll discuss it tomorrow."" 

Well ladies and gentleman, today is tomorrow and I still haven't heard shit from this dude.  I'm 99% sure he's dodging me and waiting for me to just forget about it.  Even though I'm pretty sure it's gonna be a hard no, I'd still like to actually hear the answer.

18,"So. Hey. I should probably preface this with... a few things before I get into it. I am a minor, a transgender male, and distinctly do not have an eating disorder. I figured that maybe, hey, since no one in my personal life can tell me what to do, maybe I should go to random internet strangers. (TDLR at the end)

I'm currently a few pounds underweight! Which wouldn't be an issue if not for... well, no, yeah, it's an issue. So I have ADHD and I take two medications for it. One of them isn't important to this stuff at all, but I'll mention it anyway for the sake of avoiding questions later. It's Guanfacine Intuniv. The one that, as far as I can tell, is causing the issues is my other medication, Vyvanse. Vyvanse deals with impulse control a lot of the time, which was important for me when I started it a few years back.

Due to my low impulse control, I sort of binge ate a lot and was overweight because of that fact. Vyvanse helped with that a lot, actually! It works well for my impulse stuff and I don't want to mess with that! However: an important thing about Vyvanse is that it's also used to treat binge eating disorder. 

So Vyvanse has been working great for years! Until the past year or so. Because I've gone from the type of ADHD to always do everything all of the time to the type of ADHD where I focus on one thing so much that I forget everything else (kinda. ADHD doesn't work like that and it's a constant balance but that's the easiest I can explain it). Which includes eating. I forget to eat. A lot. And since my meds make it so my appetite is smaller, I don't tend to notice. 

Until I went to the doctor a few months back to find I was right above the ""underweight"" marker for my height. Which meant I was threatened to be taken off of my meds if I didn't get my weight up. Which I tried so hard to do. ***So*** hard. And it didn't work. Because now I'm actively underweight and no matter how hard I try, I just can't get it back up!

So, this is my call for help, I guess. Does anyone know some easy and cheap (I have no job and come from a lower class household) ways to gain weight/get a lot of calories in a safe/healthy way?

TLDR; My meds made me drop a bunch of weight, I really need to know some ways to get it back up.",14Feb2020,1
19,"Hi there.  
A little about me: I'm Italian, so I'm sorry if my English is not that good. I work in the digital marketing field and after a few difficult years (internships, bad jobs, bad choices and no money) I decided to become a freelance in order to make my own ""fortune"". This decision came with the fact that an agency that worked with me asked me to be a freelance and assured me they would take care of me while I was still new to this world (meaning that I would have had their clients to start with).

This happened 8 months ago; in the middle I got sick and I had a surgery and I spent 2 months in bed. Meanwhile this agency started to lose clients because they don't really want to put an effort in their work and they don't support the client nor me, so my incomes became less and less by months as I was finding other clients very slowly since I was recovering and in a terrible mental state (my desease is chronical and the surgery didn't solve).

I kindly reminded the agency that I went freelance because they asked me to in the first place, they told me they have a lot of things going on and I have to be patient, and today they sent me an email at 18.00 saying that I lost another client (that decided to cut the contract because of their bad work on his site, but I got involved as a part of their team) - and my income right now just covers my rent and something more. The agency is trying to monetize without giving me work (they use their intern for that), but they asked my cooperation in the first place and they still talk me about new clients that don't seem to appear anywhere.

Right now I'm having interviews with other potential clients, I'm working hard to build a site without no money so I'm learning how to do that on my own, but without a decent income I'm not gonna be able to go much further. It's a shame because after my surgery I truly wanted to grow-up as a professional, but it takes some time to gain new clients, build a reputation and so on, and with this income I won't have this time.

Plus, in Italy is really difficult to find a job in a short amount of time and my mental health is fragile lately, so I really don't know what to do. My future seems so dark and I'm worried about what could happen.

Tomorrow I will talk to the agency, that doesn't seem concerned a bit about this, and I really just want to cry but of course I can't call them and cry.

So I'm writing here because it's night here, I'm not thinking straight and any advice on what to do, what to think and how to think positive would be really appreciated.

Thank you so much.",14Feb2020,1

27,"There's this guy at my university who I've liked for some time now--probably for over a year. I don't remember why I started liking him. It could have been because there weren't many guys in my department... I'd catch him looking at me sometimes and so I hoped he liked me but I wasn't going to do anything. He's currently a senior and will be graduating this semester while I am a Junior. He was part of a group project for my class and started to talking to my best friend (who is attractive). He asked her if she wanted to hang out but at the time she was and currently is seeing someone. They still flirted though and when my friends and him were studying, he asked my guy friend if we could invite my best friend. The reason I didn't was because my guy friend doesn't like my best friend--which I try to stay out of. A few days before we studied, my guy friend, him and I went out to eat by chance and things were kind of awkward. My guy friend was making fun of us by saying things like ""do you two want to be alone"" and things like that. He asked for my snapchat and later that night he texted me, but most of the conversation was about my guy friend and how ""he's a good friend"" and things like that. This conversation happened over two hours. When I told a friend about this, she said that he may have been trying to be my guy friend's wingman. This is crazy because my friend  likes to do things like fart in front of me and call me names. Our friendship has never felt uncomfortable like it does when I like someone. He's more like a brother lol. After we were done studying, he texted me again with general conversation. The thing is, in person we hardly talk partly because of how shy I am. I'm pretty sure he knows I like him as I think I get red in front of him.

I have a fm that since I was a kid has been very problematic because of their own mental health. They suffer a lot and Im 100% sure that theyre intentions are not to hurt other people, but they do. That fm hurts other people and me included with their words and tone. Always agressive. Always the victim. Always trying to seem that theyre better than they really are, but I know that it comes from deep issues they have, so usually I ignore it (not gonna lie I give snarky repplies too in return).

I love this fm a lot but at this point its very mixed with frustration and grudge. I dont want to see them get hurt but no one would have to pay me for me to give them a couple of punches. To anything wrojg they do I get this horrible rage that I feel since very little. When I was little I didnt fight back much because I was small, but now if I do fight back it will make the person more explosive and hurtful to the other people I love.

I look at them and see someone I dont want to be, someone I see as I shouldnt be, even if I know that they have a really good heart. I came to the point of calling them useless in their face (which i know hurt them a lot) because I honestly thought that someoje who actively doesnt fight back hurting the people we both love with their tone and words is stupid.

I want to have a good relationship with this person, and I do for the most part but some days my anger takes the best of me and I become unfair to the people around me too. This person cannot be dealt with agaisnt because it hurts you (at this point in time, sure it could change), and if I tried to speak with them they would use the victim card and leave without letting me speak.

Basically it means that I am going to have to learn how to leave anger behind and accept the best of them and ignore the rest.

What can I do to leave grudges behind.",14Feb2020,1
35,"Hello, first a little about me, I’m 20 years old, male, I’m an average looking guy, not fat not skinny, I do work out but I’m not super buff or anything, just a normal looking dude and this is a problem that has plagued me my whole life, I’ve tried to think very deeply about it but I couldn’t come up with anything so I figured I’d post here for some advice or explanations maybe, not really expecting too much, just looking for some help.

Alright so I have never had a girlfriend or been in any sort of relationship before, this has been by choice but not necessarily one I’ve been happy with, let me explain. Throughout high school and even at my job, I can recall 8 specific instances where a girl has either outright asked me out, or has flirted with me in a very obvious and straightforward manor. However every time I have either declined, or just pretended to be oblivious/ignore the advances. Now this hasn’t been because I didn’t want to go out with them, some of them were incredibly attractive and I’d have loved to go out with them. 

But this is where my problem arises, I constantly feel like I’m not good enough for these girls, like I feel like I’m just gonna disappoint them either physically or just when they get to know me, I just never feel like I’m good enough personality wise or physically. And it’s like this constant anxiety in the back of my head, I want to go out with these girls but in my head when I’m with them it’s just “your just gonna disappoint her” “your not good enough” “ she’s not gonna like you”. 

I have this constant need to improve myself physically and socially because I feel like I’m never good enough. And I have no idea why I always feel this way or how to overcome it, like I said I’m an average looking guy, and I make my friends laugh, I feel like I’m quite funny and have a decent personality. I just never think I’m good enough for any girl and just beat myself up in my own head. Any advice or maybe just an explanation would be of great help. In short I feel like I’m never good enough for any girl, I beat myself up in my head anytime I’m with one thinking I’ll just disappoint her and I’ll never be good enough for her, and I have this constant near pathological need to improve myself, I’m always working out and trying to improve myself socially just to make myself better and maybe feel like I’m finally good enough. It really bothers me because I feel like I can never have a relationship. Thank you in advance and I apologize for the length/any errors, it’s my first time posting here.",14Feb2020,1
36,"So I recently started with an overseas internship at a travel company. It wasn't too clear what I would be doing before I went there and they branded themselves as an adventure/nature based/ eco tourism agency. From the first day on I've not being enjoying myself here. It is not adventure/naturebased/ecotourism at all! They promote domestic flights that could easily have been avoided and they do all sorts of pollution activities like heli skiing or scenic flights. My tasks in a day are printing documents and checking them. Then they have to be delivered in the city centre which takes me about 2 hours of walking a day.
I have had a conversation with my supervisor and asked for more challenging tasks. I thought I would be helping out planning/doing research into new activities/accommodations from a sustainable pov. However, she told me that that would never happen since that's not an intern task.
I am on a working holiday visa, so I always have the option to just work, gain some work experience abroad, go back home and do a new internship. This would give me a year of study delay but I'm in my early 20s so that's not really a problem for me.
I am however afraid that a new internship might be the same thing.. I know it's very common for internships to be like this but I also know that there are some good companies out there (although they didn't hire me because I did not have enough overseas travel experience yet).
Overall the company is nice, the employees are nice but I am not passionate at all about what I do. I know it has only been 2 weeks and it might get better but when I asked about it it will never be what I expected it to be.
Thoughts on what to do? I have another talk at another company in the same town that gives me the opportunity to be part of tours based on cleaning waterways?

I was all stoked because I love lemon and I love candy. I was ready to rip into it when Shannon was all to her daughter “what the fuck are you doing? Hammerkat605 doesn’t use and other friend doesn’t want that shit”

The daughter had handed us edibles. 

I’ve been sober for 15 years and needed to drive 2 1/2 hours to get home that afternoon. I’m fine with my friends imbibing. I could care less. I’m always the DD and I’m happy to do it, but I just don’t.

It just makes me angry that if my friend hadn’t of stopped me I would have just popped that candy in my mouth and gone to town and I would have gotten all stoned.

I know that really all I need to do it calmly tell the daughter “in the future please don’t give me edibles” but part of me is angry and wants to lay into her.

What should I do? Her mother already yelled at her. 

Should I tell her matter of factly to not give me edibles? Should I tell her that I’m angry that she just handed me an edible without telling me what was in it? Or should just letting her mother yell at her be enough?",14Feb2020,1

49,"Okay, any advice from anybody who knows more than I do or who is an expert would be really appreciated. I'm looking for advice I can give to my friend, because it's really not my business to call the police. More on that later.

My friend's parents are... I'm failing to find terms to describe them because I have a nagging feeling that my friend is downplaying what their parents actually do to them. There's no physical violence, as far as I can tell, but I can tell that the verbal abuse is really taking a toll on their mental well being. Both of them make my friend, who is an overachiever for their age, feel worthless to the point that they tried to commit suicide- only to be forced back to school the very next day despite feeling sick. Their dad calls them a ""parasite"" or a ""waste of money"" for even eating too much or asking to go get groceries (because my friend isn't allowed to drive). Their mom hangs over them like a helicopter, pressuring them to keep studying without taking breaks until it's late at night. When my friend got sick because they stayed up late to finish their work, they got blamed for not managing their time well enough and for, again, costing the family extra money (friend can't go to the doctor that often because they aren't allowed to miss school). They lay it on thick that they wanted to abort my friend, and how they want my friend to leave the house so much so they can move away. 

Now, my friend has tried to tell school officials and doctors and others about their situation, only for the ones they placed their trust in to tell their parents- and they got scolded very harshly. In fact, the only reason why my friend was allowed to go to therapy was to save face- and their mom pressed them to say everything they told the therapist afterward. My friend doesn't want their parents to be taken away, either- they love their parents and they got really scared when we mentioned anything like that. My friend can't move away either- they're too young- and they may have to be dependent on their parents through college. 

Please, please, anybody could tell me something that would help my friend. They still have a couple years before college, which appears to be too long of a time period to just ""hang in there."" This friend is extremely dear to me, and it breaks my heart every time I hear that their parents have yet again done something horrendous to them. Thank you.",14Feb2020,1
51,"To start off with, I'm currently fifteen and my younger sister is five. I've posted here before about a problem with my mom, and I've only gotten more exasperated with her since (for reasons other than what was mentioned in my last post here).

My problem with her is that she neglects my younger sister and refuses to admit it. She even thinks she shows my sister *too much* attention despite being a psychology major (no idea if she's still in college). She said to me once (paraphrasing), ""I don't know why \[sister\] behaves the way children do when they're neglected!""

She notices my sister's unhealthy behaviors but refuses to acknowledge what they mean or to do anything to help her.

She regularly endangers my sister in ways I won't go into detail here. By the time I turn eighteen, if Mom hasn't gotten a stable job and improved her parenting skills, I want to take my sister away.

The problem is that I don't know how I could afford to do that, and my sister's dad's side of the family exist. I'm worried they would step in. In that case, it would be me, an agnostic transgender eighteen year old who probably just graduated high school, against an upper-class, middle-aged family of vegan christians.

 I could talk about how off these people are for days, but just know I don't dislike them because they're vegan Christians; they just have a very misogynistic, almost cultish mindset that's very offputting. I also have reason to believe they don't take physical safety seriously enough. My sister has been put in life-threatening situations before under their care.

I don't know how likely it is they would step in, or how the rest of my family would react to me going against my mom like that. The worst part is the funding. If I start working as soon as I turn sixteen and save every dime I earn, I don't know if that would be enough.

I'm so worried about my sister all the time. I would do anything to make sure she stays safe and healthy. Does anyone have advice on what I could do? Even if it doesn't involve taking her away, I'm open to anything that will keep my sister safe, physically and emotionally.",14Feb2020,1

54,"I don't really have anyone else to turn to or talk about these kind of things with so I thought turning to reddit might help, because so many people have suffered and come through the other side better off. 

I'll try to keep this short and just say that I've had suicidal thoughts since I was about 11 years old until now. One of my parents passed away around that time and it left a void ever since, which is probably the route cause of how I feel deep down. I have a shitty relationship with most of my immediate family (including my remaining parent) because they are emotionally and have been physically abusive. I have literally 3 friends and a long term partner of 7 years. My friends are amazing, but they have their own problems so instead of overloading them I prefer to absorb their stresses. Me and my bf have had ups and downs. Although I love him dearly, I don't feel comfortable sharing my feelings of sadness with him. I finished studying for my degree and am currently looking for a job but I'm struggling to do so because I feel like living is pointless and I have no energy to exist anymore. 

I would say that I have high functioning depression because no one (except reddit now) knows what I've been doing. I've been on and off different types of anti depressants for about 4 years. I just started taking sertraline a month ago after a break of 1 year. I've tried therapy during this time too but it hasn't helped me. When I was a teen I used to self harm by cutting and picking my skin. I have always had body issues and for the past 6 months I've been binging, purging and using laxatives daily in an effort to lose weight. A few months ago I was feeling particularly low and more aggressively suicidal. I left home late at night to go to the train station. I had been crying and it was winter but I had no jacket, phone etc. and stood at the platform trying to sike myself up to jump in front of the next train. I was hesitant  because I don't want to leave my youngest sibling behind - it feels like they need me... But I literally can't escape the voices in my head that tell me I'm fucking worthless and disgusting so I wanted so badly to end it. Someone intervened and warned the station staff so I was dragged into their offices crying, which was ultimately very embarrassing. Lately I look at suicide methods online all the time. I don't have a particular time or date for ending things, but I still know that I want this to be over. 

I have seen so many success stories online about people managing and overcoming their mental illnesses but I don't make any progress. It feels like I'm slipping deeper into a void where I feel nothing but numbness and self loathing. I'm actually jealous of the fact that one of my parents are dead and yet I'm still here.

For example, I was in my room and heard their toilet flush but no water from the faucet. I started breathing heavy hoping they'd wash but nope. They went back to their computer to play games. 
I them started using my shirt to touch everything and I'd wipe door handles and light switches down with clorox wipes.

I have a friend who is living in what I consider to be a toxic, smothering environment.  Her mother has always smothered her and as a result- she is 30 with anxiety and depression and living at home.  Her mother basically says things like ""don't let me hold you back"" and ""I don't know what I would do without you"" in the same breath.  My friend has started and quit multiple jobs and does not know what she wants to do.  She sounds like she is about to quit her third major, having decided she wanted nothing to do with the first major she got a degree in and having quit the second major. 

I try (key word: try) to be supportive and just listen (she is one of the smartest, kindest, funniest people I know and she has anxiety but has good people skills.  She is awesome, she just has no idea despite how many times I tell her.  She calls me her ""eternal advocate"".)  Sometimes I try to be the voice of reason when it sounds like she's going to quit again but I clearly insert myself where I don't belong as I am EXTREMELY bothered by this time.

   She is failing a class and it sounds like she wants to give up again and I'm afraid she's going to live her life in this toxic house that she's expressed multiple times gives her major depression.  (She does have a therapist and she's already on depression/anxiety meds.) She got an email that said she was failing a class and to contact a person and she didn't contact the person and says she may want to quit the major now.  Who know, she may call the person and sort things out tomorrow but I've seen her shut down like this before and I don't know what to do or how to help.  I live states away but she has the longstanding offer to visit/stay with me if ever she needs to get out of that house for a while.  I don't know what else to do.  To be fair, I come from a very toxic household, and I got out, so maybe I am projecting regarding the urgency, but she has told me many times she is miserable there.  She has applied to more jobs but due to her anxiety does not want to go in to introduce herself or send follow up emails, just applies online. The only way I got the jobs I did was physically showing up to introduce myself.  Not that my way is the right way.  It might not even help, honestly.  I don't know.  But she IS applying, and thus-trying.

What do I do?  Have you been in my position or, better yet, her position? Do you have a success story about coming out of her situation because that would give me hope.  How do I help? Should I just shut up and hope for the best?  I am not going to mention this reddit to her as I feel that would be poor and hurtful communication, I just want ideas of what to do, if I should do anything.  I can't ask my parental units because... toxic, I can't ask my other friends because they know her as an acquaintence and I feel it would be disrespectful.  So I shall anonymously ask the internet and take everything with a grain of salt because... the internet.",14Feb2020,1

I am an extremely good tenant, and he has praised me whenever he can on both the inside of the place when hes had to stop in, and on my work ethic etc. I'm a very tidy and clean person, as is my partner. 

He gave us 24 hr notice not long ago that he was going to be refinancing his mortgage and would be sending in an inspector for it. I agreed and he asked that it would be clean and tidy ""as always"". I agreed again. 

My partner had just done a massive deep clean, including windows, floors walls etc. But the day of the inspection my partner was supposed to do the dishes (a day or two worth, not much), make the bed, and tidy the clothes he left at the end of the bed. But he got called into work very last second and had to leave without doing it - I was already at work. It was NOT that bad in there by any standard. 

I came home from work to tulips and a note saying"" thank you for letting us go in,  enjoy the tulips!"" I thought all was fine. 

The day after my landlord caught me on the way down the stairs to my place, and TORE into me. 

He said the place was filthy, like a bomb had gone off, that his inspection for his mortgage was compromised, that it was embarrassing and he was incredibly disappointed in me. He was shaking his finger in my face the whole time, with a raised voice. 

Now, I'm no pushover, I explained to him that my partner had to leave, and it wouldnt happen again, but that I also didn't think it was that bad, and that I was acutely aware that the inspector looks for housing issues, not minor housekeeping. Hoarding sure, or mold, but not a few dishes, an unmade bed  and the laundry. (These were the items he complained about).

My friend sarcastically said he didn’t like Immigrants. He started a quick rant about how he genuinely dislikes most immigrants. At first I thought he was being ironic, but as he spoke he began to sound more and more genuine. I said something like: ‘At first I thought you were being ironic, but as you went on I realized that you genuinely hold these beliefs.’ He, like, nodded or said “yeah,” or something? I can’t remember exactly.

So now the other friend that I mentioned earlier asks him if he believes that all immigrants are bad, to which he says that maybe 10-15% are good. Everyone is silent and clearly uncomfortable. We didn’t even wanna talk about politics. So we just kind of awkwardly moved to the next topic without entertaining the one at hand. The friend that made the comment earlier has parents that came from Norway. My other friend there has parents from Brazil. My mom is from Jamaica.

Our son has recently started acting out in school and at both homes. We did everything from going to co-parenting classes, to court mediations, having a third party masteries etc. Unfortunately, my ex doesn’t want to co-parent with me and claims her husband is our sons father and that I don’t exist. This has been causing our son confusion. 

She has violated numerous court orders to make out some not like me our my wife. We’ve done family therapy and counselling, and he’s even seen his our therapist. Grated I know these things take time, but he  seems truly unhappy. He’s developing a serious attitude. He is unappreciative of what we get him and claims it’s better at moms house (they have a larger disposable income), and always comparing the houses. He’s explained that he doesn’t like living in two houses anymore, that he rather live in one, but he won’t tell us which one he wants. 

We encourage talking through feelings in a safe environment and explain to him how much we love him and how that won’t change, but he chooses to not talk or share. We understand he’s a child, we are just looking for advice, if anyone has been through a similar situation, did you have a different approach, and tips?

Thank you in advance.",14Feb2020,1

74,"I (F17) am really good friends with a girl (16) I met online a few years ago. We’ve always been really good friends but for the past few months but she’s been starting to get on my nerves. She’s homeschooled and has never properly experienced being around other teenagers but she thinks of herself as this really smart person in the way that if I talk to her about something that’s going on in my life she’ll over analyze it and start making assumptions about stuff.

For example, a while ago I briefly spoke to her about a guy that I kind of like. She started asking me these questions about him like how he reacted to things emotionally which I just thought was a weird question. I tried to stop the conversation but she kept at me saying it was important because he could basically just not be a good guy depending on how he reacted to different things. I kept trying to stop the conversation because it was getting really tense and it felt like an interrogation so I just said there wasn’t much to talk about with regards to the guy (like nothings happening at the moment) but then she started saying that I always pushed down my feelings and I shouldn’t feel weird about talking about them and it just started to annoy me at that point, I didn’t like her assuming stuff like that. 

I just told her I needed to go do something at that point but I don’t know what to do. She’s always really adamant about thinking she knows what goes on in other people’s heads and I’ve tried telling her otherwise but she always just does this type of thing again and again. I’ve put it down to her never really being around that many teenagers before because I know she doesn’t talk to many people outside her computer. She’s also had a really hard life too which sucks but I just don’t know what to do with this.",14Feb2020,1

So when the question “what challenge did you face and overcome?” was asked, here I was telling them about the first thing that came to my mind.

I overcame depression. I told my whole freaking life story behind it. And then after leaving, I realized that I screwed up big time. I answered every question fine except that one.

79,"Hi there, my name is David and I'm 21 years old. I live in Wisconsin US with my beautiful wife. I moved to America around 5 months ago now and I'm expecting work authorization or my green card in the next 4-6 months. All my life I've never really had a set career path that I want to pursue, I've basically just done a little bit of a lot of things. Video Editing, Graphics Design, Plumbing, Cooking, Gardening, the list could go on but my main point is that I've dipped my toes in a lot of different ideas but none of them really stuck.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was younger, around 13 or so, I started to edit videos and photos in my free time just for fun. It would mostly be gaming related so old school COD montages or I'd edit some cool photographs I found on the internet. I really enjoyed this for a really long time, so much so that I didn't really try too hard in school because I figured I could just do that as a job. Welp a few years went by and I left school at 18 with relatively poor grades considering what I could've had if I'd actually tried. I got myself a job at a supermarket a few months later and worked there for a few years. Throughout this time I'd been talking to my now-wife online and we'd been going over and seeing eachother every few months until we decided to go for the K-1 visa in early 2019. Now in 2020 I'm here and expecting my work authorization through soon. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just feel like I don't have any real defined skill that I can say I'm excellent at. I've recently been looking at job prospects and career ideas and one has stuck out to me which would be Web Development and programming. I've dabbled in it before when I was much younger but never anything serious, however now I'm older I'm starting to pay more attention. Things that I once was confused about now make a lot more sense and I feel like I'm enjoying learning now. (I wish I was like that in school... but oh well we live and learn..) 

&amp;#x200B;

What I need advice in is when and what did you decide to do for your career? Did you have a sudden Huzzah! moment or did you really have to just feel around until something stuck? I feel so bogged down all the time by the stress of not being able to find something to do that I just procrastinate and end up playing games all day wasting a lot of my valuable time that I have between now and starting work. Any advice would just be amazing and so helpful, I really just want to do all I can to make my family and wife proud of me and make myself proud of who I am and strive to be the best I can.

80,"Background: I live and work in a small town. A little more than a year ago, my business partner and I went through a very public, very nasty dissolution. We established separate firms. A local charity has approached my firm to sponsor an event. Their email reads, in pertinent part, as follows:

“Last year [YOUR FIRM] was a [bronze] sponsor, thus, my request for you to decide as to whether you will again be a sponsor. We're hoping that you will consider a higher sponsorship level as [YOUR EX-PARTNER’S FIRM] contributed [a silver sponsorship] last year and are being approached for the [gold]-level.”

This person is well aware of the contentious nature of my partner and I’s dissolution. I find it unprofessional and insulting to be approached in this manner. I should note, however, that this person has referred my firm work within the last 6 months. 

I would also note that within the last year, a different local charity solicited me in precisely the same way. I simply ignored that solicitation. I love giving back to my community, but I will not be goaded into giving.

Should I ignore the present sponsorship solicitation altogether? Respond tactfully that I find the person’s approach to be offensive, but agree to sponsor (or decline)? Not address the approach at all and accept (or decline)?",14Feb2020,1

82,"So background,

I babysit for this random couple that are the neighbors of a friend I have. I met the dad while working a service job and he asked me to babysit after I told him I also do that. Mind you he has never been creepy or something ( but he does always compliment me).

So I’ve babysat their kid a few times, no problem. 
Up until last week. 
The mom was out of town for work and wouldn’t make it back till the morning but the dad would be home around 2 so he came home alone. 
We had a chat on the couch ‘cause I was watching tv.
Literally nothing was going on but somewhere while we are talking he placed his hand on my thigh. 
And I kinda thought it was nothing ? He’s a dad you know. Dads feel paternal to kids all the time so I thought he meant nothing by it. 
But he like slowly moved closer and closer and then he kissed me. I was stunned and I didn’t really know what to do so I just kinda let it happen.. 
I don’t want to go into details but he did touch my chest and like straddled me and tried to put up my skirt but then noticed I wasn’t into it I suppose because he stopped and apologized. 
I basically ran out of the home, I didn’t even take the money ( he send me the money through card the day after)
And now things are awkward. The wife asked me to babysit again next week but I haven’t answered yet. 
On top of that I told a friend and she basically told me she was jealous because he’s really attractive. Which is true but he has a wife, and a lovely kid. And he’s like 35. I’m 17, I’m in frickin high school ( but this is a eu country so age of consent is 16). The fact that he is hot doesn’t change any of that.

What do I do now ? I guess I should stop babysitting for them but I will still see him in the store I work in, and whenever I’m at my friends parents parties he’s also there. I’ve seen him once since then while working in the store and I had like a bit of a panic attack. 

I’m at a loss",14Feb2020,1
84,"I'm just looking for advice about any and all of the current problems I've having with this situation. If you take the time to read this whole thing, thank you.

Mid-January, a week into the semester, three of my siblings 6, 10, 12 where dropped off at my one bedroom apartment by their mom. She was supposed to go into rehab, but dropped out a day later. My dad is at a hotel with disabled women who is footing the bill in exchange for his help after her father died. My 4 year old sibling and the kids' mother is also at the hotel.

My only income is financial aid and the seasonal position I had at Target this past Christmas. I've already spent enough to make me short before the semester is over. I'm doing extremely poorly this semester so far, which threatens my ability to transfer to university next semester and if I fail I'll have to pay back my financial aid from this semester.

The kids are extremely dependent. They despise doing anything that's not tv or video games and will stop doing something if they aren't checked up on every few minutes. For example, I've told them every single day since they arrived a month ago to put their bookbags in the closet when they get home from school, but only one child did it once in that time frame. This same situation occurs with shoes, coats, teeth brushing, hair combing, etc. This isn't to say they don't do what I say. They just only do it if I just told them to do one specific thing that moment. Two things at once? One won't get done till I say it again.

They never stop talking till they go to sleep. Example: This Saturday I was making coffee while everyone was sleeping, when I heard the middle one yell ""I can't wait to do ""x"" on Gary's Mod!"". He hadn't even rolled over from his head down sleeping position on the floor. It was non-stop jabbering from that point even after I lectured him for yelling.

One night, an hour before bed, I told them no talking for that one hour. The two older ones got a warning, then sent to timeout, then immediately got themselves sent to timeout again after that. They just seem completely unaware.

The only good thing is they always pass out minutes after I lay them down at 8:30 without a fight.

I don't know what to do. I know how to take of kid's basic needs because I took care of three of my other (now adult) siblings when I was a teenager, but I don't have the time to study and do everything for them, don't have enough space, and have no financial resources. Even if they where to vanish into air now, I don't know if I'd be able to recover academically and financially at this point.

My dad got groceries for this month with food stamps (last month was out of pocket) but I don't know if it will cover the whole month. He's says he looking for a job, but he's been unemployed since March. Their mom hasn't even been by to see them, which is making them very upset. My grandparents sent a little money, but are living off retirement themselves. The school gave them supplies.

Teachers have given me some extensions, but everything is still pilling up and only studying can improve my test grades.

The walls in my apartment are very thin, so you can hear every little sound. I have asked them multiple times to keep it down after 12, but they get too stoned to remember. The craziest part is, is that her friend lives down the street. I’m usually not against people coming over, but when it starts to interfere with my sleep and studies, that’s crossing the line.

86,"Hello,

I just received a letter from Kansas City University of Medicine and Biosciences. They are inviting me to apply to their PsyD program. Enrolling straight from undergraduate to PsyD would be a huge thing for me - it would mean I could have doctorate in just 1 year more than it would take to get my master's in Counselor Education/Clinical Mental Health Counseling and open *lots* of doors for me.

The only problem is on their website it says this:

""*KCU is regionally accredited by the Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools. Our Psy.D. program has initiated the multi-year process of seeking APA accreditation.

In May 2018, we received “Intent to apply” status from the APA Commission on Accreditation after program document review and will submit an application for “accreditation, on contingency” in Fall 2019. The “Intent to Apply” status will expire in May 2021.*""

Considering the cost of getting a PsyD (over 100k) and the fact that I would have to move to MO, I'm very dubious about this offer. My application fee is waived so I figured I'd apply just to see if I can get in, but wanted to know reddit's thoughts.",14Feb2020,1

I love black people, most music artists I listen to are black, I’m inspired by their courage to fight for their rights, and I’ve even cried several times over my racist parents because most of my heroes and idols are black and my parents don’t approve of my interests at all, and mock blacks.

but I can’t seem to stop letting my mind get the better of me in situations with black people. I’m not scared really, since I know that any sane person wouldn’t immediately hate me. It’s just that when I get into a conversation with a black person, or an interaction with them, my mind tells me to try and be chill and act cool with them so they don’t think I’m judging them by their skin color. 

For example, I had to tell the security guard at my Grandma’s neighborhood where I was going, and he was black. He came out of the little shack and I said “I’m going to (Address)” and I started to get really nervous and I handed him my ID.

So today, I asked my friend, we'll call him Jake, if he could write my name on the paper. Our mutual friend, he'll be Nate, also takes that class with us. Jake finds out that the prof is also counting the number of students in seats so he texts me that he isn't going to put my name down and it'll just look like I skipped the class. Nate, on the other hand, did not catch on to the counting, thought that Jake had forgotten to write my name for me, and wrote himself. I think you see where this is going...

Nate got caught, honestly admitted he did it, and had to talk to the prof after class. The prof asked if I knew that he had done that (which honestly I did not until Jake texted me after class about the mess up). Nate said no, prof says he doesn't believe him and doesn't know why Nate would do something so deceitful.

Following the procedures for contacting our prof, I text him telling him who I am and how I found out what had happened and asked him to call me when he got a chance.

His reply: ""Not today.... I'm so angry about this little stunt. I'll call you tomorrow.""

It’s weird for some people but it’s my life and I’ve I’m not ashamed of it anymore...

Anyway, my mom is living 14 hours away now with one of my aunts because she’s in her 80’s now. And my grandpa and I still live in my home town. Back in September, we found out he was diagnosed with stage 3 lung cancer, later found out to be stage 4. Since then he’s gone through 6 cycles of chemo and been sicker than hell. But at first it was working and he started to feel a little better.

He’s been feeling worse recently though, so the oncologist sent him for another rCT and sure enough, his cancer has become resistant to the chemo and is beginning to grow again. Chances are, other chemo won’t work and will just make his last months miserable. So I think for his quality of life, we are opting to do nothing... which the doctor says will give him 3-6 months.

He has also traded the photos of these other people within the friend group of the teen. (Multiple minors trading photos of other multiple minors who have no idea). He has also said a message that said the following:

BIL: Would is surprise you if I was charged with murder?

Person they were talking to: Um why?

BIL: My dad has been on my nerves and I want to kill him. 

He has also been fluffing to these people that he does drugs and drink (which he definitely has not). He’s never had sex either. The chats he has are XXX (and even me, an “experienced” adult who has some interesting likes, the chats made me gag and cringe terribly).


I’ve suggested that the parents ask law enforcement to come talk to him. Remove phone and XBOX (when time comes, nightly turn in of phones and parental controls for awhile). I suggested this because this is exactly what my parents did to me when I was caught doing this at his age. I also asked my mom what she would do.

102,"To make a long story short, his mother has mental health issues and no one seems to want to address it and chalk it up to “oh that’s just how she is”. He’s been threatened before since he was 13 about being kicked out but has only actually happened when he was 20 but he went back the next day. Now this time he’s been kicked out, yet again, for an issue he wasn’t involved in but his mom caused a gigantic scene which quite frankly he could’ve got her arrested for but because he has two younger sisters he hesitated. We’re long distance so there’s absolutely no way for me to invite him to my house otherwise I would. He has no other family in Florida, except for his grandmother, but she’s living in the apartment too atm even though his mother wants her out too. The only friend I know of that lives in Florida he’s not AS close with and he’d never ask for help either. He only took his clothes and whatever belongings he could grab but he does own a car so that’s a good thing. He also has a gym membership where he can go bathe. He has a part time job but the hours aren’t the best atm although he’s trying to work on getting his real estate license if he passes his test.

I wasn’t expecting any of this to happen and it’s really just upset me beyond belief and all I can do is sit here and cry about it. He doesn’t have any money momentarily so I’m just at a loss of how to help him. Him and his grandmother were supposed to look for apartments today until this happened so now I’m not so sure about that either but I’m trying to stay strong for him but it’s hard. If there’s any advice on what I could do for him or what he can do for himself I’d greatly appreciate it.

TLDR; bf got kicked out of parents apartment and has nowhere to go except his belongings and is currently sleeping in his car. Has part time job, but no money saved, and had option to live with grandmother once an apartment was found but she’s still living at the apartment. Any advice is welcome.",14Feb2020,1
103,"Currently I’ve been applying to jobs at daycares. I had one interview where I had to actually work with the kids and I loved it. I’ve always known that I loved kids but I was scared to work with them because I want them in the future. (I think that I will end up feeling like I won’t be able to get away from my job if that makes sense). I am considering getting a early childhood education degree, however I know that most those jobs will pay less than the career plan I was planning on doing. I also feel like some of the jobs (Ex.babysitter) may be less stable. And I’m not sure if I want to be a teacher or therapist. I would like to babysit or work with toddlers mostly. I think I would be happier pursuing a career with kids versus my other career plan.

My other career plan was working in radiology. For the past four years I was planning on getting a radiology degree and becoming an ultrasound,  MRI, CT, or x-ray tech. I feel like these jobs will provide stability and money. I will also be able to get the degree faster and with less debt compared to early childhood. However, I would only be doing it for those reasons. I don’t feel like radiology will make me happy, but I also don’t think I’ll absolutely dread any of these jobs. I can see myself doing most of the jobs within the radiology field, whereas I only want to do a select few in early childhood education. I’ve already looked at all other paths and this is the one outside of early childhood I feel will fit me best. (I am passionate about philosophy but I was advised not to go there bc it gets you nowhere. And I don’t wanna use it for law or marking).

Recently I had a talk with my coworker and she caused me to really doubt myself. She started telling me all these stories of people who chose money over happiness and it resulted in them hating their lives. While I don’t want to be one of these people but, let’s not lie, money is important. I’ve grown up with both parents struggling to make ends meet and I don’t want that for my future family and I. Also I want to make enough to sustain myself and at least 2 kids. I don’t want to depend on anyone else or their income. However I want to be happy with my career choice because this is take up a major amount of my life. It’s something I’ll have to do nearly everyday so obviously I want to enjoy it.

Has anyone had an experience dealing with a situation like this? Any advice would be helpful.",14Feb2020,1
104,"and i've only just started learning how to make music.

My current situation: I'm 18, on a gap year and set to start Medicine this September. Right now I am on the path to be a doctor (Already done admissions for medical school and got it) and with no doubt it will be a job I enjoy and will be satisfied with, but it isn't my dream per se.

My dream: If I were to tell you my ideal job it would be to make music full time, put as much time into my work as I want and be paid enough to sustain my living costs and not worry about money (I'm not obsessed with making it to be crazy famous)

Why am I considering this now: For the first time in years I am in a emotionally stable enough position after a battle with mental health where I believe I can fully commit to something. I'm also thinking that in 30 years I would be so disappointed if I didn't at least try to achieve my dream- that would be such a mediocre and disappointing life to me. I genuinely do not see the point in not trying at all.

Why I believe I can pull this off: This is where it might seem crazy because I have almost zero experience in making music myself, but I am absolutely in love with it. One of the biggest things that I have learnt about myself is that when I am working on something I am passionate about my work ethic is unparalleled, I am always striving to improve, adjust get closer to perfection and I know that with time I can make works of art. I have the vision, ideas things I want to do (from a technical standpoint I just cannot execute these yet as I don't have the skills). I understand alot of people also take the risk to make music and there is so much competition, but I'm genuinely of the mindset that I can stand out from the crowd. I feel music, I see it, I'm so emotionally captured by it more than other people and I genuinely believe I have the capability to make truly captivating work.

Why I am asking for advice: another thing I have learnt is that it is not possible to see the whole bigger picture by myself, and none of my family know yet of this. this whole process makes logical sense to me and I want to do it, but what if I'm missing something? I don't know. I would really be glad to hear your honest thoughts on me taking a step like this.

Anyway, today he comes home for work and our dog, who’s always excited when we come home goes to him and I jokingy say “where’s ___ gift for valentine’s day” and he replies that men don’t give gifts to other men and we have to get our dog a gift as females. Then I try to argue that Valentine’s day is about love and showing that you care about someone, but he’s says “No, i’m homophobic and i don’t believe in that” I’m immediately floored and just walk away. I’ve always assumed that he was slightly homophobic by his comments growing up but he’s never confirmed it out right. For example, always saying when you marry a guy/ when my brother marries a girl and once when i wanted to get my baby cousin a stuffed animal he said that that’s too girlish for him. I understand that he’s a devout christian and he’s had a much different childhood from me, but I don’t know if i could honestly see him as the same father I have most of my life not that he’s admitted to it. 


Also-I have this rainbowish sweater that I wear around the house because it’s comfortable and this past week he’s been making comments like “Why are you wearing that with a rainbow” or “You’re walking around with that sweater, you better not wear that out”

I found out that his gf is on my snap and I have the pictures that he's sent me. (I didn't ss them, he saved them in the text so I can just go back and ss it to prove it).

115,"Let me preface this question with: I fully understand and acknowledge 99.999% of women at the gym are not there to make friends. They are there to workout and not talk. I want to respect that, but I've never been so tempted to try my luck with someone at the gym before. Theres just something about her I am crushing on hard about. 

I've been going to this gym for months now. This past week a new face appeared and I've seen her the last 4 times I've been there. Today was chest day and there was a smith machine next to her (only one open) so I sit down and realize theres no hecking plates for me to use. 

So I walk over, pull out an ear bud and ask if I can use the ones on her rack. She pulls an ear bud out ""what's that? Oh yeah sure"" (while avoiding all eye contact). I finish my sets, rerack back on her machine and go on with my workout. Not long after she finishes on her smith machine too. I see her on the treadmill for a whole 3 minutes and next thing I know, she comes in to the same part of the gym that I'm doing abs in. I finish abs and go to the locker room. As I'm coming out shes walking over to reception and cuts right in front of me. I saw her glance back in the mirror and see me behind her. 

If I try and break the ice further will I come off as creepy? She could think that I was following her if she wasnt actually following me around like I initially projected her to be. What's the least creepy way for me to break the ice? Should I just admire from afar and never talk to her?",14Feb2020,1
116,"I know how the title sounds, but please hear me out. First off, I'd like to stress that I always take sexual assault seriously and I would never victim-blame.

I(F16) met this friend(F16) in high school. The first day we hung out, she brought up how she had a traumatizing experience a couple months ago. I won't go into too much detail, but she said that she was with her classmate (M16) and he touched her without her consent (she was too drunk). She also said he basically stalked her. She told me everything that went down, but the gist of it was that she hated this guy's guts and everything he did was 100% without her permission, which was obvious. I was shocked and comforted her because that's something no one should go through.

Now, fast forward a few months. All of a sudden, my friend and her assaulter are close friends. They often hang out and text a lot, and I see them together at school all the time. It's really obvious that she holds no hostility against him, which struck me as weird. I asked her why she's friends with him, because he's the one who assaulted her. She won't give me a straight response. Her telling me about this trauma is a big part of what bonded us, as I had essentially been through the same thing. This is why this subject is important to me; our similar past brought us closer, and it makes me uncomfortable and disrespected to think that maybe she was lying about parts of it (I still believe it happened).

Am I wrong for questioning whether she exaggerated or left out a part of her story? I want to believe and trust her completely, but a part of me can't help but think that it's just strange that she is so chummy with him. I don't know if I'm being disrespectful to her as a sexual assault victim or reading too much into it. Should I just let it go?",14Feb2020,1

118,"Quick background: I’m a mid 20s girl. I know next to nothing about cars and drive a 14 year old Camry. While I would love to upgrade, I’ve got 4 months until graduation (and therefore employment) so I’m invested in keeping my crappy car working until I can afford something better.

So a few days ago I started hearing a clicking/creaking sound when I made sharp turns at slow speeds, so I figured I’d take my car in to the mechanic. I work full time, so I called a well reviewed mechanic near my place of work a few days in advance and explained the problem and said that I could leave the car all day but I had to pick it up by 4. I’ll save you the long story, but it was a frustrating experience. They ended up saying I needed new brake pads/rotors since that was probably making the noise. They gave me one price which I agreed to then 2 minutes later said it was going to be a $110 more than the quote without explanation. They agreed to have it done by a certain time and they were late, which threw off my plans for the rest of the night. It ended up costing me $340. When I was picking it up, the mechanic asked if the noise was a rattling sound when I was driving, which was not at all what I described to them. He said if the noise persisted I could bring it back another time and he’d drive with me and listen. As I was driving away, I literally heard the noise as I was pulling out of the parking lot, and it wasn’t subtle. I would’ve brought it back then but I was already late and they were closing. There were other frustrating details that I’m leaving out for brevity, but I’m pretty annoyed with this mechanic. On the one hand, I think I should bring it back so he can fix what I actually came for since he fucked it up the first time, but I doubt he’s going to refund me on the work he’s already done or give me a discount or anything. On the other hand, I think he’s a shitty mechanic who didn’t listen to me at all and I would rather take my business elsewhere and not give him another dime. Is it better to give him a second chance and hope he does some sort of refund/ discount or take my business elsewhere?",14Feb2020,1

122,"My 73-year-old grandfather lives with me (27) and my girlfriend (27) ever since my mom died. My grandma died five years ago so that's how long he has been a widower. He is a nice man but takes no shit from anyone (and I mean anyone). He still holds a part-time job at our local Wal-Mart...

Ever since my mom died (his daughter) two years ago, he hasn't been the same. With no wife and with his only living children living out of state all he really has for a family are me and my girlfriend. Now, as I stated, he is 73 years old and can be naive about certain things, and in this case technology. He has a computer in his room and other than going to work Facebook is really his only other social life. ""He lives on Facebook practically"", as my mom once put it.

He has a tendency to meet women his own age on Facebook, but they always hit him up first as far as I know... This story really begins about three of four months ago when some old lady began messaging him on Facebook. He gave her his phone number and it didn't take very long for him to regret it. This old lady, someone who he has never met, immediately began talking about how she was in love with him... It got so bad he stopped answering her calls and had to get my girlfriend to help him block her on both his Facebook and cellphone. I do very well remember her calling over and over and over and over and over and over before we finally got her blocked on his old cheap 2009 cellphone.

We thought we had solved the problem until about a week later... My grandfather was on vacation for one week and when he went back to work apparently this old lady had come to his workplace and asked his co-workers when he worked again so she could come to meet him. Of course, they didn't tell her. We all tried to laugh it off and for the past two months and since, things have been fine... until tonight.

My girlfriend and I were preparing for bed when I walked into the kitchen and saw a car parked down at the end of our driveway. I opened the door and saw this strange vehicle moving back and forth between the neighbors house and ours. I turned the porch light on and then the car pulled up. A man, probably in his 30s or 40s, along with some old lady were sitting inside. The man stuck his head out the window and asked if (my grandfather's name) lived here. I figured maybe it was some co-workers or maybe even someone else he knows so I reluctantly said yes. My girlfriend who was standing by me when to get my grandfather.

My grandpa stood on the front steps and asked who it was and then it was revealed to be none other than, yep you guessed it, that crazy old lady. He was stunned and ordered them to leave our property under the threat of him ""getting his gun"", (yeah I know, probably wasn't smart for him to say). They left, but not before dropping a bag in the driveway. Once they were gone he asked me to go get it. I went out there and picked it up. It was a gift bag full of stuff.

We went into the kitchen and the three of us looked through it together. She had put inside two cards and a very expensive looking pocket knife. My grandpa put all of it back in the bag and asked my girlfriend to throw it in the trash. Before she got the chance, I decided to keep the knife because it looks really nice... I tried to read the cards and all I saw was ""I love you so much"" and her phone number. He took the cards and bag away and threw them away himself. He swears to me he has never met this woman in person, that it has been months since they have even had contact, and that wants no part of her... but the scary part is that she should have NO WAY of knowing where we live. He NEVER gave her our address. And I could tell he was embarrassed and probably frightened as to how she and that man that was with her knows where we live.

I know I might sound stupid or paranoid but I do not like the fact that this old woman and that other dude seem to be stalking my grandpa and even found out where he (we) lives. This whole situation just doesn't add up to me. And of course, my grandpa chooses to do nothing about it... But I am going to do something about it but I just don't know.

After some digging, I figured out (and have confirmed with someone else in our family - apparently the only person who knew the secret) that I'm closely related to one of the birth parents. This person (the birth parent) doesn't know that I'm aware that they gave a child up for adoption at a young age, and presumably has gone to great lengths to conceal this information throughout their life (is now in their 70s). I have no idea what to do. I've been sort of buying time in the messaging with this person given up for adoption while I try to figure out if it's okay to disclose the identity of the birth parent.

I thought it was a weird joke, until a couple months ago. My younger brother said that he was gonna set up cameras to watch us jokingly and my dad said “ I’ve done that, it’s not fun”. I asked him what he meant and he just ignored me. ever since then i’ve been having a lot of anxiety when I get dressed or anything because I don’t know if he’s watching me, so I decided to test it out. I took some weed from his stash and hid it in a rip in my teddy bear deep In my closet. today when I took out the bag, there was a note that said “I wish you would stop stealing from me”.

144,"I slept late today. I should have gotten up earlier, but instead I allowed myself to waste the day sleeping. As sometimes happens when I sleep late with the sun out, I get into this delirium of powerful, vivid dreams. I always want to chase those dreams. They feel important; the feel true in a way the in-and-outs of practical life feel false. They contain a beauty that real life does not, and it just feels right at the time.

Today, for example, I dreamed a new musical idea, although it's hard to remember 100%, and how good is it? What seems powerful in the dream may not seem so in waking. Or is the dream telling you something true that layers of consciousness obscure?

I didn't have 'work' I missed, per se, but there's always something to be done in waking life. I had a potential client I really should have called back earlier. I probably could have squeezed in a gym session if I wasn't sleeping. And so on. And those things aren't not important, right? I think of where I could be in life right now if I were a pure, practical-minded busybody, with my current brain resources always laser focused on those things.

And this was all magnified back when I was in college. I slept through many of my early classes first semester. I still have fond memories of what I was embracing; of the sun and the cool mountain air coming through my window. More than that, I really had myself convinced I was doing something right. I was rejecting what others had thought right for me, and embracing the things that felt true to myself: Art, music, aesthetics, feeling...life. Failing classes that semester, however, didn't feel quite so right. 

So did I foolishly waste my time in my dreaming? Was a more a drug addict searching for a high that destroys their life while doing it, than a philosophical explorer of the mind? Is it all just something to be entirely forgotten while we busy ourselves with tasks and bills and practical work? Am I still just a fool for ever letting it all go and exploring those dreams?

I’ve always had trouble with pronouncing words and my speech but lately I’ve been mumbling a lot and it’s been worse for pronouncing words.
I’m not sure if this is anxiety or maybe I’m a little depressed or stressed out. I just have been feeling this way since the fall and it’s gotten even worse this year. 
I’ve also been second guessing everything I do, I’ve always done this a little but now it’s obsessive. For example I can’t walk out of the house without going back to check to see if I closed the door all the way or at the gym I know I locked my locker but I have to check it at least once, usually twice after.

I was sexually assaulted/ taken advantage of in November so idk if this is related to that- the person did not get in trouble and I did not pursue anything (big regrets) and I hold a lot of anger towards them. I constantly thing about it and work myself up where my heart is racing and all I want is to punch him in the face.

152,"I am a 19 year old female who lives with her father and his girlfriend . 
Ive been living with them for about 7 months now . Ive been struggling to find a job since I was let go from my old job in late November last year . 
Ive been handing out resumes online and in person , and even doing chores around the home to make sure I am helping out while living here as they dont expect me to pay rent .

As of December , my dads girlfriend started treating me differently . She started to complain about me constantly and always makes rude remarks about me to my dad and doesnt care that i hear it . My dad has tried to tell her she needs to stop being so hard on me , but she just gets angry and defensive and then they argue about it . 

To be more specific these are only some of the things she does :

- she refuses to be in the same room as me and has a small tantrum when asked to come into the same room as me 

- she never looks at me and tries her best to avoid looking in my direction , this includes childish behaviors such as turning her head completely to the other side of the room and looking up if she is facing me 

- she always makes complaints to my dad about me being lazy , annoying , problematic , and her favorite ""she does nothing all day"" 

(i do a lot more than she thinks i do all day also) 

- she accuses me of not being smart enough to change a toilet paper roll (i forgot to change it once) and accuses me of taking some of their money when i never did such a thing

- she gets angry with me if i speak to my dad (no matter what she gets angry and dislikes me talking with him very much)

- she doesnt like it when i message or call my dad , i overheard her getting angry when i called him while i was out 

- shes always whispering to herself when i walk by 

- she treats me like complete garbage because im not working temporarily 

I tried writing her a letter explaining how i feel about the way shes been toward me , she read it days ago and isnt saying anything back to me about it . Shes just been behaving worse toward me . So i sent her a message apologizing and telling her that i hope things can get better . 

Me , her and my dad have had countless talks about these kinds of things in the past , but suddenly she has been avoiding confrontation, normal polite confrontation. I just dont understand why she is being like this after all my efforts to get a job and to help her to not be so angry with me all the time . 

I just dont know what to do anymore . Ive tried apologizing for whatever it is that caused her to dislike me so much , but she doesnt care . She doesnt want to have anything to do with me it seems and I was wondering f anybody had advice on what i could do to maybe repair whats been broken here . Thank you !",14Feb2020,1

At Christmas we all go to theirs to eat and my uncle tells me I have a package from Amazon. I'm like weird, I don't remember ordering anything, but it's not beyond me to order something and completely forget about it. I open it up and it's some crazy sex toy for dudes. Fortunately I opened it away from the family and all the young children, I shove it in a cupboard and spend the next week cross-referencing who knows I was living at that address and who would send me a $70 sex toy for Christmas. It's basically my best friend or an ex-lover. Neither of them own up to it.

Over the next month a couple more random amazon orders turn up and that's when I think it's probably not just a friend dicking about. So I do some googling and it turns out a few people have had random sex toys turn up at their house, free of charge and other random amazon stuff, so marketplace sellers can game the amazon product review system (google it it's pretty wild), so I assume I'm just getting some freebies from that.

Then I check a CC statement for a card I haven't used for a while and see a handful of amazon charges I don't recognize that correlate with the delivery dates and I'm like ""oh fuck"". I call Amazon and confirm the card has been used to open a mobile Prime account. Whilst trying to figure out the whole ordeal, the rep accidentally revealed the phone  number they used for the account, which apparently is against their policy.

Anyway, Ive been talking to this girl, enjoying a lot, asked her out and keep getting denied, after a few attempts I opened my heart to her “I believe that we have more than just a friendship here, but please, maybe I am getting the wrong idea and I would like to know if that’s the case, so nobody end up hurting each other feelings”, well, her response was classical “like you as a friend”. Okay, I have been there before, no harm done, I am not deeply involved and can easily walk away.

Problem is, she won’t let me. And that’s kinda new for me. if I try to keep my distance, she starts talking to me. We even hang out as friends. And I am getting mad.

I woke up after a particular bad night yesterday and drank. I spent the day on just enough alcohol to be chill. Bought a pack of fags for the first time, although I had smoked before like the occasional one on a night out. My flat mates only realised I was drinking when they caught me missing a drink on the evening, I was not black out drunk. I smoked when I needed a top up. To get a feeling of dizzy spacey disembodiment. I accidentally burnt myself making soup, only a splash. All I could think about was how much I wanted to do it again. 

My flat mate took me out for a walk after I broke down and started talking about how I felt. The walk cleared my head for a bit but I'm now just wishing for the same things. I don't want to be left to think, I'm considering everything to space me out.

The thought of taking something more serious to space me out has occurred. I just I know that I won't do anything stupid stupid but I'm not doing good.

For some back story my girlfriend and I have been together for a little over a year. She has Bi-polar depression. She was raised in a very strict and Catholic household. She's 17 and still lives at home there. Since she was 13 her mom would give her wine to deal with her problems, she now gets drunk almost every day to deal with her problems with the wine that her mom provides her. After repeatedly asking for a therapist her parents just tell her to pray to God and her depression will go away. Over the year that I've been dating her she's slowly fallen away from her friends. I fear i'm one of the few people she has left. She graduates from high school this year and her plans for the future seem to not be working out. She believes that her family is going to kick her out as soon as they can. She says that after this summer she's going to kill herself. She has already attempted suicide, once two years ago (her parents got mad about the bill and that's it), and once while we were dating (she was too drunk to swallow the all of the pills). I had no clue what I was getting into when we started.

Recently we've been talking about breaking up. I'm not sure if its a good idea. I love her a lot and when  we're in each others company we both feel happy, but her depression has been too much for me to handle. I still love her a lot but i have no idea what will happen when i go to college. I'm afraid she's going to kill herself, how are ways she can get help? What can I do?

There were also black videos with static noise in them which I'm guessing meant nothing. They talked about giving ""salvation"" to my town and bs like that. Eventually, they posted a 17-day countdown and everyone started freaking out thinking there was going to be a school shooting. Nevertheless, the account gained popularity extremely fast, and every post that was made would be accompanied by hundreds of joke comments of students spelling out ""penis"" and making puns, etc. Still, I heard rumors that the principle was told about this and that they were (probably) looking for the person. 

&amp;#x200B;

After I assumed the 'secret poster' was getting annoyed of the satirical comments, they deleted all of their posts and put up an encrypted code in their bio which was quickly solved (I never heard what the solution was) and followed by another encoded message that said ""your all wasting your time. Phase 1 will begin soon then you will know"". Notice the multiple grammatical errors. This message was originally written in atbash meaning that it was decently easy to decrypt it online, and the poster didn't take the time to make anything elaborate. 

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, the secret poster made his/her last post reading: ""This was a social experiment to see how many people i could hook. As fun as was to see this blossom into a fucking meme unfortunately i forgot \[town name\] is full of pansies. with that being said im not trying to go to jail over karen being scared to go to school because of the \[profile name\] instagram page. Grow a pair of balls and stop being so sensitive to everything in life. It was fun GOOD BYE"". If I had to guess, they started to get scared once they saw how serious the situation was getting with school officials and how not-serious the comments from everyone else were. 

&amp;#x200B;

I decided to do some investigative work, so I had a conversation with the secret poster in DMs and they actually seemed pretty chill. He/she basically said that they were getting death threats, but they didn't mean anything bad by it, and they basically apologized for the whole thing, too. Not gonna lie, I felt a bit of pity for them, though their cocky last post gave me the will power to send them a bait link which I used to track their IP, city, and find what kind of phone, software version, service provider, etc. The link was disguised as a message, so they would have no idea that I tracked them, and since they neglected to use a VPN or VM, I'm guessing that they don't know much about security...

&amp;#x200B;

With an easy warrant from the cops, the school could easily contact the provider and track the exact location of the IP address. My question is: do you think the school even cares about finding out who this person is now that it's all over? Will giving them this info just put in a bad situation (with the police or school or whatever)? From the context clues, I've assumed that this secret poster is probably freaked out already, and they've probably also learned their lesson. They're most likely just some edgy high-schooler who made some stupid decisions. Is it really worth punishing them even more, or should I just let them off scot-free? Thanks!  


TLDR: Someone posted creepy edgy content on instagram directed at my town + school and a countdown, but deleted it when it got serious. Everyone panicked a little. I got info for the school to track down the person. Is it worth giving the school their identity?",14Feb2020,1
181,"Hey, so at the moment I am currently looking for my first car. originally my max price was stupid low, but my parents encouraged me to invest in a newer car that way i can get the years out of it. right now there are 3 that are catching my eye. one 2018 ford focus titanium for $15,250 all in (57,000 km), a second 2018 ford focus titanium for $17,000 all in but with my father's dealer (also has one accident in the history, it was rear ended with medium damage)\[40,000 km\], or a (2015?) ford focus SE $13,000 all in ( i think 60,000 km+)

I offered to bring her home. My husband was furious. But I explained the situation and said we didn't have to keep her but I didn't want her to end up at the shelter. He ended up loving her while she was cute and itty bitty. But now she is in a little monster stage and struggling with potty training he doesn't want to keep her. She has chewed some cords and admittedly some of his personal items. I have since blocked off his area so she can't access it and when I am at work I crate her so she won't be his responsibility. He is still insisting that we get rid of her and that she is ruining his life. I have another dog who is now 3 and if my memory serves me right, he hated her too. But after puppy hood she is a wonderful dog. I personally want to keep her, and he clearly doesn't. I am just sad and frustrated. He doesn't he love animals the way I do. Should I just rehome her?

187,"We met through a group of friends who we knew together.
We started hanging out together and one day she told me about her growing up.
She lost her father at an early age, her mother had a breakdown and abused her when she was young.
Her mother left her to her grandmother for about ten years.

Basically, she grew up without getting the attention and love she needed as a child.
Hearing the story sparked something in me that made me feel sorry for her.
I told her I could provide the love she needed and we started dating.

I knew she was mentally unstable the day I started dating her.
She would hurt herself when she was having a breakdown, she would text me right after we say goodbye that she was having a hard time.
She was showing a lot of red flags but I kept to my word.
She would text me and call me late at night because of her anxiety and I listened to her.
I couldn't do anything but listen until she felt better until she went to sleep.

The feeling of helplessness and listening to her stressing about her life chipped away at my patience.

The fact that I paid 99% of the time when we dated due to the fact that she did not have a decent job did not help.


After meeting her for 3 months I realized she did not care for others.
She did not think about what others would feel like when she spoke to as such, she did not care that I had a morning shift tomorrow when she called at 4am multiple times.
I was here working my ass off trying to pay for the expenses and listening to her ramble about no one in this world being on her side not knowing when she would stop and go to sleep.


After keeping this up for 7 months, the last strike was at my birthday February 9th.
She took my words and went to get a part-time job.
She was fired after two weeks.
We promised that she would help me with the expense but she bought a weird looking used shoe without a brand for $150 and a $50 zippo lighter.
She told me that she couldn't get me a present or atleast a cake because she did not have any money.

She was breaking me down and I had to say farewell.
I knew she loved me (whatever she thought love was) but I just couldn't.
Knowing her, I knew she was going to do something reckless but I couldn't care enough.
I chose my words very carefully and let her down.

Yesterday, her father contacted me and told me she killed herself.
I felt nothing. I wasn't sorry for her, nor did I miss her.
I was happy that we broke up, but I did not wish her death.

191,"I need some advice so I figured here would be a good place as you all are helpful. A bit of back story here. A little over a year ago, I was in a relationship with a guy that unfortunately didn’t work out. My cousin who is in her 30s was also in a relationship with a guy that didn’t work out. After cousin’s relationship ended, she decided she was unhappy with herself and for whatever reason wanted to look more like me. She went to Mexico and got a gastric surgery. Now she is super skinny and claims she is happy.  Fast forward to after she had the surgery, she started dating someone she knew from her childhood. 

Everything is happening super fast. I get if you love someone you know it. My cousin and I didn’t grow up together but have been close since adulthood. 

I got a text when they were two months in that they had purchased a house. Then another text that said they were going ring shopping at four months. I was very happy for them both. The very next day after ring shopping, they were engaged. I was informed a week later that they would be getting married in December. Then a few days later they advised they had moved it up to March. They are getting married on March 13. In case anyone is wondering, she is not pregnant as she has told me she cannot have kids.

I got my invite but due to it being out of state and me being out of time off I will be unable to attend. On the invite it has wishlists. Tonight as I’m going through, I texted her and told her I would be sending something to her. Here is where it get weird. She admitted she knew I wasn’t going to come but she had to invite me anyway. Then when I inquire about gifts, I’m told multiple times not to send one. I understand that both my cousin and her soon to be husband are in their 30s so they probably have everything they need. It’s the first wedding for both. I guess I don’t understand why you would send out invites with wish list then be like no. 

I really want to be supportive. To be honest, I am a bit concerned about my cousin but I would never tell her that. I get when girls meet guys, they do everything together. I’m not jealous but I feel like I lost my best friend and that somethings not right. What would you do if you were me?",14Feb2020,1

197,"I am just looking for some online insight on their thoughts about this situation, what I should possibly do or if there are things I’m just not seeing.

For the sake of this story, we will call this girl Jane. I have known Jane for quite some time, since the beginning of high school. We are now mid twenties. We never kicked off a romantic interest until about two years ago, where she got out of a serious relationship and just happened to have eyes for me. That relationship involved dividing of a house, finances, lawyers and such, and there was very little time between relationships. 

Next thing you know, we are dating one another. I’m living at my mothers at this point, and she has ended up renting a place with friends. After a conflict between roommates, eventually I move in a few months later. Our relationship is still blossoming and great at this point.

A few months in, we have an instance where I was flirting with a girl I used to work with who didn’t live in North America anymore. Playful, but not serious. She came across the messages while going through my phone (at this point had gone through it on three to four occasions). That caused some issues with trust, which I can take fault for but told her to dump me if it was going to ruin our relationship. She decided to stick around

From there, we got past that and travelled many places, I had a fair amount of money from an inheritance that I was able to spend with her in the beginning of our relationship. 

Fast forward to about December, where we have a dispute with our landlord. We have to find a place by April, so we decide we might as well buy a place. I put down 80% of the downpayment to make sure we could afford a nice place. It’s in the range of 50,000 down.

Around that time, our relationship really starts taking a shit kicking. She gets ultra upset when things aren’t OCD clean, to the point where she’s blowing up and full on screaming her head off. I’m genuinely not a dirty person, but am not perfect either. I can be burnt and make mistakes. She continues to let the trivial things get to her. I think it’ll pass on with house stress and Christmas time financial stress.

February comes and we move in together. Not 24 hours in, she dumps me. The first day we have the house. Saying she doesn’t want to be with me anymore. Says she hasn’t felt it for a while and is open to going to relationship counselling. In the meantime though, she wants space. She sleeps out at coworkers houses at night, does her own stuff, going out all the time while I watch the animals of the house. but talks to me when she wants help or needs someone to talk to. She hasn’t decided what she wants yet so I’m kind of being toyed along.

Before the falling out of the last few months, I thought everything was really good. We had some trust issues that I had believed we worked past with assurance from her, but that wasn’t the case. Ideally I’d like to let the situation work 

Should I be trying to work on the relationship, should I be finding ways to get out of the housing situation, I’m totally lost on what the fuck is going on. I need some ADVICE",14Feb2020,1
198,"**Long story short:** I had allegations made against me that made their way to both my college and the police. I visit a local criminal defense firm and hired two lawyers (being partners) - one would focus on criminal side, and the other the college side. I had to spend **4 years worth** of my money that I had saved. I was told the criminal side would cost **$10,000** and the college side would cost **$15,000** ""because it could take longer and require a lot of back and forth meetings"". Furthermore, I not only exhausted almost all of my savings but my mother had to dip into her 401K for **$10,000**.

After two stressful months, the criminal side lawyer worked hard and my case was dropped. As for the college side, all I did was submit my statement (which was slightly modified by the paralegal) and no follow-up meetings were had. My case with the school was dropped **with no work**. 

I admit I did sign a contract to pay both sides of the $25,000 **but** that was under the premise that the school side would be a lot of work when it absolutely was minimal.

**My Question:** I really want to pay my mother back because she means the world to me, would it be possible to talk to the attorneys to get the $15,000 back because no work had to be done college side? Or, since I signed the contract am I screwed?",14Feb2020,1

*There's a TL;DR at the bottom because this is a long post*

Since this post, I've apologized to my friend for betraying her trust in me. I've told her how guilty I feel about the things I've done, the things I've said, and how I poorly reacted to her explaining she doesn't think a relationship (neither a long distance one nor one we had once wanted) would work.

She wanted to call last Friday, February 7th, 2020. She hadn't talked to me by voice for a long while, and the only contact she had with me since the fallout was just reading my blog, where I just open up and write however I feel and whatever I think and post. Sure I could do this all on a word document and keep it private, and there's a long and irrelevant story as to why I blog.

So I called her once I was free on the 7th. I had vocalized the same things I said in a text apology, which prompted her wanting to call me. I did most of the talking during the call. I heard that she was crying. I don't know what specifically brought her to tears since I did nothing more than just repeat everything I texted her. She eventually said ""it's good to hear your voice. I was scared"", and I'm assuming she was scared I'd do some even more irrational or dangerous to myself or the people around me? I didn't ask, so I don't know what scared her.

So I suppose it's been only 6 days. A couple of days ago, I decided to reconnect with her on social media. I did this on February 11th, 2020. One detail I neglected in my first post is that I removed people as followers as well as unfollow people. She accepted my re-follow request (she has a private Instagram account) and followed me back on Instagram and the other platforms I re-followed her on.

Because tomorrow is Valentine's, I naturally think about what I thought Valentine's this year was going to bring. But everything changed. All I want is my best friend back, and I don't know what I should do.

TL;DR I made some baby steps towards reconciliation, but I don't know where to go from here. I'm unsure how to regain trust and unsure of what level of contact I can do.",14Feb2020,1

He had 2 children and he got to know me so I started to see him as a friends. He framed it to my manager as a joke, so I went along with it. It was so absurd that I never even considered he was being serious. But when I did, I brought up the age gap. He immediately asked me what age I would date him at. He stopped being friendly to me after that. 

This same man worked with my sister part time as a gymnastic coach. With kids. He already violated policy by following their social medias and that’s only what’s openly known. 

I only told my sister this today, months after the fact. She was shocked I had kept this a secret and furious that he would do something so inappropriate. She would have got him kicked out of the gym of girls around my age and kept him from coaching ever again. Since, he quit both jobs and is newly enlisted in the military. 

I just can’t help feeling like I should have spoken up sooner. If he has done or will do something to other girls, I could’ve stopped that. But the thought never even crossed my mind that he would try this with someone else. I also feel like I should have never said anything because I don’t want to bring this crap up again and have to deal with it. Least of all have my family treat me like some sort of victim.

I decided to leave school (I did get my associates degree so I wasn’t a full dropout) after sophomore year in 2016 because of depression anxiety and stress and lost touch with her for a while. We caught up a couple times  but it was always with a group of our friends and I never got the chance to talk to her one to one. 

When we were finally able to catch up just the two of us a few months ago I was ready to tell her how I felt but before I could she mentioned she had just started dating someone. We’ve met up a few times since I found out and I still want to tell her how I feel but I don’t want to mess with our relationship or the one she has with her boyfriend. I love being around her and it’s making me miserable keeping my feelings to myself. 

Should I let her know how I feel? She’s one of my closest (and very few) friends and I’ve liked her since before I dropped out of school and I don’t want to lose her as a friend but I feel awful not telling her how I feel.",14Feb2020,1

Someone, for some unknown reason, has been cutting our shower curtains in half. This has happened on multiple occasions over the past two months. As soon as I buy new ones to replaces the mutilated ones, bam, cut in half in the middle of a party. Hilarious, right?

This person (or copycat people) have never been seen or caught, and no matter what I do it hasn't stopped. However, we have narrowed it down to determine that it is 100% a brother in the fraternity, not just a random guest.

The call was going good. He has been trying to get better. On the call, he asked me the major and I said computer science and he spent the next twenty minutes telling me how that it was a mistake and I should focus on med school. Granted, he wasn’t aggressive at all.

224,"Hello everyone! 

I recently got the opportunity to change jobs and it is very likely that it will go through. The job would be in a city about 1 hour away from where we currently live, and we would have to move there.
The job would start on April 1st, so there is not that much time to prepare. 

My daughter (5) has been living in our current town since shortly after she was born. She goes to Kindergarten here for 2 years now, next year she would be a ""senior"" in that Kindergarten. As far as I can tell she enjoys it very much. We also have a second daughter but she is just 1 year old so she will probably be fine.

Leaving aside the job being better than my current one, moving to that particular city would make many things easier, since the city we live in now is pretty rural, to the point of being really inconvenient at times. 
We would also be much closer to my mother-in-law, whom my daughter really loves, so that is definitely a plus.

I vaguely remember having to move house in my own childhood and having a hard time with it back then. 

We haven't told her yet, since it is technically not 100% sure that I will indeed get the job.
If she knows, she might end up talking to people who know others at my current job and I don't want them to know before it is finalized. (If the deal falls through I want to be able to retain my job without fear of being treated differently)

She is my first daughter and I would really like some advice on how to handle the situation best for her. Both me and my wife are sure that the move would have longterm benefits for all of us, outweighing any short term difficulties. 

I would love some advice on what I can do or say to help my daughter have a better time with this transition, I would also love to hear about experiences similar to this, as I am not quite sure what reaction I can expect from a 5 year old girl. 

I'm pretty sure everyone is gonna be a bit stressed out by it but my biggest concern is the wellbeing of my daughter, and input would be much appreciated. 

Thank you for your time.

Hi, I’m currently a college student who is just trying to explore life to its fullest. I’m only 19 years old. Recently I was just pulled over for speeding earlier in the day I was drinking beer and smoking weed before an officer had pulled me over later during the night. He then asked me how much I had to drink and I replied with two beers. I took a sobriety test where I passed all procedures. He then took a breathalyzer where I blew into it reading .04 Bac. He then asked me if I smoke any weed today where I replied with just a small amount ( half a gram). After I was put under arrest, they booked me into the county jail where I stayed 6-12 hours waiting for them to process me so I can leave.

228,"First, a little backstory: I met this person about 6 years ago through my at the time long-time friend of nearly 20 years. He lives in Australia, I live in the US. We have never met in person. At first, he seemed like a good person to talk to. He gave me lots of good advice and was there for me all the time- we Skyped almost every night. He did reveal to me eventually that he likes to dress up in women's lingerie and clothes; however, he is not ""out"" and doesn't like to publicize this aspect of his life.

Fast forward to the past several months. When I was at my worst after my breakup with my ex over 6 months ago, my relationship with my long-time best friend went to hell. She had been drinking every single day and night for a few years. We were drifting apart because of this - I don't agree with her lifestyle (I don't drink and she goes from couch to couch, guy to guy running and hiding from CPS because she not only drinks in front of them and has had several abusive relationships also in front of the kids, she is violent with them as well, because of her sickness and not taking her meds for bipolar disorder and schizophrenia). I tried to talk to her after my breakup and she basically told me to f**k off...that I didn't talk to her during my relationship with him, which was somewhat true, but because she kept messaging me in the middle of the night, drunk, when I was sleeping, and then attacking me if I didn't answer, leading me to mute her conversations. I finally broke it off with her for good and blocked her when she did it again, out of the blue, calling me worthless, a bitch, etc.

In comes my Australian friend. He talked to me like we did in the beginning, seeming very genuine. I was going through a miscarriage as well, which was really hard on me emotionally.  He brought up the idea of me being his ""mistress"" at that time, and, feeling very vulnerable I decided to humor him. Anything to have a friend, I guess, which sounds terrible. He would have me use his login info to access his Facebook and put girly pictures up, say that he had a mistress and I ""owned""him, even delete his friends. All these things he requested. I would acquiesce him - but then, the next day I would find that the pictures and posts I made were deleted, and he was re-adding his friends. After a couple of rounds of this, I no longer felt comfortable doing it. I am not a dominant person anyway and controlling someone is just not my thing. I did tell him so a few times, but he would then bring it up, and the cycle would continue. Nothing I have done or said has made him back off. He calls me about 5-10 times a day on Skype, and sends me 30-50 messages per day. I barely ever answer him anymore, yet he persists. He threatens to delete me all the time but never does it...and the more I ignore him, the more aggressive he gets. 

I'm not quite sure what to do here. Yes, he has been a friend of mine for a long time. But we have never met in person, and I no longer feel like this is a friendship. We don't talk about personal matters anymore-it's all about his fetish and what he wants me to do as his ""mistress.""",14Feb2020,1

237,"On mobile, so formatting blah blah. 

I'm getting divorced after 10 years of marriage. No kids, no shared cars or property, no shared debt. 

When we first started dating, I got a cat. And 3.5 years ago we added a dog.  This was about the time things started falling apart. He befriended a girl from work, I warned him it was sketchy. He didn't care. Eventually ""fell in love."" We did counseling but still talked to the side chick. Eventually he decides we were done with counseling. Says he stopped talking to the girl (he didn't, accidentally saw a text when I passed him his phone). I decided we needed to call it quits. We agreed to live together to save money. The next damn month, the new girlfriend moves in. Yes, that girlfriend. I was sleeping on a cheap bed I got from Amazon in the dining room while they took the bedroom. Yes, it was weird.

We originally agreed to split the ""custody"" of the cat and dog. I've luckily since moved out and in with my new boyfriend. He is allergic to cats. As are my parents, sister, and her children. I said he could keep the cat. 

That aside, my name is on the receipt of the adoption papers, the dog is on my lease (not his), I have receipts showing proof I paid for his last vet bill.  He lets the dog wait inside when he knows the dog has to go potty. He'll sleep in, take a 20 minute (surfing the internet) bathroom break for himself, play video games. All the whole time the dog whines to go out.  One time it was so bad, the dog peed on my ex's brand-new name brand mattress. Now the gf won't let him into their bedroom (where his crate is). One day I took him out at 5:30am, and didn't get back till 7pm. They didn't take him out at all during that time, the gf was there since about noon and fell asleep. I think it's animal cruelty. At least he cleans the cats litter box. At least she can go inside. 

I want him out of my life. I'm over it. I just want the dog. He doesn't want to give him up. He got everything, and now he wants to ""share"" by trading off every two weeks. He basically bullied me into signing an online separation agreement and now I don't know what to do. I'm meeting with a lawyer on Tuesday, but I don't have a ton of money to fight over my dog. He got everything else. I don't want his money, I just want my dog. And for him to be out of my life for good.  He's got the dog now and so graciously said I could have the dog two weeks to his one for now. 

How do I get the dog back? When I do, do I just keep him?

240," 

 She really trusted me, I had kept a trust streak with her pretty much as long as we've been friends. She (We'll call her L) and her best friend(F14) both have bad depression. Her friend (we'll call her C) was very suicidal; and by the sounds of it, was about to do it. But L convinced her not to. C said she wouldn't do it that night, but couldn't promise anything for after that. 

 L trusted me, and told me about it since it really hurt her deeply. I told her that she needed to tell someone who could help, such as a responsible adult. I didn't really know her friend well enough to know whom to contact. But she couldn't tell on her friend. 

 So I took it upon myself the next day to call a school staff where they go to school, and notified them about the suicide risk. I not only said that C was at risk, but that L was as well, since L told me she couldn't live with herself if C did it. I knew L had been suicidal before and that she had those thoughts. 

 L and C found out that I had told on them both. They let me know that I've really messed up their lives. They both come from homes where it would be a very bad situation if their moms' found out. I didn't realize just how unloving or untrustworthy their moms' are. It wouldn't make sense. L's mom found out and has really made matters much worse for L. C's mom hasn't found out yet, thankfully. 

 L has forgiven me and still loves me as a friend. But C hates me with a passion. 

 I see just how much I messed up L's life and I can't take it back or do it differently.  She is in so much more emotional pain. She actually tried to commit suicide a few days later. But she called me, and I stayed on the phone as long as I could and then I found a way to make sure she wasn't alone and then I had the police called. 

 Now it's been a few days and she's staying at a relative's place. She still talks to me every day, and still considers me as her best (guy) friend. She says I mean a lot to her even though I did what I did. It seems I'm the only one she feels is still there for her the way she sees it.

 I am constantly reminded of how I ruined their lives so much more, just by seeing L suffer for it. My intentions were good, but I regret the way I did it. And it haunts me a lot. All I want is for her to be happy and overcome this dark moment of her life.

On Feb 7th, he emailed me again to which I explained I forgot to email him back and that we could email for the project. I told him that I could ask my friend (who had Facebook and added him) for what was going on in the chat. The group member read my email but didn’t reply. He and the other members did not message me so I decided to ask my friend on Feb 10th if he heard anything from them. I asked my friend said that he had added the guy on Facebook and sent him two messages ( between the 6th &amp; 10th) and had not gotten a response or an invite into a chat. On Feb 11th I emailed the guy to ask what was going on with the project and what part I could do. He read the email but did not reply. I asked my friend again if he had received any messages to which he said he did not and had once again tried to reach him on Facebook (this was the 11th or 12th. On the 12th the guy emailed me saying that the project was done and that I had to contact the teacher. I texted my friend the news and he was confused and upset like me.

My friend and I both have screenshots of all our communication but we just don’t get why they would do this. It’s not like we hadn’t contacted them at all or the project was due in a few days. 

My question is, what do I tell my teacher when I meet her? I assume the other members claimed we weren’t reaching out to them but that is not the case. We had communicated with them multiple times so it’s not like the group could argue that we weren’t pulling our weight.

247,"So this is alot. My parents were divorced when I was 9 years old. I have a sister who is 19 in college away. I on the other hand am in high school. I am finishing my last semester right now. I have my dad's house and my mom's house. My dad is (51) and my step mom is (46)  I also have a step sister over there who is (16). I tend to get along with my dad more but I will get into that later. 

At my mom's house I have her (44) and my step dad (53) and a step sister who is not here that much who is (14). 

So here is what went down. I have never tried drinking because I don't agree with it but I tried smoking. I tried it one time in the summer and now I got some more and used it 3 other times recently and then my mom suspected it and my dad searched my vehicle. He found it all and was very disappointed.  He pushed me around a little and then told me to get in my car and go to work. I was thinking about it the whole time and was very upset. I went back home to my moms and there was a letter that stated that I needed to start going to a counselor and that my gf (18f) would no longer be aloud to go downstairs where my room is ever again. I also have to do regular drug tests and if I don't pass my mom said she will tell my girlfriends parents. The part that bothered me was the thought that they think I couldn't stop. My mom also is a counselor. Her husband is a psychologist who is from Pakistan. My mom took the approach of investigation and interrogation. She took out a pen and paper and started asking me questions about it and kept pushing. My step dad took verbal punches at me saying if I would have given my dad a heart attack it would have been all my fault if he had died. 

I also have to input that I'm not normally a bad kid nor was I on a bad path. I have a job, I am on varsity soccer and have been since I was a freshman, I have made huge progress in my job and am working my way up the rankings.  My grades have been A's and B's. I'm a part time student who only needs half a credit more. I also pay for my own car. I fix my own car. I have built computers and so on. I'm a very active kid not some lazy dead beat. 

Anyway for my dad's approach to all of it. He was very upset but my step mom I'm guessing calmed him down because she had smoked weed before and also done shrooms before and she turned out to be making six figures. They sat me down and was asking why I did it and so on and I was explaining to them that I did it because I was curious and it was relaxing. I didn't do it with anyone. I just did it by myself because it was fun. They thought I was trying to self medicate or something else. My dad said he will be tracking my phone from now on and I have to ask him before I can go anywhere. I haven't gone anywhere really. It's been 2 weeks and I've went to my gf's house 1 time. My dad was saying that people who smoke are lazy and all that. I was compliant and listened to what he had to say. He said we will be spending alot of time together and he constantly checks up on me. 

I've spent most of my time at my dad's house recently and it's because my mom has a weird view of success where it's valued by money and not by happiness. She says I'm on a terrible path and so on. There is nothing to do at my mom's house. We never have gotten along that well so there's nothing for us to talk about. I have been to my mom's 3 times in the past 2 weeks and all I've done is sit in my room and my brain just wonders. I can't go anywhere and it doesn't help that my room has no windows. 

At my dads my gf is still aloud over because he understands that she is a good influence on me. We have also been dating for a year and 4 months. He has let me go over there one time to her house. Life at my dad's has been better than at my mom's. My dad seems so actually be trying to get me on a good path and is wanting me to figure out what to do in life.
There's so much more but this is getting really long. Here is an example of how they are different as of right now. I was explaining to my dad how I'm going to set up a Roth IRA and a credit card soon to get a good head start and my dad was like that's good and was nice about it. I told my mom that and she rolled her eyes and was saying well then I'm going to have to pay off your debt. 

To shorted this up my mom gave me an option to almost move all my stuff at her house to my dad's and just live at my dads and stop in at my mom's here and there. I'm not quiet sure what to do because all I want to do is move out and then it is fair to both parents but I'm going to the community college to save money.",14Feb2020,1

249,"I’m in the middle of a bathroom remodel at the moment with an insured reputable local construction company. Today was the day where the contractor added a layer of cement to the floor. 
He left the door open to help the floor dry but forgot that I have a skittish cat wandering about the house.
Fast forward a few hours and my wife comes home to cement paw prints all over our house. My cat had spent the last couple of hours trying to get cement out of his paws and fur. Unfortunately for our cat, the cement is toxic and we had to take him to our local emergency vet. 
The bill going to be somewhere around $1900 (USD). What’s the best way of approaching the topic of reimbursement to the building company? Will this be a simple case of their insurance paying out or should I expect resistance?

250,"I’ve just broken my right leg and had just removed my leg cast, and now everytime I try to bend my knees to 90 degrees it hurts like hell. I’ve had a physical therapist come to my house for some exercises, apparently because I kept my leg straight for over 6 weeks, it would be hard for me to bend my knees. Everytime during a physical therapy session, just when I can almost bend my knees to 90 degrees, it hurts. 
I’ve searched all over the internet, Google, Youtube for methods and I have not seen anybody that has had the same problem that I had.
Is this weird?

I haven't seen her in a while cuz she's been home sick and so to get her out the house (and because it's been over a week since I've seen her) I asked her over Snapchat if she wanted to go to a movie Saturday night. She just responded saying ""a movie?"". I texted saying ""yea a horror movie"" but she took an hour to open it and just said ""sure if she's feeling it"".

252,"I am pretty close with this person, but he’s racist and he’s been acting weirder. think he might even be a schizo. He thinks everything is a conspiracy. He thinks the coronavirus is a conspiracy, he thinks the government and every major cooperation is working together and there’s an ancient cult of Jews who have been ruining the world and controlling everything for 1,000’s of year. He even thinks they might’ve been the aliens who came to earth 6,000 years ago and built the pyramids, and basically they’ve been enslaving humanity. I thought he was joking at first but then I realized he wasn’t.

I know he’s somewhat of a schizo lunatic but it hasn’t really bothered me. Most of our conversations are game related or us talking about our day and stuff that’s been going on. But now it’s starting to seem like everyday I know him less. He’s been telling me a lot of crazy things. He said he was prepping and doing all of this stuff and I thought he was lying at first. He said he bought 1,000’s of rounds of ammo and a gas mask and is digging a shelter (completely insane) but then he sent me a picture of the mask and like 20 containers of what looked like ammo. Some of the stuff he tells me is just utterly insane and I think there’s no way it happened, but I can never tell if he’s lying or crazy.

I only know him from online, we’ve been friends a little over a year. I don’t want to turn my back on him. Besides recently we’ve always been able to joke and laugh with each other and we have good chemistry. He’s honestly nicer and more friendly than most people despite his bigoted views. But I don’t know if I can be friends with a person like him. I’d still miss him if I never saw him again. I just didn’t know he was insane for real. It’s one thing to talk about crazy conspiracies, but it’s another to spend most of your savings on prepping. Do you think it would be bad if I continued to be his friend?",14Feb2020,1

I keep thinking it must've been some decaying animal or something. 

But that's not it. Since I had my daughter I often think I am dying. I have thought i was having a heart attack twice, lyme disease once, rabies twice, the brain eating amoeba three times. 

I dont go to the hospital over it. I just try to ignore it until i forget.

When they learned that I'm in a happy relationship, they asked for a threesome and it's making my partner and I uncomfortable (especially because they've been sending my partner nudes even though they've never met).

There's now a group chat with all three of us where they asked my partner and I to be their valentines.

259,"Sorry this is cross post from r/work, I didn't get any feed back. Trying here, thanks in advance.

Maybe is me, maybe is her, either way I need some advice on how to deal with my coworker. I am not going to go through specifics, worried she might recognise me. I work in a small team of 4 with one manager. I am the senior member of the team, more or less. We generate reports for other people who then uses them to push out client reports with strict turn-around times. We each are responsible for different reports.

The issue I have is she always says she is going to do stuff, but she doesn't do them, even if we give her the option to say no. But then the people who are waiting for the reports ask me where the data is. She will say ""I am doing it right now"". Much later, I will get another email enquiring when the data will be available.. It is so frustrating. I can't talk to my manager about it right now because he is away.

I don't understand why people can't just be straight. Why not just say ""sorry I can't do this right now, could you please do this for me"". How do I make her be honest? How do I make her ask for help? Am I being condescending or passive aggressive without meaning to? For example, I said ""I heard from managerperson that you are working from home, let me know if you can do this. If not, we are happy to run the report"". Is that email bad? We really don't care who does the work right now. It just has to be done.

I have some history with her, which might be the reason why she is reluctant to be open with me. Also the reason why I am so sensitive to this behaviour so probably over reacting a bit. Once I waited a year for something she said is ready. But I am not the only person who has problems with her, other people have mentioned that she promises but doesn't deliver. What is the best way to deal with this behaviour?",14Feb2020,1

I am not ugly, I am not stupid, I am not possesive, but I do have OCD that makes every single interaction with anything hard. Sometimes I just want to end it all so I wouldn't have to put everyone I know through this torture, either that or run away. But running away seems like a bad idea since my meds are around 400-500$ monthly. That's a lot.

Currently I'm 16 and live in an absolute shit hole of a town. I get it, the northeast has good education Andi respect my parents for wanted my sister and I do get a good education. There are so many things I want to pursue in life. As of right now I am an low A student with minimal effort in class. I have a lot of things I want to do with my life, invest in the stock market, be a landlord, be a real estate agent, and be an entrepreneur along with a couple of my friends. As for the first one I already do, and for the middle 2 I know I need to wait a couple years to let a real estate license. But for the last one especially, the person that mentors my team always says that we are mature for our age and that we can go far in life if we continue on this path. And I firmly believe that because we are truly doing something that is needed in this world but I cannot share what it is right now. But the time between now and the time I got to college and move out is a complete cluster-fuck. I want to do a double major in business marketing and psychology and I already have the foundation for both of those but I'm way too young to go anywhere to pursue that right now. There are so many other things I very much enjoy such as photography and technology, but since I 16 and live in New Jersey I can't drive by myself for another year. To add onto that my parents are extremely hard working individuals who world 6 ish days a week so it's hard for me to go places without relying on friends to take me, and sometumes they can't even take me. So I'm in the perpetual state of boredom until I have the freedom to go where I want when I want, which is about 2 years from now. I want to move to southern California because the weather can really get to me when it comes to my mood from day to day, so I think that for my own mental health that it would be best for me to live in a place that is sunny most days of the year and warm pretty much all year. As I have struggled with anxiety in the past I know what I need to calm myself down. Which is to take a walk outside while it's sunny and warm, it works every single time. There are so many people I have talked to about this and every single one says that I need to find something to do in my town. But it's hard to do so when it's all suburbs, and the most entertaining thing is to go get taquitos from one of the 3 7-elevens in the town. I have tried sever sports and it all comes down to it being way way way too repetitive for me to enjoy for a while, I need change in my life every once and awhile, I love urban areas and places with lots of people.


So to summarize it all up. I'm in this perpetual state of boredom, anxiety, and not being happy, until I graduate highschool and move to southern California. What can I do right now and for the next four years?",14Feb2020,1

284,"The jobs got reset at my work (long story) (hospital kitchen, unionized). Tomorrow, everyone is re-picking  new positions based off of seniority. I have a lot of different factors that I am stressed out about:

I am 28 year old male and I live together with my boyfriend. Currently I am part-time at my job and I work 4.5 hr shifts, 4 days a week. The new schedule added another day per week to my job, so it would be five days per week.

I like what I do in my job right now, but it just seems silly to work that many days per week on a 4.5 hr shift. Is it just me or does it seem like most of the work involved with covering a shift is just the fact that you don’t have “the whole day off” to be free and do whatever? I am less than ten minutes drive away from work. but even with a 4.5 hrs shift it seems like it takes up my whole day in a way just as bad as an 8 hr shift would do. 

Another thing is health insurance. I am under Medicaid. If I would have earned another $200 in the year, I would have been ineligible for making too much. So I guess I am kind of forced into full-time, because the part-time insurance is wayyy not worth it at my job. I take an expensive medication so I need insurance but I am also very worried the new insurance won’t cover the prescription. 

One thing is I am in fact building retirement at this job so it would be good to get more hours put in for that while I am still younger.

I do not want to come out of left field and just steal someone else’s job (a friend possibly) because I am higher seniority. I guess I would feel worse if I didn’t go for one for a friend and then have someone else take it though.",14Feb2020,1

It's got to the point where I always make sure I have an over coat on to protect my clothes from the bus seats, always sit on the edge of the seat, never touch any of the poles or buttons, or put my bag on the floor. I've even started tying my hair up the minute I get on the bus so my hair doesn't touch a seat or pole. It doesn't even stop once I get off the bus either.

I feel absolutely disgusting once I get home, and I immediately have to change out of my clothes and put them in the wash. I wash my hands with dish soap and wipe my face with a makeup wipe. Despite my hair being up and out of the way the entire ride, and have the urge to wash it so that it doesn't touch my bed pillows and get germs on my face. That last one has caused actual financial issues, because now my families water bill is through the roof (and on a personal note, showering every time you get home seriously dries out your skin and strips the nutrients out of your hair). I don't know what to do, because I feel like I'm acting pretentious, but I physically feel nauseous whenever anyone brushes against me or the bus jolts too hard and I touch the back rest of the seat.",14Feb2020,1

He didn’t believe me for a bit then finally snapped at me. He said “OK you like spending time with me, now can I leave?” And then followed up with “I’m to scared to kill myself anyways so don’t worry about me” he hasn’t responded in the groupchat. I’m really scared and sad. How do I react? I also suffer from depression but I don’t know how to approach this Without hurting him. I’m crying rn and I’m very scared for his life.

291,"Before we get started, this is a throw away account. I do plan on going through with whatever good advice I can glean, but I just need a good place to start. Please mind your step here, since it's potentially triggering for violence, domestic/child abuse, and other such things.

For about as long as I can remember, my mother \[49\] has been abusive in some way, shape, or form. At first, it was purely physical. My father \[Now 56\] and I would be beaten about every day, although my dad would bare the brunt of it to protect me. She would throw plates, phones, even whole shelving units. I was a kid and thought this was normal. Thankfully, she doesn't technically hit us anymore, but she still... Well...

All of the abuse she does is verbal/emotional now. She will yell at my dad and I (I tend to be her favored target with my dad at a close second). She tells us that we're worthless, unlovable, disgusting, filthy... She refused to allow me to go to college, only to yell at me for the next few months about not going. She threatens to leave if anything goes wrong. She tells me to kill myself, and that the world would be better off without me in it. She tells me I should leave, or tells me not to leave because if I do, she'll find me. She'll ""call the police"" on me for having episodes (she doesn't actually do it. She just picks up the phone and pretends. BTW, I have depression and anxiety.) or she'll tell me to do it, or she'll flat out ignore me/become hostile towards me.

I didn't really realize the extent of the damage caused until two or so years ago, when I realized that what was going on wasn't normal. Again, there's no more physical abuse (not as often, anyways), and there has never been any sexual abuse ever, but it's still scary. For some background, my mother is a lawyer getting ready to retake the Bar exam, my father is in software \[we currently live in Silicon Valley\], and my brother is a minor going into high school this year. I'm currently twenty and ready to move out so that rules out CPS for myself, but I cannot in good faith let my family stay at her mercy. I've had nightmares about something horrid happening to them and not being able to do anything. I can't... I can't let this keep going. I'm worried for my family's safety, and I need to be able to do literally anything.

Please, anything would help. I've started trying to compile evidence, but she's threatened to sue me if I record anything. I've also been barred from leaving overnight. This has been going on for far too long. Please, help me.",14Feb2020,1

It starts off differently every time: it'll be a normal day, and I'll be doing normal things- tonight's started off with me ordering pizza. It'll all be normal, until something goes wrong, the thing going wrong in tonight's being that I couldn't find money when the delivery driver arrived. After something goes wrong, that when things switch really quick, and the man appears. In every single dream, it's the same man: white, old, bald. I don't actually know him in real life. In every one of the dreams, I do something to piss him off, and then it goes to the same ending. After I piss him off, he goes insane, and leaves. But I have to lock all the doors, and close the windows, and sit in my room because I know he's coming back for revenge. Sometimes, I'll just hear the front door of my house open, and I wake up. But other times, he gets to me, but he never actually does anything. He just watches me, and I have a heart attack. 

I've always had issues with sleeping and nightmares, but it's so much worse than before. I'm always being reminded of the dream while I'm awake, and it ruins my day even while I'm awake. I can't sleep for an entire night, and when I go back to sleep, the nightmare will repeat or I'll have an entirely different one. I'm so tired, I've been tired for nearly two years.

305,"Long story short, I’ve been dating my friends brother for 6 years. I consider my friend the sister I’ve always wanted, which makes me protective, but never unreasonably. 
A year ago, my friend, who I’ll refer to as C, met this girl S and they began dating. I was super pumped bc in the past, C has dated plenty of guys and one other girl in the past and never seemed as happy or into it as she noticeably was with S. Things were cool for a minute until we (myself and her/my boyfriends family) began noticing S’s verbal and physical abusive behaviors. S leaves bruise marks on Cs arms as if she’s held her down or squeezed her up against a wall, she’s slapped C before, locked her out of the house, told her over the phone “fuck you, go die”, she’s controlling, manipulative, treats C like a child, she doesn’t like any of Cs family or friends including myself and anyone C has basically ever had contact with and Always..ALWAYS causes a scene during family events on C’s side of the family (fighting, being rude, stealing Cs car to make a scene, etc) the list really does go on and on.- and I’d also like to add, S is just flat out a fucking bitch. 

Cs whole family doesn’t like S but they have never said anything about S bc they want to be able to see C and know that they may not get to if there is anything said about the situation. 

Through and through, in my eyes, S is not a good person. I’m not saying C is directly perfect, but she is NOT any of those things I have listed above. She is normally a relaxed, fun person who has changed for the worst since S came around.

I could say a lot more, but I don’t want this lost to be super long so I’ll cut to the chase:

C is proposing to S next month. C knows everyone is basically against it (she says: “I know everyone has their own opinions”) but hopes we will all attend the wedding. So far, no one has been audibly excited for her and have given her the “if you’re happy, I’m happy” schpeal, but C finally told me about the proposal tonight and I could not..COULD NOT, round off my feelings about the situation with a “if you’re happy I’m happy blah blah blah”. And I asked if I could see her. We are meeting up tomorrow to talk on her lunch break and I honestly just want to cry. I know ultimately, I’ll be there and wherever else she wants me to be but it feels like It would be as if I helped push her off of a cliff. When we talk tomorrow, I do not intend on talking her out of it. I just want to address my concerns. But C has developed such a victim mentality that I feel like she’ll just say that we aren’t seeing the whole picture. I don’t know. I just need any advice I can get.

313,"Hey r/Advice, let's get down to business. 

I'm 23 and recently graduated last December (2019) with a B.A. in Art and a minor in English. 

Prior to graduation, I was extremely excited. Graduating, to me, meant more than an accomplishment. It mean freedom, financial independence, and the ability to finally make my own decisions and be my own person (ie, move out of my family's house).

My life at home isn't terrible, per-say. But, things aren't great either.

Long story short, I'm having to hide a very pivotal part of myself (ie, i'm trans). They found out about it several years ago, threatened to take me to conversion therapy, so I quickly went back into the closet and told them it wasn't ""real"".

So to me, graduation meant so much more than just ""no more homework"". It meant freedom.

However. Things've changed.

Today marks three months out from graduating and I'm completely unemployed and have nowhere to go.

I have experience in marketing, design, copywriting, and advertising. So I do have professional experience. However I quickly ""yeeted"" (for lack of a better phrase) out of that career path because it felt incredibly soul-sucking and was a detriment to my mental health.

I've gone to career fairs, brought resumes, and looked presentable, but most every company has looked me dead in the face and has said, ""we don't have any positions available that are suitable to your education and experience,"". 

I've considered teaching, and I've worked as an assistant to close teacher of mine, however I quickly, too, realized that wasn't the career path for me.

In a nutshell, after spending the past three months trying to figure out what in the hell to do with my life, I decided to raise my white flag and go visit a career advisor at my university.

I told her everything. My problems, my issues, my concerns. I told her where I want to be and where I want to end up.  

We took career aptitude tests. Every exam I took pointed to the same career path. Counseling, Social Work, Therapy, Psychology, etc. In response to that, we discussed about my possibly getting a Masters in Social Work and becoming a LCSW.

We talked about my likes, my dislikes, my desire for financial stability and interest in more tech based jobs and so forth. In so, we discussed about how it may be a good idea to considering getting a second bachelors in C.S. 

Both options sound great. It's just a matter of determining what is more important to me.

And, although I left that appointment feeling really great and confident that I finally have two clear options to pursue, I'm really struggling.

Why?

Because this means I have to deal with a major con, which is, I have to put off my independence, financial freedom, etc. for another two and a half years.

I cannot begin to express to you how soul-crushing that is for me.

Yet truthfully, I can't think of any other options I have.

Although I do believe going back to school would be a great thing for me (ie, getting me out of the house, being social, feeling like i have a purpose, etc) -- at the end of the day, no matter what, I have to come back home.

And when I come back home, I'm constantly reminded of how much longer I still have to go and god, it just makes me feel incredibly defeated.

I don't have the financial ability or option to live on campus, so that isn't a possibility unfortunately.

So r/Advice, I really need your help.

Are there possibly any other positions I'm not considering that I could get a well-paying job with knowing my degree that don't have to do with marketing, copywriting, or design?

Or do I truly have to bite the bullet and stick it out for another two and a half years?",14Feb2020,1

325,"Hi! Throwaway because I don't want anyone I know in real life to know.

TLDR AT THE END &lt;3 I just need advice :)

I'm currently in grade 11, so marks are extremely important to post-secondary schools. My school does semesters, meaning you have the same 4 classes in one semester and a different 4 in the other. I start school in September, and semester 1 ends at the end of January for me.

Starting in August, I started an addiction to chatting online with different people instead of doing something else. It was steady at first, but after a week, I found out I was really addicted to chatting on discord gaming servers, and meeting new people. I've always been very shy outside in the world and I've told myself that this could be a way for me to improve myself. This addiction was considered terrible, I would spend countless hours chatting on a server, and if that started to die down, I would move onto another.  

I'm not sure if I should mention this but I started finding ways to cope with my personal problems which led to my addiction. My father has stage 3 lung cancer and September 2018, he told me that his family doctor said it's going to be terminal. I kind of already knew this in the back of my head but I never really wanted to acknowledge it. I searched online and some sites said patients usually last a year or a year and 3 months. When August 2019 came around, I started to panic a lot because my dad told me his health stats were going terribly and I really thought the inevitable was going to happen that quickly. It stayed in my mind for the whole of August and since it was the summertime, I didn't have much to do other than to rethink about that over and over again, which made me want to just do something that was fun to me and also require me to think so my thoughts about that wouldn't be the main thing on my mind. 

As I started school, I still went on the same discord servers to chat. I had pretty hard classes this semester, including 2 sciences, a math course, and an elective for computer science. I wouldn't focus on my homework, and during computer science classes, I would spend a lot of time checking over discord instead of listening to the teacher, because my addiction took over me. My average for this semester turned out to be 80%. For the past 3 years of high school from grades 8 and 10, my averages were always around 93%, which is a huge difference. After staring at my marks, I've decided to improve myself a lot more since we had a break between the semester changes. I know my abilities and I know for sure I can do so much better than 80%, even if it was in a hard course such as physics, because I never studied, hardly did any homework, and did the bare minimum for assignments. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; Extreme Addiction because I needed to cope with my dad's health to cancer, terrible marks that resulted from this. 

What would I be able to do to ensure that I will get into a good university, such as SFU, BCIT even with my 80% average in the first semester?

337,"To make this fair we are going to write this from a genderless POV and refer to each person as Partner A (A for short) and Partner B (B for short). 

We came here so we can get some second opinions of what should happen next because we are in a difficult position and have very different views. For some background, A and B live together in an apartment on a shared lease and are engaged and only have one car which they share but B owns. They are approximately the same height, with A being about 50 pounds bigger than B.

So here goes,
A and B were having an argument (details are irrelevant to this story) and B leaves the apartment to get away and clear their head. This takes approximately 10 minutes and B comes back and is ready to work through this argument in a healthy way. While B was gone, A was freaking out because they felt trapped because B had taken the car and they were both supposed to go to a family event that they were now late for. When B gets back, A is refusing to talk to B and B is upset by this and threatens to walk out again and for this time to walk away from the relationship for good. B tells A they need to sort this out and B does not want to put up with this in the relationship. B tells A 3 separate times ""If you let me walk out this door again I am gone for good"" and A refuses to speak or acknowledge what B is saying. B goes to move towards the door and A jumps up and blocks the door, saying ""Please dont go I'm ready to talk."" B responds with ""I gave you 3 different chances and you're too late, let me out please."" A refuses to move for B and B then threatens to call the cops because A is trapping them in the apartment. B tries to step back and call the cops and A moves forward and grabs B's arm, disabling B's ability to use their phone. They have a lengthy conversation about how B has the right to leave the apartment and A is trapping them in. The only way out of the apartment is through the front door or out onto a second story balcony. Everytime A let's go and B steps back to call the cops, A grabs them again. Everytime B tries to push towards the door, A blocks the door. B then runs to the bathroom and tries to close the door to call the cops and A follows and blocks B from being able to close the door. Now A and B are both in the bathroom with A holding the door open. A continues to move towards B and tries to grab their phone. At this point, B punches A in the face and A stumbles backwards allowing B out of the bathroom. B then heads towards the front door again and A beats them there and blocks it again. B then backs up again to pull out their phone and A grabs their arm. At this point, B elbows A in the face and A falls down bleeding from the nose. B then started grabbing paper towels to clean up and spends the next 10 minutes checking on A and starting to clean up. A eventually leaves to the bathroom to clean themselves up and B finishes cleaning the floor. The cops never ended up being called. 

As a result of being elbowed in the face, A ended up with a broken nose. The problem now is A needs surgery to fix said broken nose and A believes B should pay for the surgery because B was the one who elbowed A in the face and cause the broken nose. However, B believes that A is mostly at fault for this situation and believes they should each pay for some of the surgery, with A paying for the majority of it. 

Both A and B believe they are right in their viewpoint of who should pay. We would just really like some second opinions because we dont want to go through anything legal because neither of us want to impact the other person's life in a way so negative and severe.",14Feb2020,1

353," 

Hello,

I work at a bank and had a client who was an officer.

How do I know this individual was an officer?

Because the officer was in uniform.

I greeted and asked how the client was and how I may help today after successfully authenticating the client with their bank card and PIN with our device.

The client had a photo of a partner's credit card (different institution) and a memo of an amount.

""I want to pay my partner's US dollar credit card bill with my partner's US dollar chequing account.""

I replied ""certainly! Is the account joint under your name or do you have power of attorney on the account?""

client replied ""No. Listen, as you can see there are several accounts joint with my partner. My partner had a surgery and is unable to do this on their own. Therefore, why I am standing in front of you.""

I replied again, ""I understand. As much as I would love to assist you with that specific account if it is not joint nor without a power of attorney we won't be able to access the account for transactions. Other solutions would be to use your Canadian dollar account that is joint with your partner to pay this off or your partner can even call telephone banking for this transaction which they can definitely use the US account once they verify them over our secured telephone banking.""

Client leans closer and replies again, ""So you are telling me you can't help me, you are not willing to help me?""

I reply ""No. It is not that I am not willing to help you. I cannot help you by policy. I hope you appreciate our policy set up to protect not only the bank but our clients privacy and assets. I am not trying to give you a hard time and I would love to find a solution but again we will not be able to access that specific US account.""

client ""So you're telling me if I saw you driving at 55km/h at a 50km/h zone I should be ticketing you by \*policy\*. But would I do that? There are certain circumstances that you as a bank should be able to give exceptions.""

I say ""I am more than happy to grab a manager to further explain. My wording I worry may not be clear. May I please grab a manager for you?""

Client ""No. The manager will say the same as you what you said right? What is your name and your bank manager's name.""

after I tell my name and the bank manager's name he says he will be in touch very soon.

The interaction I had was very...intense. I felt intimidated with the uniform to begin with.

I'll be honest the client was calm. But the way he looked at me felt like I was doing something against the law by not abiding to what he was asking me to do for him as a client.

I am conflicted. A few of my colleagues suggested I should report this case.

But I feel like I may be just naive and I should be sucking it up.

I work at a customer service industry so it is something to be expected right?

And my closes friend said that even if I reported it, it would be a disadvantage to me because

1. nothing will happen.
2. this officer might hold grudge and down the road who knows what will happen.
3. it is my words against the police.
4. I don't matter. The bank will not want to lose a client and the police will obviously take the officer's side.
5. Let's be honest I am being naive.

I just wanted to 2nd opinion from people in the police force.

It will be insightful not only for my personal growth but for my career as well.",14Feb2020,1

I focus on school and have one friend who I can only talk to online because my father was in the military so I’ve been all over the country and to 7 different schools. I keep to myself somewhat but enjoy speaking and am outgoing to a degree. Recently I got assigned to sit next to a girl in class (18f) and she seems to have a good personality and looks good enough (beggars can’t be choosers). Just a couple days ago she sent a friend at me with a note saying I should text her sometime so I did (remember this is HS even though that tactic is usually abandoned after middle school). I barely know her and I can’t hold a conversation but I know she’s into me because I’m not dense and she drops hints. I don’t know if I want to get into this though.

366,"So I'm still a virgin at 24. It's also not cause I'm ugly or that I have extremely low self confidence though, it's a combination of 1) I've always wanted my first to be with someone I really cared about and 2) I'm RARELY ever attracted to women (I'm not gay). I know when girls are hot or not but tbh, unless I get to know them, I can't really say I'm interested or anything. I don't just walk up to random women just cause they're pretty. I've only been in one relationship and that was when I was 16 and nothing really physical ever happened. 

I'm also not an unattractive guy. I'm no Adonis but my friends tell me some girls do check me out from time to time. I guess I'm a 6 or 7 maybe? IDK and I really don't care that much. Same friends who give me stick about being a virgin though but I dont really mind the jokes.

I don’t know what to do now I’m young and not used to this process, and google didn’t help much.

370,"I live in a small home on my father’s property where I don’t have to pay rent (I kick my dad a couple hundred bucks every month anyway). I work for a large international company and I was recently promoted to a supervisory position. But, I don’t like my home or the city I live in, and I really don’t like my job or the upper management. 

My brother lives in a large city about five hours away and he’s has offered me a room and to help me get on my feet if I move there (he’s my best friend and closest confidant). I currently have $500 in savings and a full paycheck due in a week. 

I’m nervous about this for a lot of reasons. It took me almost three years to rebuild my life the last time I made a major move, granted some of that was because I was battling addiction, alcoholism, and mental illness. I’m forty and feel so far behind already and I’m scared of starting all over again. I don’t want to be a burden on my brother and his family in any way.  I’m on a fast track trajectory at my job despite my misgivings about it. 

On the positive side I’ve discussed all this at length with my brother and he says to just rip the band-aid off and get my ass up there. He’s willing to help me financially if need be and has assured me his family wants me there. I’ve put in some applications in the target city already and have some decent prospects. I have two ties to the city already-my brother and my addiction specialist that I see monthly. 

To boil it all down....I have a decent paying job with an opportunity to continue to grow there, but I hate the head boss and I’m not a fan of the work in general. I have a quaint little home of my own that I don’t have to pay for, but it’s very basic, in need of repairs, and I don’t feel welcome by my stepmother or her children. I have a small savings with more money coming in plus a modest tax return, but at most all of it put together is a month and a half of my earnings. I want to go, I want to be there, but I’m scared of being a burden on my brother and of failing there and having to come clawing back with my tail between my legs. 

So, do I rip off the band-aid and resign my job, pack my things, and go all in? Or, do I play it safe, continue to save, and make the best of my life where I’m at? I feel it’s implied, but I will say it outright that it’s just me, no pets, no kids, and no significant other.

I should start off with the fact that I'm 17, so maybe im wrong and this is all just me being overdramatic. Anyway, my father and I used to have a fairly normal relationship I think. He still slapped me upside the head and yelled a lot but not enough that I would use the word 'abusive'.

About when I hit 4th grade he became highly verbally/emotionally abusive with physical there but less so. Once I hit 7th grade, he and my mother were fighting a lot and he had this whole conspiracy in his head that we were 'a couple of backstabbing bitches plotting against him'.

He planted listening devices around our house and caught me and my mom having a convo where I was crying and telling my mom about how he had been hitting/punching/etc me everyday, and I said I hated him. He heard this and got very mad and I won't get into details but the next day I called the police and had to scare him off with a knife. 

My mother later ended up having him move out and they started the process of divorce. He would often stalk us in his car, and trying to confront us so we had to get a hotel room for a bit. At one point I was at a coffee shop and I looked outside he was parked there watching me for two hours.

I ended up having to stay at his house for a few nights later on and he was no better, at one point he broke my pc when he was mad and I ran away with my shit to the nearest gas station and called my mom to pick me up because he was drunk and throwing shit around.

So it's been a couple years, I don't really talk to him unless he wants me to dogsit while he's gone. He wants a relationship now and messages me like once a week saying things like 'please talk to me im your father' . My mother and her fiance say I need to have a relationship with him and so does my therapist. My extended family doesn't say anything specific, just stuff like 'so when are you seeing your dad next? oh you're still not talking to him? you'll get over that soon don't worry'

He's apparently depressed about how I don't talk to him. I don't want him to be sad but whenever I give him another chance he always disappoints me. Problem is he's been prone to self harm(drug/alcohol abuse) in the past and I don't want him to do anything crazy.

He says hes different now. He has his own apartment, he has a new gf, a dog. He says he's calmer now but i have yet to see it

This might be the teen angst talking, but do I have to have a relationship with him? 


TLDR; my father was verbally/physically abusive, do I have to have a relationship with him now?",14Feb2020,1

376,"Me- 20 yo Male

Her- 18 yo Female

I will preface this post with some background information. I'm a 20-year-old guy in college, and I'm also a virgin. I have only been in one relationship back in 8th grade (if you can call it that), which was mostly making out because you know raging teen hormones and all that. Nothing else ever happened, and that was the majority of what the relationship was. It ended badly because of immaturity on both our parts. I have since been a firm believer that dating should happen after high school and preferably when you are ready to try and find lasting love, and that anything before college is just asking for heartbreak and or problems.

**CURRENT SITUATION:**

I moved into college back in August as a 20-year-old freshman (yeah, it took a while for me to get to college because I wasn't quite ready yet). Since then, I have found that the majority of the people on the floor of my dorm are great people that are nice and fun. Almost all of us are friends, and we all party, drink, and or smoke together on weekends and are all very supportive of one another. Honestly, I love my floor and the people on it, we have a strong sense of community together, almost familial. There is one girl that, in the beginning, I didn't think of in any romantic or sexual way. We are friends (not anything super close but still friends), and that's how I thought of her until two weekends ago. My group of guy friends and I were hanging out and smoking, and she and a few girls came in the room who were killing time until their ride showed up so they could go to a frat party. I was pretty high and sort of out of it but lucid enough to know what I was doing. She sat down next to me, and she held my hand, and I held it back, we started rubbing each other's hands with our thumbs, and she laid her head on my shoulder. The ride showed up, and she left to go to the frat party, when she got back, my friends and I were sitting on the floor in the hall talking, and she ran to me and sat down and hugged my arm. The next day a bunch of us were drinking in my room and playing Mario party, and she came in and sat on my bed with me and grabbed my hand again and was generally cuddly. These experiences set everything in motion, I started to feel my heart sink a little when I thought of her, and I wanted to explore it further. The next weekend came, and she had a club retreat thing to go to, and we didn't see each other. It's also weird that nothing like that experience happens when we aren't in a partying setting. Last weekend was the same as usual; we were partying. I had gotten the perfect amount of drunk earlier in the night and was sobering up. It's 1 a.m., and my friends are sobering up also, so we do the only logical thing, we smoke. I came into the room, and she was already there sitting on my friend's bed as everyone was hanging out and smoking, talking, listening to music, and I sit down next to her, hoping that something would happen again. I grab her hand, and she grabs back, and we rub our thumbs along each other's hand again. We were both sitting up but laid back, and she scooted closer to me. She laid her head on my shoulder, and I laid my head on hers. Eventually, she started to hug my arm too. Now here I got a little bolder, and I don't know exactly what I was going for because I was slightly crossed, but I gave her a sort of half-hug by reaching across my body with my left arm, she was on my right side, and put my hand on her shoulder and pulled her in tighter a little. I'm not sure if it came across as a hug, but either way, she scooted even closer hugging my arm and rubbing hands. This went on for a while until I eventually had to get up and do something. When I got back, I found that someone had sat in my spot next to her, and that ended the interaction for the night because we weren't next to each other after, and she also went to bed about 30 minutes later.

Cut forward almost a week later to current day RIGHT NOW 2/14 at 2AM:

I have been thinking things through (probably overthinking it) over the past week, and I've found some problems that I think might keep me from acting on our feelings. 

**PROBLEMS:**

1. I'm a college student that has no job on campus or income, and I make purchases using cash that I brought with me and some cash I got over Christmas. Overall I don't have the long term funds to support things like going out on dates, getting her gifts, etc. You know, the things that a good boyfriend is supposed to do for their girlfriend.
2. I already struggle a lot with my time management between being social with friends, studying/doing schoolwork, etc. and I don't know if I can balance the added quality time I would like to spend with her.  
3. We are both new to dating and intimacy, me because I just haven't been interested in a relationship until now, and her because she is from a slightly strict Christian upbringing. She was also pretty sheltered before she came her, but she has adjusted pretty well. 
4. I hate this one because I think it makes me sound like a douchebag but, adding on to the strict Christian upbringing thing, she has already said before that she is saving herself for marriage. I'm a virgin because I just haven't actively been in the dating pool or casual sex pool yet. I don't know if I can handle an intimate dating relationship long term without full intimacy. I don't want this issue to come off as ""he's a pig and just wants sex though,"" because while it is about sex, it's about more than that. 
5. I'm scared that I won't be able to give everything that I need to a relationship. I'm scared that I'll end up heartbroken. I'm scared that I'm not ready for this. I'm scared that with my problems I won't be good enough for her. I'm scared.

I don't know if I should take the leap and ask her out because of the issues I came across above, I don't want to fall in love and start a relationship that ends in heartbreak (mine or hers) that I could've prevented from the beginning. 

I want your advice on whether I should jump into this relationship and stop overthinking it or whether my overthinking is justified or any advice in between.

I don't know who will see this if anyone, but thanks for your input in advance.",14Feb2020,1
377,"Last month my neighbors flew down to disneyland for vacation and offered to pay me $20 a day to house sit and watch after their dog. On the second day it was pretty nice outside , sun shining and everything so I decided to take the dog (black lab) for a walk. I’m not going to go into great detail because it’s still bothering me to think about, but I didn’t have the greatest grip on the dogs leash and it bolted out into the street and got hit by a SUV and died on impact. 

Ultimately I think I may be to blame for this, the neighbors even told me that it probably wouldn’t be a good idea to walk him since I have no experience in owning any pets before. Rightfully so, the neighbors are pissed off at me and are refusing to pay me for the house sitting and they threatened to press charges but I don’t think they will follow through with that. I’m not upset that they aren’t paying me, I just think they took it over board when my neighbor, let’s call him Kevin, got in my face and yelled at me. In my defense I didn’t know the dog would bolt like it did so I don’t think it’s 100% my fault, probably like 60% my fault and 40% the owners fault for not teaching it how to walk properly. What do you guys think I should do? How do I get my neighbors to move away?",14Feb2020,1

380,"I found out just last week that my girlfriend is pregnant with my baby. I'm not sure how far along she is, and to be honest I'm not very familiar with how it all works, but she's early enough into her pregnancy where you couldn't tell she's pregnant by looking at her. Anyways, she is visibly shaken up by this whole situation, and I don't blame her, but she wants to keep the baby and wants me to be there with her to raise it. I told her I wanted her to get an abortion, but she doesn't want to as she was raised in a very conservative household. I'm not happy with her decision as I feel it is selfish to jeopardize both our lives just because of her outdated beliefs, but I love her so I will support her decision. Because she will have so much on her plate in the near future, I've been urging her to drop out of school so that she is spared from the relentless bullying that I've seen pregnant girls in my classes receive, and also so that she can focus her pregnancy while I try and work full time. Honestly I think this whole situation is god teaching me a lesson for how I've treated people in my life. I'm pretty much stuck here watching my dreams disappear.

I'm petrified about my future, there's no way I can afford to support a baby as I am still in high school (super senior) and work part time at mcdonalds. I know it sounds horrible, but I'm really considering faking my own death and moving away. My mom raised me as a teenage single mother, so she knows first hand how hard things will be for me trying to raise a baby at 19 so she would most likely support my plan if I ever inform her of my girlfriend's pregnancy. My girls family is pretty wealthy anyways, so I really don't think it would be that big of a deal to lose my mcdonalds income in the grand scheme of things. As for her parents, they don't know she is pregnant yet. They haven't even met me yet, as my girlfriend and I decided to keep our relationship on the down low. Yes, I know I screwed up and I will never make the same mistake again so please spare me the lecturing and just give advice. Is there any way I can trick her into getting an abortion?  And is there any government programs to assist low income parents in raising children they can't afford? Do you think if I cheated on her she would want me out of her life and therefore excuse me from the responsibility of raising the baby? Thanks for any help.",14Feb2020,1
381,"I know this sounds like a simple question but it really isn't. I have to first explain the context.

I started a job recently as a stocker at a grocery store. I started working there maybe 3 months ago and I have made very good friends with the people in my department. It's sort of odd but our manager really makes us feel like a big family rather than just coworkers. We recently had someone quit due to medical reasons, and we ended up getting a replacement who we will call Jess. Jess has been working with us for probably about a month at most. She is a very shy person but we have been trying to let her know she's welcome not only for our team but as our friend. Unfortunately Jess has been through a lot of shit in her life. I don't know the details because I definitely don't want to dig up any unpleasant memories. I have gathered so far that she was abused. She has group therapy for abused women, but nobody except her is there so it's really kind of a 1 on 1 therapy session. She is extremely depressed and anxious all the time. She just switched medications which may be throwing her emotions out of whack a little bit but even before her medication change she was very clearly lacking motivation.

This is where the complications come in. Our main group of friends is 5 people including Jess. We all have pretty generic teenager humor which is a little bit dark but not too cringe. We make jokes and laugh, but not on anyone's expense. The only reason this is important is because Jess is Christian. She told us she recently became Christian to help her with motivation, and so far she's really into it which is where the problem stems from. She doesn't feel like she can make the same jokes we do. She never swears, she never makes any of what i'll call ""semi-dark"" jokes and She doesn't do any drugs (Only reason I bring this up is because she had told us she used to before becoming faithful.) These are problems not because of what she believes, but now she doesn't feel included because she feels she can't really join in on any of the joking that we do. I had contemplated joking about lighter things but whenever we try to force a joke to be lighter than we normally would, it is very obvious that we aren't genuine about them. She can tell, we all can tell, and because our humor and personalities no longer match up very well, she feels like an outcast.

Believe me, we have tried letting her know that we care for her. She constantly gets hugs and motivation when she needs it. She is always included in any activities we do. We try to just make sure she knows that we care and that we ARE friends, but none of it seems to be working... I mean shit the last time I saw her, she burst out crying 4 times within a 5 hour period of time. I'm just lost, I really have no idea what we can do at this point. We all like her. Genuinely, when she's happy she is fun to be around. I have spoken to everyone else, we have come together trying to think of ways to help Jess feel included, but we've exhausted all of the options we have thought of. Can someone please help? I'm genuinely afraid that she might hurt herself if she doesn't feel like she has friends.",14Feb2020,1

383,"I was hoping  to get some perspective  on if I made a mistake or not, and if I should abandon ship.

Backstory:

I am a young professional, a bit of a free spirit, and work remote, so I can work anywhere. I was working in an expensive California  city when I decided it was time for a change, and looked for places cheaper than where I was living, and my friends  in Seattle had invited me up to live there. Sounds good!

I was going  to live with a couple initially, I had known them for about 3 years, had casual sex with both of them (I am a no strings kind of guy) and thought that this was going to be great, get to live with friends, live in a cool city.

I arrive and immediately things start going wrong. The new house floods day 2. Ants pop up from nowhere, and we are talking 10,000 ants in the basement where I put my office. Appliances break, front door doesn't work. Hot water heater leaked. I get to mitigation immediately, I am the point of contact so I am meeting with the landlord constantly to get things fixed. 

A week and a half passes, I find out real quick that the couple really only behaved themselves around me when I was visiting.  They fight constantly,  venting to me when they are mad, and then when they are happy they do everything  together and flat out ignore me. Dont invite me to do anything or help me make friends, I get to socializing and try to keep myself busy, make lots of new friends in a month. I am literal  onto of it spending  all my free time being a social butterfly. 

Meanwhile, the guy dumps the girl and it is a nuclear meltdown, the girl is a freelancer and straight decided not to work for a week. Her margins ain't great so I start to worry about the rent. They both start smoking lots of weed, as well as taking adderall the girl's mom is giving them, they have moodswings all the time. At three weeks they decide to be friends but then still spend all their time together and ignore me. 

I assemble everyone I had been hanging  with for a party at my new place, which includes some mutual friends as well. I pay for everything since I was told it was my party. That's cool, no problem,  I do ok for myself financially and I want to try and bring the house together, but they didn't offer to help cook or cleanup. Again, they didn't have to, and they dont clean up anyway, but seeing as how they haven't done anything  to hang out with other people here, it would have been cool to help setup for our first party. I guess I just felt that they really dont want to hang around me all that much, and it just kinda hurts that I moved all the way up here to be their housemate, and I feel like they simply dont give a shit that I am here.

I have a wonderful friend group back in California and have. Even thinking of throwing in the towel, telling the landlords to go screw and cutting  my losses. The upside is that my rent is impossibly cheap (that's how they can both afford it too) and this whole ordeal has forced me to open up in ways I didn't know were possible for me.

I have always been extremely close with both of her parents, I have looked at them like I was their daughter for as long as i can remember. I love her stepdad like a dad, he’s always helping us out when were in trouble and has basically seen me grow from a child into an adult with his stepdaughter. Around November, a month before my bestfriends birthday I text her stepdad asking for ideas for her gift. He didn’t really have any ideas at the time so i just left his text alone. He texted me again randomly one day asking if I was going to get him any christmas presents or what i was going to get him for his birthday. Right after those texts he then sent another message asking me not to tell anyone we were texting, and asking that i delete all of our texts. I agreed but kept the texts anyways just in case. My bestfriends birthday passed, meaning he wouldn’t have any excuse to text right? No, he contacted the same family friend for the 3rd time to ask for my number because he keeps deleting it, presumably to hide from his wife(who I also am extremely close with). He another 4-5 messages asking for hints on his birthday present, if it was okay that he was texting me and that he “just wanted to say hello”. I ignored all of the texts and he texted a bunch of question marks. He stopped texting after I wouldn’t reply and about 2 days ago the same family friend reaches out to me asking if my bestfriends stepdad had texted me recently, I said no why? He says because he had asked for my phone number again! The family friend finally just ignored him and didn’t give him my number. I know he would’ve done it again if he had the chance and I can’t understand why he would do something like this. The implications him asking me to delete our conversations have are so creepy. There’s no way that he’s not trying to flirt with me, but he’s trying to play it off? so I really don’t know if i should tell my bestfriend, her mom, both of them, or just not tell anyone. I know if i tell my bestfriend i’m most likely going to ruin our friendship but i think it’s unfair to her because i have now inadvertently changed our friendship. I just feel like if he is trying to somehow flirt with me, there are some major pedophilic undertones to that because there’s no way become attracted to someone you knew as an adult, grow from a child into an adult.

401,"hello, I'm writing y’all because I don't know what to do, it's been 3 months since I started a new job in a city.  I had a lot of trouble settling in this city because I was graduating from my mba and not much income, it was an ordeal to find an apartment.  I found an apartment at the end of December (the apartment is OK but does not suit me too much because it is an old apartment).  

with my new job I start to earn money (2000 euro per month: which is correct), I put savings aside(1000 euros per month: got 3000 in saving ), 

but the problem is that it's been the second time in 1 week that I get punctured on the left tire in the close parking of my residenceand I don't know who is the culprit.  

I don't know if I should park somewhere else or change my apartment.  

the problem is that the job i'm currently doing ends in april but they want to renew me until september ( don’t trust anyone, it is their words)                                

i don't know what decision to take among those - 

-park my car a little further - 

-change apartments (procedure, pay a new rent, new deposit, the apartment i paid currently is 580 euros  ) - 

someone punctures me my tires

wait until the contract of my job ends and leave the  city ​​looking for a new job?  - 

stay until September and earn the money (it is a great job that can have a huge impact on my resume( even thought it is bullshit for me?)

404," For years I have been striving towards this singular goal of fixing myself. When I was in highschool I went out of my way to fix my inability to talk to other people and now I have very little trouble with speaking to people. Last year I decided that I can’t expect anyone to want to be with me if I am obese so I started a diet and I’ve lost 80 pounds so far. I realized that dressing well is important too, so I’ve reworked most of my wardrobe. I have put a lot of work in to trying to fix myself, however, none of this has helped me at all.

Despite anything I have tried I am still undesirable. I don’t know what to do anymore, it just feels like I just can’t achieve any level of worth. I have bumble, tinder, and okcupid and since October I have a combined 0 matches on any of them. I don’t understand why nobody wants me, It sucks knowing that out of the thousands of people I’ve swiped on and of all the people I’ve talked to in my life the general consensus is that I’m not worth their time. It has totally consumed me, I have dreams several nights a week that just center around getting a date.

It just feels like I will never matter to anyone, that no matter how much effort I put in it will never pay off. I just want everything to be over, I hate living when it seems so sure that I will never be worthy of anyone’s love again. Even my mom told me that I’m a 2/10, there’s not a person on this planet who thinks I have a shot and I just can’t keep pretending I do.",14Feb2020,1

My question comes from taking University classes and realizing I'm dealing with the same issues in one of my classes (headache, tunnel vision, and brain fog). Being University brain fog is a serious problem. I look around and see someone vaping in the room (trying to be ""stealthy"") and then I notice the distinctive bubble gum flavor odor.

406,"I've been in CS for 3 years. I've always gotten A's. I enjoyed my math classes, though not enough to want to take more of them once I got all the required ones out of the way. I thought pretty highly of myself. I thought I wanted to get into VR programming, but when I tried to apply for internships, I learned that I needed way more programming experience from personal projects.

I only ever programmed for my classes, every time I tried to start to make a game, I realized I wasn't creative enough to think up of what the game loop should be. I looked into some open source projects that needed bug fixes, and just was too intimated and frankly bored to continue. So I just went back to drawing or playing video games. 

I live in a situation where I have a great computer, no need to work (during the summers that is), access to a free 3d/2d game engine with Unity, drawing skills for sprites, and a plethora of open source projects that need help, and I am too bored to program. It is so boring for me, so I just sit and do nothing feel anxious because nothing is motivating me and I don't have any idea.

Then it hit me: I am not a programmer.

Well, I only have 1.5 years left before I'm done with this degree, and I've realized I'm going to be completely unemployable and even if I did get a software engineering job, I'd just be awful at it.

So what now? Should I switch my degree to IT or is it possible for me to get a non-programming job with a CS degree? What job in this field doesn't require me to be super motivated or intelligent. I'm stupid and I'm lazy. But I can do what I'm told when I'm told, that's how I got such high grades. There must be a good career for me, right?",14Feb2020,1

Pete has a best friend called Jake who I've only met once and he seemed okay. I don't really remember much of him that night because we never really had a full conversation. Jake added me on Facebook after I briefly met him and now he's being weird.

- He began spam-liking all my selfies, but only ones that don't have my boyfriend in them. He was liking pictures from over 6 years ago so going really far back.

- He's commenting on literally *everything* I post and it comes across as he's showing forced interest in my posts. For example, I posted a heavy metal song the other day and he does not like heavy metal but commented on how he gave it a listen and wasn't much of a fan.

- He's commenting empty complements on all my pictures, and friends pictures that I'm tagged in such as you're beautiful etc.

- He messages me paragraphs about himself, trying to get to know me, but it's too much. His messages are really flexy? Like he goes on about how he was in the military then sent me 3 videos of his son who he raises alone before I even replied.

I've looked at mutual friends to see if he does this to them but I can't see that either. I sent screenshots of the messages to friends and my boyfriend and they all agreed that although he didn't say anything extreme, just how he's writing these huge paragraphs is super weird. He also signs them off with kisses and heart emojis.

I replied by being quite cold, giving short answers but he kept going so I eventually just left him on read yet he keeps messaging me.

It's quite honestly suffocating, and the only reason I haven't told him to fuck off yet is because I have so much respect for Pete. I'm kinda nervous about meeting him again now because he seems obsessed.

Do I tell Pete to tell his friend to cut it out?",14Feb2020,1
417,"So backstory time:

TLDR at the bottom.

&amp;#x200B;

I work parttime as a mail delivery person for local postoffice, it's a tough and rough job due to long walks and weather etc.  
And have an internship which is located 0.5 hour away from the train station.

My knee has been giving me pain for the last three weeks or so, starting mildly with pain when bending to now almost unable to stand on the damn thing.

I also bowl as a sport, which I had yesterday and I used something like Voltaren (heat producing medicine for local pain in muscles).  
It went okay for the two early games, but the last game and the ride home were a pain in the a\*\*.

As well as traversing up and down the stairs in my house, and walking to work (internship) this morning hasn't been the happiest time as well. And I'm already not looking forward to the traversal back to the train station from work...

Even when I'm lying in bed and I have to roll over, thus using my knees and legs to turn over, is a hell to go through. Not once bent though, and I can assume a comfortable position, but bending straight then is a hell again.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, what I'm asking is if I should call today that I'd need rest for my left knee, that I'm unable to fully walk and/or work because of the knee. (work time is 2,5 hour per saturday).  
Thus not straining it more than it already is resulting in more injury than I already have and rest my knee for the weekend to be able to go to the doctor during the weekend (emergency post) because traversal to work is 1+ hour.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Left knee hurts like hell, gotten worse in three weeks to the point that the slightest bend hurts like hell as I stated. Doubting to call in sick for work today, for tomorrow, to tell that I'd need to rest my knee because it's not going well.  
Bowling had to happen yesterday, since we had to win so I just bit my tongue and went through with it. But it's not happening for the parttime work, where I turn, walk up steps etc. where my knees get the full force of the turn.

Turning my left knee is also a hecking no go.

Thanks for advice anyway, I hope you can help me figure it out with work.

And yes, I'll go to the doctor ASAP if I have the chance.",14Feb2020,1
418,"So to describe the situation I won't use the real numbers. it's an online job so I can see exactly how long i worked, tracked by them. in my first paycheck so far, they for some reason put down less time worked than i actually did.

Let's say the system says I worked for 618.2 minutes, or 10.303 hours. let's also say I get paid $25 an hour. that would mean ~$257.

in my paycheck, it said 9.7 hours, so I was paid ~$242 rather than the $257 i should be paid. i found this really odd since their OWN system says i worked 10.303 hours, not 9.7. I know it makes a small difference, but i don't have a ton of money.

I came in for my shift that day and they told me there was no way I could be paid that month and would have to wait to next pay day??? Seemed a bit suspicious but I’m bad at confrontation and went along with it, I’ve got near to no experience with work so thought maybe this was normal. They gave me 3 weeks unpaid off until the next pay day so I didn’t feel like I was working for nothing.

Next pay day comes around and In my bank is £48.15, I should have been paid £400 for what was 41 hours of work. I call up and ask what the fuck is going on and apparently no one has been clocking my hours for me even though I have been reassured many times that they’re being clocked in for me because I hadn’t been given a clocking in card for 2 months even though I asked for one nearly every shift. 

At this point I’m absolutely sick of this and tell them I expect to be paid this month and not have to wait another month, so my boss fills in a form that takes 5 days to process and tells me I should be paid next Thursday or Friday, well today is next Friday and I still haven’t been paid. I called again an hour ago and my boss said hes going to check what’s going on with the form and then call me back, I’m really fed up at this point, my phone bill is overdue by 2 months and I have rent to pay in a couple days, I’m terrible at standing up for myself, what can I say or do to sort this?",14Feb2020,1

I work 10 hours a week at $15 an hour but thats not shit. After my car payment, gas, food this leaves us NOTHING for rent. Shes not working and is blowing through her small amount of savings.

My male (31) housemate has, several times, confronted me about this. Apparently he considers nightgowns to be underwear, and me wearing them makes him ‘uncomfortable’. I find this utterly bizarre as I’d be revealing more skin if I was wearing my shorts, a bikini, or half of my dresses. 

Also I’ve never encountered anyone before domestically who has had a problem with this, or doesn’t do similar themselves. Most people I’ve lived with jump straight into lounge wear or pjs when they get home or if they are having a lazy day. 

Further, many of my males housemates walk around in underwear, or shirtless and in shorts, or sunbathe on the balcony etc. I don’t see why I should have to wear pants to make this bloke happy but people without vaginas can do whatever they like. 

It’s gotten to the point where I am terrified whenever he comes home. I just know he’s either going to make a comment about my state of dress, blame something on me, accuse me of something I didn’t do, or ask a weirdly controlling question (he does all of this consistently). 

I tried to reason with him and explain that my legs are objectively not something anyone should be uncomfortable about, he doesn’t have a right to control my body, he may well have grown up differently but he and I aren’t the same person and he doesn’t get to force his values onto my behaviour, that I’m paying my rent and am allowed to be at home in my home etc, and he doesn’t get it. 

Eg I had literally just come home from work. He is yelling at me through the back door because apparently it’s locked and he wants to get in, and I literally say ‘mate I just got home it wasn’t me’, but apparently it must be my fault. 

It’s gotten to the point where I get up at 4am to get ready for work because I’m so scared of encountering him, and I often go out for no reason and stay out late just to ensure he doesn’t come near me, when I’d rather be relaxing at home.",14Feb2020,1

When we're ready to order, the server comes up and I realize she looks real familiar. Upon closer look, she's my high school crush that I never had the confidence to talk to. I used to be somewhat out of shape/introverted. It's been 3 years since high school (I'm 21) and by now, I'm a lot more confidence in myself and I start by asking her if she remembers back from high school. She says yes and that she would have never recognized me unless I told her who I was.

Anyways, we have a good talk, super friendly and outgoing. Eventually, we order and I ask her if I can add her on Instagram and tell her that we should hang out sometime. She says sure and she adds me on Instagram. This happened last Saturday.

Today, I end up getting the courage to hit her up to see if she wanted to grab a drink sometime. I go on Instagram to DM her, but I can't find her on there. I keep searching to see if I had any typos or anything, but I end up finding out that she deleted her Instagram..

Now that thing that's bugging me right now is that I have her added on Facebook from back when we were in high school. She barely knew me back then and I honestly do not remember how I have her added on there. I really want to ask her out or at least be friends with her.

I'm in a bit of a situation where I want to make that big career step...but I don't know what the hell I want to do. I want to write a small paragraph about what I like, and if anyone can give me any insight or advice it would really be appreciated.

I'm in my mid 20s and I have previous office experience. I would like something flexible in terms of its working hours and days, as well as preferably going to different places. Basically I hate constant routine especially if the tasks are repetitive. I don't like telling others what to do so I would hate a supervisory position, but I wouldn't mind being in a small team with a collective goal. I also wouldn't mind something where I work by myself and others need to come to me in order to find out certain information or get updated on a project I'm working on. I've heard something like a cyber security analyst would be quite fitting for this. However, I do like the idea of the job having to do with other countries on a financial basis or how the globalisation and current affairs are affecting one another.

440,"So, I'm in a discord server about a game. The owner is 22, and there is a girl who is 14. It seems that they are friends. However, today he was asking her some creepy questions, I will list them here;

""So your front, developed?""

She anwsers, also tells him about her ass.

""The size?""

She anwsers with ""I don't know.""

""Are they big?""

She anwsers.

""And are you, skinny? Or fat.""

She anwsers as well.

""How big is your waist? You got curves?""

As usual, she anwsers. 

Now it gets even creepier, he asks her,

""Do you have a history of any major illness in your family tree, may I know what they are?""

And... she anwsers. 

There was more about genetics, but I think that's enough.

This is really weird. He also stated that it is for research purposes. They both know each others age. So the questions I have for y'all, are; What do you think is happening? What do I do?",14Feb2020,1

Long story short, I started working in this factory 1.5 year ago as a worker and next week I will be the shift supervisor. 
Although I was trained about a week for it, the amount of responsibility feels like a weight on my chest. Ten machines, ten colleagues under my “command”.

Well the night the knives went missing I stayed home and was fine I called the police to report and they were dismissive and told me to file an online police report, which I did. 

The next day I decided to stay at my mums house (less for paranoia and more convenience as I had been clubbing and her house was easier to get to after a night out) anyway. The next day chatting with my mum, she said she had to take her car to the mechanic cause all of sudden it stopped working, her hot water is not working for some reason and she’s had all her pot plants stolen, she loves her 🌱 😔 poor mummy! (She thinks someone tried to open her bathroom window too). So she obviously filed a police report. I’m more concerned for her than me, and I don’t know if they’re related to each other, because she suspects it’s an ex friend who’s going through a messy divorce and is jealous her husband is still friends with her.

He used to be one of my best friends in high school and was truly honored to be asked. I have not spoken to him in years though. We usually text when we are in our home town to see if we want to snag a beer but besides that no true conversation. I have never even met his fiance.

We used to be super tight back in high school and hung all the time. We went to separate universities and sort of parted ways. We still kept up and would hang at each other's universities plus in our home town. We both graduated and simply started losing touch. Our text convos would be when we were home and wishing each other well.

He started dating this girl when he moved cities and was jacked for him. He proposed and honestly never even met her. When he asked me to be in his wedding I didn't even remember her name. /rambling

Basically I live abroad now and flying to this wedding, tux, accommodation, car rental is going to cost me $2500+. I have the cash but it will leave me living a bit more frugally for a month or two after. Come to find out as well is his fiance wants a lot of her friends to be bridesmaids so we probably got added to make an even match. He has a lot of his recent friends in his wedding so I feel like I was the friend that got chosen to round out the large number of bridesmaids.

TL;DR: Buddy asked me to be in his destination wedding and I already said yes. It will cost me $2500+ which I have but will have to live more frugally after. Plus we are not as tight as we were back in high school.",14Feb2020,1
450,"Yep, so i am a bit colourblind, which i found out about ~1 year ago. I have trouble seeing and differentiating reds, browns, pinks and purples. It isn't severe, but when the colours get muted i usually can't tell them apart. Up until now it didn't really impact my life that much, but currently it is.

I am in medschool and am taking a pathology course, and the problem is, i can not see the differences in colours in the samples. This is not too good, because the way we are taught depends a lot on seeing the differences in colour. For example, I can not see iron accumulations in cells, because everything just looks equally pink to me, while the iron crystals are technically brown, at least that's what other people say. I also can't really say which part of the tissue is undergoing necrosis without spending 3x as much time as other students, because i can't go off of the basic colour based rules as ""red means dead"" and so on, i just don't really see the difference.

I thought about what to do, and i guess the best way to go forward would be to try and get colour correcting display apps for my phone and laptop, to help me see the contrast. I know that these devices come with pre installed few options, but they don't really help.

So i guess, if anybody on this sub has had a similar problem, or just know where to look for such apps or anything like that, i would like to know. Or if there is a way to just set up the screen to spread those colour frequencies onto a higher amplitude, i would like to know too.

To be honest I would be very upset if he did this to me, but is it possible that he may not view it the same way, and even be glad to get the night off?

454,"I've essentially ruined so many good things in my life just because I'm a creep. I have Autism and, though I won't blame any of this on my condition, I've just always been awkward and a creep. I'll just give a couple of examples to show what I mean:

* when I was 16, I had a crush on a girl. I started to get a little annoying. One day, I unfriended her on Facebook. I freaked out, had like 3 panic attacks. Every time I got on Facebook, I kept getting nervous. I essentially was nervous all the time. I ended up sending her hundreds of messages. I cyberstalked this poor, innocent girl because my chest would rattle inside my body if I didn't. 
* I got into an argument with my friend and bombed his Facebook with messages
* When I was 18, I ended up having points where I'd stare at that same girl I had a crush on.  Eventually, someone told me to stop and I hardly ever did it again.
* A couple of days back I called my professor at 11 pm. She gave us our phone numbers, and I was panicked and stressed out over grades.

You can see where I'm going. I don't get something I emotionally want, I'll bug and stalk someone. I'm a deplorable piece of human trash, but I don't want to be that anymore. I've been to therapy over my autistic behavior when I was young (attempted suicide for attention), but I resisted, and a lot of it just didn't stick. They told me at the end of it that it was to stop me from going to jail. Now I see their point. I'm gonna end up in jail if I keep this up. Not to mention the mental health of all of these people I've done harm to. I bet that girl I had a crush on has PTSD because of what I did. As an adult, I need to get better and to be mature and respectful towards others. I want to reshape my life with my condition in mind.",14Feb2020,1
455,"I have been married to my wife (30F) for a year now. She is a model from Brussels while I am a German. She often shows me her photographs and video clippings and usually, I enjoy watching them.

Recently, she came across a couple of her arm-wrestling videos that were posted on Youtube. They were posted a few years ago but I never saw them. She wanted me to watch these videos along with her in the evening (after work). I thought it would be a great time to spend some time together and enjoy her victory.

In the evening, when I returned we watched the videos as planned. To my dismay, my wife performed [quite poorly in those matches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KfO6ZO52xw). I straightaway told her that she wasn't serious while competing - her gestures suggested that. It almost appeared to me that she was flirting with her opponent (who was a girl) instead of trying to win. She replied that both were quite serious about winning as they had a bet that the loser would have to dance or something fro the winner. I told her that wasn't true or she would have put in greater effort.

Unexpectedly, my wife paused the video and left the room in a huff. Apparently, she was hurt when I said she was flirting instead of competing with her opponent. I am certain she was not fairly defeated. What exactly have I done wrong?",14Feb2020,1

460,"A bit of background:

2 and a half years ago, my dad decided to have an affair on my mum and leave her for this new woman after 28 years of being together. I’m the only child, and was 18 at the time, and a few months later I moved about an hour away to uni. I wanted to take a year out to stay at home with her and be with her but she insisted on me going because it was the best thing for me and my life at the time.

She struggled to cope with all the divorce negotiations and proceedings when he was still coming back and staying in the house at some point most weeks. She was upset most of the time and would phone me and cry most days for at least a year. 

She has a full time job as a manager of two shops which she needs to pay the mortgage and her bills, which she doesn’t get paid very much for because she works for a charity. She often goes into work on her off days, goes in early, or stays late. The job is quite physically demanding and very stressful for a 62 year old. Although she gets on well with her job and likes the challenge &amp; is very good at it, she isn’t exactly passionate about it, hates the company she works for, and it’s not very rewarding.

We finally moved house a year and a half later into a run down house that smelled like animals, and she spent the next 8/9 months working on planning and renovating it which was finished not too long ago. 

She doesn’t have many friends because she moved around the country a lot with my dad, and she’s not close with any of her family other than me. Now the house is renovated and the divorce is done, the majority of her days consist of getting up, going to work, coming home and doing a few chores, then falling asleep in front of the sofa with a glass of wine. She’s considered trying to start a degree at the open university and tried twice but can’t cope with the amount of work alongside her job which she can’t quit because she has to pay the bills. She doesn’t have any other qualifications.

So my question is:

How can I help her to start a new life? She’s a really intelligent and interesting person but doesn’t have anything to focus on or anybody to spend time with. She’s not as upset as she was about the divorce now but still gets sad sometimes and I think she’s quite lonely, and although I always phone and go back to visit, I won’t be living at home permanently for at least another year if at all (other than holidays). 

She’s very closed to the idea of trying to meet somebody else whenever I suggest it to her. It’s very difficult for her to try and find another job that a  enjoys more or she’s more passionate about as she needs the job security.

If anybody’s been through anything similar and has any advice it’d be really helpful, she’s such a lovely woman but is just wasting the rest of her life because of the situation she’s in. Thanks!!",14Feb2020,1

462,"I am not gay but I have a gay cousin and I know a few gay people. That’s not exactly relevant.

My parents views in relation to gay people are quite hostile. I live in a rural area and a lot of people here still are quite homophobic.

My cousin in particular rants about this on a daily basis on FB, talking about how bad gay people are and how it’s a lifestyle choice (what nonsense). 

When my cousin came out as gay my grandparents both sat their crying and told her never to come to her house again. A week later my aunt came out as gay (she was forced) and they reacted the same way.

They both allowed them back in but didn’t attend my cousins wedding. 

My parents aren’t as bad as my grandparents but they certainly aren’t approving of gay people. My father just sat there saying that gay people have to be tolerated and that he doesn’t approve of their “lifestyle choice”. 

What I don’t get is their complete inability to understand this? Why would anyone think being gay is a choice? You are literally born with your sexuality at birth, it’s ingrained in you, it’s not something you can decide.

I have said this to them “oh why don’t you pretend to be gay then” and they just stare at me.

I met a girl a few months ago at work and we were talking a bit during work and stuff like that and we had a lot in common and basically connected pretty well. 

She started texting me on Instagram first just for the work plan and stuff like that but even though I was interested in her I didn’t text much. Few days later she texted again and we had more conversations.

She started saying things like ""you’re interesting"" ""i never met someone like you"" ""we have so much in common"" things like that. 

Then she told me a lot of personal stuff just out of nowhere without me even asking. Like how she cut herself and a lot more personals stuff. I noticed her scars before but never asked.

So she gave me a lot of attention and I mean a lot. She texted me every day and she wrote sooo much like sometimes we texted for hours.

Now comes the confusing part.
I noticed that she isn’t home a lot and she was saying I’m with a colleague (Kollege in German) basically a ""friend""
Or that she is visiting someone.

Long story short she has a boyfriend for over 4 years and she never told me. She always avoided saying she had one. She always said she’s at a friend or not home or other things without mentioning her BF.

I was mad and told her why she never mentioned him and she said she did and she always talked about him and I was like no you didn’t I would definitely notice. Because I like her she spent so much attention on me like no other girl ever did.

There is a lot I didn’t mention but what’s going on ? Is she into me ? Side note: She said she hates her boyfriend and he cheated on her a lot but she is bound to him because he is the only person that stayed with her during all her bad phases.

I act very distanced because she has a BF and i don’t want to do something because of that.",14Feb2020,1
465,"Hello,

I just received a letter from Kansas City University of Medicine and Biosciences. They are inviting me to apply to their PsyD program. Enrolling straight from undergraduate to PsyD would be a huge thing for me. It would mean instead of 4 years graduate study and becoming a licensed counselor, I'd spend 5 years and become a doctor of psychology. This open lots of doors for me as far as what I could do to make money and also increase the level of care I'm able to provide.

The only problem is that their website had this to say about accreditation:

""*KCU is regionally accredited by the Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools. Our Psy.D. program has initiated the multi-year process of seeking APA accreditation.

In May 2018, we received “Intent to apply” status from the APA Commission on Accreditation after program document review and will submit an application for “accreditation, on contingency” in Fall 2019. The “Intent to Apply” status will expire in May 2021.*""

Considering the cost of getting a PsyD (over 100k) and the fact that I would have to move to MO, I'm very dubious about this offer. My application fee is waived so I figured I'd apply just to see if I can get in, but wanted to know reddit's thoughts.

467,"This is going to be a rather long and convoluted post, so I appreciate the time taken by anyone to read this and offer their advice. For background, I am a 25 year old single white man living in British Columbia.

Approximately one year ago I experienced a sort of nervous breakdown that involved memory loss, dissociation and disorientation. I was at the time finishing up my undergraduate studies and living with my parents. There are several weeks during this period which are essentially black holes in my memory and which cannot be accounted for. I did not abuse drugs or alcohol at the time and have no history of such issues, and as far as I remember there were no extreme stressors in my life. I nevertheless managed to complete my degree and was considering whether to apply for grad/law school or enter the job market immediately, however this episode stuck in the back of my head and caused me considerable distress. I saw my doctor and had several tests done, including a CT scan, in order to rule out an organic condition; everything turned up normal. Eventually I came to question my parent's involvement in the incident, as there seemed to be a discrepancy between their reaction to my behavior and presentation at the time and the reaction of other acquaintances and friends, with some of the latter going so far as to suggest that my apparent disorientation implied drug or alcohol abuse while my parents downplayed/avoided the topic. This lead to several heated arguments in which I revealed some of my concerns and suspicions and eventually led to a voluntary hospital visit on their advice, though I thought this was unnecessary.

While in the hospital I am evaluated by a nurse, a medical doctor and a psychiatrist, and they conclude that my suspicions towards my parents are evidence of a psychotic illness of some sort and certify me under the mental health act (!) Google this if you don't know exactly what this means. I am kept in a bed on the emergency ward for a week before being transferred to the psych ward as an involuntary patient and forced to take medication against my will. I express my disagreement with the situation, however I am otherwise compliant and polite. I remain on the psych ward for another two weeks before being discharged on extended leave as an outpatient. Nurses and the more lucid patients express their skepticism of my mental disorder and I am advised to apply for a board to review my case, as is my right. I have since applied for three such panels over the course of several months and each time they have decided to continue my detention, citing primarily my ""lack of insight"" into my illness as proof of my continued illness.

I'm a little bit put out by this, as you might imagine. I'm open to any advice/opinions regarding any aspect of this situation, and can elaborate on any aspect of the story or my life as required. Frankly I'm shocked at how easy it is to deprive a person of their freedom in this province.",14Feb2020,1

Her stinginess has caused incidents in the house and when we eat out as a family and let's just politely say she has caused her fair share of misery with this. I can't bear to be around her anymore, everything, literally fucking everything I do is monitored and I've reached the limit that I deliberately avoid being at home to avoid being around the girl. Toilet paper, kitchen paper, teabags, the amount of water I put in the kettle. I get screamed at ""ONE PUMP IS PLENTY"" every single time I wash my hands. 

Whenever the family eats out she monitors the whole thing, and she doesn't even pay on half these occasions. She is a humiliation to us and herself. If anyone orders anything too expensive she causes a scene with a face that she wants to murder someone and has ruined the occasion on several times. Our parents can drink whatever they want but for us siblings she orders only water every single time.

I think it's worth noting that I got my first girlfriend at 18 and I'm still not fantastic at dating in general; I've only ever had 3 girlfriends, only 1 of which was anywhere close to long-term.

After my ex and I broke things off, I realised that I actually did like this girl and it started killing me to even think of her with another guy. When she came over one time she spent a few hours in my flatmate's room and it honestly made me feel a bit sick. I thought I got over it, but about a week ago we hooked up again and I realised I still like her. I evidently didn't hide it very well because she now knows. I know it's really hypocritical but I can't help it.

I used to fantasize about us, getting married, having a family, but then one day I woke up feeling like I no longer loved him and it traumatized me so much because it was so uncalled for and there was no reason behind this. It just happened and I couldn't explain it or justify it in any way. I felt guilty beyond words. It happened 5 years ago but I haven't been able to recover. I cry every single day. Falling out of love for no reason was traumatizing. It shattered my entire world. Then I proceeded to look for happiness in temporary addictions such as alcohol, drugs and hardcore gambling but nothing seemed to make me feel whole again. Here I am, years later, still severely and chronically depressed, on 3 different antidepressants and in therapy but nothing seems to make the pain go away. I don't think I will ever enjoy life again.

484,"I’m in my last year of high school , I’ve always had excellent marks , I’m always the first of our class ,  and I’ve always wanted to become a doctor.

Even though higher education is completely free in our country , the quality isn’t the best and med students last year had to protest for months and a lot of professors lost their job because they were supporting the students (there’s a discrimination between private and public universities students , hospitals are crowded , and the the private schools students get everything ) so I applied to some European universities , my parents were okay with it since they would never say no to me in anything that concerns my studies . 

They can afford paying for my studies but just a few days ago , they said that if I go to Europe, they will have to send more than 10.000€ every year , while that if I stay here, I will move to another city ( no med school in my town) where we have a flat , family , friends , and is only an hour away from home , I will only need about 200~300€ per month to cover my expenses ( groceries , transport , leisure) , they would let me get plastic surgery, my dad will always buy me the newest iphone , I can go to europe whenever I feel like it ( I have a visa and the flight tickets are really not that expensive) ,we will have a « big holiday » once to twice a year ( basically a holiday where we go to somewhere exotic or far , since Europe is quite close to our country and we have already been there too many times ) ,they would buy me a car as soon as I get my license  and they can come visit me as much as they want to , they might even hire a maid for me ; they said that they really don’t want their daughter to go live far away on her own ( in our culture,people still think that girls need their parents till they get a husband ) 


While that if I go to Europe , my budget will be tight , and I’m aware of it , I will have to find a studio , pay rent , transport etc + the school fees ( 2000~4000€) , I wouldn’t be able to get a car this soon , travel this often, plus the weather is way colder there and my hands turn blue and start burning really bad if the temperature gets lower than 10°C   .


But the thing is , the quality of studies and life is way better there , it’s way more safe for me ( girls get treated badly here , like second class citizens ) , and I can actually be free  and have intimacy, I won’t have to fake fasting during ramadan , or have people checking if I prayed or not today ( I live in a muslim country but I’m not religious ,but I still have to act muslim and I can’t tell anyone about it) if I ever get a boyfriend I won’t have to act like if he’s just a friend in public and I would be able to just HOLD HANDS with him , a thing that if I ever did with my ex in my city , would get me in too much trouble . Heck , in Europe I can finally go see a psychiatric  without having people thinking that I’m just crazy .


I’m fluent in the language of the countries that I applied to , I’ve already been there a few times and people often confuse me with a local , I won’t have a big problem to « integrate » , even though I’m aware that it might take some time to get used to how things are there , it might be really difficult at first since back home , we have a maid that does everything for us ,my parents drive me to school and I have all the time to study and have fun .


I just don’t know what the best choice is anymore , live an easy , quite extra life in my country , but with a shitty system while pretending to believe in Islam , or go to Europe, enjoy the high quality of education, be more free , but with a really tight budget for a very long time ?",14Feb2020,1

I (F17) am really good friends with a girl (16) I met online a few years ago. We’ve always been really good friends but for the past few months but she’s been starting to get on my nerves. She’s homeschooled and has never properly experienced being around other teenagers but she thinks of herself as this really smart person in the way that if I talk to her about something that’s going on in my life she’ll over analyze it and start making assumptions about stuff.

For example, a while ago I briefly spoke to her about a guy that I kind of like. She started asking me these questions about him like how he reacted to things emotionally which I just thought was a weird question. I tried to stop the conversation but she kept at me saying it was important because he could basically just not be a good guy depending on how he reacted to different things. I kept trying to stop the conversation because it was getting really tense and it felt like an interrogation so I just said there wasn’t much to talk about with regards to the guy (like nothings happening at the moment) but then she started saying that I always pushed down my feelings and I shouldn’t feel weird about talking about them and it just started to annoy me at that point, I didn’t like her assuming stuff like that. 

I just told her I needed to go do something at that point but I don’t know what to do. She’s always really adamant about thinking she knows what goes on in other people’s heads and I’ve tried telling her otherwise but she always just does this type of thing again and again. I’ve put it down to her never really being around that many teenagers before because I know she doesn’t talk to many people outside her computer. She’s also had a really hard life too which sucks but I just don’t know what to do with this.",14Feb2020,1
486,"Next year my school is doing AP Computer Science (which would be a deep dive into Javascript) and I’m really excited for it because I wanna be a game developer in the future. I also love art and I’ll be able to take Drawing and Composition for next year. If I take Drawing now I’ll be able to take Advanced Drawing senior year.

I *could* take both, but in doing so I lose my free period and for some days even my lunch. I have a free period this year and I really enjoy it. I like listening to music while getting some homework done. When I don’t have homework I like having that break. It’s going to be my Junior year too and I’m worried that I might need that free period to get homework and studying done, or at least a break so my brain doesn’t melt.

I’m really passionate about both game development and art, so I’m really uncertain. I could take the HTML/Java elective, which would only be 3 days of the ABCDEF schedule, but it’s more of a web design thing.

487,"Well, Hi, I'm a 15 year old Half Japanese Half Filipino.
I have a nice life, currently living with my niece and my grandparents
Also I only really have 7 friends who are true to me.
Today is valentines here. I have no date. No nothing. I'm very shattered as I type this (8:08 PM) Well I bought stuff for my crush ( which she knows that I like her) and her 2 friend (also girls). Her bestfriend helped me which gift to buy for her. Well I got the stuff and bought gifts for the 2 girls as well. I gave them the gift today and they appreciated it (I guess) then after school, I went to McDonalds with my best friend, then after eating, we went home. While I was riding the jeep (Philippine transportation vehicle), I texted her and she replied. I asked her ""Hey, what's up?"" She asked ""Hi, wdym whats up? Also, I just got home."" I replied ""Well I haven't gotten home yet. It's really a tough traffic rn."" She then said ""I got to the honors"" ('cause that's also the day our grade certificated for the 3rd quarter giving day and she got 90+ average). I was surprised ang congratulated her. She said thanks. Well some other unessential chats. Then she said ""Finally, something I can brag about for my crush."" I pretended that didn't hurt me and I replied ""Ayiiee! Clus aq ahhh JOK"" (English-Ayiiee I'm actually jealous, JOKE!"" She asked what was it the ""Ayiie! Clus aq ahh""? I replied "" SELUSSS JOKKEEE"" (English-ENVY/JELOUS JOKKEEE"" she said ""Gastog"" (English- lol) then other more chats (also not really important. Also, when I got to the gate of our subdivision/neighbourhood, I was still talking to her and sent her a pic of the gate, also that time I was riding a tricycle, another Philippine Transportation Vehicle. Then she literally just stopped chatting. I got home and got dressed up. And continued to chat her. She didn't reply, just ""seened"" the other chats. The other girls on the other hand, posted it on Facebook about my gifts. I saw the comments about them talking. I was happy and sad. I didn't know why she won't talk to me. And also, everynight we say goodnight to each other, but since last month (I guess) that stopped. I didn't do anything wrong. I don't get it. I'm so broken. I was also about to ask her outside but I wasn't since her bestfriend already told me that they will go to a mall to celebrate her grades. I don't know if I'm messed up, hates me, doesn't appreciate me, or anything else or maybe she's shy. Everynight I pray that I hope that God show's me a sign that there is a chance. I know I need to wait for 8-13 years since we're in Grade 9 and she can't have a bf if she still hasn't have a job. She even said she won't have any crushes because she will prioritize hey studies first. But what do I see, she has a crush. Lives NEAR her. She even said if someone waits for her that long, she'll accept that guy. I hope I'll be able to make it. I won't be able to withstand if I end up being without her. I'm scared. I need help. Also, the day when we bought the gifts, (2 days ago, Feb 12), I was sick that time, but I ignored it, just so I can get her a present. I just want her to realize my efforts. Why can't she see it.

Hi there! I am a 19 year old male and would describe myself as an encouraging and lighthearted person.

I feel like I have been struggling with loneliness, and more specifically, making any “real” lasting friends, over the past few years.

Quality over quantity has always been the priority for me, focusing my efforts on building meaningful friendships with a few people. I am always the person who encourages my friends, organises catch ups, or initiates contact to ask how their week was or whatever else.

Not to sound entitled, but nobody ever shows back any genuine interest in my life, and I won’t hear from anybody unless I contact them (also depending on if they choose to respond or not).

To be frank, I am finally over it. I feel so tired of wasting my time and effort by consistently trying to invest in other people when they don’t show anything back.

In summary, I feel very lonely and have no idea why I can’t seem to make any friends. I think I have the potential to be a great friend, but nobody seems to care.

Advice from anyone who has been in a similar situation would be greatly appreciated! If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Thanks for your time.",14Feb2020,1

490,"So. Let's start off with I'm in my early twenties with a 7 month old. My child's father and I had a very toxic relationship and as a result, there is now a restraining order and courts are involved. The relationship was crazy. Mentally, emotionally, physically abusive on both ends and no doubt about it, it had to end. I'm not innocent either. I feel like I ruined his life and I have done damage. When I found out I was pregnant late 2019 we were in a rough spot but I chose to continue with my pregnancy because I wanted that baby with OR with out him. Since it has come to a breaking point recently, He can see my son one day a week and that was ordered by a judge.  

3 days ago, I found out I was pregnant. It is his. I did not have any sexual interaction what so ever until we spent the holidays together after being a part for a long time. And yes, I feel stupid.

The thing is, we just can't be together. Therapy did not work. We both suffer from PTSD and anxiety and that just does not work. I miss him terribly but I know this. There is a restraining order due to a domestic violence incident. He was in jail, and needs a psych evaluatuion ordered by the judge. I regret calling the police. I feel like I ruined his life and I could have just ended it and walked away. But the day of the incident I was scared and our child was present. I think it's important to say I did not have any serious injuries. A sprained arm, that is it. 

Anyways fast forward to now.. I have tried to reach out already despite the restraining order. Once in regards to our child. and once when I found out. I simply just asked to talk. I have been ignored, bashed on social media, and blamed. That is fine. I have come to terms with the fact that I chose to end it and make it messy. 

I want this baby. I really do. But I am young, with a 7 month old. A student and work part time. Child support has not been finalized so I have been doing this completley on my own with the help of my parents and it is not easy. I cry a lot at work and when I'm not around my child. It is his baby, and would have no problem with a DNA test. (I Know if he finds out, he will call me a whore and claim it is not his). It is. My pregnancy with our first child was terrible because of the relationship and now I'm a single mom. I have given up on telling him. I have considered adoption but I think that will be my mental breaking point, but I also think going through an abortion as well will be a breaking point. But I also  do not feel I am equipped to have another child.

If you have read up until now thank you for just taking the time. I posted this here because I do not want any biased opinions. I'm asking a bunch of strangers for advice because I am completley lost. Give it to me straight.",14Feb2020,1

497,"Hey, I need some help.

I'm 23 and recently graduated last December (2019) with a B.A. in Art and a minor in English.

Prior to graduation, I was extremely excited. Graduating, to me, meant more than an accomplishment. It mean freedom, financial independence, and the ability to finally make my own decisions and be my own person (ie, move out of my family's house).

My life at home isn't terrible, per-say. But, things aren't great either.

Long story short, I'm having to hide a very pivotal part of myself (ie, i'm trans). They found out about it several years ago, threatened to take me to conversion therapy, so I quickly went back into the closet and told them it wasn't ""real"".

So to me, graduation meant so much more than just ""no more homework"". It meant freedom.

However. Things've changed.

Today marks three months out from graduating and I'm completely unemployed and have nowhere to go.

I have experience in marketing, design, copywriting, and advertising. So I do have professional experience. However I quickly ""yeeted"" (for lack of a better phrase) out of that career path because it felt incredibly soul-sucking and was a detriment to my mental health.

I've gone to career fairs, brought resumes, and looked presentable, but most every company has looked me dead in the face and has said, ""we don't have any positions available that are suitable to your education and experience,"".

I've considered teaching, and I've worked as an assistant to close teacher of mine, however I quickly, too, realized that wasn't the career path for me.

In a nutshell, after spending the past three months trying to figure out what in the hell to do with my life, I decided to raise my white flag and go visit a career advisor at my university.

I told her everything. My problems, my issues, my concerns. I told her where I want to be and where I want to end up.

We took career aptitude tests. Every exam I took pointed to the same career path. Counseling, Social Work, Therapy, Psychology, etc. In response to that, we discussed about my possibly getting a Masters in Social Work and becoming a LCSW.

We talked about my likes, my dislikes, my desire for financial stability and interest in more tech based jobs and so forth. In so, we discussed about how it may be a good idea to considering getting a second bachelors in C.S.

Both options sound great. It's just a matter of determining what is more important to me.

And, although I left that appointment feeling confident since I finally have two clear options to pursue, I'm really struggling.

Why?

Because this means I have to deal with a major con. I have to put off my independence, financial freedom, etc. for another two and a half years.

And reddit, I cannot begin to express to you how soul-crushing that is for me.

Yet, I'm completely lost at this point because I can't think of any other options I have.

Although I do believe going back to school would be a great thing for me (ie, getting me out of the house, being social, feeling like i have a purpose, etc) -- at the end of the day, no matter what, I have to come back home.

And when I come back home, I'm constantly reminded of how much longer I still have to go and god, it just makes me feel incredibly defeated.

I don't have the financial ability or option to live on campus, so that isn't a possibility unfortunately.

So, I really need your help.

Are there possibly any other positions I'm not considering that I could get a well-paying job with knowing my degree that don't have to do with marketing, copywriting, or design?

Or do I truly have to bite the bullet and stick it out for another two and a half years?",14Feb2020,1
498,"This is going to be such a #firstworldproblems post, sorry lol

&amp;#x200B;

I've been a HUGE fan of Green Day since I was a tween. I was never allowed to go to /rock concerts/ and by the time I was old enough to do things on my own, they were not touring any more. The last few tours I was not in the financial position to go, as I live far from most touring cities and would have to do the whole ticket/flight/hotel thing. SO WHEN they announced going on tour this year, I jumped on that because now I'm a big girl with a big girl job. Being a summer concert the flights are stupid expensive, but I was going to move some stuff around and pull some extra shifts. Plus a friend of mine is joining me. Fast forward a few weeks ago My Chemical Romance does the whole RETURN thing and OF COURSE I need to go to that because this might (or might not) be a one time only reunion...Im not taking any chances. Being during the fall, the expense is not as bad. BUT THEN a family member is not doing well and I've been called to come home and help sort things out (older sibling duties) and of course, I live across the ocean and need to buy a flight. AND AND I'm a bridesmaid for a friend's wedding in May, so, you guessed it, another flight across the ocean.   
While ONE concert and a wedding was doable....2 concerts, a wedding and a family emergency all in one year is not.  


So here's the issue, I HAVE to go home to help, I HAVE to go to the wedding and I (kinda) HAVE to go see MCR...but I WANT to see Green Day too.

I have survived all kinds of abuse there is. Physical, emotional, mental, sexual. I've seen it all.

I have an elder brother who is a failure in life. He couldn't get through college (Chemical Engineering) and dropped out because of alcohol and weed. He was also admitted in the rehab for de-addiction. This is a huge stigma here in this country. So that's how it is all connected to me and where it started.

I got forced into Med School by my parents. I wanted to become a kindergarten teacher and here I am. Now I'm being forced to get into a residency program of their choice. I want to take up a basic preclinical subject (like physiology/pathology) and get into teaching again but they want me to practice medicine. All of this because brother screwed up his Engineering college so they thought Medicine would be correct for me.

Mother left me to be with my brother when I was 14. Threw me in a hostel and didn't bother picking me up from there when the entire state closed down during Emergency. I was alone in the entire 6 floored building with some hostel supervisors. No phone, no electricity. She said I faked my symptoms and sent someone else to take me to the doctor. It was when I was diagnosed with Typhoid fever that she took me home. She came back to me when I was 21 (after my brother was done with rehab and college and found a girl for himself).

Med School was a roller coaster for me. My best friend passed away, my ex fiance dumped me because I was not good enough for his parents. I leapt on alcohol for closure and that opened doors for the sexual abuse. I've been raped a number of times by the guy who was my alcohol supplier (girls from so called respected families walking in a bar and buying alcohol is a stigma, again)

Brother had mental health issues (which I feel he faked because I've seen what mental health issues look like), went to a psychiatrist and took prescription meds. So parents obviously believed him.

All these events gave me MDD, GAD and PTSD. They said I was faking it again. They didn't let me see a therapist or let me get help because they were offended by the fact that I (their perfect, flawless daughter) could have any mental health issue at all. So I self medicated and got a job so I could afford therapy (secretively). Therapy turned out to be a scam. Looted me of all the money I had so I quit therapy and had to quit the job because the only way out of all this is by studying full time, clearing residency exams and getting out of here.

I'm blessed with wonderful people such as my boyfriend and my 2 best friends from Med School who understand all of this and are extremely supportive. All of them say ""You've seen enough, you've been through enough, it's time you took stand for yourself and speak up for what you want"". I know they're right. But I've been beaten, hurled abuses at, called a liar for speaking up and trying to reach out to my relatives for help.

My parents now want me to listen to them because my brother has already let them down and has ""spoilt"" their name in the society. So they want me to get into a residency of their choice and practice medicine because teaching is below their standard of what they want me to do in life. Or, if I still want to pursue my career in teaching, they want me to get married to a man of their choice so I can be a stay at home mother and look after the kids. I don't have a choice here.

I can't deal with any of this any more. I feel like running away but they won't let me. I'm trying to collect evidence of the abuse that goes on (videos, voice recordings) but I don't know if any of it will help or if they'll ever let me get out of this. Being one of the so called respected families, such things never come out into the open. I wish all of this could end.",14Feb2020,1

I might have just bee overthinking it, but her words sounded a little jumbled like when she had too much to drink, but she sounded mostly normal, so I just hung up without saying anything. I called her back, and asked if she had been drinking. She said of course not, and that she had just gotten off work, and she was gonna go home. I can always tell when  shes drank too much, but I couldnt tell this time. I even saw her when I was sitting in a parking lot. She came up next to me, and started talking to me. I gave her a bunch of one word replies because I didnt want to keep listening to her, and find out that she in fact had too much to drink. I know, I should have really listened to her to find out.

I would have definitely stopped her if I knew she drank too much, but I truley couldn't tell. I also talked to my brother that night, because he was with her right before I had talked to her. I asked him if it seemed like she had been drinking, and he said ""no, she seemed completely fine"" he knows how I feel about drink driving, so maybe he just said that sonic didnt worry. I was gonna talk to my mom this morning, and ask her to be truthful with me. I was going through a terrible episode of depression/anxiety, and I was just started to be happy again, and if she admits that she had been drink, then I was gonna tell her that she ruined it, and now I'm back at square one (because I would be) shes the one who wanted me to go to counseling, and a big reason I feel the way I do sometimes is because if her drinking. But I'm truly not sure if she had been drinking, so I dont know if I should go that far.",14Feb2020,1

511,"Im a bartender in a fine dining restaurant that has one manager, we’re a smaller place that’s pretty self sufficient as far as staff goes. I’ve had to take over most of the management duties because of this situation. 

Our current GM was a server who was pretty much the only one who would take the job after our previous GM got fired. He’s incredibly unfit for the position and has gone off the rails. He’s stopped coming in 4-5 nights a week (we only open for dinner) and when he does show up he gets completely wasted. The guy will regularly drink 3+ bottles of wine; one shift he made it through a case of beer and half a bottle of tequila. He comes and stands behind the bar and rambles on to customers talking shit about his entire staff, he breaks things, falls, cries. I’ve had several regulars bring his behavior up to me, and ask for my schedule so they can come in when he isn’t there. 

When I’m not at the restaurant I get text messages from staff filling me in on his behavior and all the awful things he says about me when I’m gone. Several of us have made an attempt to speak to the owner, even one of the partners in the restaurant, but the owner has three new restaurants that are making him money and he said this one is the least of his concerns at the moment. 

I feel like all I can do at this point is ask to meet with him before we open and confront him about his behavior. We’re losing staff left and right. I’m just wondering if that’s the right way to go about it, or if it will create more hostility.",14Feb2020,1

first off, I have to make it clear, he never touched me

I don't know how long it's been happening but i feel like it's been at least since i started puberty, possibly earlier though but I was young and didn't notice

a few examples

I often find him outside me bedroom, he'll be looking, like having his head just high  enough to see in,  and when i walk out i'll see his head disappear or he'll just hurry into the bathroom (which is close to my room)

A lot of the time I feel like I hear someone outside the bathroom door when I'm taking a bath or shower, and a few times in my life I've seen him close to the door when I opened it

just now i was wearing shorts and I was walking away and I saw the reflection in the window, he had his eyes on my shorts, and when he left the room I saw him outside the door peeking in through the corner

Or I'll be getting dressed and I'll be 99% sure i closed my door fully, but I'll look back and it will be open just enough to see through the corner

like it's seriously stressful but at the same time I don't want to believe it, i feel like I'm crazy, any time I'm showing any skin or even anything tight I just feel his eyes on me  
even if I'm just making food in the kitchen at night in my pyjamas I'll hear his door open and think I see him peeking his head out

I can remember him helping with my homework when I was 13 and I had a loose top on and he just seemed to be staring, making sure to be above me too

I know I can't do anything really, he could just deny it if I did bring it up to anyone, It's just scary to deal with",14Feb2020,1

Later in the evening the next day around 7 or 8 the cramping wasn't getting any better and was worse. We went to the ER where my OBGYN is located, about 45 mins away. We eventually learned that we had lost our baby. Being 19 weeks along, they should have put me into a room to deliver the baby at the hospital. We were sent home. I had asked before being discharged multiple times what to expect at home and they said, ""The bleeding will get heavier and you cramps will get stronger."" I was confused but didn't think much of it at the time because I was in so much pain. By the time they discharged us I was in so much pain that I had to stop walking and would double over in pain. That pain only intensifies over the next couple hours where we went home and then decided to go back to ER in our home town because I couldn't stand the pain anymore and thought I was going to die. This ER is only 5 mins away. We pull into the parking lot and as soon as we park I felt relief wash over me. I hesitated going inside and ended up having the baby in my pants right outside the ER doors. Once we were inside a nurse took me to the bathroom where I pulled down my pants and let my deceased child fall into a pink medical tub with the amniotic sac still in tact. It was about the size of 2 baseballs. She said she was shocked that they sent me home and said that the pain I was experiencing was actual labor pain. I didn't know it was labor pain since I've never been in labor before due to my first pregnancy being a c-section due to preeclampsia. There are risks going into labor after having a c-section where the scar could rip open. I'm lucky that didn't happen since I wasn't under any medical supervision during the whole process.

523,"Me- 20 yo Male

Her- 18 yo Female

I will preface this post with some background information. I'm a 20-year-old guy in college, and I'm also a virgin. I have only been in one relationship back in 8th grade (if you can call it that), which was mostly making out because you know raging teen hormones and all that. Nothing else ever happened, and that was the majority of what the relationship was. It ended badly because of immaturity on both our parts. I have since been a firm believer that dating should happen after high school and preferably when you are ready to try and find lasting love, and that anything before college is just asking for heartbreak and or problems.

**CURRENT SITUATION:**

I moved into college back in August as a 20-year-old freshman (yeah, it took a while for me to get to college because I wasn't quite ready yet). Since then, I have found that the majority of the people on the floor of my dorm are great people that are nice and fun. Almost all of us are friends, and we all party, drink, and or smoke together on weekends and are all very supportive of one another. Honestly, I love my floor and the people on it, we have a strong sense of community together, almost familial. There is one girl that, in the beginning, I didn't think of in any romantic or sexual way. We are friends (not anything super close but still friends), and that's how I thought of her until two weekends ago. My group of guy friends and I were hanging out and smoking, and she and a few girls came in the room who were killing time until their ride showed up so they could go to a frat party. I was pretty high and sort of out of it but lucid enough to know what I was doing. She sat down next to me, and she held my hand, and I held it back, we started rubbing each other's hands with our thumbs, and she laid her head on my shoulder. The ride showed up, and she left to go to the frat party, when she got back, my friends and I were sitting on the floor in the hall talking, and she ran to me and sat down and hugged my arm. The next day a bunch of us were drinking in my room and playing Mario party, and she came in and sat on my bed with me and grabbed my hand again and was generally cuddly. These experiences set everything in motion, I started to feel my heart sink a little when I thought of her, and I wanted to explore it further. The next weekend came, and she had a club retreat thing to go to, and we didn't see each other. It's also weird that nothing like that experience happens when we aren't in a partying setting. Last weekend was the same as usual; we were partying. I had gotten the perfect amount of drunk earlier in the night and was sobering up. It's 1 a.m., and my friends are sobering up also, so we do the only logical thing, we smoke. I came into the room, and she was already there sitting on my friend's bed as everyone was hanging out and smoking, talking, listening to music, and I sit down next to her, hoping that something would happen again. I grab her hand, and she grabs back, and we rub our thumbs along each other's hand again. We were both sitting up but laid back, and she scooted closer to me. She laid her head on my shoulder, and I laid my head on hers. Eventually, she started to hug my arm too. Now here I got a little bolder, and I don't know exactly what I was going for because I was slightly crossed, but I gave her a sort of half-hug by reaching across my body with my left arm, she was on my right side, and put my hand on her shoulder and pulled her in tighter a little. I'm not sure if it came across as a hug, but either way, she scooted even closer hugging my arm and rubbing hands. This went on for a while until I eventually had to get up and do something. When I got back, I found that someone had sat in my spot next to her, and that ended the interaction for the night because we weren't next to each other after, and she also went to bed about 30 minutes later.

Cut forward almost a week later to current day RIGHT NOW 2/14 at 2AM:

I have been thinking things through (probably overthinking it) over the past week, and I've found some problems that I think might keep me from acting on our feelings. 

**PROBLEMS:**

1. I'm a college student that has no job on campus or income, and I make purchases using cash that I brought with me and some cash I got over Christmas. Overall I don't have the long term funds to support things like going out on dates, getting her gifts, etc. You know, the things that a good boyfriend is supposed to do for their girlfriend.
2. I already struggle a lot with my time management between being social with friends, studying/doing schoolwork, etc. and I don't know if I can balance the added quality time I would like to spend with her.  
3. We are both new to dating and intimacy, me because I just haven't been interested in a relationship until now, and her because she is from a slightly strict Christian upbringing. She was also pretty sheltered before she came her, but she has adjusted pretty well. 
4. I hate this one because I think it makes me sound like a douchebag but, adding on to the strict Christian upbringing thing, she has already said before that she is saving herself for marriage. I'm a virgin because I just haven't actively been in the dating pool or casual sex pool yet. I don't know if I can handle an intimate dating relationship long term without full intimacy. I don't want this issue to come off as ""he's a pig and just wants sex though,"" because while it is about sex, it's about more than that. 
5. I'm scared that I won't be able to give everything that I need to a relationship. I'm scared that I'll end up heartbroken. I'm scared that I'm not ready for this. I'm scared that with my problems I won't be good enough for her. I'm scared.

I don't know if I should take the leap and ask her out because of the issues I came across above, I don't want to fall in love and start a relationship that ends in heartbreak (mine or hers) that I could've prevented from the beginning. 

I want your advice on whether I should jump into this relationship and stop overthinking it or whether my overthinking is justified or any advice in between.

I don't know who will see this if anyone, but thanks for your input in advance.",14Feb2020,1
524,"I recently started a new job at a Dunkin donuts and right off the bat of the application to the interview, I told them ""My legal name is x, but please call me y"" Everyone was fine with it. However the manager above them stomped it out saying everyone has to use their legal name. However shortening of the name is okay. So Jessica can be called Jess but x cannot be called y. Why? Because from what I understand another store in the district had employees using ""inappropriate"" nicknames. I'm not even sure what that entails, but It's infuriating to me. My preferred name is not a nickname, not even my mom and dad call me my legal name, and I'm still saving up the money for the legal name change. 

This has gotten me so angry but I genuinely don't know what to do. I have the number for the person above the mean manager, however I have no idea how to approach it, I could try talking to the mean manager, but just from watching her interact with other employees and the way she talks about her personal life, she's really toxic and I'm scared to talk to her.

528,"Hi I posted this to AskHR but I figured more advice couldn't hurt. I work in the US. First off I want to  say that my coworker is very helpful and always offers to lend a hand,  works hard, and has been nothing but nice to me. Besides this he's a  conspiracy theory nut who usually goes on at length about these things.  When he does this I usually just smile and try to ignore him (I have  social anxiety disorder and being anything but nice to people to avoid  confrontation is difficult) He also has a dark sense of humor.

He  had cancer that went into remission but is still visibly depressed  about this and makes off the cuff comments about how he has no future  and nothing to live for and that he's just resigned to never moving up  in life (we work a low paying factory job and he's in his forties). A  couple weeks ago he made an off the cuff comment that probably the only  thing holding him back from shooting up a school is his wife (who he  talks about having a great relationship with) but he would never shoot  up a school or our work, probably a restaurant.  He said ""No worries  though I don't have the budget for firearms"" and chuckled. I just looked  at him and didn't say anything as I was kind of shocked. He then went  on about how all the mass shootings were probably really done the  government.

It's been in the back  of my mind since then (2 weeks ago) but I've just been brushing it off  as his dark sense of humor. I feel like I should ask him if he was  joking or not but I have social anxiety disorder so confrontation is  very hard for me. I could bring it up to my manager but I don't know if  that would lead to him getting fired and I'm sure he would know it was  me who said something as I was the only person around when he said this  and also this is a pretty small company.

I  don't know if I've just been ruminating about this and blowing his dark  sense of humor out of proportion because I have social anxiety disorder  or I should actually report this. Again if he got fired and he was  joking I would feel pretty bad since he's been nothing but nice and a  great worker and talks all the time about money issues.

I'd appreciate any advice about this situation! Thanks :)",14Feb2020,1

532,"Every other sub seems to have a ""no personal advice posts"" rule, so trying this one out...

----------------------

38, male, 5'10"" (178cm), 132 lbs (60kg).

I want to bulk up.

I have always struggled to maintain/gain weight -- if I go through a stressful time and/or exercise a lot, I lose weight easily and it's hard to gain it back. 

I feel full really easily when eating, and if I eat too much in one meal I get heartburn.

I've been eating healthier for the last 6-12 months (nothing too crazy, but a LOT of egg whites, chicken, etc). I think this has made me lose more weight.

I've done exercise / lifting / racquetball / etc sporadically during my life. But, over the last 1-2 months, I've been trying to get into an actual weight lifting routine (about 3 times per week) to bulk up. I've definitely noticed more toned/defined muscles, but not really any weight gain overall.

Calorie trackers show that I'm not eating enough.
Any advice for how to stomach eating more food? (pun intended!).  Or, are there supplements that could be helpful?",14Feb2020,1
533,"I am a 17 year old girl. I have two brothers(18 &amp; 14). My mother is 59. My father is 47. We all live together. My uncle has also lived with us for the past 18 years. We live in North Carolina.

Before work yesterday, my mother told me she wants to leave and go to Texas. She quit her job the other day as it was too much for her. She is an legal immigrant, but doesn’t speak English. She worked in a textile factory for a month, but it was 12 hour shifts and it’s too much on her aging body. Before that job she worked in a poultry factory for about 8 years, but a ganglion cyst developed on her wrist so she had to quit. There’s no job opportunities here for her, or at least any nearby.

Apart from that, she has an unhappy marriage. My father did something unforgivable about 15 years ago and it was impossible to recover. It was some messed up shit, that even left me screwed up with trust issues and other sorts of issues. They’ve both been miserable but stayed together for us kids because we were young.

I didn’t say much when she told me all these reasons, for some reason I couldn’t make out any words and I just cried. I went to work and sobbed the entire way there. When I got home I spent 3 hours looking for jobs she could do that were near, I found one. I did the application but my mother has no education and I hope her experience will be enough. I am really praying she gets this job. This morning, she got a check from her last workplace and she said it’s enough to move to Texas. She has friends and family over there and nobody but us here.

Yesterday during our talk, she said she’s been wanting to leave for awhile. She said she was planning on just disappearing one day, but she couldn’t do that to us. Im scared she’s gonna leave in the middle of the night.

I can’t go with her bc I have my high school and college here. I can’t leave till I finish my classes bc Im midway between the last semester. My father would never let me go either. I don’t want to be separated from my brothers, friends, dad, and uncle. I can’t start a new school my senior year, all I know is here.

I know she has sacrificed so much for us and I don’t want to be selfish, but I want my mama to be with me. Or at least in the same state. I knew I was gonna have to leave in two years anyways but I love her. And my little brother will have even less time with her.

I don’t know what to do. Should I let her go and be happy? I’ve been searching for jobs but can’t find anything.",14Feb2020,1

535,"Hi everyone. I’m 17, my parents divorced around 4 years ago and ever since their relationship has been on and off. I lost count of how many times  they’ve broken up and gotten back together. They got divorced in the first place because my dad cheated. Around 1 year after the divorce my mom took him back, but when they got back together she didn’t stop talking to the guys she was with. So yeah, now my mom was cheating on dad. They’re also both alcoholics, which contributed a lot to their relationship being so on and off and toxic. Right now my parents have been broken up for four months, and are starting to get together again. They both haven’t been drinking and things were pretty good. Today i got back from school early and the guy my mom was with after my parents got divorced came and brought her flowers. That was a little shocking to me, so i was asking my mom in front of him why she keeps lying to everyone, so the guy left. Today is valentine’s day so my dad will also come later and bring her flowers. I feel terrible just thinking about seeing my dad today. My mom tells me not to tell anything to my dad because it’s none of my bussiness, but i honestly feel like if it were me in my dad’s place i would want someone to tell me something like that. The previous times that she cheated i told my dad, but this time it’s valentine’s day and it was also his birthday a couple days ago so i don’t think i can bring myself to tell him literally after he gives my mom flowers. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to tell him and if i should even tell him.

536,"A bIt if background as it’s usual for this kind of post.

I was in a relationship with said Ex for approximately 5 years. Unfortunately it didn’t work out which at the time I was very upset about.

Fast forward 15 years (yes this is grown up stuff not kids stuff), I’m happily married, 2 kids. I’ve kept in touch with my exes sister as we all used to live together so I have sporadically heard about what Ex is doing in life.

Anyway whilst back in my home town I bumped into an old friend who mentioned that one of his close friends had hooked up with my ex a few months ago and had spent a few nights together. He was slightly wary of telling me but it’s water under the bridge now. I said I was surprised as I thought Ex was in a long term relationship but didn’t really think too much of it. It’s her life.

Today I happened to speak to the sister and she said that Ex is 3 months pregnant and has just bought a new house with her partner. Pregnancy dates are a little in line with said hook up.

I phoned my friend and clarified that he was sure what he told me was 100% correct which he told me he’s absolutely confident as he’s saw them together.

So now what do I do? 

I’m still friends with the sister, If it ever gets out and she finds out I knew,I’m an arsehole for not saying anything.

If I tell the sister I’m an arsehole for stirring it up.

Do I anonymously tell the partner ?

Any advice would be great",14Feb2020,1

539,"Advice for a Student

Hi all! I’m a junior student in a BASW program with a big decision to make. I love the social work program, I’ve met a lot of great people and learned so much. For senior year, we have to do an internship and I can’t help but think I’d rather do something else instead.

Money is a big concern for me and there’s a child welfare program at my school that pays your senior year tuition and in return, you have to work for CPS for a year. I find this to be a big risk, because if I hate the job, I’m stuck working it for two years. 

The other option is to finish my almost completed psych major and get a creative writing minor. My mom isn’t supportive of this and says it’ll be a lot of wasted money. I can’t help but think focusing on my writing will make me happier than doing an unpaid internship or an internship in child welfare.

I should add that I was abused as a child and I’m worried that the CPS job may be triggering. Please let me know any thoughts or advice you have for me.",14Feb2020,1

542,I've had a very similar dream twice this week. It all centers around my feeling and fear that my friends hang out with each other and don't want to hang out with me. I always see them together and they never ask me if I want to join. I don't know if it's just absentmindedness or of they genuinely don't want to spend time with me. I've talked to them about this before and ⅔ responded with apologizing and saying they'd make an effort to include me. They haven't really. I've tried setting things up to hang and that usually works but I'm tired of always being the one to instigate. The problem is that I want them to include me in whatever Hangouts they're planning. Part of me just wants to detach from them. That's the part that thinks they just don't like me anymore. Now I don't know how to act around them. I'm constantly afraid that if I don't make them laugh or have fun then they'll just kick me to the curb. I don't what to say. Should I talk to them or just deal with this in my head?,14Feb2020,1

I have around $700 I can give to them, and I think I can convince my aunts to help me. We're also selling 2 broken cars (one has a broken transmission and the other won't start). That's honestly all we've got at this point.  What else could I do?",14Feb2020,1
544,"First of all I apologise for the long read, I tried to make this as short as possible.

I'm currently in a serious relationship with my lovely girlfriend of 3 months and she **loves** bracelets. She wears them every single day. She wears the ones she got from different countries on her right hand and special ones on her left hand. She has around 7 bracelets on her right hand and only two bracelets on her left hand, one she got from her best friend for her birthday and the other one was from her ex.

At first I didn't know that she wore special ones on her left hand. A few days after her birthday this month she was showing me the bracelet her best friend gave her, and I asked her why she was wearing it on her left hand rather than her right. She said it's because it was a special one, and that the ones on her right hand were from different countries.

Then, I asked her who gave her the other bracelet. Unlike the birthday bracelet, It wasn't anything fancy, just a normal, plain looking, light purple bracelet. She hesitated to tell me, ""from someone"", she said, while smiling/laughing to what seemed to me guiltily. Or maybe because she didn't know how I would react, I'm not sure. But after asking her two more times she told me it was from her ex. I was a bit weirded out by it and I didn't know how to react. I just said it should be on her other hand. Then she kept smiling and giving me looks, and when I asked her why she was giving me looks she said something along the lines of ""it's nothing."" I was only half serious when I said that so nothing happened after and she's still wearing every day on her left hand.

Now, this ex was a childhood friend of hers, and till now he's also a family friend as he sometimes hangs out with her siblings and her parents know him. She broke up with him around a year ago, they only lasted around 2-3 months. But they didn't completely lose feelings for each other until maybe 9 months ago. They are currently well-aquainted as she told me, she doesn't know whether the trust is still there and so she doesn't really consider him a friend.

The next day she told me that they recently got back to texting each other, and that he wanted to take her to McDonald's to hang out and if I was fine with it, and that it might be a regular thing that they'd hang out from time to time. I didn't know how to feel about that so I thought about it and eventually came to peace with it. Even though I'd rather she doesn't go out with him, I trust her and he is a long time friend of hers so whatever. But then she told me that she won't go out with him because she felt like I was weirded out and she respects it if I don't like it and she doesn't feel right going out with him when I'm feeling some type of way about it.

Any advice on what I should do and if I should ask her to stop wearing that bracelet? I mean I don't mind if she keeps the bracelet as a memory or whatever but I do kinda mind her wearing it every single day. At some point I came to peace with it but I'm writing this because I'm not sure how to feel about it anymore. I also want to know how I should go about them texting again.

TL;DR: My girlfriend loves bracelets, she wears a normal, plain looking bracelet that her ex gave her every single day and they're also texting now but just as acquaintances. How should I go on about it?",14Feb2020,1
546,"So. I'm 21 and I honestly really don't like my name. I feel like my first name and surname together sounds kind of common, doesn't suit me and has this annoying rhyme. They're also both really short - first name is three letters and surname is five letters - something I've always hated. So I kind of have three options - change one of them, get married or get used to it. I can't see the second one happening any time soon and going with the third option is probably just going to make me miserable.

I've considered going by my middle name but I actually hate it even more than my actual name, it's a family one and a lot of my cousins have it. (My extended family is embarrassingly weird, so much so that whenever I say anything about them to my friends, they kind of just stare at me in mingled shock and horror).

Now, my first name can actually be short for a longer name, and I've kind of been going by the longer version on and off since secondary school. I really like it and I feel like it suits me a lot more than what I've got. The problem is that my mum hates it. I brought up changing it before and she refused to listen and just shut the idea down immediately. Also, my dad chose my first name. He died when I was 13 so I feel like changing it is sort of betraying him in a way? Because I can't ever ask him about it and get his consent.

It's not just that though, I kind of have bad memories about my current name too. I was bullied awfully at primary school and yeah, the way they used my name, disrespected it and looked down on it kind of impacted the way I see it.

Whenever I write my first and second name anywhere, I just feel really bad. Whenever I introduce myself to people I feel similarly awful. I'm finishing my degree this year and I feel horrible about it being on my transcript and certificate.

I might have just bee overthinking it, but her words sounded a little jumbled like when she had too much to drink, but she sounded mostly normal, so I just hung up without saying anything. I called her back, and asked if she had been drinking. She said of course not, and that she had just gotten off work, and she was gonna go home. I can always tell when shes drank too much, but I couldnt tell this time. I even saw her when I was sitting in a parking lot. She came up next to me, and started talking to me. I gave her a bunch of one word replies because I didnt want to keep listening to her, and find out that she in fact had too much to drink. I know, I should have really listened to her to find out. Especially since I knew in the past that she had drank too much, and I let her drive and vowed I wouldnt do that again. I would have definitely stopped her if I knew she drank too much, but I truley couldn't tell. I also talked to my brother that night, because he was with her right before I had talked to her. I asked him if it seemed like she had been drinking, and he said ""no, she seemed completely fine"" he knows how I feel about drink driving, so maybe he just said that so i didnt worry.

558,"Nothing to do with love or valentine's before anyone thinks that

Over the last few Fridays at college I've been slowly getting friendly with a girl in my class. I'm 20 and male for those wondering. This isn't a crush and she has a bf, I'm just wanting to make friends. However with me not having as much social experience as the average person due to my past and *slight* yet unnoticeable autism, I find it harder to make friends and actually manage to speak other than just staying silent out of unconfidence / overthinking.
People probably just don't think I'm much of a talker as I only take social interest in specific people and not everyone (I don't feel incentive to talk to a lot of people)

Today was just a normal day, we spoke a bit and that's fair enough. However unlike the other 3 times that I've spoken to her, this time I don't feel like I've significantly progressed much at all and it's really bothered me now that the college day is over. Half of the things that I think of saying just stay in my head and I miss out on opportunities to say some points or responses to some parts of conversation. Today I feel like I spoke about only half as much as I could have. To summarise previous events:

First time speaking: small talk, started to become acquainted
Second time: more small talk, getting further acquainted
Third time: becoming certified acquaintances, finding out about our interests and free time
Today: probably about as much small talk as week 2/second time. I don't feel like I've progressed

And now I'm digging myself over it and have been for at least an hour. Is this insecurity or me overthinking everything? I feel like I'm overthinking whether I come across as normal or not as I'm so used to being judged in my past due to previously being awkward

Just trying to make a female friend is very important to me and I feel that's why I'm overthinking it all. For once in my life I just want to actually succeed properly at doing this. Is it normal for me to bash myself this much after just feeling like I can do better?

But lately I’ve noticed that I keep interrupting, or rather start talking while the person I’m having a conversation with is still talking and they don’t stop (rightfully so). I dislike this habit that I’ve developed because I wasn’t like that, and have always hated being interrupted. 

I think it’s because two people I’ve been hanging out with do this too, so I’ve adopted their bad habit even though I was aware of it from the moment I met them.

Thing is, whenever I do it it feels like an impulsive need to be heard. Like subconsciously I’m thinking, *if I don’t say it now I’ll never get to say it*. And at the same time, I’m not sure of at what point the person will let me speak, so I just word vomit. 

I just stop thinking and speak over them regardless of how much I try to remind myself not to do it, you know?

When I was in high school, I was very porn addicted and fetish friendly, which I'm not shaming anyone if they are here, but given the new environment, the school girl outfits and the new faces (I come from a country where 99% of people are white), led me to develop a fetish for Asian women. Asian women were my go-to for anything sexual. Once I graduated, I started dating a Chinese girl which then ended up terribly (and this has nothing to do with my fetish I assure you), so after that I started to put my fetish into practice and soon had a body count of over 30, 25 of the women being Chinese, the other being half-Asian. Keep in mind that this was done in a matter of 2 months. I was having a lot of sex. I kept my fetish pretty tame before and during my relationship with my Chinese ex, but after we broke up and I got hurt, I started to seek the affirmation of random strangers, and I always gravitated towards Chinese/Asians. After those two months I decided to stop having sex so loosely, and I dated again. Again, with a Chinese, because after this I couldn't even see women of other races as an option. I'm straight up intimidated by women that are not white or Asian, and I see the white women the same way I would see my guy friends (and I'm straight). When I look at pictures on the internet of attractive women, I can acknowledge that the women who are not Asian are attractive, but I don't feel anything or think about them as an option in terms of dating or anything below and beyond that. When I see Asian women who are even less attractive than some other non Asian women, I still get a lot more of a thought loop and heart beat. And when I watch porn there's always an Asian woman involved. This has been the case for me for a year now, and I don't want to live like this anymore. I don't objectify the women that I'm attracted to or have some sort of kink where Asian women wear ethnic clothes, but I only gravitate towards them and I really honestly don't see Asian women as a potential option in marriage (which I want to do), due to the cultural differences. It's purely a short term thing and I want to get myself out of this loop. And honestly the fact that the women here go crazy over foreigners doesn't make it any easier. I've tried before by simply not going for Asian women, but I would always be like one last one, just one more, this is the last one etc. Sorry for the long post, and thank you so much for any advice or criticism.   


TL;DR: I've had yellow fever for a long time, but after my Chinese ex and I broke up I raised my body count where I had sex with around 25 Chinese women, and now I have a hard time finding other races attractive.

577,"My partner is about to lose his job due to sickness and other reasons that personally I would consider inappropriate. He didn’t like the job, didn’t feel like he was treated fairly and has no interest in remaining in the field in the future. Today, his employers met with him to invite him to a termination meeting where, I suppose they intend to terminate him.

The advice we need here is whether or not it will be better for him (regarding future careers) to quit effective immediately or to go through the termination process. Our fears are that being fired will hinder his job prospects in the future, however we are unsure on whether or not it is acceptable, appropriate or even allowed for him to just quit when this is the process they are trying to go through.

Please note here I’m asking for advice on whether he should stick out the process and accept termination or if he should quit beforehand, I’m not asking for advice on action against the employer for unjust termination.",14Feb2020,1
578,"I am 29 M she is 23 F

Quick thing, Im her first BF and she lost her virginity to me and she hasnt had sex with anyone else according to her even when we were on and off. 

This is what she sent me 

I honestly don't want talk about this but I just wanna say that I'm going to be honest &amp; tell you I'm not sexually attracted to you anymore. I don't want to hurt you but I also don't want to keep on faking it w you &amp; I think we need to take a step back &amp; not be with each other because it's not working. We argue all the time &amp; you give me so much anxiety &amp; it's not healthy for either of us. I don't want to keep feeling like my heart is beating out my chest &amp; like I can't breathe because you stress me out all the time &amp; I've told you I don't want to be with you.

Quick back story. I've been with her for almost 5 years on and off. We argue alot but its usually little shit that becomes big problems. Yesterday we had sex and she wasnt able to orgasm. She usually never does and relies on vibrators. I have made her cum through penetration when we first starting having sex but it stopped once we brung the vibrator into the equation. Im super duper hurt tho i really want to be with her. It sucks more that it happened the day before valentines. I keep thinking damn if we wouldn't have had sex this wouldn't have been an issue. I know i dont have penis size problems because i have gotten alot of compliments in the past. Im average nothing fancy. I believe im some what thick. I have had girls tell me it was before. The plan was for us to chill in the day time she would go out to be with her friend thats a girl and then she would come back home to me and spend the next day with me (valentines). That didn't happen of course. 

We have been arguing alot and just arguing and expressing ourselves gives her anxiety. Litterally her heart starts beating fast just because arguing gives her anxiety. We had this lock on our Instagram bio and she took it off signifying shes single. I don't know what to do. At all. I still want to be her. I love so many things about her. I texted her a few times just saying Listen i dont wanna stress you out. I understand whats on your mind. I was there when we first started going out. We have been forcing our relationship. I guess trying is not an option anymore. I do wanna speak and see u one last time so we can break it off together with a mutual understanding just for consideration for both sides. And also told her breaking up through text is childish like lets see each other and come to an agreement together and get some closure. She hasnt responded since last night. Shit hurts so much. I keep looking to see if she posts on her IG story or if she sends me a text reply. Not sure what should be my next move.",14Feb2020,1

581,"Alright, so the area I live has quite a few cats, including my own. Recently a new cat has shown up, no collar, hungry and a bit skinny. We thought she was a stray at first, but her fur is long and well-groomed, especially the tail. She sits by our doors and windows and meows loudly, doesn't hesitate to come inside if we let her.

If we give her food, she practically inhales it. She's very patient, allowing my younger sister to pick her up and cuddle her, and my younger brother (6) to pet her.

I know the obvious answer is to take her to a vet and have her scanned for a chip, but I'm worried she might be taken to a cat's home and potentially put down if she has no owner. I can't take her because my cat doesn't get on with other cats, and my dog doesn't get on with other things in general.

As I'm typing this, she's sat beside me on a towel I put her on, asleep. I check my local Facebook page often, and did see a post with a picture of her. It was someone who lives close to me, who also noticed how hungry this cat was. None of the replies were her owner, although with her good behaviour and fur quality, I doubt she's a stray.

I've never been in this situation before, and I'm basically clueless on what to do, advice would be fantastic. In the meantime, I'll keep her fed and towel her dry if she's caught in the rain, and keep one eye on FB.

It has caused many problems for me emotionally to the point where I dream of quitting everyday. I work many hours on top of my commute, so I rarely see my wife or child (wife works weekends on top of this) and this has also caused relationship problems.


Currently, I’m in maybe $60/$70k in student loan debt and sadly had to rack up my credit in order to survive school with my child. I’d love to just leave my job for a startup with my in-law that involves doing something I love, but won’t be able to survive financially. I also can’t survive this job either without putting such a large strain on my mental health and relationship, with this also being my first job (so quite difficult finding a new job with minimal experience of 3 months).

586,"I'm currently in a situation where two of my buddies want to move into a house with me for the next grad school year. One of them has been working really hard, looking at the market for a house to actually buy (his parents financing this), and he came across one we got a tour of last Friday. He seems really keen on this house, but a few red flags stood out to me: the neighboring houses are *very* close together, making the driveway so small that we would have to park in a line up the driveway. It may seem insignificant, but this stresses me out so much. The realtor said we could do a rotation system of who drives/the order of parking, but that doesn't seem feasible in real life. Furthermore, both potential roommates have girlfriends and will want to have friends over often, furthering the congestion and feeling trapped if I want to get out and run errands.

The girlfriend part plays into my next red flag. I have a hunch they're always going to be over, and in the house there are two bathrooms but only one has a shower. We will all have to be up at the same time in the morning and I feel I'm never going to have access to the bathroom. It's even connected to the master bedroom, that my friend will be taking.

Ultimately, my buddy has considered inviting me to live with him because I'm quiet, respectful, and create an environment conducive to studying. It sounded good at first moving in, but a week after visiting the house, and based on my current living situation (3 roommates but my own bathroom), I feel I'm the type of person who ideally lives better by himself. I've actually been researching single bedroom apartments and the more I do this the more I cement my feelings on living alone. I feel bad though because my buddy has invested a good amount of time and resources into this housing process and he thinks I'm at this point 100% on board. How do I break this to him in the most gentle way possible? I know inevitably there's going to be cold feelings, but I know the sooner the better.

593,"Long but please read, I'm troubled.

Okay, story time. Me and my girlfriend have been together for bit more than 5 months ( from September ). She had this group of friends consisting of 2 girls and 1 guy, 1 of the girls was her best friend and she referred to the guy as best male friend. She noticed they were acting a bit stranger and more distant to her around October and one time she found out they are talking behind her back, making fun of her, calling her all sorts of bad stuff, telling other people untrue things about her etc.. She was really hurt so she stopped being friends with them. She cried a ton, I'm talking crying every day for 2 months but at the end she said she's much happier without them and how now her life is better.

Out of the 3 people that she was friends with the 2 girls she was sure were talking behind her back ( she had evidence ) and for the dude she wasn't but he just listened to the other 2 and stopped talking to her altogether, which is to me even worse because it truly shows he didn't care about her, when she confronted him once in real life he made up some dumb reason.

Anyway my girlfriend kept telling me how happy she is now etc etc.. yet she's now trying to get back with them. She started texting the guy a few days ago and never even stopped texting the ex-best friend girl just distanced herself. Now she's making excuses to me how she doesn't even know why the guy started ignoring her and basically making excuses to herself ( and me ) about why she now started texting him ( and the girl more frequently ).

What's even worse is that she obviously wants to get back to being friends with the guy the most out of the 3 even though she talked the worst stuff about all 3 of them. I'm fearing there's maybe more to him than just their ""friendship"". After finding out I don't support her going back to these """"friend"""" abusers she started hiding the fact that she's texting him from me. She usually texts people openly in front of me when we're hanging out together but not him. When she shows me something on her phone and goes to the chat / DM feed I always see his messages unopened like an hour or so ago and then when I think about it I realize it's always aligned with the time I went to the bathroom, or she did or just in general I wasn't around. Meaning she texts him then.

Basically it seems to me like she has no backbone in this situation. I don't want her to go back to people who literally don't care about her and that made her almost end up in hospital from all the stress and crying. But it seems like she wants that, it seems like she has no backbone and would go back to them whatever they've done. What's even worse is that she seems to want to get back to being friends with the guy much more than the girls. What was once ""He's actually the worst one since I didn't even do anything to him and he stopped talking to me and trusted them"" to ""Well... I actually don't know why he did that maybe he has a reason.... he's not so bad"" to now somewhat hiding she's texting him from me.

I don't want my girlfriend to go back to something toxic just because she wants those times back. Even less do I want her hiding a male """"friend"""" from me. What do I do? I don't want to have to worry about who's she's going out with every day now and she most definitely wouldn't admit if she goes out with him because I said I don't support her going back to those toxic people.",14Feb2020,1

So I have this problem, recently I got rlly close to one of my now best friends. Shes super sweet and caring. 

One day she came out to me. She likes another girl and at that moment i didnt have feelings for her, i think.
I realised that i liked her at a sleepover with our friends. I slept in the same bed as another friend(D) but in the morning she left rlly early and said goodbye to the rest. Everyone was still sleeping and then my crush came in and slept next to me. And damn my heart skipped a beat. 

She called me during class when she had a panic attack in the toilets too, so I think she trusts me a lot. 

The thing is that I'm scared. I don't want to be too clingy and annoying. I am sure she doesn't like me back bc she likes this other girl. And everytime i see her with this girl shes close too(L) i get this jealous feeling. Should I avoid her? Should I act normal around her?

I get hope sometimes that we maybe will be together and I keep making up these stupid fantasies in my head.

They talk to me about working together for this contest and the fact I haven’t said anything to deny it is making things worse. I try to be a people pleaser and this feels like I’m going against my ideals; but if I don’t, I’ll feel worse.

614,"I want advice, because I am planning to reject a person that I have liked for a very long time, and that means a lot to me.

Here's the story:
I (M/17y) have a girl (F/17y) in my class, let's call her Paula, that I have liked for a very long time. I would say about three years or more. Over this time, I have become one of her very best (male) friends. I really, really like and appreciate her as a friend, as she is the best (female) friend I have, however I always wished we could be something more. I have, however, always managed to keep my feelings hidden. (At this point I should mention that she had been cheated on by her previous boyfriend and was quite broken over that. That happened approximately 5 months before the Prom in the following story). 

Shortly before the most recent Prom in our school, Paula and I end up holding hands one evening. Everything good so far, and I thought I was finally working myself out of the Friendzone. 

Over the summer holidays, we meet up (Our Families are close Friends) and spend a few nights together; Mind you, there was still nothing official happening between us. We end up cuddling and being in love for 3 days straight, before Paula leaves again. After this, I have the necessary confidence boost and am also sure that I have made it out of the Friendzone. Fast forward, I bring up if she had considered dating me, and get rejected via text. I end up confused but decide to leave it at that, moving back into the friendzone. 


It sounds unreal, but this pattern repeats twice more. We meet, Paula makes moves on me, I fall in love and feel i have finally made it out of the Friendzone, after 3 years. Turns out, this still is not the case and I get rejected a 2nd and 3rd time after asking her out for dinner twice. At this point, I give up and step back. I decide that it is best to get over her, as there is clearly no way of us coming together. 

About 2 months after this, Paula comes to me, telling me that she might just do have feelings for me. I was trying to get over her, but my emotional side takes over and I start talking about how I am still not over her. I stick to the topic, but, surprise, surprise, she ends up telling me the day later, that she actually does not think it is a good idea for us to be dating. 

The same night, Paula texts me if I, since there is no chance of us dating, would want to be ""Friends With Benefits"". She basically asks me to fling with her for a few times of making out, although I had confessed that I still love her, 10 minutes earlier. I reject the offer, heartbroken beacause it has just been revealed that she only cuddled and made moves on me to get me to fling with her. (This was approyimately 2 weeks ago)

Fast forward she hands me a present for Valentines Day, in which she tells me that she actually does love me and would also want to date me. I am wondering, if I was only a fling-opportunity before, why should this change suddenly? Therefore, my initial plan was, to reject her, not out of spite but because I feel that although she might be serious, I still cannot completely trust her. However, I am unsure if this is the right thing to do. She means a lot to me and I still would not want to loose her as my friend, so what should I do?

So long story short, I was dating this guy for awhile to the point where we were gonna move in together and I really thought he was the one and I loved him so much but last Valentine's Day ( a couple days before) he broke it off saying he want ready for a relationship. Now he's with someone new and I know it's not gone last because he's that type of person and he's toxic like I would never wanna get back with him but I can't help but feel sad and think about how they're celebrating together.

I like about half of what I do but don't look to persue a career in this/continue living in this town. Basically, the only reason I am thinking of staying is because I do not want to let anyone down or have anyone be upset with me.

I respect that but I wonder how a person can go through nearly a semester and a half without a single friend.

623,"To make this fair we are going to write this from a genderless POV and refer to each person as Partner A (A for short) and Partner B (B for short). 

We came here so we can get some second opinions of what should happen next because we are in a difficult position and have very different views. For some background, A and B live together in an apartment on a shared lease and are engaged and only have one car which they share but B owns. They are approximately the same height, with A being about 50 pounds bigger than B.

So here goes,
A and B were having an argument (details are irrelevant to this story) and B leaves the apartment to get away and clear their head. This takes approximately 10 minutes and B comes back and is ready to work through this argument in a healthy way. While B was gone, A was freaking out because they felt trapped because B had taken the car and they were both supposed to go to a family event that they were now late for. When B gets back, A is refusing to talk to B and B is upset by this and threatens to walk out again and for this time to walk away from the relationship for good. B tells A they need to sort this out and B does not want to put up with this in the relationship. B tells A 3 separate times ""If you let me walk out this door again I am gone for good"" and A refuses to speak or acknowledge what B is saying. B goes to move towards the door and A jumps up and blocks the door, saying ""Please dont go I'm ready to talk."" B responds with ""I gave you 3 different chances and you're too late, let me out please."" A refuses to move for B and B then threatens to call the cops because A is trapping them in the apartment. B tries to step back and call the cops and A moves forward and grabs B's arm, disabling B's ability to use their phone. They have a lengthy conversation about how B has the right to leave the apartment and A is trapping them in. The only way out of the apartment is through the front door or out onto a second story balcony. Everytime A let's go and B steps back to call the cops, A grabs them again. Everytime B tries to push towards the door, A blocks the door. B then runs to the bathroom and tries to close the door to call the cops and A follows and blocks B from being able to close the door. Now A and B are both in the bathroom with A holding the door open. A continues to move towards B and tries to grab their phone. At this point, B punches A in the face and A stumbles backwards allowing B out of the bathroom. B then heads towards the front door again and A beats them there and blocks it again. B then backs up again to pull out their phone and A grabs their arm. At this point, B elbows A in the face and A falls down bleeding from the nose. B then started grabbing paper towels to clean up and spends the next 10 minutes checking on A and starting to clean up. A eventually leaves to the bathroom to clean themselves up and B finishes cleaning the floor. The cops never ended up being called. 

As a result of being elbowed in the face, A ended up with a broken nose. The problem now is A needs surgery to fix said broken nose and A believes B should pay for the surgery because B was the one who elbowed A in the face and cause the broken nose. However, B believes that A is mostly at fault for this situation and believes they should each pay for some of the surgery, with A paying for the majority of it. 

Both A and B believe they are right in their viewpoint of who should pay. We would just really like some second opinions because we dont want to go through anything legal because neither of us want to impact the other person's life in a way so negative and severe.",14Feb2020,1

633,"I find myself typing this in a pickling situation. I tried to make it short, but I failed. Q’s &amp; TL;DR at bottom.

Some background info: I, 23F, have worked for a law firm in a legal call center for about 1.5yrs. I try so hard to do my best and prove my worth in hopes of moving up. My supervisor wrote me a glowing yearly review and has told me I’m one of her best on the team. That being said, we have special restrictions on how many people can be off/out/on vacation on any day. This is mainly to ensure adequate coverage in the department. No other department at my job has these restrictions. We cannot take floater-holidays at will. Vacations must be meticulously planned. 

Yesterday: My bf, same age, of five years has a friend that lives on the other side of our country in a really cool place to visit (sorry, for anonymity). My bf and his other friend were planning to visit him for a week towards the end of summer. I get home after work yesterday and my bf and his friend are looking at plane tickets. I was invited to join and decided to, last minute. The prices were really good, as well. All three sets of tickets were ordered together. 

Current situation: This morning at work I called my supervisor, told her that I’m going and asked for the week off. She told me to email her the dates and she would check the calendar. I have the vacation time and I’m asking six months in advance. (Potential mistake: I told her we had ordered the tickets, and she said snarkily, “do I even have a choice?”. I then mentioned that we could cancel for free within 24hrs.) She gets back to me and says that another coworker had asked for the same week off. This same coworker takes ~3wks off every year to travel and has seniority over me (grrrreat). This coworker is also incredibly passive aggressive towards me. It’s apparently her birthday week, and she apparently asked for the time off before me (which I honestly doubt) so my supervisor said no to my request. I haven’t responded to her email.

I spoke with my bf, and if he were to cancel my ticket only, he would have to cancel them all and repurchase. The same tickets went up about $100 per round trip today (not shocked). No other week in August will work for everyone, and the ticket prices for the other weeks are more expensive by hundreds of dollars. 

To me, there was a small window of opportunity, and I jumped on it. I’ve known my bfs friends as long as I’ve known him nearly. I trust them and enjoy their company. I know I may take some fault here for not checking first, but I find it ridiculous that we have these restrictions. Six months should be enough time for my supervisor to figure something out. I have been trying to escape this department for a while. I applied for a higher position, but the person in charge twisted my words and now I have a “hybrid” position that I technically asked for, but requires double the work with a small pay raise. I’ve been frustrated with this job for a while, and I think this is the last straw for me. I really don’t make a lot of money and I work myself ragged trying to do the best work I can - for an employer that couldn’t care less. 


Am I overreacting? Should I even respond to my supervisor, if so what should I say? Would this motivate a reasonable person to leave?

TL;DR: Bf, friend, and I booked a trip to visit a friend via plane, six months in advance. Supervisor denied my request for time off, because someone asked for the same week off and we “can’t have two people off for a week at once”. Obviously, this upset me as no other department at my job has any of these restrictions.",14Feb2020,1

I have been seeking a therapist for five months (ten sessions so far) and he has asked me if I had thoughts pertaining to suicide at least eight times. In all times I said no, because I did not feel that way. It made me felt uncomfortable that he was asking me that so much and I couldn't feel like I should ask him to stop because that's technically his duty and responsibility. That said, I want to move on, no go back. I ultimately decided to quit therapy because while it has helped, I didn't give me the results I expected and I still feel unsatisfied.

Then, my mom is hounding me over the fact that I am acting very apathetic about her issues and concerns despite giving her $14,000 in money over a period of five years (two of which while I was in college) and she said that if I continue to act aloof towards her, she would consider cutting me out of her life metaphorically speaking.

Then, there is my girlfriend Jessica who has been with me since freshman year in college and while cares for me, is feeling iffy because she complains that I have lost romantic interest in her after starting my antidepressant (the one I used for anxiety) called fluoxetine. She says that she still notices that I talk to her, but my interest in her has decreased dramatically ever since starting the medication.

Also, I noticed that my mood, while has become stable, I have developed lethargy (low energy), and a lack of interest after starting the antidepressant. I told the psychiatrist at the time, and she said ""I don't want to rock the boat, anxiety can also wreak havoc on your life. Side effects are the lesser of two evils in your case. You can end up in the morgue if your anxiety is unmanaged"". This was during my junior year in college.

Back in August of 2019, my PA (new prescriber) agreed with me and decided to taper me off the antidepressant. Started on 40 mg of fluoxetine, and over the span of several months, my PA finally discontinued my fluoxetine in February 3rd of 2020 and so far, I still feel the exact same way when I was on 20 mg of the medication. Now, my PA did say that it can take two to three months after stopping the med to notice improvements in side effects.

But this is problematic because I have been waiting for several months and now that I am off, I need improvements soon. But nobody can tell me when, but only assume the worse of my situation. Never been hospitalized for mental health problems, but have been dealing with anxiety since age 10.

I need help. Therapy with that male therapist wasn't as helpful as I hoped. Side effects are still there and I am starting to distrust my primary care physician. I need help on how to fix these problems please.",14Feb2020,1

644,"I can't put my thoughts in order. I know that I'm peculiar, but I've never experienced conflicting emotions like this and I don't know wtf is going on. 

So I am an incredibly private person.  I've been told I'm excessively so, but I feel like I'm protecting my own boundaries so it's never caused any problems for me. 

Just to give you an idea of my sense of privacy: if at all possible, I would strongly prefer complete anonymity. I recently moved back home for a brief stint in-between boarding school and going off to college, but when I'm not at home I generally contact my parents once every five or six months, extended family only if they happen to be around when I call my parents. I keep my circle of friends separate, most people in my life are acquaintances at best, and I am fully comfortable with admitting that I'm a liar. I will tell people that I don't want to tell them that once or twice, and after that I will resort to lies to keep a sense of social peace. If they ask if I'm telling the truth though, I will tell them I'm not. This has cost me friendships so to speak, but again, I've never particularly cared. 

I'm working towards moving to a place where no one knows me. I'm incredibly looking forward to this, and I know that when I'm in uni I finally won't need to be around people as much as I am now and was during boarding school. 

I have asked my immediate family to uphold my usual level of privacy when I'm with them. This means no conversations about me, with no one except those who they are 100% sure of already know of whatever they want to chat about. I.E. they're free to talk with my grandparents about my being home, going off to study etc, because I have told my grandparents myself, but if they were to run into a colleague or something to not go beyond ""she's home rn"" and to not give away any details of my life or current events. 

My parents told me they cannot promise this, so I told them that if they can't, they can either choose to listen to my saying I won't tell them this, or agree to being lied to if that would make them more comfortable. Both chose for the first option, so except for my sister I will start keeping everything I wouldn't want them blabbing about to others from my family. 

I feel strangely conflicted though, as I am otherwise close to my parents for as far as the situation would allow. I don't understand why they won't just shut up about me to other people. I would hate to ruin my relationship with my parents, as they are one of the very few people I am truly comfortable around. They told me they can't explain it if I don't get why, so reddit, please help me understand. Am I the one asking too much here?",14Feb2020,1
645,"Hi everyone, I am a young single female (20) considering adoption. I am currently a college student who plans to enroll in school full time. However, a niece of mine is not currently being cared for. I know that she was previously raised in a home much worse than her current one. I don't live in the same state as her currently, so I have only had the chance to visit and learn a majority of my information from social media and sources back home, but even with that being the case, over the past few years have witnessed some physical abuse as well as emotional and verbal abuse by her current caregivers. Even though her life has been hard, she is still a happy loving child. I just fear as her aunt that soon, she will lose her spark and positive outlook on life. I know that I could provide a more loving/ supportive environment for her, but because I am still so young and going to school I don't think people would take me seriously if I said I wanted to take her in. So I come here to ask if I should put my life on the backburner to give this child the care she desperately needs? Or should I leave her where she's at and just try to be an aunt that she can talk to/ confide in?",14Feb2020,1
646,"i’m planning on skipping my last class of the day (i’m a senior in high school). we’re not doing much in that class, just finishing watching a documentary. i haven’t skipped any classes since this semester started.

i feel like absolute shit and have been crying and on the verge of a breakdown all morning. my mom won’t dismiss me, so i’m just leaving the school. should i email my guidance counselor or the teacher? or just leave and deal with the repercussions on monday? 

usually when you skip an administrator will pull you from class for like five minutes and ask why you skipped and where you were. last semester i skipped a few times and i would just explain that i was really anxious and just get a warning, but i’m not sure if there’s a better way to approach this situation.

I cant lie because my dad has been emotionally abusive to us and now this?!? She said she never meets and now whenever she chats to this dude she always clears the chat.

652,"This is a long and complex problem, and I really hope that I can fix this because this is really getting to me mentally and I feel like I have to accept the fact that I will have a miserable life for the rest of my life and that I should stay alive and feel crappy.

I have been seeking a therapist for five months (ten sessions so far) and he has asked me if I had thoughts pertaining to suicide at least eight times. In all times I said no, because I did not feel that way. It made me felt uncomfortable that he was asking me that so much and I couldn't feel like I should ask him to stop because that's technically his duty and responsibility. That said, I want to move on, no go back. I ultimately decided to quit therapy because while it has helped, I didn't give me the results I expected and I still feel unsatisfied.

Then, my mom is hounding me over the fact that I am acting very apathetic about her issues and concerns despite giving her $14,000 in money over a period of five years (two of which while I was in college) and she said that if I continue to act aloof towards her, she would consider cutting me out of her life metaphorically speaking.

Then, there is my girlfriend Jessica who has been with me since freshman year in college and while cares for me, is feeling iffy because she complains that I have lost romantic interest in her after starting my antidepressant (the one I used for anxiety) called fluoxetine. She says that she still notices that I talk to her, but my interest in her has decreased dramatically ever since starting the medication.

Also, I noticed that my mood, while has become stable, I have developed lethargy (low energy), and a lack of interest after starting the antidepressant. I told the psychiatrist at the time, and she said ""I don't want to rock the boat, anxiety can also wreak havoc on your life. Side effects are the lesser of two evils in your case. You can end up in the morgue if your anxiety is unmanaged"". This was during my junior year in college.

Back in August of 2019, my PA (new prescriber) agreed with me and decided to taper me off the antidepressant. Started on 40 mg of fluoxetine, and over the span of several months, my PA finally discontinued my fluoxetine in February 3rd of 2020 and so far, I still feel the exact same way when I was on 20 mg of the medication. Now, my PA did say that it can take two to three months after stopping the med to notice improvements in side effects.

But this is problematic because I have been waiting for several months and now that I am off, I need improvements soon. But nobody can tell me when, but only assume the worse of my situation. Never been hospitalized for mental health problems, but have been dealing with anxiety since age 10.

I need help. Therapy with that male therapist wasn't as helpful as I hoped. Side effects are still there and I am starting to distrust my primary care physician. I need help on how to fix these problems please.",14Feb2020,1

656,"So I dated my girlfriend for four months before I broke up with her on account of stuff that she was doing that was harmful to me emotionally (not intentionally on her part) and I lost the passion for the relationship/her. 

Currently, we are locked in a lease in a house on campus, and will not be able to move our separate ways until the school year ends. We did end up doing a friends with benefits thing, which ended up (in my opinion) harming our friendship and her emotions, so I cut that off as well, even through her protests. 

I would like to stay friends, or at least amiable, since we do live in the same house. But it's no joke that we've drifted apart due to post-relationship arguments and disagreements (which is often about stuff that happened in our relationship that ended *months* ago at this point). 

Right now I'm in the situation where she continues to try and push a friends with benefits relationship, and keeps trying to cuddle up to me. Sometimes I let it happen because I don't want to deal with her trying to fight with me if I say no, especially since we're still living in the same house and she constantly pushes it. 

Anyways, this is all background for a new issue. She keeps trying to cuddle and sleep with me. I got home late last night after hanging with friends and went to my bedroom to go to sleep. I was tired. She tries to climb in bed and cuddle/talk because shes tipsy. She's a ""little sad"" but ""it's okay"". Sigh. I've been through this too many times to count. Most of the time she's sad because of things that happened in our past relationship. Anyways, I'm tired. I keep stating this, and how I'm trying to go to bed. She keeps talking for half an hour. Finally she just falls asleep in my bed, which I explicitly told her not to do, and to go back to her own room. I'm like fine, okay. At least it's quiet, I can go to sleep. 

She fucking started sleep-talking. So at this point, it's 3:30 am, and I have an 8:30 the next day, and she already annoyed me for half an hour after I told her I didn't want to talk. I wake her up and tell her to leave my room and go sleep somewhere else (maybe a little rudely, but I'm pissed off at this point). At this point she starts BAWLING. 

She then apologizes profusely for sleep-talking, as if that was the major issue. But then she says ""I just needed somebody because I tried to hurt myself the past few days"". As if I knew that. ""A little sad"" does not translate into that. I told her that I can't read minds. She keeps insisting, restating this, trying to sleep in my bed with me or make me stay up and talk. Again, I am pissed off. I'm empathetic, but I deal with my own shit too, and I'm tired and I don't have the mental capacity to help her. I told her I'll gladly listen to her tomorrow. She climbs in bed anyways, cuddling up to me for another half an hour, before she finally leaves for the night.

I am trying to be her friend, but as an ex I feel like I shouldn't be the one shouldering this. She has a few close friends and a dad who is more than willing to help her. She also has a psychiatrist and psychologist who she says ""don't help her"", and she refuses to look into other psychologists because she says none of them have been able to help. But if they cant, how can I? 

Maybe I'm just being a dick but I'm already depressed as it is, and I don't think I should shoulder this personally. Especially in the situation we're in, I feel like it's too intimate for our friendship. But she feels like I can help her, even though I don't think I really can.

What should I do in this kind of situation? Should I notify her dad or somebody? I want her to be safe but I don't know what I can do for her, and her talking about it to me just makes me more depressed.",14Feb2020,1
658,"So, a few months back my mom asked if I wanted to go on a missions trip (I'm 17, if it makes a difference). I told her it's not something I'm interested in. She kept pushing for it and I kept telling her no. One day her and a mom of my friend both confronted me about it saying it would be good and my friend is also going on it. I felt uncomfortable telling both of them no in the moment so I reluctantly agreed. After that meeting, though, I told my mom again I still didn't want to go. 

She kept pushing me and made me sign up and go to the meetings, despite my continued insistence I'm very uncomfortable with the idea. Apparently one of her Facebook friends donated a lot of money for me to go. I have multiple reasons for really not wanting to. 

Mainly, my anxiety has been really difficult to handle lately. I just started medication and therapy for it but it still is really hard and I don't know how it's going to act when I'm thousands of miles away. Maybe it will be fine, but at the same time it's not really a risk I want to take when I've had some really difficult and scary moments even in low stakes situations. The medication also might have side effects I'm unaware of since I just started it today. 

I'm also not a religious person, I don't know what I believe at all and being around that environment where everybody assumes i am just makes me uneasy. 

To add to this I'm sick right now. It's getting marginally better as the week goes on but I just have been feeling fevery, sore throat, coughing, congested, all that stuff. It's probably nothing serious but I do have an IGA deficiency and it's likely that this is only going to get worse if I go. 

At the same time I feel really awful because my friend is going on the trip and he thought I was going. I'm the only friend he has on the trip and even though we're not super close or anything I feel really terrible leaving him there. I don't know if he'll be frustrated or the friendship will be affected if I don't go. I also know somebody donated money that isn't refundable. 

I talked with a close friend and my dad about it, and they both know me and what I've been going through really well. They both agreed that it probably wasn't a good idea for me to go on the trip and I wouldn't really be able to get anything out of it, or just be miserable. 

I feel conflicted. I'm frustrated because I feel like nobody ever listened to me and kept pushing me until I ended up here, and everything has just been really difficult lately and I feel like the trip is just going to exacerbate all of those symptoms. 

At the same time, I feel terrible about my friend and about the money. I don't know what to do and I'd love to hear any advice about the situation. Thank you.",14Feb2020,1

See, today is Valentine's Day. We've made plans to grab food and kick it at her place, but upon waking up this morning, something crossed my mind. It's not the first time this thought has popped up, but now it's getting to me. When the relationship had first started, I was excited because I genuinely felt love for her. I wanted to rejoice and tell everyone how great I was feeling. I felt my life change as she entered it. However, time passed and we slowly got comfortable in the relationship. The spark was still there, or I like to believe at least. She tells me she still loves me, but now, I can start to feel the distance. We're drifting away from each other, gradually. It's something I dreaded when we had first started going out--and now that it's a real thing that's happening, I don't know what to do. My feelings are fading for her, but I'm not sure if her feelings are fading for me--that's how it seems on the outside.

661,"TL;DR - Undiagnosed chest pains for 8 years since I was 13. Have already used my sick days when I had the flu real bad earlier this year. Can't work while experiencing these chest pains. Can't lose my job. Have already received a verbal warning and will probably receive a written for missing yesterday. Have scheduled an appointment with my family doc for next week. 

&amp;#x200B;

A little back story. 

I've had undiagnosed chest pains dating back to 2012 when I was 13. I've had ECG's, Ultrasounds, MRI's, have spoken to a dietician, and nothing has helped. One doctor in particular back in 2014 ruled that it was just stress, but gave me no path to follow to resolve it, which left me feeling frustrated, ironically causing another chest pain attack. 

For the most part since then I've tried to just deal with it. 2019 was a great year, I maybe only got it once or twice, lasting for only hours at a time. But coming into 2020 I've been getting it very frequently. The last 3 days I've had it none stop, and it's the worst it's been in years.  While I didn't believe that the issue was caused by stress, it is certainly aggravated by it. I work at a call center, which means the stress levels can be high. When I have a customer on the line who is bitching at me, it feels like something in my chest is going to burst. Yesterday I called in sick, and today I'm debating doing the same. 

The thing is, however, is that I've already used all of the sick days that are allotted to me by the provincial government, and I have already received a verbal warning because of this, and will most likely be written up for missing yesterday. I have no idea what to do. I've scheduled an appointment with my family doctor for next Thursday, but I can't work while experiencing this, and I can't lose my job. On Wednesday when I was at work, I ended up taking 6 extra strength Tylenol through out my shift, which was only helping for a couple of hours at a time, and it only made it bearable.",14Feb2020,1

I can't go to a therapist anytime soon, so if you guys could give me some advice on this problem I would really appreciate it.

I am absolutely obsessed, like crazy obsessed with looks and attractiveness. I spend actual hours thinking about how to become pretty and looking at my face in the mirror and wanting to be prettier. 

The worst part is I am not even ugly. I am not deformed in any way, and I know many people wish they looked like me. This sounds arrogant and stuck up to say, but I'm sorry. The cognitive dissonance between other people saying that and me looking in the mirror at school is getting to me.

Sometimes I think I'm very attractive and I feel very confident, but then I look at a candid picture or in the mirrors at school and it makes me want to literally kill myself. I have no idea how attractive or unattractive I am. I keep looking for validation from boys and other people.

A year ago, I would have killed to look like the way I do now. Now, I want to look better. If I isolate myself from other girls, I won't feel like this way anymore. I know this for a fact because over the summer I had great self esteem, but the moment I return to school and I see certain girls that I am incredibly jealous of and I feel horrible.

This is exhausting to me, and it is exhausting to anyone who wants to talk to me. My personality is deteriorating because of my rampant insecurity and it's fucking me over. It's making me think in fucked up ways. Even girls who I always loved to hang out with and people I loved are just seeming like people I can compare myself to. I feel horrible for thinking this way. I know exactly how detrimental this is. 

When I used to be incredibly ugly I used to think 'i just want to look lowkey cute'. Now I have that and a bit more and even some guys are attracted to me and I am still ungrateful.

Anytime someone says another girl is pretty I feel jealous. I am jealous of everyone and everything and it's becoming horrible. Please help. Please give me some advice on how to fix this obsession. I want to develop a true personality unrelated to how attractive or unattractive I am.",14Feb2020,1

She then got really mad at me and slapped me, very hard that my cheeks started to get red. Then she continued to say that I won’t reach the gates of heaven when it’s armageddon and I will burn and rot in hell for talking back at her which I clearly did not. I was so shocked that she could say that to her own child. After that, she would often say that I would burn in hell every time she is scolding me. She tried to reason out that she was just saying that to help me get to heaven and not rot in hell. But it still didn’t quite sit well with me. There was also a time where she got really upset with something I did that I just stretched out my arm for her to hit it since she said i need it for me to get disciplined.

676,"I don’t really know where to start. I’m 25. I am a pathological liar, I sit around playing video games all day, I order food to my apartment because I’m too lazy to cook, and I occasionally show up to work. I quit a job that provided for me well enough to go back to school on my parents' dime. I’ve been dependent on my parents for the last year and a half while living in an apartment with roommates. I went back to school and dropped out almost immediately and consistently lied to my parents because they were giving me money for every living expense I had, as well as money for classes. I even forged unofficial transcripts to convince them I had actually been attending college. I started a job several months ago after finally telling my parents that I wouldn’t be finishing my degree because I had to focus on going back to work and being more independent. During that time and up until now due to a flexible working schedule I simply didn’t go into work most of the time, was consistently late on rent and had to ask my parents for even more money, I also stopped making car payments entirely. In the past year or so I have built up $13,000 in credit card debt that is now in collections, and I emptied my measly 401k. My car was repossessed yesterday and my lender is asking for a full payment of $17,000 to get the car back. I know the only option is to go to my parents and ask them to pay it, with the intention of them selling it to  recuperate the money they’ve lost as if it goes to auction it won’t sell for near the value of the car, and I won’t be able to pay back their original $10,000 they lent me as a down payment. I can’t go to work without the car so I’ll need to find a new job within walking distance. I most definitely won’t be able to make rent this month and I don’t know how to explain this to my roommates, one of whom is the closest thing to a best friend I’ve had for years, but I consistently ignore. I have taken advantage of my parents who provided me with every possible opportunity to succeed. I have basically lost every friend I have because I would rather sit in a dark room playing video games, laying in bed looking at memes, or sleeping than doing literally anything else. I’m a lazy dishonest POS that doesn’t deserve or expect sympathy or forgiveness. I need to get my shit together, but every time I start I just stop caring. I lack any motivation to succeed at anything, and am more than content to just go on existing, not that anyone would or should miss me if I were gone. I’m meeting with my father tomorrow to tell him about the car, and I don’t know how to approach it. I don’t plan on asking forgiveness and accept responsibility for my behavior, but I believe the best course of action is for my parents to cut me out of their and my siblings lives.

Then yesterday we sit down to order something for her and my mom starts getting mad at me. “I can’t believe I am getting this for her I don’t think you should even get her something just give her a card and send it to her” She said, I’m like great I should have just heard this 3 days ago because I could have gotten her something. So we ended up getting nothing got into a big argument. Today my girlfriend who is in college, I didn’t get her anything I feel so guilty I should have never told my mom I am leaving the house to get her something. I should have just went to get something for her and sent it to her because it would be better than nothing at all like it is right now. I really thought my mom would get her something special she would like but instead my mom ended up getting mad at me and we got nothing no even a flower for her. I just sent her a long message today saying how much I love her but aside from that there is nothing at all for her. I feel guilty because I could just said no mom I want to get this myself instead of listened to her and got an argument and nothing else.",14Feb2020,1

684,"I had two pet budgies when I was 9 years old, but it didn't end up pretty well. I bought them from a stall in my local square with a pack of seeds, a bad and small cage and little to no accurate information either on the internet (because I was too young to do accurate research) or by the person that sold them to me. Long story short I started to develop depression when I was eleven and lost both of them starving them to death because I couldn't care for them anymore. It hurts me so much to this day, expecially because I deeply bonded with one of them and the more time passes by the more I realize how much we loved each other and what an horrible thing I did to them and myself just because I didn't have the strength to care neither for them or myself. My parents are aware of the fact that I starved them and told me that while I live in their house I shall never get another pet again. I am now 17, I feel way more responsible since I am able to care for myself and deal with my disorder without having too many issues. I managed to convince them to get me a goldfish so that I could at least try and see if any pet could fill that hole in my heart, but to no avail. I am not asking for a cockatoo or a macaw, I just want a small parrot to bond with again like I did with that little guy...

\&gt;Girl I know from highschool comes down because of work

\&gt;We drink and one thing lead to the other, we had sex

\&gt;Next day, girls telling me she wants to be in a relationship (I guess I was confused because most times I have sex with someone with no romance I just think of it as sex, one night stand, etc and move on to the next)

\&gt; Girls very into me, she wants to come down to my area to visit more, and she wants something serious

\&gt;Girl I know from high school comes down because of work (I guess I was confused because most times I have sex with someone with no romance I just think of it as sex, one-night stand, etc and move on to the next) she has a good career (makes from 1.5 to 2K a week from her business), has a cute face, and a good personality. We are also the same age which is 29. I don't fat shame, but ive always been the one to push my friends and family to get healthy, so I kind of feel weird about telling my family about her if anything, only cause im still trying to feel this relationship out but I don't want to play her either so when the next day happened I kind of just felt like telling her I wasn't for it, but a part of me told me to just try it out and see what happens. The first week in this relationship she starts going to yoga twice a week, meal prepping high protein meals and getting rid of (beer, soda, candy, chips, etc), eating healthy, fasting, and trying to get it together, in two weeks she dropped 8 lbs. She does ask me for advice on meals and works outs and wants to drop down to 150lbs. Idk how I feel about this, a part of me was wanting to let this go because I wasn't interested because she never took care of herself (never ate right, went to drink, never slept right, etc) and yet I guess the man in me just thought of this as a one night fling, but its like right when she got into a relationship she all of sudden wants to try and be healthy, impart because I'm healthy. I went through old photos of her in high school and she was always a babe (was in cheerleading, played soccer, volleyball, and softball) and to me looked like a 10/10. But I guess a part of me feels like Id probably get laughed at by my family and friends if they knew I was with her… So I just don’t know how I feel about it, and also because I'm, not 100% sure if I'm into her since I've always been the jock to just go out and fuck girls in high school, not really just do relationships. I was also a prior SEAL in the navy and right now I'm trying to finish my MD program, so with the stress of that, I haven’t really been too sure. I just feel like if I break it off she's going to just give up on losing weight and lose it. Another part of me tells me to just play it by ear and see where it goes. What does anon think of what I should consider doing? I've been in relationships, longest 4 years, but they’ve always started naturally with romance, sex always came later, I just don’t know if its right sometimes only because I feel it can be hard to get through school when you are in a relationship….",14Feb2020,1

TLDR: guy who seems really into me suggests we should date again (I agree) then seems to ghost me?

So without getting into much detail, 

A guy I used to see texted me again after a 4 month hiatus to see how I’m doing, this shocked me as I thought we’d never speak again. We talked about how much we liked each other in the short amount of time we were dating and how he’d think about me all the time and I would too. he’s was a sweet guy. We agree we want to try again (he suggested this mind you) and plan a date this valentines day and he tells me we should text thru the week and figure out what we should do. 

I was excited, I’ve never felt this way about someone. A few days go by....crickets, no good morning, no hey how are you, nothing,,, I shrug it off, and I text him hey, he responds and we banter a little but still don’t decide where or what time to go on our date. 

Thursday evening rolls around and still, nothing. Now I’m worried. I just say “hey still on for tomorrow?” and follow up hours later to ask if everything is ok.

It’s today now and still nothing. What gives??",14Feb2020,1
691,"I am a 16 year old asian dude living abroad for four years now. I have some very traditional asian parents and to be honest up until a few months ago they were fairly reasonable. However, in the recent few months I have noticed how easily provokable they are. I know that they are going through lots of pressure from what they told me (1. they don't speak the country's language 2. they feel like they are lonely and isolated from the society) , and I think that the fact that they have pressure is fine. However, I believe that they shouldn't take out all their pressure onto me. 

Being traditionally asian, my parents have very, very high expectations for me. They expect me to be enrolled into either the Ivy League or one of the top universities in the US (top 30 ish) and are doing everything they can to help me reach that goal. I appreciate their effort to bring out the best in me, however, some times it gets unbearably toxic and I don't know what else to do. For example, I have been a high honour student for two years straight (I don't know what the ABCD scale is I have a 6.5 in IB). My parents simply think that my high honour is simply not enough and ""below average"". When I try to back myself up and corroborate myself with evidence to show that I am actually decent, my parents will tell me how they've went through hell and are basically dying/suffering everyday that they are abroad just to get me a good education.

Every time they bring the big ""we have the moral high ground we raised you and we went through hell to give you a good education"" talk, I feel attacked, as I did not choose to go abroad or study to be enrolled into a top university. I may not understand their pressure here, but I certainly believe that they shouldn't use their own problems to justify their actions and behaviours on me. At this point, it most certainly feels like I am being compared by my parents to a perfect ""self"" that doesn't exist, and if I don't transform into my perfect self, they will guilt trip me and tell me how they've went to hell to give me education.

694,"We had an exam on Tuesday and while taking it, I felt like the questions were different than what I had anticipated. There were questions pertaining to what our professor had given lectures over towards the beginning, but then they went into more detail than he had and didn't go into the more recent material he had covered. I had read some differing opinions on this professor online, so I didn't know what to really expect going into the exam.

Then on Thursday, he handed out the test sheets (not our scantrons) and I saw that it was definitely different material than what was on the test he had handed me on Tuesday. After sitting through the review (I didn't want to interrupt him and I also wasn't 100% sure if there were different versions or something) I came to him after class and told him how the test we had reviewed was definitely not the one he had given me to take. He was baffled and apparently had wondered why there was an extra test in the stack and concluded he must have guessed wrong on the class size, but at the same time, had no idea where the test I had taken came from because he didn't even teach the class for the exam I took.

He told me he would try to think of a solution over the weekend for how to handle this and encouraged me to give my own suggestions if I had them. For now, my test grade is in as a 16. I had an idea of proposing an essay over the course material to try and make up for him giving me the wrong exam. Any other ideas?

tldr; Professor gave me the wrong exam and is asking for ideas on how to fix the mistake. I cannot take the correct exam as the review has already been given. Need ideas.",14Feb2020,1

My dad has me applying to universities in our state and is under the impression that I’ll be living here until I get my bachelor’s degree, at least.  He wants me to attend the same university that he did, and he talks to me about my life plans often. Little does he know, the “plans” I’ve told him about are completely fabricated, and in reality, I’m moving to England in September.

We’ve already been looking into apartments in his area. He will be attending university and working part time, and I’ll be taking online courses in business and working full time.

I’m already a bit of a disappointment to him, and I know telling him that I’m both gay, and moving to England to get married in eight months will just make it worse.

699,"I'm a freshman in college, and I matched with my roommate back in july. I thought it was going to be great, because we had a lot in common and played videogames with each other over the summer before moving in together. However, as soon as we moved into our dorm, he started responding to everything I said with extreme condescension, and he would seem utterly disinterested in anything I had to say, despite also wanting to tell me things at other times.

For a while I didn't feel comfortable in my own dorm so I would spend all of my time at the library, except for sleeping. I'm talking, like, 4-6 hours each day in the library. Eventually I realized that it wasn't sustainable so I finally started spending more time in my dorm.

Since December, I feel as though my mental health has been deteriorating. Two days ago I had kind of a breakdown, and later that night he kept cutting me off with ""I know"" when I was trying to explain something to both him and one of my friends (even if he knew, which he didn't because he *was the one to ask the question*, my friend also didn't know and seemed interested in hearing the answer). I had to leave that group hang out and go back to my dorm and just cool off.

Yesterday, I realized that I hadn't eaten in a while so I was looking at the menu for a local pizza place. I was surprised to see that their single slices were absolutely massive and very cheap for the size. He came into the dorm, and since I knew he had gotten pizza from this place before, I asked him if what I was reading was true. He said ""Yeah, well they're really big slices."" But the way he said it was as if I was the dumbest person on earth, as if I should have already known that. The inflection in his voice was such that I was stupid for not knowing how big they were. I can't describe it over text. I responded with ""okay... I was just asking."" Then he said ""Jesus christ I can never say anything to you without you acting like that,"" and I said ""that's because you say everything condescendingly."" He then said ""Yeah, okay. whatever."" Then he said something else, which I can't remember, and I just fucking lost it. I screamed, loudly, ""THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE A FUCKING ASSHOLE."" He kind of freaked out and said something along the lines of ""Jesus christ, man! Jesus christ. It's a fucking piece of pizza!""

I just grabbed my things, my coat, and my scarf and left my dorm. This was around 11pm. I was shaking and panicking and just broke down crying a few minutes later on the sidewalk, then talked to a friend for a while. I didn't return to my dorm until 2:30 am. I woke up before him and went to class, and just got back around 15 mins ago. I started writing this before anything had been said between us, but just before he left he said ""bless you"" after I sneezed and asked if I wanted the blinds up.

Do I do anything? Do I just act like it never happened? Do I no longer interact with him? I don't know what to do. We share a few friends, but he's closer to many of them than I am (because I would typically avoid hanging out with them when he was there).

 \-It's misspelled. (Yes, my parents are not very bright.)

\-It's not a common name. (Besides being foreign and misspelled, it's the most inconvenient and least used.)

Okay. So, my entire life, my stepmother has been a mean, angry, and (most likely) mentally abusive person. And it got worse for a while, but has lessened again all after my dad became disabled. His disability makes it painful to do anything, so he tends to lie down and just stare up at the ceiling since he cant really do much else.

This makes him a prime target for my stepmother whenever she's in a bad mood.

My stepmother is a teacher that also has the idea that her way is the best way. Any other way ticks her off mostly, as she has a super short fuse.

Whenever she is stressed, she will get angry at the smallest and stupidest of things. (Last valentine's day she threw flowers that my dad had gotten her on to the ground for some really stupid reason, or she gets angry if me and dad get something and we didn't ask her if she wanted some, but always refuses anyways even when we do ask her. Meaning anything we get we have to get rid if before we go home so she doesn't flip)

When she gets angry, she starts yelling at the closest person or whoever screwed up slightly. Which is usually me or my dad, since we live with her.

While angry, she will consistently come up with bs things to say you did, or she will twist your words and tone of voice. (Such as saying you're yelling and she isnt when it's the opposite) and she will occasionally subtlety insult you when she isnt angry, and then say that wasnt what it was.

She isnt physically abusive, which I'd good. But from what I've heard she used to be. (Which I honestly don't know if I should believe that, since it's been told to me by other people who hate her, but also I don't have any reason to doubt them)

Because of her, I don't want to even go to my dad's house (btw, my parent have split custody... mostly) I do enjoy spending time with my dad, but she's convinced my dad to make so many rules that are incredibly annoying.

Such as I cant have my phone up in my room. (Which is a phone they didn't buy btw) and all electronic devices have to be out in their room at night, anything with any internet isnt allowed up there. Why? ""Because I'm a boy and cant be trusted to not do anything.""  Yeah.

Did I mention both of then are religious? Yeah, this has also caused me problems. Specially since I told them i no longer believed in their church. They didn't flip out, but both my dad and my stepmother bother me about it. My stepmother a whole lot more than my dad though.

My family that doesn't associate with them anymore consistently tells me that if I want to stay with them, I can.

But the problem is, I can never get myself to finally just go with it. 

I would like to mention, my dad is a great guy. He is really nice, and is a lot more laid back with the rules, and the most he does to try to push his religion on me is mention god and blessing and such in sentences sometimes, and he doesn't even force me to go to church if I muster the courage to ask him to let me not go. He is literally a great dad, but he's kinda ruined a lot by my stepmother.

I would like to mention, because of my stepmother I've become a perfectionist, and also made me unassertive and unable to get myself to ask someone for an escape or help.

This also has absolutely destroyed my ability in school.

I used to do great well, but once I got to the parts where I couldn't finish assignments, I stopped turning them in because I couldn't get myself to turn in something incomplete. This resulted in me never learning or improving.

She would also make me do every question on every assignment, even if the teacher said we skip some, and she would make me do questions on assignments that were finished and graded just because.

Because of all this, my ability in school has fallen and I hate it. Not to mention I'm an absolute loner, meaning I don't have anything to look forward to at school. And if I need to go to my dad's house, as well as school, it tends to out me in a depressive mood.

My stepmother has absolutely ruined me as a person. She may be a good person at times, but that doesn't excuse anything.

My problem now is, I have the option to escape it all, but I'm afraid for a few reasons. 1. My dad has told me that I'm his only reason that he keeps on going. 2. I'm unable to ask for help. I have such difficulty asking for help from the people who CAN help. 3. I feel that if I left, and didn't come back, it would hurt my dad a lot. Specially since he's had 2 other kids do the same.


I honestly don't know what to do. I have an option to get away from her, but I would also have to stay away from my dad, and also accept that he may... give up...

My family other than my dad and my stepmother encourage me to get away, and tend to comment on my mental health.

I might delete this post eventually, since I'll probably regret this, but yeah.

718,"Throwaway  because he knows my main. 

My boyfriend and I started  seeing each other almost 4 months ago and had the conversation about  using the words boyfriend/girlfriend about a month ago but we consider  the 4 months to be the actual length of our relationship.

Now  we didn't discuss getting each other gifts but this is the first  Valentine's Day where I have someone to celebrate with and he recently  got a job after 5 months of being unemployed. On the day he found out he  got the job, I got him two items from Etsy because he is a biiiiig fan  of LOTR (it is two wine glasses with the one ring inscription on them,  and a card with Gollum's face and the text ""you're my precious""). They  both took a while to deliver to me in Canada so it coincided with  Valentine's Day. The reason I'm overthinking whether I should give them  to him is because I don't think he got me anything and because we didn't  discuss gifts, I don't want to make him uncomfortable with this.

I  was abroad for Christmas. For his birthday I just took him out for a  nice dinner, so this is the first occasion where we've been confronted  with the possibility of gift exchanging so I don't know what to expect  with regards to his thoughts on gift receiving. We haven't been dating  for very long so I don't know if this is too much for Valentine's Day.

I'm  thinking perhaps holding onto the wine glasses and giving them to him  for another occasion down the road and only giving him the card? Or  should I just give both to him? I just don't want him to feel guilty or  uncomfortable for not getting me anything.

TLDR: don't know if my gift of two LOTR themed wine glasses and a card is too much for our first Valentine's Day.",14Feb2020,1

720,"I recently transitioned from living in a large city and waiting tables to going to back to school in a small town (I’m in the U.S.) While before I used to stay up late, smoke weed, drink some and sleep in - had an erratic sleep, eating, and exercise schedule, I’ve been doing the opposite for the past month. I eat pretty healthy 3 meals a day plus some. I’m active, I’ve been taking weight training and exercise 3-4 times a week for about an hour. I walk everywhere. I get between 7-8 hours of sleep every night. I have maybe one beer after dinner sometimes none. Also about 2 cups of coffee a day.

723,"I don't have a lot of time on my hands so I want to get straight to the point: 

I have been engaged for 2.5 years to my fiance who I've been with for almost 7 years now. I feel like my love for him is genuine, true, and unconditional. Details aside, it has not always been that way and for the majority of our relationship my love for him was very conditional and limited. However, in the past few years things have changed and I've changed a lot and I've realized my horrible mistakes and began to truly love him for who he is. We have had a rough relationship and to be honest I have put him through A LOT and I owe him my life...he is one of the only people in my entire life (including family) if not THE only, person that actually loves me for me. However, lately he has been treating me very poorly and calling me stupid, worthless, a bitch, and an idiot. Now, I don't want to depict him as a bad person and I don't want to paint just one side of the story, these things only come out during arguments and fights. Whether he is right or wrong in the dispute, the things he says to me hurt me extremely bad and affect me much more than he knows. I do want to admit that sometimes I lash out back and retaliate with similar insults, but I feel like he does it more often than I do and I feel like the root of our arguments begin with him and happen because he gets upset or angry at me for controversial things. I do tell him that I don't like the way he talks to me, I do tell him that I don't want him to talk to me like that and I do threaten to leave if he continues this behavior, but he usually just ignores it or says that I'm trying to victimize myself and make my life look so sad. It's so frustrating because when I ignore him and clap back with ""idgaf"" or ""fuck you i'll leave"" he calls me a bitch who doesn't love him and when I break down and try to cry myself to sleep he antagonizes me and says ""look at you trying to be such a victim"" ...I can't respond WITH ANYTHING because either end of the spectrum results in a different insult or accusation!   


I feel like if i were to talk to him and tell him that the way he is treating me is making me fall out of love with him, he would put it on me and say that I'm trying to make him out to be a horrible angry person and that I'm trying to trick myself into believing that this is all his fault when it's actually mine. He would accuse me of still not loving him the right way and he would say that my love was NEVER unconditional. This frustrates me so much because I have addressed the past and apologized and admitted to not genuinely loving him the right way. I have apologized time and time again and tried to make up for my actions in the past. This invalidates all of my efforts and my progress. 

I don't actually think I'm falling OUT of love with him, but I do have moments when things are fine that I lack enthusiasm for being around him or being able to spend some time together. This also bleeds into our intimate life and I find myself lacking passion for him sometimes because we just argued the day before and he called me something that hurt my feelings and it just kind of blew over after I left and came back from work.

Don't get me wrong though, I DO still stand by ""I love him unconditionally and I do still want to marry him"" but I can't lie and say that I never get the desire to just grab my stuff and leave. 

I'm so desperate for a solution and I'm so desperate for a change, but I don't know what to do anymore.

728,"For a little backstory, I’m a 22 year old man. In middle school, I “dated” two girls that I thought were cute. In high school and college, I met a few girls (around 15) who were interested in me. We became friends, but when each of them started dropping hints that they wanted to date, I started being an asshole to them and became very distant until we just stopped talking completely. 

With the girls I “dated” in middle school, I had zero motivation to do anything after we actually labeled it as “dating.” I didn’t want to put all the work in to text them all the time, get them gifts, flirt with them all the time, or go out with them on dates or group events. 

Since “dating” both of them, I’ve had no interest in putting all of the work in for a relationship. I’m still interested in girls - I think they’re attractive, I enjoy being around them, and I think I want to get married eventually, but they just seem like a lot of work when I can just do whatever I want, masterbate to porn when I feel like it, and spend all of my money on stuff I actually want.

736," 

I'm currently an undergrad, but in 3 months I'm going off to start my MD/PhD. My last lab at my institution moved, so I needed to find a new one exactly one semester before needing to write my senior honors thesis. I found one, thankfully, but something always feels off.

When I walk into a room people get quiet and it feels like I killed the whole mood. My post-doc always speaks to me like he would rather be scratching his head with a cheese grater than speaking to me, another guy doesn't even say hello to me if I say something to him (I might as well be a tool on a lab bench), and one even goes out of her way to avoid me if I'm sitting at a table or a bench.

Look, I know the common denominator here is me, but believe me when I say I have been nothing but kind and respectful, I speak rarely, I'm enthusiastic about the field and I am always looking to learn more. I know I'm leaving soon so they probably see me as a short-term investment with not a lot to offer (and that's totally fair), but why does it mean they have to be mean and treat me like a second-class citizen?

Also, it's not just that I'm an undergrad. The other undergrads are treated like the best friends (we started at the same time btw) of some of the post-docs and their faces light up when one of them enters a room. They're always super inclusive and make jokes together, and I feel useless. I never want to be in the lab because I feel hated and I can't find a reason.

""You realize this is why I can't be friends with you, right?""

""Your words mean nothing to me""
""You just message and message and fuck everything up.""
""As far as I'm concerned, you'd just find someone else to treat like shit."" (-about leaving me/blocking me)
""I didn't, and still don't give a shit about that.""
""You do not make anything better.""
""Speak proper English, for fuck sake."" (I have problems with limited vocabulary and expressing myself. So that hurt a lot, especially since I considered the message I had sent very coherent.)
""We lasted a month. Woo. [Ex who I have a bad past with, who he knows I hate talking about] would be jealous.""
""You'd rather me keep all my hurt and frustration to myself if it threatened to damage your precious, sensitive ego."" (When I told him that he shouldn't be making nasty remarks during arguments for no reason, especially considering I still hold my respect for him even thought we're fighting.)

742,"Let me start off by saying he’s a great guy. All the years I’ve known him have dictated that and that’s how he’ll always be in my mind. But I don’t know what happened to him. I know it has to do with his marriage/divorce because that’s when I noticed the change.

25 year friendship. All is fine and we never really have any problems at all.

He gets married. They start having problems. I’m there for him in a big way. I get married. Reach out for help (I *really* needed it too and made it clear). He’s not there. Weeks later he contacts me... I bring it up. He apologizes. I accept his apology but that incident showed me something: it showed me that I care more for him than he cares for me...because at the drop of a hat, I’m there. Say the word and I’m there. That’s how much I loved him and valued our friendship (I did notice little things though that would happen). So I didn’t know it wasn’t like that for him (but thought it was) but was glad the situation happened and glad to know now going forward what the dynamic is.

He wants to continue on with the friendship like it was before, but, me being a communicator (also discovered he doesn’t like to talk about it when problems come) I tried to communicate how it affected me and the insecurity and imbalance that I notice in our friendship, and how things are different for me now. I wrote him a thoughtful objective text sharing my heart about the situation. I think 25 years deserves some open communication. No response.

4 years later I’m talking to a mutual friend. He encourages me to reach out to him. I think about it and say why not. Again, 25 years of my life...and I still of course have love for him. We’re talking, catching up, and I say hey if you’re up to talking about what happened that’d be fine. He says no, he’d rather just start from here and go forward. I say ok, and respect his wishes.

I’ve been really going through some things recently. I don’t have many people in my life right now to reach out to so I’ve been alone. A couple days ago he randomly texts me and says I’m on his mind and asks if I’m ok. I told him no I’m not doing the greatest right now. He says well I’ll call you today and if not today then maybe tomorrow. He didn’t call either day... I get a text from him today saying his kid was sick and thats why he didn’t call. No apology. Says he’ll call me this weekend.

I really can’t believe he did it again. I’m not really hurt this time of course, but I was sure he’d make sure to keep his word after all that’s happened. Even if you can’t talk, how much effort does it take to text someone and say I’m sorry I can’t call tonight. Would he no call no show for a work appointment? Of course not. Then how could you do that to someone you’ve known for more than 25 years. Someone you’ve called your brother and best friend? How could you do it again?

What would you do in this situation? I feel like a fool and that 25 years were wasted. Is this how he’s always been? I know I’m not a fool and that I’m a good friend but how can you tell who’s who to avoid this? It seems you can’t and just have to chance it.",14Feb2020,1

Our original plan was moving across country to get a fresh start but it meant my s.o. leaving us for several months at a time until our lease was out. Since we wanted to live closer to family and it was less expensive we decided to take the ""best"" option. It was going to be our family business. We could have our child there and it was going to be great. There was 1 month left at this time but she needed us asap and said we'd make it up with what we'd make. So we broke a 3,500 lease to accommodate her wanting to retire sooner. 

And then it got really bad. She started to get really impatient with us. When we first got into town she had said she had something nice for us to live in. When we got there it was literally an r/v with sewage backed up. We suffered a week before she moved us to a condo. Shifting us from property to property (she owns) to her advantage. She moved us out of that once she had to sell immediately due to bad investment. She took advantage of my work ethic by letting me hold down the fort to go on vacation several times (which not even her own son working with her for 4 years was capable of doing) . She decides to not sell the business at all last minute leaving me in a financial situation where I had to take up her 50/50 percent off with her son to buy the business. Everything was still in her name so it was more like leasing to own. I couldn't see any bank statements to confirm what went in or out of the account, what the actual bill amounts were. I fully invested myself into this to the point where I felt I had more load on my shoulders than the other 50 %. I barely saw my husband, barely saw my son. The contract we finally signed after telling her I was not happy with her change also added an addendum that my husband needed to make 1000 every month or my share would be taken back. The contract had nothing to do with my husband , it was just us 3 but she basically forced him to sign or the contract was off entirely. 

My schedule as is was unpredictable, I would leave home around 7 and get home around 6, latest would be 8. On rare occasions, 9 PM. My s.o. would try his hardest to make this amount up in any way he could doing handiwork. We did not want our son in childcare, we do not trust easily and it is expensive as is. Even though she would force her opinions on us to put him in daycare when he was not even a year old. She had other conditions put into the contract such as, my child and husband can't be at the premises. We had to pay rent 1,000, 400 in utilities and (3,000 plus loan each for the business within the 2nd month). On top of that she was still on payroll $20 an hour until she decides to fully retire. It was easier for her son than I, he has no bills as he lives in one of her homes for free, he has no children. As for us we are a 3 person family, we are in debt due to having to rely on credit cards for the first few months, having to move 3 times the same year just to accommodate her timeline. Her houses were not in the best condition. Both houses had a/c issues going up to the 90's on a hot day, my s.o. installed a roof vent to fix this problem with our own money because she refused to pay for the issues. Both places had house tenants who didn't clean up after being evicted which we had to clean up to move in. Just unlivable conditions in one where there was black mold in bathrooms and kitchen. The black mold house was rented out to an ex convict who we had turned several people away asking if we sold drugs months after he left. 

She has said some very rude and hurtful things to us and about our son whenever she was in a mood, threatening to kick us out various times. All of this in a span of almost two years. I started working when my son was 4 months old. He is turning 2 in april. I felt like I lost so much time with him I could never get back. I just feel like we blindly believed her and were trapped in a situation when it was too late. She had promised so many things and in the beginning that she would train my husband first and then me so I could be with my son. My son was welcome at the shop. That had changed to her training me first and then I train my husband. At the time we couldn't disagree so quickly because we gave her the benefit of the doubt but after putting up with it for that long. ""4 months into half ownership"" I should say, I fell pregnant with our 2nd child and I just knew it wasn't going to work out anymore. I did not want it to be the same way like with our first. My husband at the time was doing so good with handiwork he was offered a solid job in our hometown and was waiting for him whenever he wanted. This meant he could work and I could finally be the Stay at home mom. I broke the news and when time came around for the last pay which accumulated to 1090.50 she refused to pay me in full. I understood that, trying to make it easier for them. They could pay me electronically as money came in. Said she could only pay me 300 and we would call it even, which I said no, that is rightfully my money for work I did while I was 50/50 owner. Not even half of what the amount came up to. She settled just sending me the money once the customers paid for their clothes but it isn't guaranteed they'll pick up their clothes. It is an alteration business. By this money I'm referring to people picking up their clothes and paying for the alteration that I did. When she had given us ""ownership"" we paid her in full no matter if customers picked up or not. They said they'd keep in touch. The date was January 31st.

Feb 7th , Friday: 1 week settled in our new home , I ask if anyone picked up any of my orders and her son said yes, I'll gather the amount with my mom on monday. I left it alone as I didn't want to bother him.

Feb 10, Monday, I get a call from her yelling that she is going to report me for theft. I supposedly took 700 plus dollars from the business bank account and when I asked her when this happened she said the 10th. I responded today is the 10th, how could I have done that so early in the morning. She said my mistake but then started to barrage me with insults saying that I was ungrateful and that she could never forgive me and that my family rot in hell. I told her that I could never forgive her either, out of respect even though she didnt deserve it I did not insult her back. I told her that she was just trying to not pay me for the work I did and that I should be the one to report her. I just told her thank you and bye to her insults and hung up. I instantly called her son to tell him I'm not going to take it lightly and that if she wants to be like that then I have no choice. He said it was her mistake, he is so sorry and that he would call me later. Currently it's the 14th and no call back. I've tried calling him back but no answer. I know his son and I supposedly ended on good terms and we are on the same phone bill so one way or another we will have contact next month. I give him money for our phone bills so I'm thinking his mom told him not to have contact with me. What do I do? How do I fight this? She obviously hasn't called back because she has made a fool of herself and I have never threatened her before. She has been in business for 30 plus years and I know she doesn't report everything. I wrote everything I could possible when I was in charge. I have all the texts, I took pictures of deposits and reciepts so I could have a grasp on anything to track how much was mine. If I did not there would only be her word to trust and I do not trust her. I also have the original contract. They have the copies. We did not make another contract to break the original signing. I do not want anything to do with her crooked business, now that I am smarter and know the whole truth. I just want what's rightfully mine. Any outside insight would help me so much.",14Feb2020,1
744,"  I've been talking with the sister of one of my best friends, I think I like her and that there is something special, now I talk more with her than with my friend. Have any of you been in this same situation? Or does anyone have anything to say about this issue? what should I do?",14Feb2020,1
745,"Just wanna start of saying English is not my main language so sry in advance for any mistakes, I'm also super hungover cause I went out for a single beer yesterday and ended up partying all night like a complete idiot, before my 9 hour shift as a salesman today..

Anyway at my work we have this young girl (I'll call her Emma) who come and clean our workplace now and then, it's her first job and she has been with us for a year, she is 15 years old, super smart, sweet, down to earth and actually listens to her parents and behave well all the time.
She was very shy to begin with but lately she has begun to come out of her shell, and apparently she has a really funny personality and since I'm the joker at our workplace I always mess with all my colleagues, but never Emma because she is underaged and super shy so it felt wrong, and I didn't want to make her uncomfortable or get the wrong idea like I'm hitting on her, since she often sees me flirt with my other colleagues in the usual workplace way.

Lately I've started to mess more and more with her, making jokes about how much she behaves like a teenager, with her music taste, all the new slang words she use that I didn't grow up with and so on. A few weeks ago I made a joke about her name since I give all my colleagues funny nicknames, and multiple times she has hintet that the boys in her school also give her funny names and even calling her a man which is weird cause she is skinny and natural beautiful with no makeup, so I just assumed it was them hitting on her in the teenage way where you literally have 0 game and just act like an idiot to get her attention, and no idea what to do with once you have it so you just continue to say stupid shit.

So today 1 hour before closing I was in the back off our store unpacking new stuff and she was sent in to help me, but basically I was just chilling and praying for my headache and stomach to stop killing me, so I made her do my job while teaching her how to do it, since she had never done it before. I started to mess with her to pass the time and again she mentioned the boys at her school also picks at her, I jokingly said something about ""as long as you don't go crying home it's fine"", she then said in a joking voice with a smile on her face that she doesn't walk home while crying, she waits till she gets home and then cry.
Hungover and stupid I didn't catch the hint and continued to mess with her, but she kept saying they are really evil and she actually does cry when she gets home, but every time it was said with a smile and a sarcastic voice.
When I realised she might be saying the truth I asked her if she really did cry about it and she started to come clean..

Now here is where i need some advice cause I'm really bad at dealing with stuff like this. I'm a boy and back in my teenage years we would just fight and settle the score like that.
To sum up her situation, she has gone to the same school for 8 or 9 years, same assholes have picked on her the entire time, when she was younger she would fight them and lose since they are stronger and outnumbered her, but nowadays its they just verbally bully her with names, trash talk and so on. She doesn't have any loyal friends who'll help her deal with them, the teachers don't do shit even though she has told them multiple times, her parents keeps telling her to ignore them and she doesn't want to change school since she only has 1 year left and it would be hard to start another place so close to exams.

Since I was hungover and tired I kinda froze cause I felt really bad for her and admitted I didn't know what to say, and told her I wish I could beat them up for her or threat them via Facebook or something, but that's obviously super stupid and with major consequences.. 
So I just apologised a lot for messing with her and told her she is a good person and nothing is wrong with her personality or body. Luckily she knew I was just messing with her and that she actually thinks I'm a nice guy and fun to work with. 

But I can't get her out of my head now, I feel so bad for this sweet and innocent girl, she really doesn't deserve to go home and cry because these fuckers won't leave her alone. 

So Reddit, what can I tell Emma next time I see her? I really wanna help her deal with this, but I don't know how. I feel like all I can do is comfort her by listening and saying I feel for her which simply doesn't change anything at her school..",14Feb2020,1
746,"I am 15 years old and I have been diagnosed with Severe Depression and Anxiety disorder. First some background; My Mom and Dad are divorced. They don't live far away, so I rotate between their houses every 3 days. We are upper middle - middle middle class. My Mom is a Therapist/Psychologist, while my Dad is the director at IT at a local company. So, obviously, my Dad is more a mechanical thinker then emotional. With my Mom on the opposite side of the spectrum. Naturally, they would have disagreements. This has developed into something I can no longer handle, and I need an outlet and maybe some advice. 

My Mom has always been my Therapist. She is always been the one to pay for external Therapists, medication, and overall medical bills. Even though she is in debt and in a very sticky financial situation. While my dad and step mom on the other hand, are doing quite well, financially. I tell my mom almost everything. And since I can't bring myself to confront or talk to my dad myself, I ask her to convey to him what I tell her. His responses to these emails are the single thing that is edging me closer and closer to ending it. I will give you the basic gist of his responses. Keep in mind he knows all about my mental health.

His responses vary from, ""these are normal thoughts for a teen this age"", and, ""I was like him when I was younger, and I turned out fine"". This is just the tip of the iceberg. 

Now, I have to confess. I have access to my mothers email account without her knowledge. And, regretfully, I have gone through all emails having to do with myself dating back to 2012. I now know that the reason I never got help up until this point is because my dad convinced everyone around him and me that I didn't need help and he turned out fine. Which is implies that me and him are the exact same. Now, I do feel for him. He had a troubled childhood with his dad not being around and abusive when he was. But I am growing up in a much different world and much different living conditions. 

This is all I can write now. I'm sorry if this is unclear, but please, if you have any questions please ask.",14Feb2020,1
747,"So, there is this girl I used to like -I will call her Jacquelline- and told her I liked her. It was 5 months ago. I got rejected but we decided to keep things good between us and stay friends. There is nothing wrong with this but the confusing part is what is happening nowadays. 

4 maybe 5 days ago, me, Jacquelline and two friends went out and ate something. Then one of these friends had to leave early and we were three, me, her and this friend -I will call him John- . John and Jacquelline were going to a theatre at the evening and we decided to just hang out until they go to theatre. It was pretty fun, we played cards and talked. But here is the confusing part, she was like trying to be closer to me, I mean it was like she was into me. 

After that day she kept doing that and I kinda started to like her again. I also was getting her looking at me several times and I really thought she liked me and today I got some news. It was from John, the guy she went to theatre with. After I left, they kinda got closer but after that night he told Jacquelline that he didn't like that getting closer thing. 

Now, I don't know what to do with her. Please give me some advice.",14Feb2020,1

750,"Hey all, I guess this will be a little different than what’s always being posted here, after just a quick browse of a few of the posts. But I figure I’ll ask anyway. 

I need a little help and this post will probably be a wall of text as there are so many things I feel I need to explain but if your looking for a TL:DR I guess I just need help being in the moment, being a father and a husband, actually spending time with my loved ones, any advice would be appreciated. 

Now for my wall of text:

Backstory I am a father of 6(yes big family I know) I love them all to death and they know it, I come from a smaller family than that I grew up with two older brothers who were kind of out of my age range to actually hang out with and my younger sister, my mother and father I believe were typical baby boomers who were always focused on work and doing their own thing almost all the time. I never really did much with my dad besides a few things here and there and to be honest he’s kind of a sociopath anyways so I never really had that relationship with him. 

I’m 35 years old now and in a okay place financially and have almost everything going okay for me and my family, we have our health, a nice big house, steady income and all that stuff, the problem is me. I don’t really feel like I’m doing the right thing by my kids, I barely hang out with them as a group or as individuals my eldest is beginning to drive and learning about finance, my two older girls are beginning to care about how they look and getting into stuff early teens get into. I have two younger boys (6 and 4) who are looking for a role model and always are asking me to play games with them or even just watch YouTube. But I can’t get myself to come around, it’s almost as if I feel I can’t do it or maybe I’m not worthy? To be honest at sometimes it feel like I don’t give a shit, I know it’s hard to communicate tone of voice over text but I really don’t want to make myself look like a good guy in this context. If anyone of my kids asks something of my time I almost always say maybe later, or I’m not up to it. I know they need that father figure there to help guide them, their mother God bless her soul really is there for them like all the time, I swear if she’s not helping them with something actively she’s doing it in a passive way. She’s a great woman and me and her are in a good place together right now we love each other greatly. But like I said, I feel like I’m a piece of shit, I feel like I’m doing 2% of what I should be doing and I can’t find the strength or drive to actually get up and do it, I feel really bad about it and just want some advice, maybe it might stem from the way I was raised or even now how I’m treated with my own family, my wife doesn’t really argue for much and when she does she feels like she’s imposing or whatever, I try and tell her that I have no motivation or drive and that she has to push me but she’s really not that way, she would rather have me not do anything than to have to ask, and to be honest that’s the way it’s always been, no one has ever pushed me to be better, I never had anyone tell me I’m not doing enough or to try and be better. Right now I’m overweight and I really want to start getting in shape but I can’t even find the will to do that. I really don’t even know what I’m expecting of this post but maybe putting it into words that I can read will help somehow. 

Thanks for reading this and God bless.",14Feb2020,1
751,"Just for a bit of backstory, I had a 3.9 gpa going into this semester and now I'm not doing so well. Im taking a math class that is rly hard and that is causing me to do bad in there along with everywhere else cause I'm spending so much time on it. Actually I'm not spending enough time on any of it cause i can't find the motivation to do any of it cause like what's the point of anything, you know? The thing is I WANT to get motivated but I just cant. So now my parents are making me decide between withdrawing from the course (but I will have to re-take it later and I wanted an easier year next year) or staying in it and working really hard to get my grade up (it's barely above an F rn). I don't want to withdraw cause that feels like giving up and like it's the weak thing to do, but the idea of having to keep going with this being as hard as it is is terrifying.

752,"When I was 28 and working full time I suddenly lost the ability to function and had to leave my job, home and stay with a relative. I found out last year this was due a kind of brain injury caused by a prescription medicine. 
Now, 3.5 years later the house is being sold and I have to get my own place again. I want my independence back but am concerned about my quality of life/state of mind whilst I'm still ill.

In a nutshell I have a lot of pain and fatigue daily, and struggle to go out (today I went for a 10min and my heart rate went to 120bpm, where it stayed for 25 minutes even after sitting down). Prior to this I was athletic and hardworking so I struggle with the isolation just from being agoraphobic. 

My options are:

Move to an area where the ambulance wait times are quicker (I sometimes have to have them for my tachycardia), there are more professional opportunities for when I gradually heal, and where I have a couple of friends who could come over for movie nights etc. But the cost of it would mean I'd cover rent and food and that's it. If I want to do anything else (not that I can do much right now), but like one decaf coffee outside a week, or a haircut, I'd have to dig into savings. My plan is to grow my design business, for which I've had some commissions already so the potential is there, but of course with any new business - success is not guaranteed. 

Or move to a cheaper area where the medical services aren't as great, where there's less professional opportunities, and where I know no one. I could maybe save £50/£100 before I even put effort into my online work which would be some relief. But I'm worried about sinking into a deep depression (NB. What I'm going through literally affects the chemicals in the brain before we get into circumstantial influences). Intrusive thoughts, depression, suicidal thoughts are all common symptoms, even though they're not things I dealt with before. My natural disposition before this was work-hard-play-hard and everything is figure-out-able type attitude. Now it's.. I can't make a 10min walk without going tachycardic and I get brain fog regularly (it's the brain that's been injured). 

When I spoke to my doctor today she said she was concerned about me living alone whilst going through this but I don't feel I have any choice (hence why the area feels important as *some* social life might be significant).

To add another factor to the mix- Coronavirus has landed in the area I want to move to, and my immune system has been weak for 3.5 years so, whilst it might fade out, it might not and I'd definitely be in the category of ""vulnerable person"" right now.

I have until end of March to move. 

To add another factor, as I'm currently registered disabled due to this, I receive disability benefit as I'm deemed 'unfit to work' , which means I can't get an agency-managed property (which anything above a dark, tiny, squat is) without a guarantor or 6 months rent upfront.

Despite trying really hard I haven't yet won the lottery (I'm kidding, I haven't actually gambled away my disability) whilst being in this situation and so don't have 6 months rent upfront (I have saved enough for maybe 2 months upfront). Neither parent can be my guarantor. Nor uncle etc.

I think the stress is causing me to have more tachycardic episodes at the moment and so I feel pretty overwhelmed and thought I'd ask the Internet for any advice",14Feb2020,1

755,"Apologizing in advance for the length of this!!

I have a friend I've known for about 30 years. We were very close in our teenage years and early 20s, and when we were young like that, our friend group had a tendency to be sarcastic, joking with each other in kind of a mean way, which was sometimes fine and sometimes went too far. I bring this up because I think at least some of the dynamic between my friend and me grew out of this adolescent way of interacting...and despite the issues I'm about to describe, I wonder if this sometimes-playful, sometimes-hurtful rudeness is just a more genuine way of relating to friends, compared to the fakeness or distant politeness that often characterizes adult ways of interacting.

But even by my mid-20s, this friend and I had issues because she often hurt my feelings, and when I brought it up with her, she would never apologize...it was like it was always my fault, and it was on me to let things roll off my back. One time, I remember her saying to me, ""Maybe we shouldn't be friends anymore,"" and I was like, ""No, that's not what I want, obviously I don't want to lose you as a friend.""

(Full disclosure...I am overly sensitive, and it's something I have to continuously work on, not to fall prey to social anxiety, not to take things people say too personally or read every social interaction as negative. At the same time, many people recognize this friend has a bitchy streak--she's apparently made an employee cry, she just says incredibly rude things sometimes, and she tends to be sharply critical and judgmental of others.) 

In our 30s, we were both busy with different things--I had a kid, she had a career. At one point, I stopped talking to her for 5 years because she was rude to my kid. I didn't want to fight, so I didn't say anything. I just stopped calling or trying to communicate, and so did she. I got a message through a mutual acquaintance that she was thinking about me. This touched me and I sometimes thought of her over the years.

For this reason, about a year ago, I sent her an e-card. We got back in touch, and she said she wanted to come visit me. I had a bad feeling, but because I have lost many of my old friends (which I blame myself for), I thought...I should try to reconnect. When she came to visit, it was back to the same old shit--she was critical and insensitive with me, or even just out of the blue about my child, and she would say negative stuff about mutual friends. She would act annoyed at me if I took too long to order in a restaurant, when I was indecisive or slow generally, or just for my topics of conversation...

This is typical behavior of her--I think she's always been like this. But I kept biting my tongue, biting my tongue, or choosing my words carefully or saying sorry to avoid conflict. 

After she left, she seemed to think it was a good visit (I felt like I had suppressed my anger most of the time, in an effort to make sure it went smoothly). She keeps texting me and occasionally asks me to make appointments to talk on the phone. I feel like I've been fake...I respond to her texts in a friendly way, and a couple of times, I have talked to her on the phone though I think it's weird she insists on making appointments to do it. 

But I don't want to do this anymore. It's not that I hate her or that I don't value our history...I really do. Well, honestly, maybe I do kind of dislike her at this point. And I don't have much in common with her in terms of our views on life. I suffer from actual anxiety when I think about talking to her. While talking to her, I anticipate she'll say something mean and feel like a doormat when I can't find a way to defend myself that doesn't seem defensive or overly sensitive.

I got myself cornered into making an appointment to talk to her this weekend, and in the words of an advice therapist I heard somewhere, I think I finally have to ""use my words"" and say to her that I need some distance from this friendship. 

The other option is just to not show up for our appointment and slowly ghost her.

And yet another option is to stand up to her the next time she says something that offends me and let the chips fall where they may (but I get queasy thinking about a confrontation, and worry I won't come up with the right words to defend myself--that I'll be either too harsh or too soft). 

I think if I ""use my words,"" I'll just say something along the lines of... ""Almost every time I talk to you, I feel offended or my feelings get hurt by something you say, and I end up feeling angry or anxious. It's at the point where I experience anxiety every time I talk to you. And I don't think it's healthy, and I don't know what to do about it. I think I need some distance from this friendship.""

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I have an old friend I value for our history, because I've known her 30 years. But her insensitivity and occasional meanness has always rubbed me the wrong way. Now she appears to want to re-establish an intimate friendship, but it's causing me anxiety, and I think I finally need to do something I never wanted to actually do and tell her upfront that this friendship isn't working for me. Would it be hurtful and cowardly to just ghost her (in an effort NOT to say anything that could end the friendship)? Should I tell her honestly how I feel?

I would rather not speak honestly with her but I'm thinking it may be necessary. This has been going on for a loooooooong time, right?! It's so embarrassing to admit I've allowed myself to feel scared of a friend for so long. And whether it's her fault or my fault, the point is, I shouldn't feel this way, right?? What would you all say is the kindest way to end this friendship? Or am I throwing away a 30-year history? ANY advice or illuminating observations and thoughts would be much appreciated!!",14Feb2020,1

Its 2 days before Christmas and my boyfriend has come over to babysit whilst I went to an appointment. 

An hour into my appointment I get 3 missed calls from Bf. I call back and he tells me that the police had come round after a report of child endangerment. I immediately stopped my meeting and came home to find out what happened. Bf told me that he was upstairs tidying the kids toys away when he heard S talking to someone. (My son was with Bf at the time) he figured she was talking to a friend through the front room window so looked outside and saw N and E. He didnt hear anything being said just voices so he went back to tidying. 30 mins later the police knocked on the door asking where mum was and where he had been whilst I was out as someone had made a report of children being in the house on their own as S told someone mummy was out. He explained everything and they were happy, they spoke to the children and left. After this I phone the police and asked them what exactly had happened and what time the call was made. They told me and told me it was around 12pm but for obvious reaons couldn't tell me who made the call. I looked at my CCTV and saw N and E talking through my window and as they walked off N got her phone out, put it to her ear and walked out of view. The time stamp was 11.56. Noone else walked past during the whole time I was out (we live on a back street so hardly anyone walks around that way).

The next day during one of our talks outside I casually ask her why she didnt knock on the door to see if anyone was there with the children. She asked what I ment and said I had the police round and knew it was her that made the call. I told her I was a little annoyed but was just confused why she hadn't knocked, called me or anything. She immediately gets defensive and starts to raise her voice at me. I tell her it doesnt matter I wouldve just liked an explanation I wasnt looking to argue and walked back into my home. Within about two hours, Bf had gone home and the children where eating their dinner I hear what sounded like someone trying to break down my door - I closed the door to the kitchen where my kids were and went to the front door , it was her and her sister. They both started shouting at me telling me that I had no right to shout / argue infront of E , that I had in fact abandoned my children etc.etc. I told them if they didnt get away from my door that I would ring the police as they were being threatening and I had my children in the house. The backed off. That was the end of it or so I thought.

About a week later Bf was waiting for her to come down a set of stairs outside our front doors and she told him to stop staring at her, to tell me to move out of my home as I am not welcome here anymore. When she got to the bottom of the stairs her sister was in the car waiting, she started to shout after him as he walked up so her sister could hear and of course her sister jumped out the car and started to shout too - baring in mind Bf said nothing to her and ignored her the whole time.

Later that day Bf was stood outside my front door talking to another neighbour and again started to kick off. Told him to stop smoking weed in front of E, that she better not see my face again. (He doesnt smoke weed but had a normal cigarette in his hand) she was ignored again.

The girls (S and E) go to the same school. I found out that E had constantly gone up to S to tell her she wasnt her friend anymore and didnt want to play with her. S was upset as she knew I had fallen out with N but I told her it didnt effect the relationship the girls had and they could still play together.

On to Today :
Both girls go to an after school dance class. When the children are ready to come home N barges past the teacher at the door and disappears to the right out of my view. When S is called she comes from the right - I didnt think anything of it. But the first words out of S mouth was : E's mum said you need to apologise to her.

I'm fuming. What right does she think she has?! First she tries to get her daughter to in a way bully my kid (she didnt go up to her just the once to tell her she isnt her friend but nearly every day for around a month. And I was told by a teacher she was pushing over by E) but now she wants to do this when I haven't said anything to her or her child since Christmas Eve.

What can I do to put this to a stop.

 I have spoken to the headteacher at the school to keep an eye out incase things escalate with the girls. I didnt mention today's incident to anyone at the school as it is the last day of school before half term and most teachers had gone home. (Including S's teachers and head teacher)",14Feb2020,1

767,"Hey guys, so I plan on trying out private Investigation after high school (currently a senior). Luckily for me the job only requires a license and a high school diploma. My plan is to do online college simultaneously while working as a investigator so I can work at my own pace. The issue is I have no idea what to major in, I would like a major that involves criminal justice , however, people claim a CJ degree really isn’t useful. Also I would not like to put all my eggs in one basket in case I don’t like the CJ field 

So my question to you is what is a major I can choose that can allow me to have a wide variety of jobs within criminal justice but also in other fields aswell?

768,"I have started to become depressed because I feel like nobody is attracted to me. Im 18 and Ive only had two people like me and only dated once. All of my friends and everyone around me have people flirting with them or asking them out on a daily basis, I listen to other girls at my school constantly talk about how boys fight over them or try to impress them. My friends are the same age as me but have all had multiple relationships or hookups by now, and it seems to come so easily for them. Im starting to wonder if maybe there’s something wrong with me that keeps people away, i’ve even tried tinder but I only matched with two people, neither of them responded to my messages. I feel like its not normal at my age to have no one interested in me while all my classmates have been dating since middle school. Ive tried to ask them for advice but they just kind of laugh me off. Im not particularly ugly, but it’s starting to seriously affect my self esteem and I don’t know what i’m doing wrong.",14Feb2020,1
769,"I'm a female in my mid 20s, the guy I asked out is in his mid 30s. Here's the curve ball. He's my doctor. For starters, he isn't treating me for anything serious or chronic. He's my PCP. I go in occasionally for minor things. I'm a pretty healthy person, thankfully. 

The second time I came in to see him, we chatted about a lot of things and we just clicked. I've dated a lot of people and I know when I really like someone. It was obviously mutual. The whole thing was very smooth. He ordered a couple tests for me and said he'd call with the results. Later, he called me from his personal number. Towards the end of the conversation, it felt natural to ask him for tea. At which point he mentioned that this is his cell number and I was free to contact him whenever. 

I was impressed with my boldness, honestly. But as a wise man once said, YOLO (Drake, 2011).  I am usually much more discreet with things like this but I knew I had to be the aggressor in this case. 

So here I am. Thinking about what/when to text him. More importantly, I'm wondering why so many people are saying it's unethical. I'm smart. He's smart. I'm mature, as is he. This doesn't feel wrong in any way. Neither do I believe there's a power imbalance. I understand that a relationship between doctor and patient is vulnerable, but again, he doesn't treat me for anything serious/chronic. I don't see any vulnerability at all. 

I guess I'm trying to reconcile not feeling vulnerable with people saying that I should absolutely be feeling vulnerable.

Another friend (D, 19m) and I have been trying to work out dating each other. D and I have a really strong relationship and talk to each other about almost anything. R keeps telling me that he's upset that he's not closer with D and feels like he can't talk to him about anything important. R says he feels like something is ""off"" about their relationship, even though they interact totally normally with each other. I tried telling him that sometimes there's just people that we don't mesh with and maybe he and D aren't meant to be really good friends. But R still has this really weird obsession with wanting to be really, really close to D and gets mad at me when I try to tell him otherwise. R is going to talk to D today about the feeling ""off"" part. I don't know if I should just let the two of them figure it out, because it's bleeding into my life and it almost feels like R is trying to have the same kind of relationship I have with D. And this is not really me being possessive, but my relationship with D is obviously very different than anything D or R could have.

775,"My friend and I have been friends for about 2 years recently we got into a pretty bad argument. We're both 18 and he has a girlfriend who is 15 but they started dating when she was 14 about 6 months ago. And of course they've had sex at least once to my knowledge. Their whole relationship she's shown she doesn't truly care she sometimes just won't talk to him, she uses his money frivolously, and most recently cheated on him. They've ""broken up"" and gotten back together several times all because of things she's done. He's consistantly shown me he realizes she's no good but can't find the strength to get rid of her. After being cheated on he got back together with her within a day, and now he seems completely brainwashed. He is convinced she loves him and cares about him, and I can't say she doesn't for sure but the evidence is against it. I've been heavily against him dating her from the start and I've taken hours and hours to talk to him about her and giving him legitimately good advice and help I believe. It seems to get through to him but he always dismisses it when it comes time to use it, except now he just seems to ignore it even though he asks for it. When she called him he asked what I'd do if he answered, me being mad after finding out he's back with her, said I would yell out ""oh is that a cheater on the phone"" and other things to that extent, so he ran back to his house which wasn't far. I just said meet you there and when I got there he is old his cleaning lady to effectively not let me in. Thinking it was still Kindof a playful situation as we don't take much too seriously I told her to talk to him and she came back down and I basically had to leave, though we had plans for the day together. We argued, his argument was he didn't want me to bother her and mine was more of a spewing of how badly he treats me and takes me for granted when im just trying to help him, of course some  in my argument but it was a long time coming sort of thing. More on that if requested as my post is definitely in the TLDR range. I realize I overstepped my boundaries but our whole friendship is Kindof about overstepping boundaries and finding humor in it, usually neither of us gets too mad about it. Right now we aren't speaking to eachother and I refuse to forgive him until he gives me a real apology based on my argument in our fight, as he has done plenty I have overlooked though i am finally through doing so. Should I ignore the relationship and let him potentially ruin his life? Should I get rid of him? Should I just forgive him and continue doing what I'm doing or wait for his apology then continue doing what I'm doing or what? Any other advice or help?",14Feb2020,1
777,"So my friend has become incredibly edgy and unhealthy over the years. He jokes about mental illness and talks shit about people when they are not around. We have been friends since we were 3 and I feel uncomfortable around him now because he is lazy and thinks that getting fries and burgers for breakfast and lunch EVERY DAY is cool and when I mentioned that I get a healthy amount of sleep every night, he laughed at me and bragged that he can function on no sleep for 3 days straight. He lies about really simple things that don't even make him look cool. I just don't believe anything he says anymore. I feel uncomfortable around him now because he makes edgy jokes about himself but then he goes overboard and says stuff about me to even though I have continuously asked him to not say stuff like that. 

We have been friends for over 15 years and I like him and I don't want to end the friendship like this. I also don't want him to fuck himself over just because he thinks being unhealthy is cool. His grades are becoming worse than mine.

779,"Hey everybody, 

I asked a girl in my highschool on a date and she said yes, she then gave me her instagram so we could talk and we did everyday for a few days. Even if it was for a short time we sent eachother a lot texts. She was showing a lot of interest, asked me a lot of questions and gave me compliments. I was doing the same.

But since monday she has just stopped reading and responding to my messages and I wanted to know why. I'm gonna list some more infos so you guys can help me. Thanks in advance to everyone !

Infos:

\-I'm in France, she's in Italy for holydays doing ski.

\-She cares about her apperance on social media aka she always looks good in her pic BUT since monday her profile picture has changed to a random selfie where she doesn't look good (the kind of accidental selfie in front camera) her previous profile picture was one of her as a child

\-I've seen her connected on insta since monday but she didn't read my messages

\-She hasn't posted anything on her feed nor her story

\-She doesn't seem to have liked any posts since that day

She is a very nice person, we go to the same school and she is interested in me (and vice versa), so i don't understand why she would ghost me. To be honest i'm very confused and kinda stressed about that situation because i really like her and I haven't done something wrong that made her lose interest in me.

796,"And I don't mean an internet hug. This is gonna be a long story, I assume, I could also flair it 'Rant' so only read if you care about a random redditors life. 

So it all starts back in 2018 when I first got a gf. (We broke up that year and I'm single ever since ;-;. Also let's just call her gf). Now since we've broken up I haven't had a crush, I just continued to live like before. The breakup wasn't the loud argument and shouting kind of breakup, we just talked through it and realised we'd be better without each other. Now there is another girl who I literally only know through my (now ex) gf. Whenever I had a problem with the relationship, needed advice or just someone to make me happy, she was there to help me. But when we broke up, I stopped talking to gf and therefore also stopped talking to this girl, as it would be rude to show more affection towards a person who I met thanks to gf, than gf herself. So we stopped talking. She was from another town but not too far, so we had absolutely no contact. But now we just happened to meet in a 3rd town, where none of us lived. And I realised, after these two years this is the closest thing to a crush I have felt, and its really bad, due to multiple reasons:

1. Im not entirely sure, but I assume she has a bf

2. She lives in another town about 2 hours away from mine

3. As I mentioned, gf was the only topic we could talk about and she was the only relation between us. It was also a peaceful breakup, which would make me a gigantic asshole if I got together with new girl.

Now here comes the other part of the story, featuring my sadness instead of my social life. Ever since that breakup I was really messed up. It does a lot of harm not being able to develop a crush on anyone and just living by yourself. For these last 1.5 years I was just simply not happy, but now I'm sad. Genuinely sad. The kind of sad where you constantly feel it, like even when you're occupied with something else. I had a dream where I realised I will die soon (in some unrealistic dream tho), and it was really easy for me to say 'huh, that's great, I wonder what comes after'. And that makes me scared, suicide was never an idea in my mind, and don't get me wrong, it isn't now either, and I don't want upvotes for that. It's a throwaway account anyways. But I'm just scared of how easy it would be for me to just accept that my life has to end. It's very weird. But instead of the upvotes, I'm here for what you might like more: I want reddit to encourage me to do something dumb, which I feel I have to do:

I want to ask new girl to just hug me. Even though we haven't talked for a year, she was very kind and friendly and we had common stuff to talk about. Now I don't want her to be in a relationship with me. It would be impossible, as I counted the reasons above. But a hug would be enough both to make me happy and get me out of this weird constant surfacing sadness and to show that she does indeed care about me, just a little bit. 

So can you just tell me this is not completely dumb or pointless, or just encourage me to do it even if it is? I feel like I should do these dumb things at this age rather than later, or never and then regret not doing them. Also, I think there's more to win than to lose. 

If you got this far, thanks a lot I guess few people make it here. No TLDR, it's the whole story or no story",14Feb2020,1

798,"Note: This is not a post looking for sympathy--I'm just looking for advice. Please do not think I'm whining; I'm not. I realize my inability to say ""no"" and value my own time has really hurt me.

**Here is the situation**:

I worked part time for the school during college. Upon graduating, it was very hard to find a job. (*Note: That mentality, even 8 years later, still sticks with me. It is as if I am continually needing to know that I have a ""backup plan"" for losing my current job and being jobless. I currently live in a good city with a very active job market for my field. There are tons of openings and have been for the past \~2 years. In reality, I don't think I would be jobless, and I work hard at my job / my managers seem to like me fairly well and see that I work hard.)*

I finally found a job after a number of months and was incredibly grateful for it. I worked hard at it. About a year after working at that job, my advisor from college retired and suggested me to teach one of his classes for a summer semester. I felt like this was doing him a favor until the college could find a replacement professor and was glad to help on his behalf. I had no indication it would be anything other than a one-time thing. I taught one summer that year and that was that. That said, it was incredibly stressful for a few reasons:

* my notes from that particular course, while helpful, were very shuffled and I had to make my own teaching notes almost ""on the fly"" with very little notice I would be teaching beforehand
* although I understood the material well, this particular course was one of the earlier ones I'd taken and I needed to review everything several times
* talking in front of people for 2 hours at a time gave me intense anxiety (I have since mostly overcome this though, so it is mostly no longer an issue--still happens sometimes, but not as bad as it used to be)
* I had a number of students who kind of wanted to pick at me / heckle me during the course and it resulted in absolutely hating the experience. (Not all students were like this, just a few.)

Three years later, the college asked again, since they were in a pinch and said they had no one else, and could I please teach again, another summer. I had no excuse and said okay. That resulted in me teaching the summer semester for the next three years. I would hear they had no one else to ask, know that I had no excuse not to help, and feel guilty for wanting to say no. I probably gained 50 lbs  from stress at my full-time job combined with the teaching and using food to cope. (Though noting there were other stressing contributions from my personal life during these years.)

Now the problem is getting worse. Here I am, teaching the same course but in a spring semester, so it is twice as long and more than double the students (this greatly increases the amount of time grading and helping students). The college is asking if I can teach all year. They are also asking about teaching a new course that I did not take (but took an equivalent course for). I do not have notes for that new course. I know they have no one else, as they have let the remaining professor retire and have only myself and a part-time professor to ask. The part-time professor has said no to teaching in the summer and has a full teaching load for fall.

I am hesitant to say no immediately, as if I would be cut-off from a job I might need as backup if I were ever fired. I also feel guilty refusing a job, knowing how hard it was to find a job 8 years ago. I don't want to seem ungrateful or thinking I'm ""above"" teaching. Secretly, I just don't want to do this anymore. I also feel horrible saying no to the extra $13.60 per hour, as I feel that some people would be extremely happy with that.

Note: I acknowledge there are people who teach and work full-time and can handle both and don't have any issues with anxiety or stress. I honestly don't know how they do it. Again, I am not complaining, just trying to explain the situation best I can so that it can be well-understood where I'm coming from with this. If you do simply think I'm being ungrateful and should ""shut up and do the job"" then go ahead and say it. No insults or cruel remarks please. I know people have it hard out there and I'm not saying I'm above anyone else or deserve anything more.",14Feb2020,1

Hi ladies, this will be a bit of a long post explaining my circumstances. I am 25 years old, healthy, and just found myself pregnant at 6.5 weeks (or further possibly, I would have to wait to get another ultra sound to confirm). I got pregnant on the copper IUD which had a failure rate of .8%. I really want to be able to keep my child however I’m facing a few obstacles that I don’t know how to deal with. I’m turning 26 before the expected due date so I would be coming off of my mom’s insurance. Even with my mom‘s insurance maternity is not included so I would have to pay for every office visit unless I can use medical or something like that? I know there is affordable/free prenatal care in my area that works with medi cal. I work part time and I don’t have health insurance through my work. My partner and I currently live in the Santa Barbara family student housing because he is a student at UCSB. He’s graduating in May of this month so we have to move in May. We’re in a really difficult financial situation right now where we live paycheck to paycheck and basically survive off of his veteran marine disability benefits and financial aid. We are not sure where we are going to be moving, we both have some debt, we don’t have a specific place that we planning to move to yet. I’m in the process of getting an online remote job with full medical benefits and I have a few interviews lined up and I apply for jobs daily. I’m facing extreme negative backlash from my partner and both of our families because they’re nervous however they’re all supportive of my choice. For moral reasons I don’t feel comfortable ending things without knowing all my options and I feel really negative surrounded by everyone’s opinion that we will ruin our financial lives. Is there any hope? I would really love to hear if anyone has been in a situation like this, how are you made it work, what you wish you had known, and anything else that may help.

Edit: I am only looking for advice, resources, and how you made it work if you were in this situation and you kept your child. I am fully aware of other peoples horror stories and have lived through many circumstances in my life that makes me consider every angle of this situation. I have researched both the positive and negative consequences of this choice however I am looking for resources, referrals, and anything that would be helpful.",14Feb2020,1

Because of that, now she considers me her best friend and wants to sit next to me and talk all the time. 

She’s a nice girl but it’s definitely not the type of friend I’d have. I don’t enjoy her company mainly because her parents still overprotect her a lot (she’s f*ckin 23!!) and behaves and talks like a 12 y/o. 

She constantly wants to go have lunch/cinema together but I just don’t want to. I always come up with excuses bc I feel extremely bored all the time with her and our conversations are only about her dogs/cousins and the things you’d talk about with a little girl.

815,"Hey there guys, let’s get right to the “fun” stuff of the topic. I just lost my girl, now we wasn’t together VERY long, only about a month or so. But this girl.. man was this girl almost soul mate levels of perfect for me.  We had everything, literally everything in common, from personal interests to Kinks, to tastes in food and humour. 

But I messed up cause I might have opened up a little too much, I guess all the desperation to get my words out got to me, long story short. I need advice because I feel like showing too much of myself is bad, or maybe it’s her own fault for not taking the time to help me. 

Over the past few years I do this, I push people away without realizing it, I black out and say awful self destructive stuff about myself and then they get sick of hearing it and step away from me. 

I suffer from depression issues, anxiety issues; the whole wrap pretty much everybody nowadays does and unlike a good bit of them I have a hard time keeping it locked all inside; i can bottle up how I feel for a week but then I’ll explode. I won’t attack anybody, I won’t get violent but I’ll get very.. hateful, toward myself. I’ll get extremely self destructive. Talk about how much I hate myself, emotionally drain everything I bottled up and then, feel completely fine after. Then repeat the loop. I wanna stop doing this. Because things the way they are right now I can’t seek any professional help and my hobbies, such as gaming; talking with friends, etc. aren’t doing it anymore for me.  

Does anybody here have any advice for me? Has anyone gone through the same things? The girl I can get over; but sometimes I find days where I just can’t be happy. Even for a few seconds, my sense of humour disappears. My anxiety creeps up. 

Question is, without proper medical help and a family who won’t help me and thinks my depression is just me being sad over nothing; Am I too far gone? Is this it for me? Am I stuck this way? What do I do?",14Feb2020,1
816,"Before I start, my boyfriend (M18) and I (F18) were together for almost 3 months. A few weeks ago, he broke the news that he's being forced against his will, by his parents, to move to Europe to finish his education there. He's too afraid to speak up against them because they're very controlling parents.

Two days ago, my boyfriend and I broke up. He broke up with me in person, which I found very mature. He told me that he's very overwhelmed with school. His mom expects him to be perfect. She has access to his account where she checks his grade every day, and if he doesn't get 95 or 100 she loses her shit on him. He told me that he feels bad because I was more invested than him, he was unable to see me all the time but I didn't want to see him 24/7. He felt like he was a bad boyfriend even though he tried his hardest to make me happy. I assured him that what he did was perfect, and I was happy with how our relationship was going. I told him if seeing me twice a week is too much, we could choose a day to see each other. Even if it was for a little bit of time I would be happy to see him once a week because we were good with contact via. text and social media. He was unsure if he could do that because of the workload and pressure from his parents. He said that he felt like he was in a weird position, and he has to focus on his education to make his mom happy. He thought that it would be better to end it sooner than later because he was also afraid that we would break up when he leaves for Europe, and he didn't want to hurt us even more. We talked about long-distance before and he knew that I was willing to fly over and see him during some breaks because I have family members in the same town where he's moving. He said that he spent the entire week thinking about if he should break up with me or not. He said he was it was the hardest thing to do and that he was still on the fence about it. He told me he still likes me and wishes we could've been together for longer. He said that he'll still come to hang out with me once a week because he doesn't want to lose me. Even after we broke up, he didn't want to leave. He held me in his arms and kept kissing me, saying that he could stay with me longer but he had to go home. I told him that I'll give him time (2 weeks) to think about his choice, and I gave him three options of what we could be...

1. Get back together and see each other once a week
2. Be a fling, basically just cuddles buddies. He doesn't want fwb because he doesn't see sex as something casual. It should be intimate and meaningful.
3. Be close friends with no hard feelings

Before we started dating, his parents put this thought in his head that he shouldn't date because he's leaving soon and that he'll find the perfect woman in Europe. He showed them a picture of me but didn't tell them that we were dating, and his parents called me ugly. He still went against their say and dated me because he really wanted to be with me. I feel as if his mother might have found out about us and told him to end things with me because he kept trying to make excuses for why we should break up (ie. we rushed into the relationship etc...) His mother is extremely controlling and snoopy. I think that if she did found out about me she wasn't happy because I'm not going to be as successful as him. He's going to be a doctor, and I'm going to be a teacher.

On Monday, he was perfectly fine when I saw him. But, he was stressed cause he had a test this week and his mom went off on him about how he needs to get 100 on it. He was affectionate, he kept saying that I make him so happy and that he never wants to lose me. He looked like he was about to cry out of pure joy. He was holding me tighter than ever that day as if he'd never see me again, but he was so happy to have me in his arms. When I saw him on Wednesday I could see that something was off, he was extremely overwhelmed. It looked like he was about to cry from all the stress, and it was painful for him to break up with me. He kept saying ""I wish I didn't have to do this"" so it seems like something happened which pressured him to do it. He told me that I made him the happiest he's ever been, that I have a heart of gold, and I taught him a lot about love. He promised me he's not going to try and find another girl, and he doesn't want to hook up with anyone else. Even before he left, he put me on his lap and held me for so long. He didn't even want to stop kissing or leave my room. The kiss felt like it was our first again, and he seemed really upset.

To this day, he still treats me the way he did when we dated. We decided to keep a distance, so we don't reply to each other the second we get a notification but we reply within a few hours of each text. He still has a normal conversation with me and acts as if nothing had happened. I haven't asked him how he's holding up because I don't wanna seem nosy, I want to give him space to reflect. His texts and snaps haven't changed at all, except for the fact that he doesn't call me babe anymore. He still says goodnight/good morning to me, and we have small talk. I just don't know what to do because we still want to be together but his parents pressuring him to be perfect is the issue. He constantly feels overwhelmed with their necessities and he felt like it affected our relationship. I have nothing against him trying to succeed, and I know that school always comes first. I still want him as someone close in my life, and he does as well. What do I do? Should I try to impose getting back together, or should I ask if we could just be a fling/cuddle buddies?

TL;DR: My ex-boyfriend still has feelings for me but he's overwhelmed with his parents' academic expectations. He didn't want to end things and is still unsure of his decision. He's not sure if he can do a relationship but he still wants me as someone close in his life and still likes me (more than a friend). What should I do?",14Feb2020,1
817,"I'm on the board of my condo association. If it matters, we're in Minnesota.

The next step suggested by our lawyer is foreclosure. I'm not sure that things will get that far, but I'm selling my unit soon and will have little say in the matter. 

She screams at all hours at no one in particular; we have complaints from her direct neighbors weekly. Anyone trying to contact her has little luck. She won’t answer her door, period. If you run into her out of her home, she screams and goes on a tangent of accusations that are completely impossible.

828,"TDLR; Boyfriend normally gets flowers for me, this year I got tickets to an event I’ve never heard of before. Am I ungrateful for feeling disappointed? 

I (20F) have been with my boyfriend (22M) for almost three years now and this is our third valentine’s day together. Normally, he gets me flowers and my favorite chocolate, which I really look forward to because I love flowers. He thinks they’re ridiculous to buy because they die in a week, but I love how beautiful they look. He only ever gets me flowers on this day, and I would buy them for myself if I could but he thinks that is weird. 

This year he didn’t get me flowers, which is fine because I get he doesn’t like buying them even though he knows I like them. My problem really is that instead he got us tickets to an event six months from now to see somebody that I have never even heard of. I obviously thanked him and I’m grateful, but I’m also disappointed. 

I guess I feel like he set a standard because the last three years it’s been something that I would want and felt like it had actual thought put behind it and now I feel disappointed because this is something that I look forward to all year long. I feel like an asshole because I shouldn’t expect anything in the first place and he doesn’t owe me anything, but it just feels like last-minute and thrown together and not for me, if that makes sense. Can somebody tell me I’m just being ungrateful or something? 

I feel really bad about being disappointed, but I just need clarity from a third party on if I’m being ungrateful. What I’m really trying to say is that it’s not about the actual gift, but the thought behind it, and this year it feels like there wasn’t any.",14Feb2020,1

I WANT TO MOVE OUT I WANT A NEW CAR I WANT ALL THIS SHIT but what the fuck do you do?? just work and get fired over and over again until you die?? 

&amp;#x200B;

I ran a drop shipping business with the money I made from UPS and it made over $1200+ sales in the next week but then I couldn't find another niche when that was working so I just closed the fucker and I'm just slowly spiriling into insanity. I want to move out I want to have a girlfriend and not rely on her for ANYTHING and her the same to me I just don't know what the fuck to do. It seems like any job I could possibly get right now is a job that ANYONE can fucking work I'm pass trying to go to college I want to get the fuck out of my parents house, they destroy my mental health on the daily with so many things in their little agenda of ""failures of my son"" but they can't help me move forward and I'm constantly reminded of everything shitty I've ever done in my life like smoking fucking pot LOOOL I'm so sick of feeling like I'm going no where and that there's just too many people in the world that these companies don't want to give some fucking ""uneducated retard"" like myself any opprotunities to be on the high end level of income. All my friends it seems have gotten jobs because of their families and now they're sitting pretty and stress free but I don't have that luxury.

I am almost done with my life at 23 if I had a gun permit I would've ended it a fucking hour ago with the last conversation me and my dad had but instead I've just been searching for suicide methods that are painless and it came to me that I just want maybe some different answers on what the fuck I should actually do with my life that I haven't found on google yet and If I never reach out I won't find it so here I am.",14Feb2020,1
830,"For context: I've been visiting my friend and her boyfriend at their college for about a week now, and all of the seniors are insanely stressed about the due date of their thesis papers, which is tomorrow. 

Last night I got really drunk at a party and my friend went to bed early, but her boyfriend stayed. We were hanging out fairly normally until he put his arm around me and his hand on my leg (nothing particularly sexual but definitely not the norm in our friendship) and he told me how glad he was that I was there, how much he's missed having me around, etc. The whole thing felt a little off to me, mostly the touching. 

I feel terrible and I want to tell his girlfriend but I'm worried that it will affect her ability to work on her thesis, as she's extremely sensitive and prone to long bouts of depression when she and her boyfriend are in trouble. 

The other concern that I have is that she will be mad at me for not stopping him. In fact, I think at the time I was so drunk and so happy to be receiving affection that I was sort of into it, but I didn't initiate or escalate the situation at all. 

He might've just been really drunk at the time, though not nearly as drunk as I was, or he could have been experiencing a lot of stress from his own thesis process that made him feel and act differently than he normally would. Also, if he didn't mean anything by it I don't want to burn that bridge because I do really enjoy his company. 

Please help. I've never been in a situation like this and I don't want to ruin my friendship or my friend's writing period.

831,"Hello.. I'm really sorry if this doesn't make sense but I'll try explaining the best I can. 

I'm 17F and I work cashier/customer service at a restaurant. Customers whom do not want their change back , I get to keep it because it's considered a ""tip"" or sometimes they even tell me I can keep it for myself as a tip.  I had a customer and they had 5 dollars in change. I got told to keep it for myself as a tip so I took a FIVE but it was in fact a FIFTY and I unknowingly looked to see. The fives are to the left on my ones stack so I just instinctively just grabbed out of the five stack.  

That same day, I had to increase my till for pennies. I had a roll of 50 cents in pennies. I began to increase my register for the pennies. I mistakenly  put ""50"" instead of "".50"" I did not know this until i counted my drawer for the night. It stated i was short 50 and my coworker asked if I entered in the 50 cents in pennies correctly and I remembered I did not. I apologized and they told me it's a easy fix and not to worry.

This was a few days ago. I never check my wallet really since I never use cash only my card. But i looked in my wallet today and saw the 50 dollar bill. It had to have been from my work but I really do not remember taking it. I feel extremely bad and I'm so unsure what to do. I've talked to a few people and they are telling me not to say anything because I might make it worse. I'm not sure if my manager will take me lightly if I just tell them, ""Hey i accidentally took a 50 please don't fire me it was a mistake."" They have not said anything to me since so I'm just not sure what to do. I feel so bad and I don't want to be known for stealing or get fired.",14Feb2020,1
832,"I think I already know the answer but I just need another opinion and advice. I don't even know if this is even a legit reason to sue. And I'm certainly not saying I'm going to. I'm on a throwaway. I know my employer doesn't use reddit but who knows.

I work at a chain hotel. I love my job and everything about it except a few employees. I'm quitting because of numerous reasons. One of which is I work with a pervert. I understand, as I am a male, guys just like to check women out every now and then, shrug it off and move on. But this guy gawks about each event for days. We have a spa/pool and he works night shift. 2-3 times a week, he comes in to relieve me from my shift and tells me about some lady he saw in the spa/pool the night before in a bikini. He will sit there and make comments for 60 seconds straight (Thats a really long 60 seconds), dry humping the air, slurping his tongue, things like that. I'm just trying to paint a picture for you. Some days, ill come in after not seeing him for 4-5 days and he will bring up a lady he saw 5 days prior and just go off. He has such a terrible memory when it comes to work but not with his spank bank. This makes me uncomfortable. I've told management multiple times. Nothing was done. One day at a employee meeting with every employee in the room this guy called himself ""The Night Creeper"" loud and clear in front of everyone, three times. Like I said, just trying to paint a picture.

My brother worked at my job before I did. My brother told me that this guy, I'll call him Fred, one day had to go to the airport and pick a lady up and bring her back to the hotel. Fred works night shift so midnight to 8 am. Fred picked this lady up and I guess he thought he was hitting it off with this girl, somehow managed to get her room number, took a piece of paper and put his name and phone number on it and slipped it under her guest room door. I guess she woke up, saw it, went to the front desk and reported it. I was told he got written up and that was it.

My brother is tech savvy, so Fred asked my brother to fix his phone. My brother opened up his web browser on his phone and saw roughly 40 tabs of porn opened. Dropped his phone and said he isn't going to fix it.

Now what I've seen.

One day, we had a group of underage girls from a high school staying at the hotel. They we're like 14 or 15 I dont know, but clearly not 18. So picture this. We have out shop, one wall has a door. Outside the door is a hallway and right across the hallway from the shop door, like 8 feet is two guest rooms. I'm standing in the doorway with my back to the guest room doors, he's standing in the shop with his face towards the guest room doors and facing me, we are talking and a young girl walks up to unlock one of those guest room doors, she's in a two piece swimming suit and he looks at her, goes ""Damn, look at that."" slurps his tongue, proceeds to make a V shape with his middle and pointer finger, puts it up to his mouth, and flicks his tongue a few times. It caught me off guard. I walked away and it didn't hit me about what happened until I got in my car to drive home. Sick as fuck. The girl did no see or hear him.

One day, he came to work and left his lunchbox open. This lunchbox is not used for lunch. I know this because he leaves it open all the time. He has papers and bunch of random things in it but I saw porn magazines laying on top once. Clear as day. I wanted to take pictures but i'm pretty sure thats illegal to take pictures/videos of other peoples property where I live. I don't know so I didnt.

So by this time, from the magazines and what my brother told me about the porn on Freds phone, I get the bright idea to go buy a UV light. To see if there's a certain fluid in places it shouldn't be.

Low and behold, on the chair at the desk where everyone sits, underneath theres what I think is semen on that wall. I googled images and found possible patterns of semen look like on walls with and without a UV light and they matched pretty damn close. I also found another spot in a separate room.

Thats about all the information I have. I love the hotel and the people, except a few. I don't want it to get shut down if I report this. I'm pretty sure i'm going to report it. I just need advice and another opinion. Is this worth suing over? I don't think it is. I think its just worth reporting to the corporate office. I do feel gross that management allowed this man to work around me. As a hotel employee, you are around hundreds of people a day and he can get that hotel shut down and in trouble in a split second. Its a top priority to make guests feel safe and comfortable and what he is doing is sick and demented and I'm damn sure all of you reading this would not stay at a hotel knowing a man like this is working there. I've told management about all of these EXCEPT finding the semen on the wall. My last day is this next Tuesday.

Side note, HR is the hotel manager, the same person i've told all of this to.

He does not have much contact with his parents nor do they want him to stay with them as he’s an adult.  Recently he had a fall out here with my parents and was forced to move out and luckily his friend and girlfriend welcomed him in... but he also hasn’t worked due to no work available at his job. Last night I stayed over there and they had a small argument over a small thing... she was accusing him of stealing food items. But I had purchased weeks worth of groceries for him at the time of move in.  Fast forward till morning and she is clearly angry.. vacuuming and banging cupboard early in the morning even though he and I are extremely quiet when they are asleep.  She then bursts in telling me I have to go because her partner is going to work and he is my ride home. Okay. By this point I feel so unwelcome and burst into tears.. the ride home I silent. Not even 5 minutes later I receive contact from my partner informing me he is being kicked out from the new place and is being called names as well as I.

838,"Hi, I'm a 14F and I have a lot of social problems but the one that bothers me most is my fake friends. I don't even know if they classify me as a friend, but I'll just call them fake friends.

I go to a really small school so there isn't bullying and everyone is talking to each other, but it seems like when it comes to me nobody wants to talk to me. They try their hardest to stay away from me and that hurts me badly. I found about this when I just started to get comfortable talking to people, they talk to me in a whole different tone than they are talking to others. For example: Someone is talking to their best friend in a 'real' way, and when it comes to me they act all nice and they are trying to end the conversation as fast as possible.

Another thing is that nobody takes me seriously even my own family, and my classmates laugh at me all the time, and I always laugh it off. I would honestly rather get physically bullied than having fake friends, and I would LOVE to tell them that they are being a fake friends but my anxiety doesn't let me.

Also, whenever I THINK I made a new friend they just backstab me. The worst one was heartbreaking. I started talking to this girl and we started texting and face timing eachother everyday. Then one day I found her talking with another fake friend of mine and calling me a 'nigger' and 'go back to your country' (I'm black) and I cried myself to sleep. I got physically sick every time I went to school for the rest of that week and I stopped talking to her.

841,"So I became best friends with a girl about 3-4 years ago. We were very close and had amazing chemistry, same values, always on the same level, etc. Different from any girl I’ve been with before. She had a long distance/long term boyfriend at the time who treated her like shit. She confessed she had feelings for me as I did for her. She was going to break it off with her bf so she could be with me. I gave her some time &amp; space to process it, during which she changed her mind and thought the right thing to do was to give her relationship more effort. Hr bf hated me so there was no longer any room for me in her life and we stopped speaking, during which I met a great girl who I was with for 2 years &amp; ended up torpedoing the relationship because of my other feelings for this other girl. I would see her now &amp; again &amp; every time we did see each other it was like we were best friends again &amp; no time had passed. Fast forward to recently, we started hanging out &amp; getting close, both single now. I thought we were finally going to have something real and then suddenly I stopped hearing from her. I just found out she started sleeping with my best friend who I’ve confided in about my feelings for her. 

It’s pretty humiliating that I let him in on all of those feelings and then for him to start sleeping with her, not to mention he’s probably told her about my feelings which is even more embarrassing. I’ve also known the kid for 12 years. I can see two sides to this:

1. See my resentment as justified and remove them from my life to move on. 

2. Who am I to try to stop two people that like each other and want to be together. Give myself some time to get over it and continue growing that friendship of 12 years.

Am I a chump to stick around while he’s fucking the girl I’ve been crazy about? Or is this my ego spinning out of control and I need to take some time to get the hell over it?

There's three other tenants that live in the house, of which two are in the basement.

I'm a 30 year old male. My mom died of cancer in July of 2018. She was a heavy alcoholic all her life which was a direct result to her liver cancer diagnosis. I know it's been almost 2 years, but I still struggle with it every day. My dad died when I was 6 but he left when I was around 3, and I have no memory of him whatsoever. I don't hate him or anything, but I do wish I had at least known him. My mom raised me and never had another boyfriend after my dad died. Towards the end of her sickness it went pretty quick. I moved her back into my house about a year prior to take care of her and one day she fell down and couldn't get back up. It was just me in the house and I worked, and we had a hospice nurse come almost daily but they couldn't be there 24/7. She went to the hospital to get checked out and she was fine, but I had to make the decision to move her into an assisted living facility because I couldn't take care of her by myself and she needed someone there 24/7.
 
3 weeks later, she died. Sometimes I feel like it's my fault because at this point, she wasn't eating or drinking anything. The facility she was in didn't do IVs for regulations with Medicare and they don't force people to eat, but she still had a nurse come by and I went to see her every day. Every day I would come by and her water would be full and meal wouldn't be touched. I feel like I could have tried to get her to eat or drink more, but she was always asleep when I was able to go by and I didn't want to wake her up, because any time she was awake, she was in pain. And when she was awake, she was pretty much incoherent. It's a pretty awful thing to have to watch someone you love basically waste away. I consider myself to be a pretty strong guy. I never cry, nothing usually gets to me. I was pretty accepting of everything until about a week before she died when the ""death rattle"" started. I won't go into detail about what it is, you can google it, but when that started... I just lost it.
 
Part of me feels like shit because I feel like she could have probably lived longer if we got her to eat or drink and that her passing was suffering because in my eyes she starved/dehydrated to death. The other part of me feels like that was all just part of the dying process for people with cancer who are at the end and there's nothing I could have done, and she was finally in no more pain. I don't know. I've talked to my girlfriend about it and she's there for me, but there's nothing that really can help. She still has both her parents who are fairly healthy.
 
She had several friends die of cancer before she passed while she lived with me, and it made her very depressed that everyone around her was dying and was just waiting on her number to be up. She was ready for it I suppose because she stopped getting chemo treatments but that didn't help the fact that she knew what was coming. She had a cat that she's had for about 13 years that was with her all the time at my house. The cat was getting pretty old too and not moving around as much. I had a feeling like the cat may have been sick too, but I didn't want to mention that to my mom or bring the cat to the vet because that was the only friend she had left besides me and I didn't want her thinking that she had to see her last friend die too.
 
I'm not a huge believer in God, or a higher power or whatever you want to call it, but I prayed that my mom didn't have to watch her last friend die. Whether it was just a coincidence or a higher power or what I don't know, but my mom was able to pass without that happening and that's 1 of 2 things thing that gives me some kind of happiness in all of this. The other thing is that my mom passed while I was holding her hand. I was there with her while she took her last breath. I don't know if she knew I was there or not. I noticed her breathing get slower and slower, with short quick breaths and I knew it was time. I kissed her hand and her forehead as she passed. About a week after my mom passed, the cat passed. If I had to see her lose it over the cat dying before her, I just don't know what I would have done.
 
Every day I pretty much put on a front. A fake smile, pretend like my life is one big happy fairy tale. I make great money, have a big house, nice cars, beautiful girlfriend, etc. I'm living the ""American Dream"" per se. But deep inside, I'm really just miserable and depressed and I can't seem to shake it. I'm not going to talk to a shrink or get put on medicine. I don't feel like I'm at that point... and a shrink I don't really think would be any more helpful to me than any other person out there. I figured after almost 2 years that I would have coped with my mom's death by now or accepted it but instead I just want to down a bottle of scotch every night wishing she was still here.
 
I guess this is something every person goes though when they lose a family member and some of us deal with it harder/longer than others. I keep myself busy with work, and my girlfriend has two kids that now live with me so I pretty much always have something going on, but nothing is enough to keep my mind off of my mom. Does she hate me for putting her in a nursing home? She was upset with me when I didn't take her back home from the hospital because she wanted to be home. Does she hate me for not visiting her more than what I could because of work? Does she hate me for not trying to make her eat or drink to get her healthier?
 
At some point I'm sure it will pass, but it just felt good to get some of it out. Has anyone been through something similar and if so, what did you do to finally get through it?

I wish you were still here mom. I miss you.",14Feb2020,1

851,"so, I’m a sixteen year old who happens to be good friends with this guy who I’ll refer to as J. J and I are close buddies. when we first met, he was into me. however, i wasn’t. those feelings dissapeared over time. now, we’re just close friends with literally no romantic feelings whatsover. he’s been dating this girl, who I’ll call Kimberly, for a few months now. I was happy for him. however, that was until she began being super iffy about our friendship.

       Kimberly is just threathened by me. I understand her because I just went through a situation like this with my ex just last week (we broke up two days ago). he made a new female friend and although I was jealous, instead of being the controlling and worried girlfriend, i used that as an opportunity to do some shadowork and work on my own insecurities and fears so that I could love myself more, so I could trust my own value more and trust him more. these insecurities and fears were coming to light and i decided to heal myself so this “friendship” wouldn’t take a toll on our relationship (it eventually did but that’s a whole other story which I’ll [link](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/f2t1fu/my_boyfriend_m18_has_a_new_female_friend_f17/) here). nonetheless, I cannot expect Kimberly to do the same as me, as much as I wish she could.

       J ended our friendship the same day me and my (ex) boyfriend broke up (two days ago) because of his girlfriend’s demands. I was heartbroken, because I had lost two people in a single night. when I needed him most, he left me out of the blue. I was so sad and dissapointed. I just felt so... betrayed.

fast forward a day later, J texts me askinf if we could become friends again. I said yes and forgave him while still telling him about what he did and how I felt about it. he apologized to me. J told me that Kimberly would learn to be okay with us and our friendship. however, that was short-lived. she began getting more angry and more controlling over our friendship. I honestly don’t know why she feels so threathened by me especially when J has other female friends besides me. it’s really taking a toll on our friendship and I told him to not let a girl’s insecurities and fears have control over his own decisions and himself in general. 

today, we were hanging out when it just got worse. he finally put his foot down and told Kimberly that she basically needs to chill out and that he can be friends with me even if she doesn’t like it. a few hours later, he texts me a, “I’m sorry for being a shitty friend. Goodbye.” I just responded with an “okay” because this is honestly just ????!!!!!??!?!!.

      of course, i don’t wanna lose the guy. we’re close. he’s one of my two friends at the moment and I mean that literally. I’m a huge lone wolf so the people who do become close to me mean a lot. I honestly just don’t know if I should let him go or wait it out because I honestly feel like they’re gonna break up sooner or later. I just don’t want to deal with this. I don’t hate Kimberly. in fact, I completely understand her and I honestly hope she heals herself from the inside out so that she can be happier and trust in J more. I just want them both happy.

Kimberly also said stuff like:
“If she’s rude or mean or whatever, we’ll beat her up.”
“I don’t trust her or her intentions.”
“I want her gone.”
etc etc

do you guys think I should leave him behind or stick with him and why?

please excuse any grammatical mistakes or errors. I typed this rather quickly and I’m honestly too lazy to fix them, lol

853,"i live with my mom , three siblings (i have five in total), my little cousin (he came from a different country to come live with us - has been with us for a year now) land once in a while , my moms boyfriend come to stay with us.

ever since i was little, i remember being beat for misbehaving. my siblings did too - we cried over it , then just forgot about it and continued with our lives. i’m black/african and i guess it just normal.

when i was in primary school, i remember being taken away by social services. my oldest sister called them (my mom hated her and still does for this)
i stayed with two (white) foster families . honestly my life was better with them. i don’t remember how long i was with them. my mom got had to attend parenting lessons and since then my family have had a numerous amount of social workers.

my mom made me and siblings lie to our social workers. 

“everything okay at home?” 
“yes” but in reality, everything was a mess.

“does robert still (my mom’s abusive ex)live you?”
“no” but he did and when my social workers came over , he would go out somewhere or hide in the house.

“does your mother still hit/beating you?”
“no” , yes she does , if i answered yes - i would get hit at home. she has never stopped stop beating me and my siblings.

over the years , the beatings have got stronger. when i was little, the most i got was some slaps but now that i’m older (thirteen) , i’ve got my hair pulled , choked , pinned down to the floor , punched , kicked by someone who is supposed to care for me. this abuse isn’t just physical , its emotional as well.

i have thought about running away(not the best option),calling the police, telling my head of year (teacher in charge of whole grade or year) and killing myself. sadly i don’t have a social worker anymore so i can’t tell her anything.

i feel like if i tell anybody, my whole family will hate me or be disappointed in me. my mother’s birthday is soon and i don’t want to spilt the family apart.

sorry for this being so long , i needed to get out my mind.",14Feb2020,1

I’m very uncomfortable with this of course and now want to leave immediately. Only problem being that I’m broke and my family back in America is too.

Now, I’m not asking for money (especially in exchange for sex rn) I just want to know if there’s any way I can get out of here in the next few days? I’m only here on a visitor’s visa, so it shouldn’t be too hard right? I’ve told him that I’m not interested in his offer (which I  was admittedly very scared to do) and that I’d like to go home but he ignored me. Kind of a big red flag right?

862,"I'm 21 and I've been working third shift at a major convenience store for over a year now. (We don't just sell gas and snacks; we're well known for our sandwiches and coffee hence why I added food service to my post title.) I didn't mind the job at first when I was at my old store - I actually loved it, but I started loathing it after I was forced to transfer last August. 

My current management is hellish and everyone seems to hate everyone - our GM hates our night supervisor, our FBM hates our assistant GM, assistant GM hates GM and FBM, etc. The drama is really blatant and often, people start trying to make regular associates choose a side. 

When I was transferred, I was guaranteed at least 40 hours a week by our GM and was told I'd be a fulltime employee. The last month or two, I've only been scheduled for 24 and our GM refuses to allow our supervisors to call people in when someone calls off. The GM refuses to finish cross training third shift associates on all areas and I can't move up without knowing all areas. 

I won't lie - my current job does have great benefits if I would ever get the chance to be granted a fulltime position. However, as I thought about it, I realised that I wasn't happy with what I was doing and I want a job that feel more fulfilling. I want something that isn't food service or customer service, something that pays better than minimum wage, but I don't know where to start. I feel like I sold my soul to the goose.

I currently can't go to college because I'm currently working both at this current job and I work smaller gigs. I work to support my sick mum and I work my ass off to pay the rent as well as other expenses, but I can still barely cover everything admittedly even with as much time as I put in and I'm afraid if I lose one job, it'll ruin everything.

Can anyone either point me in the direction of an appropriate subreddit, or even just give me some direct ideas here, of things I can do to be more “helpful?” I know that’s vague, so here’s an attempt at a brief (but hopefully kind of in depth) explanation: I absolutely love the careers I have (I’m a licensed esthetician, professional makeup artist, model, and also a trained dog groomer), as well as my hobbies (horses and horseback riding, photography, arts and crafts, anything involving animals, modeling, fitness.... and of course my careers are kind of my hobbies too).  Over the last 18 months, my life has been absolute hell (most of it was my own doing, that’s a different story and not why I’m here though) and I am just now beginning to rebound from everything. Over the course of this time period so many people have been so kind and helpful to me. I wasn’t always the kind of person who wanted to be social or anything - I liked to keep to myself - but something in me feels like it’s changed. I want desperately to give back all of the love, comfort, and support (and eventually money, but I’m nowhere near ready to be there yet...

878,"

Id like to start by saying that this isn't a ***bad*** problem to have so im grateful. 

I work for a law firm and I have a  lot of practical experience as it's just me and my boss in the office. Although its just us two, the work we deal with is of high value so its good commercial experience. I really enjoy it. 

I have an interview at a much larger firm (top 10) for a similar role to what I do now. I applied really to see if they would accept me even though I don't have experience at a large firm. I was surprised I got the interview. 

The issue is that I am close to qualifying as a lawyer at the firm I am at now (4 months away) but if I get into the new firm I would have to start the qualification process all over again (very long to explain) which would take another two/three years (although the salary would be good). The main issue is that my recruiter says that if I don't qualify at a big law firm then that will stop me from **ever** getting into a big law firm as a qualified lawyer (I don't really believe my field which is commercial litigation is mainly about experience. There are a set of rules you have to follow whether the claim is £5000 of £5,000,000,000. The complexity might change but thats about it.)

Another issue is that I don't know about you guys.... but I like the idea of working for myself and not a huge corporation. My boss makes a killing on his own and he is essentially teaching me how to do it too. I think with time I will be able to do it too. He lets me work how I like and it works. I am also allowed to bring in my own clients to the firm.  I am not dismissive of the benefits that come with working at a big firm (the money, the status etc..) but that doesn't seem to motivate me that much as I have seen my boss earn a lot of money without being in the corporate structure. Something in me just doesn't feel right when I walk into a huge law firm.",14Feb2020,1

The first time I fingered her and then she gave me a handjob until I came. We both wiped it off with paper towels (no soap/water) and then cuddled for 10-20 minutes. I then fingered her again. Is it possible some sperm was still living and impregnated her?

The second instance was one week later in a tight space (car). I fingered her, possibly with some precum on my fingers. She then gave me a handjob and I came. Maybe some of the cum perfectly landed on her vagina? I don’t know.

A week after the second instance (two weeks after the first), her period was due. I believe that these instances could very well have been during ovulation. However, it came three days later and lasted 5 days. She said it was heavy in the beginning. Is there any way this wasn’t a period and was implantation bleeding?

We have since done sexual things 3 times but I made sure one of us had clothes on while performing sexual acts on the other and wiped off all cum and used clorox wipes on hands after before fingering again.

A week ago she had her period at around the normal time but I don’t know the specifics of it (how long or if it was light).

I went to Best Buy to see if it could be charged as it wouldn’t turn on and it still works. It was also unlocked, and I was able to see that the last text messages and calls were from late December. It looks like the phone was purchased in September. There are only 5 contacts listed, and the only identifying information I was able to find was a connected gmail account with a first and last name. This is also the same name used to identify the person messaging in some of the text messages.

I originally wanted to find a way to return this phone, but I’m wondering if I’m being too naive... Like was this used as a temporary phone, or a burner? Why would it be seemingly wedged underneath my wiper? There seems to be intent on wanting to be rid of it. I was about to email the gmail account I saw still in the phone, but then thought I should see if anyone has an opinion on this. What are your thoughts on what I should do?

898,"Obligatory apology as this is being typed on my phone/long post.

As the title says I think I’m heading for divorce with my wife. We’ve been together for almost seven years and married 4.5. We have a beautiful 2 year old boy. When my wife and I were dating we talked about how we want 2 kids and that was our plan. However as naive people we had no idea the costs that a child entails or how expensive real life can get when you move from the going out all the time to I should probably try and save some money/have a better life.  My wife is 4.5 years older than I am and she’s hears her clock ticking loud and clear and has been bringing up having another child non-stop lately. Folks, we straight up can’t afford another child and she refuses to accept it. Before anybody says you find a way to make it work we’ve seen a financial planner about a year ago who said we didn’t have the means to take on any large financial burdens. My wife refuses to accept this and keeps saying that we had a deal/arrangement for 2 kids. She says that people make it work all the time. I recently started a new job that came with a raise, however we still don’t make enough to put money away to save.

I’ve run the numbers and we need to have, at a minimum, an additional 2k a month after taxes to afford another child. We live right outside of NYC for some perspective. Our son is in daycare and the cost for him is over $350 a week and that’s one of the cheapest we can find that’s not a shit hole. We don’t have any family that can help, her mother had health issues and my parents both work full time.

On top of all this my wife also wants to own a home, we currently rent a small 2 bedroom apartment. I’ve reached my wits end and don’t know what to do. Every time she brings up another kid I tell her that we don’t have the means and she gets in a pissed off mood like I’m the reason we can’t. She proceeds to act like I’m to blame for our current situation.

Since my wife and I met have busted my ass to double my salary from complete garbage a year to able to pay the bills and not cry each month while my wife has not found a new job to make more money. We both need to work to pay our bills, even without daycare it’s expensive to live in our area.

I’m about to lose my shit, I see a therapist every 2 weeks and I’m at my wits end. I’m tired of being made out to be the bad guy, I’m tired of keeping up with the Jones’, my in laws who all have nice jobs/houses/kids, and I’m tired of not being happy.

903,"I (19) have lived with my mother all my life, my parents had a little rough split when I was 11. 
As of right now my mother is currently married to someone who is treating her like garbage, being extremely hypocritical, and unreasonable. 
I myself am currently unable to work due to my recent ankle injury leaving me somewhat immobile. 

I have to wake up and deal with her being put down and mentally destroyed daily, if I try to intervene he lights into me about how much of a terrible person I am and how I'm using them to live care free.
It's one thing to accuse me because I personally try not to worry about the people who use anger as a personality... but my mother doesn't deserve this.
 Right now im trying my hardest to move and get out of the situation cause I can't deal with the pain of seeing her crying nearly everytime I leave my room.
I have caring grandparents who would let me live with them, but that's at a slight halt because I need surgery on my ankle and they wouldn't be able to support me through the post op.
I feel like I'm going insane living this hell over and over again.

I'm hoping maybe some of you could help me see a few options to consider.",14Feb2020,1
904,"If someone parks beside me so I can’t u-turn and thus I have to go around the block, my mind says they did it deliberately.

If I’m walking across the road and have to wait for a car (im from a small town not a city) I truly am not bothered by the 5 second wait but my mind tells me they won, they are laughing and starts to think they are going even slower because they want to make me wait

If someone is laughing nearby I often think it’s about me

I hear cars drive by with their music cranked outside my window when I’m reading? Out to get me

Sometimes it’s my boss that’s out to get me when I have a rough day at work when he really isn’t behind it, sometimes I think my probation officer is out to get me abusing his power to make my life miserable, or sometimes just strangers",14Feb2020,1
905,"My boyfriend and I have been together for a year and a half. Since the beginning, we’ve been arguing about each other’s best friends.

My best friend is a guy and we are very close (have never hooked up nor have been attracted to each other).

My boyfriend’s best friend is a girl and they are super close (she calls all the time, comes over drunk late at night, texts all the time and talks to him more than she talks to her boyfriend). A few months into our relationship, I found out they had slept together a couple years ago. He deliberately didn’t tell me and I had to ask.

It gets tricky because my boyfriend is threatened by my best friend to the point where very recently my best friend ended our friendship because of how many fights my boyfriend and I get into about him. My boyfriend’s best friend is very much in his life still and I’m having such a hard time with all of this.

I feel like there are double standards and there was zero reason for him to not trust me yet I feel like there’s quite a few reasons not to trust him and his female best friend. He’s lied about talking to her and things like that.

As wrong as it may seem/be or unhealthy, I have given him an ultimatum and need him to choose me or his girlfriend. He’s not happy about it and I get it. At the same time, I’ve lost my best friend through all of this and struggle with things being so uneven. He has also chosen her over me in several situations and I have felt second for a very long time. I understand what my insecurities are that I need to work on. This post is mostly about boundaries that have been crossed over and over with his best friend.

Hi guys! Today my ex coworker informed me that my current coworker complained and asked our director to fire me, stating I’m “messy, lazy and always on my phone” I was wondering, should I confront her about it or bring it up to my director?

I’m new, I started a month ago, so to be fair what she describes as messy and lazy (for example when closing the store) is just me still trying to get things down, so maybe I do forget to do a thing or two, but I’m learning and correcting myself. She mentioned how I’m always on my phone, but the store will get very slow and after I’ve cleaned everything twice, and there’s been no customer for 45 minutes, yes maybe I’ll go on my phone.

To be honest, I don’t have a problem with her feeling I’m not doing a good enough job, but I would preferred she come to me about it instead of our director, trying to get me fired.

I’m not too sure what I should do, I don’t want to get fired, I feel like I do an adequate job and I don’t want to be talked about like this to a higher up, and not even give my explanation to things. Thanks",14Feb2020,1

The mind on and after LSD is extremely hyper aware of things that are already there. they diagnose whatever bullshit that someone feels is persisting after using whatever drug as something that needs to be treated with medication, but they've never once in their life smoked weed or taken LSD. therefore they believe that anything different they feel after the drug has left the system is some mental illness? What kind of fucking logic is this?? Sure it's reasonable if it happens after using meth or any other stimulants, but psychedelics are a whole different ball game, they can never truly understand until they take that fucking red pill which are psychedelics.

So last year, I learned she was also seeing another guy we work with. She had covered it up because she didn’t want to hurt my feelings. On our birthday, I took her to lunch. It was one of those significant birthdays for her and I wanted to make it special. She had made plans to be with this other guy in the evening but he ended up cancelling. Over the course of last year I tried to be the guy she chose but it ended up going sour due to my jealousy of her and him. She is still seeing him and I try to avoid her as much as possible though she would still like to be friends. 

Her and my birthday is coming up. I took time off of work so I wouldn’t be around her or him on that day. I just don’t want to deal with that. I expect she’ll send me a text to wish me a happy birthday this year. We both have done so for the past several years. And this year is a milestone birthday for me.

919,"this guy is 20, and he and i have had vibes going for a while now (like months and months) we were flirting over text and i thought he just wanted something casual. i invited him over where he told me he actually did like me and that hes ""going for me"". we slept together  that night and he basically stopped texting me while i reached out a couple times asking when i could see him again, to which he promised me soon and that its worth the wait. 

flash forward to two days ago where we were both attending this staff party thingy (he doesnt work there anymore) he spent the beginning with me but was being super nervous and awkward, and eventually started flirting with another girl infront of me (holding her hand, hugging, kissing her infront of me..) i kept acting cordial with him despite the hurt. &amp; i ended up telling the girl when he wasnt around that if she doesnt want a hookup she shouldnt go for it bc he did the same to me not long ago, and she ended up rejecting him... leading him to approach me asking to know who i told about us. i told him a lie that i havent, he walked away and was being dejected and depressed the rest of the night sitting all alone. i feel really badly that i ruined his chances with her despite how it hurt me tbh, i only told her for her sake. he wouldve hurt her the same way eventually, and she wasnt into a one time casual thing, so she made her own decision based on that.

hes troubled w a lot of baggage, he had a difficult up-bringing that i wont disclose. when he was all depressed he couldnt have the girl bc she knew about us, my roommates approached him asking whats wrong. he opened up and told them hes insecure, that girls always use him for his money (hes rich), that he was hurt badly before and has given up on relationships etc. they gave him unbiased advice just telling him not to flaunt or spend too much on the girl cos thats not how you get her to like you for you. they told him that everybody is insecure and nobody who dates hasnt been hurt before. you just have to move forward with life and love yourself. they also said that if he doesnt want a relationship  he shouldnt act like he does. they basically told him to grow up &amp; he said theyre right.

anyway, i dont really like him anymore obviously but it really hurt me what he did. despite that, i dont want to be rude to him or anything, im just wondering whats the best way to treat him after this all happened? im asking bc sometimes i see him around.

932,"My friend (Mandy) had this crush on a guy who lives down the hall from her and she called me, on FaceTime, to tell me her idea of giving him a Valentine. I was listening to Mandy explain and she said she was going to hang them up by her friends doors and then one by his door. While Mandy was telling me this I was with another close friend of ours (Becky). Becky and I looked at each other and our mouths dropped and then we busted out laughing.

Mandy got all quiet and said she was not meeting us for lunch anymore and said we were not being understanding because her and her ex of many years broke up on Valentines Day last year.

It does not sound like a terrible idea with this information except she has not talked to this man before and I fear she is creating a narrative in her head. They only smile at each other occasionally. She talks about him constantly, she is always on the look out for him, she will purposely leave stuff up for him in the hopes that he will look at it and think of her. Anytime I have teased Mandy about her crush she laughs but becomes a bit violent. She's tried to trip me and has punched me in the arms a couple times.

We talked for the whole period, some moments of silence but nothing too bad. Then near the last minutes of the period (I wanted to see how far I can get with this) I asked, “Aren’t Valentines supposed to kiss each other?” She said yes they are, so I held her face and tried moving in. I was nervous and pulled out because we weren’t dating (officially). But then a minute later she called me a pussy, then I asked, “You will let me kiss you?” She said, “Yes”. So we were standing and I held her face again, then I slowly moved in and she initiated the first kiss and kissed me. (My heart was beating furiously). She said that is was “just a kiss”. This girl knows I haven’t kissed anyone ever. So after she kissed me she said, “Well, that’s your first kiss. Sorry it had to be me.”

937,"Because I'm frustrated and at my wits end.

(TL;DR at the bottom)

My coworker (let's call her Liz) and I work as in-house copywriters for a small company. While we get along for the most part and have a good rapport, there are times when we disagree on things. This is in-part because we have different writing disciplines; Liz is a classically-trained writer and I'm a conversational writer.

When Liz was first brought on, I pulled aside my manager at the time and asked her if anything about my job was changing since one of the reasons Liz was brought on was to help train me. My manager then told me that Liz was simply going to be another copywriter and not someone I would be reporting to.

That being said, I've noticed that whenever Liz and I have a disagreement over my copy, she will bring in other people who will take her side and who tell me to change it. Ok, no big deal, I thought at first, it makes sense to bring in a third party when an agreement can't be reached.

Only, this keeps happening over and over again. And only when it comes to my copy.

She's the type of person who'll fight for something she believes in and I respect the Hell out of her for it. Only, whenever I edit her work, she'll revert the changes she doesn't agree with and close out my comments without another word. Yet whenever I revert a change or close out one of her comments she feels particularity strong about, she'll verbally confront me about it. Since we both work in an open office, this basically means she's calling me out in front of all our other coworkers. 

I wouldn't do that to her and it bothers me that she does. It's gotten to the point where I accept all her edits without question even if I disagree JUST to avoid a confrontation.

I was required to CC Liz on any copy I submit for approval but not the other way around. (That has since changed when I pointed out that she was supposed to be training me and I can't learn from things I don't see.) One time, I was running up against a deadline and she kept finding errors that were originally introduced with the edits she told me to make (To be fair, it was a miscommunication because she highlighted a section and told me to replace it with ""x"". I interpreted the instructions literally in part because I have Aspergers.) The coworker who approves our submissions hadn't even given their own input yet. 

I made the changes anyway and Liz just kept finding errors.

Liz and I went back and forth for about an hour. I was admittedly frustrated by this point and sent her a separate email explaining that I realized she wanted things to be perfect, but that I was running up against a deadline and we weren't supposed to make these kinds of edits during the approval process. (Turns out I was slightly mistaken on that.)

Next thing I knew, she sent me a response declaring that she was just doing her job and had CCed two other people. It wouldn't surprise me if she had also BCCed our manager, but if she had, I haven't heard anything about the matter.

Furthermore, if she makes a stylistic choice in her writing, then it was on purpose and fine-as-is. Yet when I make a stylistic choice in my writing, then I'm just wrong. 

For example, I rejected one of her changes the other day and closed out a comment after I  responded with my reasoning. She verbally confronted me yet again, explaining that wasn't what the word meant and, in a nutshell, told me I was trying to compare apples and oranges. I tried explaining, in a nutshell, that apples and oranges were both still fruits.

She then said that I was professionally stuck on that word simply because I wanted to use it. I felt like she basically had just publicly accused me of being stubborn in front of everyone.

I get that she has more professional writing experience than I do, but there are times I get the sense she expects me to do as she says, no questions ask. It would be one thing if she were my supervisor, but she's not.

Ultimately, I feel like she doesn't trust my judgement because she'll only drop an issue if someone else agrees with me.

I could really use some advice since I realize that my Aspergers affects how I communicate and even view the situation.

TL;DR - I like my coworker, but she'll escalate our disagreements, and publicly call me out on things when I don't do that to her. I am unsure how to proceed since I have Aspergers.",14Feb2020,1
938,"I was signing for my new apartment today and as I was leaving my room (inexpensive hotel) the housekeeper was cleaning the room directly infront of mine. The guest must have checked out because the housekeepers clean on saturdays. I said hello and asked her to not go in my room (because it is messy and I want to clean up) she said ok I won't. Then I get a call from the front desk saying that my room is a mess and I have to clean it.

Why did she completely disregard what I was saying? Housekeepers here do not clean rooms until saturday, she basically just snooped around my room when I directly asked her not to.",14Feb2020,1
939,"Throughout my younger years (elementary and middle school) I always was more acutely aware of how many germs and bacteria were surrounding me. My grandfather owned a local janitorial / cleaning business and he would often bring me with him to help clean, on the weekends or nights we would clean churches, and schools. This affected me a lot in the way that I look at objects and things around me because I know how dirty they can be / get. My grandfather retired and my uncles inherited the business and now I no longer have to help out. Now though, senior year, I have noticed that I am uncomfortable with certain things that are around me or I have certain ticks that I do or else my brain will make me feel uncomfortable. Recently, I had just squished a small gnat and my arm shivered at the thought of the small bugs body on my finger. I catch myself seeing my hand pass someone in my field of vision and I have to move my hand back over them as if to ""reset"" my vision. Whenever I am walking through auditoriums I can never go through the middle, I have to always come back the way I came to ""reset"" my path. Another example being that I have to rewrite and erase some numbers when I am taking notes or letters because they don't sit right with me. The biggest thing for me is that if I blink with one eye or do something with my right hand, like I'm tapping my thighs or tapping the table, I have to do the exact same number on the other side. When I blink with one eye I have to blink the other eye and I am acutely aware of how many blinks or taps I do with each. These all seemed like minor things so I didn't think much of it. A lot of people say that they have OCD or germaphobia but a lot of people also say that when they are just neat or don't like bugs. I don't know if it's worth getting diagnosed because it doesn't seem to be a really big issue that affects my day to day life. However, I do understand that sometimes its better to be sure than to be unsure. Should I go to a psychiatrist? My physician? Or just leave it as it is? I'm kind of scared of being put on medications because of my previous experience with them for my anxiety.

Thank you in advance

Now that we've got that out of the way, I feel I always lose arguments. That I can't make a point without someone pointing the flaws and I can't talk back. I always know what I want to say, but I just can never put them into words.

And I know you may say 'well just don't get into them.' I just keep on accidently getting into one. It just takes one shitebag who is triggered because I have a different opinion to them and who feels the need to say them and I'm off (I'm not calling them a shitebag because they have a different opinion, but because they always act as if they are the best person in the world and they are never wrong). I feel the need to defend myself.

You may also say 'just don't talk back.' I try, but, in short, I can't make them feel like they've won. Especially when some are just so rude and disrespectful.

944,"I have been at this job for 3 months about, and I absolutely hate it. Mainly because of my boss. She can be a bit inconsiderate at times.
 
To start off, my first date of work, I did not even know it was my first day of work. I was told in the beginning I needed to make an appointment to get a badge, so I made an appointment for the next day and called my boss and told her. She said ""Ok, let me call you right back,"" she calls me back and tell me she remade my appointment for rhe same day, and told me it was at 3pm. Keep in mind its 2pm and its rush hour and I have no idea where this place is. 
Somehow I manage to make it there and inside the facility 5 minutes early. I get there, my managers not there, so I go ahead and get my badge on my own, then call her, and she tells me to wait there for her. Doesnt give me a reason, just tells me to wait. So I wait. And I wait. And I wait. And I wait. 
She shows up 2 hours late, with fast food in her hand, munching on fries and goes straight to business, no apology or explanation. Then she has me follow her around town and basically dumps me on this one guy and tells him to teach me everything I need to know, and then she leaves for 4 hours and just like that I am working my first shift. 

Another incident, sometimes we work on the weekends and we deep clean floors. She has a van she uses to pickup and transport our supplies and machines. Our supervisor (not my boss) comes in and he tells us that my boss doesnt feel like showing up, so we have to move all the equipment ourselves and use his minivan to carry the machines. His minivan ends up having to replace a seat because of the spikes and sandpaper on the machine.

Other times I have gotten in trouble for not doing certain tasks because I genuinely didnt know I had to do them because no one ever told me or showed me to do them. Oh, I was supposed to clean that bathroom? I didnt even know it fucking existed. Gotta mop this area? No one ever showed me to do it. I have asked for a checklist and she refuses to give me one, saying ""Its easy work, you know how to do it."" I obviously dont since I keep getting into trouble for it!

These are the main two things, along with dozens of other situations like this, where her inconsiderateness has affected everyone's work and day. From having to work overtime by 3 hours so needing to buy our own cleaning supplies because she refuses to restock until everything in the warehouse is gone. 

I dont know how much more I can take. I was planning only staying 6 months, but I am so stressed about coming into work everyday. I have had two break downs so far, one panick attack, and I just dont know how I can stay for 3 more months.

958,"I own a deli. Guy comes in and he’s maybe five foot four. Shaved head and veins popping out of his head. This guy was incredibly muscular. I’ve never seen anyone this muscular in my life. He looks incredibly pissed as soon as a I greet him when he walked in. I said to myself “there is going to be a problem.”

A teenage coworker helps him, his wife, and kids. I don’t know exactly what happened but a cup of coffee gets knocked over and falls on the floor. I guess some of the spray the woman’s pants. The coworker sees a coffee spill and grabs the mop to clean it up. He has no idea how it happened.

By the time he reaches their area with a mop this guy has decided my co worker was the one who knocked it over. I was helping another customer but from what I saw and heard I got the sense the wife was trying to calm the husband down because he was getting very upset. She kept telling him it was nothing and you could see she was embarrassed by his increasing anger.

So coworker comes over with a mop thinking he’s helping and the guy starts screaming at him. He calls him an asshole, a piece of shit, etc and he looks like he’s gonna hit the kid. The kid is bewildered. Wife grabs her kids and leaves. I stop what I’m doing and run over thinking he’s going to hit him. I’ve literally never seen a person in a rage like this.

So I yell at the guy “hey hey he made a mistake! He made a mistake! Relax!” I did that to draw his attention away from the coworker and towards me. I seriously thought the fight was on.
Guy turns around and we make eye contact. I’m not much taller than him and I’m no where near as fit or scary looking as him. We were locked in eye contact for a moment. It was a standoff. I told him “you need to relax it was just a mistake!”

The guy breaks eye contact and then starts talking and acting like a child having a temper tantrum. He’s very polite to me and talks to me like a human being. He’s telling me he’s angry because my co worker didn’t apologize to him and his wife for spilling coffee. My response was “he has no idea who knocked the coffee over and we apologize for the situation.” I could see the guy was still raging but for some reason with me standing there he seemed to be able to barely keep it together. He seemed like he really wanted to rage on me but felt he couldn’t. I told him he needed to leave and he did quietly.",14Feb2020,1

961,"Hello reddit! Hope y’all are having a lovely Friday. I’ve been running into a bit of a conundrum lately and I just thought the opinions of some people with no stake in the game could be helpful. 

I am a 25 year old female. Probably like, average looking. I consider my best attributes to be my work ethic (I work two jobs and I’m pursuing my MBA) and the fact that I’m very caring towards others. I also have anxiety and mild OCD which I consider to a major flaw, that I wouldn’t expect anyone to tolerate.

Enter my boyfriend [30M]. He is my best friend and my favorite person to spend time with when things are good. That being said, he refuses to get a job because he can’t find one in his field. When he went back to school at 24 for computer science, he refused to do an internship because he thought the idea of working for no pay was insulting and didn’t work because he thought the idea of working while in school was unfair. Now he has no job history and obviously can’t get a programming job, but thinks he is above working at Costco or Amazon. He also doesn’t do any chores around his house, which bothers me because he lives with his parents for free and because he has so much time when he could be doing it. He basically just smokes weed and plays video games all day, and then tells me he can’t get a job because he is too depressed. Maybe he is, but the ROOT of the problem is that he was born with a silver spoon in his mouth and thinks he is above certain tasks. As much as I enjoy his company, I’m not getting any younger. I’ve saved up a 30k down payment for a house so far and paid off all my student debt because I’m trying to start building a life together, and I’m wondering if I’m pulling dead weight. 

Enter my make coworker [35M] who has been my friend since I started at my company 2 years ago. This christmas, he has a hospital stay and the bill made it impossible for him to buy his two year old amy presents. I gave him $300 to get her gifts because I’ve seen so many pics and videos of her, that I feel like she may as well be my niece or something and I wanted her to experience a happy Christmas. I had a feeling like ever since I did that, my coworker had developed feelings. I was right. He recently admitted it to me. And now, I am left wondering if this is a sign telling me to get out of my relationship. I am not necessarily attracted to my coworker, but it makes me feel like I can do better than where I’m at. And a lot of the time, feeling like I’m too old to find someone else feels like the only reason why I’m staying. SOS :(",14Feb2020,1
962,"So this started about a year ago or more (19f). I’ve had a yeast infection at least once every two months, some lasting a couple of weeks. So in all (that’s I’ve gotten medicine for) I’ve had about 7 maybe. I’ve had fluconazole, the one pill, I’ve had fluconazole, the 3 pills every 3 days, few more variations of the same pill, and then various creams (over the counter and prescribed) and I’ve been given an anti itch cream from my doctor for occasional use. None of this seems to help long term. The most one of these has helped was the 3 pills every 3 days and I hadn’t had one in about 2 and a half months.  Well now I have one again, they’ve ruled it more as hormonal and or diet caused bc I use the same soap same detergent same everything for a few of these and I know they aren’t causing it.

She's quite rude and loud to my other friends, and genuinely can't tell that other people are avoiding her because of the way she acts.

It's embarrassing to be associated with her, since people have categorized her as a 'cringy tiktoker'. You'd understand if you saw her posts on TikTok. She doesn't notice that my classmates are making fun of her because, as I've said, she's dense.

I want to avoid her because she's rude to me as well. Not only is she a social parasite, but she's also a bully ig. She makes fun of my appearance when I look absolutely normal dkakfkjancns.

I fear that avoiding her isn't enough, since she's dense and won't get the message that I'm purposely avoiding her. She always sticks to me and considers herself as part of my friend group when no one actually considers her as our friend.

I go back the following day and when we're talking I notice she's always smiling, biting her lip and said ""we're wearing the same shoes"" which we were, doctor martens. She tells me I should listen to neutral milk hotel, so that night at the gym I listen to all of their music and I really like them. I go back the following day, she's not there, so I return today. Again, we get on really well and I feel like throughout our encounters there were setups for me to make a move. Anyways, I return there and say, can I write you some bands down? I write down Holy Mountains by System Of A Down and Evil by Interpol and at the bottom I put ""if you ever want to tall about music"" then my number. It's barely even been a day, but I'm worried I've made the wrong move? I'm planning on going there tomorrow anyways after the gym, will it be awkward?
