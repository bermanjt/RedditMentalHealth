0,"I’m really freaked out right now. I’m living in a bottom floor apartment of a gated community. No cars can drive in or out if they are not residents of houses here, if you want to invite a friend over, you have to ring the gate from your own phone number, it will reject calls from other numbers. However there is an open gate for pedestrians.  And this is where I get to my point. 

It’s nearing 1 am and I’m on my phone, doing some late night scrolling on my phone and a very bright white light flashes into my room. It lasted about a split second, my only thought that it could have been was that it came from outside the window. I have no electronics or lamps/lights that could have flicked. My best explanation is comparing it to a camera flash. 

I’m an 18 year old girl on my own at the moment, and I am petrified to go out and check, or even sleep. All I could do was turn on my light I suppose in attempt to scare away an intruder. 
I’ve been trying to listen out and see if I could hear anything suspicious. But I can hear the guy in the apartment above me moving around so it doesn’t ease my worry. Does anybody have any possible scenarios for what this could be so I can hopefully get some sleep tonight?",09Sep2020,1

I [23M] live in a two bedroom apartment with GF [21F] and her best friend [21F EB] for the past two years. GF had BDD and low self worth, which has afforded EB every opportunity to walk all over her. She treats my GF like a personal slave and believes that everything GF owns is “theirs"". I’ve tried to get GF away from this toxic relationship but she wont open her eyes to the way she's being treated. 

EB has always been a bit overly touchie feely with me but GF has always just shrugged it off as her being herself. Now, EB broke up with her BF in January, which forced her plans of moving out to be placed on pause. Ever since quarantined happened, she keeps on “playfully"" reminding GF on all the threesomes they had during freshman year. Meanwhile looking pointedly at me. This is the part that I should mention that I IN NO WAY WANTED ANY PART OF THIS. EB is absolutely a DISGUSTING human being and she treats my Gf horribly.

We all lost our jobs due to current situation and now I have no way to escape the drama. I also take a medication that lowers m immune system so I cant really go outside because people don’t know how to wear masks. When I was unreceptive to EBs advances, she started going on my GF. Speaking down to her, playing on her insecurities and hiding her medications. I kept on insisting we kick her out but was met with, “But her name is on the lease"". 

This all comes to a head when GF and EB come into my bedroom when I’m about to go to sleep and tell me that they’ve come to a discussion that we are going to have sex together tonight. If I disagree than, I can pack up and get out. [For context, I moved to this state for school and couldn’t just on flight to go back home]. I looked at my GF and asked her if she was really gonna let this happen. She just sort of nodded. I laid down the ground rules that I would only have sex with my GF and they can have it off with each other. During this, I would be completely OFF the bed and standing in the corner not trying to vomit. 

I start drinking to get mentally prepared, which in retrospect was a bad move on my part. We get started and after a few moments, EB starts breaking all the rules that I had in place. I wont get into too much detail of me trying to dodge this girl but A combo of drinks and a distracted mind had me coming to fruition in EB. I can’t even explain how they managed to get it in.
I’ve lost all trust in my GF and am planning on breaking up with her as soon as things get better in my state but last night my GF told me that EB is pregnant. EB is the last person I want to be shackled to for 18 years. 

I want to ask her to get an abortion or I would take her to court for custody. Shes emotionally abusive and I dont want to put a child thru that.",09Sep2020,1
2,"I get bullied by my friends at university. I’m 20 years old and yes you can be bullied at any age. I’m insulted about my appearance and keep quiet because of my shattered self worth and self esteem. I get told by mainly two friends that my haircuts terrible, that I’m skinny, that I have hairy arms and bad eyebrows. My other friends will make occasional comments. 

People pick on me and try and intimidate me. Once I was in a club and a virtual stranger( he kind of knew my friend) insulted my hair when we were sitting down at a table. He showed me a picture of this guy with exaggerated shaggy hair and said it was me. None of my friends said a thing to defend me.  I’ve had the same comments for two years of uni and I’m going into my final year. 

I shouldn’t have to change my appearance for other people. I like my hair the way it is and I can’t control having body hair and my eyebrows. I really want to tell the next person who comments on my appearance to go fuck themselves. But I know that anger isn’t the best response and they’re probably looking for a reaction. I’d rather say something than just stay quiet like I have done for the last 2 fucking years. 

The reason I see it is as bullying is it’s not reciprocal. I don’t insult or make comments about my friends appearance. Also I stay quiet which shows I don’t like it. Another thing is that I can see some people comment to deliberately hurt me to make themselves feel good. That’s essentially what bullying is. Emotionally or physically damaging someone intentionally to make themselves feel good. 

Anyways, what’s the best response I can give??. Should I just tell them straight that I don’t like people commenting on my appearance and that it’s horrible. Should I laugh it off and insult them back?",09Sep2020,1

4,"I have to put my 19 1/2 year old dog down. His health suddenly declined earlier today but we can’t get him to the vet until tomorrow. My area has a service where a person will come to your home to euthanize a pet so they’re not scared and alone, but they don’t have any openings for another week and I don’t want him to suffer. It’s devastating but because we’d have to take him to the vet, the other two dogs won’t be there when it happens and might not understand what’s going on. I have a shepherd mix who is very concerned with her “flock” and I think it’ll hit her the hardest. Should we bring him back after the vet for the other two dogs to grieve or would it be better for them not to see him again? Would it be a bad idea to let them be there when we have to bury him or would it make things worse? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",09Sep2020,1

6,"\[M20\] I'm a senior in college. I spent this summer working my first internship. I loved everything throughout the course of the summer and they seemed to be very happy with me. Just last night, I got a full-time offer from them. They already have my contract written up and a full-time adult salary listed on it.

Suddenly, I am so anxious about my future. All of my friends are having the time of their lives in college, some still have many years of school ahead of them. Some are taking breaks after college to travel, explore and enjoy their 20's. I am suddenly so scared that literally 4 weeks after I finish school, I am going to be a full-time, 9-5 employee until I retire in 40 years. My family, my girlfriend, her family, my friends are all so excited for me, but I am so scared and unsure. Normally when you get the position/job you've wanted for so long, you're supposed to be so happy....but I am just not.

Every time I hear someone talk about how their 20's were the best years of their life....but I'll have just 4 weeks of fun before I'm just an employee. Am I just being stupid? I'm sure lots of people work their entire lives. But I think that now that it's right in front of me....I'm really nervous. 

Is this normal? Am I just over-reacting?",09Sep2020,1

10,"Anyone have advice on how to help my 14 year old cat get used to (and stop hissing at) the new 2.5 year old rescue pup we just brought home? Our dog Ollie has been super well behaved and has only playfully lunged at the cat once, despite being scratched and hissed at regularly. He just wants to be friends with Misty (the cat).

It’s only been a few days since we brought our dog home, and I understand these things take time, but I’m worried about my cat’s personality changing to be one of those kitties who just hides under the bed and never comes out. He’s normally puppy-like in the sense that he just wants to be around us all the time.

Below are a few things we’ve tried so far:
1. Feeding on opposite side of closed doors
2. Letting the cat roam while Ollie is caged or gated
3. Vice versa of #3
4. Giving Misty Ollie’s chew toy to cuddle with and get used to the scent
5. Giving treats when they both have a positive interaction with each other (no hissing or whining)

Misty shows signs of curiosity, but Ollie is a lab/collie mix (so medium sized dog) and can be seen as a threat in Misty’s eyes so he’s very cautious.

We ultimately just want everyone to get along well enough to co-exist in the same room and be happy in their forever homes :)

Any advice would be super helpful!",09Sep2020,1
11,"Hi guys,

So when moving into a new flat with my mates I instantly went to set up my bills Gas, Electricity, water etc.

Water was fine to set up and we have paid it regularly and on time.

However... when attempting to setup my Gas and Electricity bills, I called up the gas supplier and gave then the address, and they asked me to send them the meter codes on both meters, because for some reason there were 3 different meters for both gas and electricity linked to this address and they couldn't tell which were the correct ones. They said that I'd have to call them back within 10 days or our gas and electricity would be shut off. 

Now me being me, I completely forgot to do this, and didn't remember until about a month and a half later! However our gas and electricity was still working and has been doing till this day. I didn't call them after the month and a half or forgetfulness because we all stupidly thought ""well if they haven't worked it out by now they never will"" and now we are reaching the end of our tenancy a whole year later and I am worried sick that as soon as the new tenants move in we will be caught by debt collectors or something.. any advice??!!",09Sep2020,1
12,"My mother has serious health problems which will plague her for her entire life as they were caught too late in life to solve. We have an okay relationship, but I live several thousand miles away from her and the help I can offer is limited.

Yesterday, she had something happen which means she will need an MRI and she's begging me to pray that she'll get one soon. While I hope she does get one soon, I do not see any way I can actually accelerate the speed at which she will get the MRI. 

The problem is, she's religious. You can show her all of the data you want and she'll never understand that you cannot rearrange reality to your whim by invoking the name of a Jewish carpenter and demanding stuff from his dad. She wants me to pray that she'll get her MRI faster. I am not religious, I do not pray, nor will I since in my eyes praying when someone needs help is an insult to that person. It is a refusal to provide actual assistance which also removes blame from you for not helping because ""Oh, well I asked god to handle it.""

I'm not going to insult my mother, nor am I going to lie to her to spare her feelings. How do I polity inform her that ""hey, you know I'm not religious. I don't pray. If there is anything I could do to help in addition to sending you a card, flowers, and calling to check up on you, please let me know."" without causing her undue stress in an already stressful moment?",09Sep2020,1
13,"so last night three of my coworkers had a get together and i end up getting trashed. we had a lot of fun all night playing dress up, drinking games, going swimming, etc. anyway we all laid in bed together and talked about how bisexual we all were. the girl laying in front of me (the one i ended up sexually assaulting,) was really pretty, had admitted to me she used to have a crush on me and was just all giggly and cute all night. i knew she has a boyfriend but she was just so close to me and we were cuddling so i started running my hands all over her and kissing her forehead and being all close, she never said stop and she even held my hand. she ended up having to go home shorty after that because she was too high and having anxiety and missing her boyfriend. so this morning i felt bad and messaged her apologizing if i crossed any lines and she told me that she felt incredibly uncomfortable with the touching but she was just too high to tell me to stop, that she's spoken with our supervisor and asked for us not to be scheduled together anymore, and that she needs to take space from me. i apologized told her to take all the space she needs. i feel disgusting and i hate myself.",09Sep2020,1
14,"Seeing my sister gives me immense anxiety &amp; I have decided that it would be best to get some distance. My Dad doesn't quite get it &amp; frequently tells me that it makes things difficult for him, which I do understand. He wants to do family meet ups (myself, my Dad, my sister &amp; her partner) which I'm firmly against attending.

To explain: 

I've tried to have a relationship with her for a long time. Getting in touch was always difficult. She would only get in touch late night asking me to meet her at a bar &amp; usually expected me to drop everything &amp; be there in under 30 mins (sometimes saying things like 'but I need my sister' if my response was 'I'm sorry not tonight')
 
I'm not a big drinker &amp; found it incredibly stressful to deal with her when drunk. I tried to set boundaries/asked her to hang out or do things that were more planned &amp; didn't involve alcohol to little success. With these being the only times I really got to spend with her one on one or with mates a similar age (mid 20s)  I would usually end up going when she called even though I didn't feel comfortable with it because otherwise I wouldn't see or hear from her.

She puts me down a lot sometimes in subtle ways if we are around other people. It feels like walking on eggshells &amp; my Dad also alters the way he acts around her to keep her from getting agitated. We go where she wants when we meet up, everything is on her terms.

She also lies a lot. Sometimes small things (like telling people our family is from a different country) which is nothing more than awkward when people ask me questions. Sometimes really big things (like telling me a co-worker had poured boiling water over her which had caused her arm to completely blister &amp; burn. She said no to showing me the wound because her 'jacket was too tight' but completely forgot about it after a few drinks, removed said jacket &amp; there was no wound in sight) these are just two examples, there are a lot more of the same severity. 

One of the last times I saw her, we were out at a bar with a friend of hers &amp; she told the friend that I was physically abusive to her as a child, just like, right to my face. This is categorically untrue, so naturally I defended myself &amp; asked her why she would say something like that. 

Nothing got resolved, it never does. She was even laughing at points while saying it. We didn't speak for a few days which isn't too uncommon. But I was really hurt by it &amp; decided to confront her as well as telling her that I'm not prepared to deal with a lot of the other stuff anymore either.

Like a few other times that I've tried to say enough is enough, she told me that essentially I was being toxic for messaging her while she was busy on a date. And that just because I felt a certain way, it didn't make it true. It kinda feels like whenever I decide to stick up for myself she becomes the victim &amp; I'm an awful person for saying or questioning anything. It's a total headf**k tbh.

I have a few friends that have straight up refused to be around her as well. But this was the last straw. I can't continue to be around someone that does &amp; says these things &amp; then puts me in a place where I can't even talk about it, even if it is my own sister.

Sorry for the length of the post, it means a lot to my Dad that he spends time with us as we are literally the only family he has but I really cannot cope with it anymore. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with a family member or situation like this? 
Thank you for any replies to this long post in advance.",09Sep2020,1

16,"Guys I need some advice. THis is long but please i could use the help from people who dont know me personally

My boyfriend is an addict. He is addcited to cocaine, hes spent so much money on it he couldve bought like 4 houses by now. Me and his family have been trying the entire time we've been living together to get him clean and nothing has seemed to help. We have a baby together and I am the step mother to his other child. I have built a strong bond with my step daughter. I have been raising both kids mainly on my own, I get up with the step daughter every morning and put her to bed everynight , feed her all her meals , comfort her when shes sad about her mom being gone working or her dad sleeping on the couch all day when shes here and hiding in the bathroom all evening. since weve been under the same roof while he hides in the bathroom and smokes and drink and does blow even when i have asked him to at least smoke outside. sometime she will stay in there for a couple days at a time, until he decides to sleep for a day or two on the couch. He wont work often , doesnt really help around the house, doesnt pay for anything. I gave him 900 in rent to give to the landlord about 6 months ago and he spent it in the city, partying while i was home with the girls. He does not share a bed with me , sleeps on the couch. BUT, when hes off the shit, hes such a good dad , and good to me, for the most part. Our baby we have together is such a daddies girl that if shes away from him for too long she freaks. Now, that being said. I left him a bit ago , and because of it, he smashed all of my plates , threw my stuff around, and told me ""my ex shoudlve beat me harder"" and still thinks its my fault for making him that mad.

Now hes supposedly on the change and ive been trying to make it work for the sake of the kids because , when i lose him , i lose my step kid too. 

Now also with this being said , i have enough money in savings to get me out of here and an apartment lined up for mid sept.

Now hes talking about going to rehab because he  says he cant do it on his own. But i dont think i want to keep fighting this anymore. I dont know if I should stay , or just give it up and get the hell out of here... If i go i lose my family , Id still have my daughter , but id lose her sister. idk what to do",09Sep2020,1

My landlord has received a lot of complaints about my neighbors yet they have done nothing. I want solid evidence in case we decide to break the lease over this. 

So, for context, my neighbors have been awful since we moved in. We had to call the cops on them for being extremely loud from 3-5:30am once. I'm not a Karen or anything, but they stay up to 2am most nights being *extremely* loud, and both my boyfriend and I work early morning shifts. We complained to the landlord and apparently so have the other neighbors, and the landlord said the other neighbor beside them also called the cops before we moved in. 

Just recently though she has started leaving garbage on our patio and putting garbage and just random stuff on our side of the privacy fence. We are also 99% sure they used our patio furniture when we weren't home as we found half empty beer cans right next to the chairs where someone would be setting them down. Their kids are on our patio and they have their guests and their dogs sit in our yard. I have a dog that's afraid of strangers and we can't even sit outside with him or have him pee out back because there are people in our yard, he doesn't bark or anything but I can tell it makes him uncomfortable. I'm fed up with this, its literally *every day*. It's just plain rude and disrespectful. 

Would a door cam be the best way to show the landlord? I also want to be prepared if we have to involve the police.

Things involving paychecks, research opportunities, interviews, emails from professors, etc. Would like some advice on how to cope and possibly be made whole or compensated by the university.

&amp;#x200B;

My s/o had been having issues with her school email account for a few weeks now and had been in touch with her school's IT department trying to resolve the issue. She'd been missing homework assignment, class scheduling, and overall important emails from her professors. Little did she know, this had been a problem ever since she started attending school.

Since she started living here in the states, she's been trying her best to keep up with the school's Computer Science program and has managed to survive mentally intact until yesterday, when she finally received a zip file sent from the school's IT department of the email's she had been missing for what she thought had only been the last 2 weeks, but ended up being the last 2 YEARS.

Keep in mind, she had been working her butt off trying to start her career early by getting involved with workshop leadership, teacher assistant positions, and research opportunities. Not to mention, she worked jobs on campus as well to support her studies and send some money back home for her family in Bangladesh.

Now that she's learned of missed job offers, interviews, even paychecks from her campus jobs, she's become distraught. I've never seen someone so happy to just be here in the states become just a shell of who she was. I'm unsure of the ways I can help her, other than emotionally and mentally, so I'm coming to you good people of r/advice. We could really use some support, anything would be great.",09Sep2020,1
32,"Idk where else to ask this. So I, a 20f, was swiping through tinder as I do. I got bored and turned my age setting all the way up. I decided to chat with some old men because I had nothing better to do. One of them offered me $100 for a few minutes of sexy FaceTime. So I took his offer, he sent me the $$$ and I literally just stood there fully clothed while he jerked off. He tried to get me to take some clothes off but I just claimed I was shy and he let it go. Then finally he finished. Now I have $100 in my Venmo balance. I don’t have any experience with venmo. Am I free to spend the money now using paypal? Or can he do a chargeback with his bank and try to scam me or something?",09Sep2020,1
33,"Opinion/Advices on what I’m doing

Hey guy. I’m 19 years old and want some advice/guidance on my financial plan from other people. 

I have a year left of community college before transferring to a 4 year university. This community college (high school to community college program) allows me to goto school free for 2 years and all I have to do is pay for books. I worked from junior year of high school to now and racked up $8.5k. I also got a $6k academic scholarship to the 4 year university for the remaining 2 years I have. 

So with that $8.5k: 
- I put $6.5k into savings. 
- I put $2k into stocks because the stock market was really low this week. (bought Tesla stocks, Workhorse, and Square stocks because I believe they will be worth the investment in 5 yrs) 

Do you guys agree with my financial decisions or should I change anything? 

Anything will help. Thanks! :)",09Sep2020,1
34,"My friends are so toxic. What should I do?

Hello,

my friends are so toxic. My friends group used to be: my cousin, person A and person B.

We all graduated HS together and I thought we‘re adults because we kinda stopped talking but still wished everyone well. Since October 2019, I have not done anything else than study. I only study for my medical school admission test.

Person B is a nice friend of mine but she really lies a lot and it was really bothering me. (Lying about guys, lying for 3 months over her prom dress being changed so I cant see it but coming in the same one then)I didnt say anything for years though.  

Person B informed me one day and sat next to me and told me Person A and my cousin laughed about me for  wanting to go to med school and how embarrassing it was, that i want to copy my cousin(she wants to go to med school as well but its not like everyone gets an admission, how can you copy that lmao and also WHO CARES I would‘ve been happy). People really dont have that positive energy for me at all and I really didnt talk to them for months(since October as I said).

I then texted my cousin, because she‘s also a relative. she screenshotted the entire conversation and send it to person A, and person A texted person B asking if she told me anything. That was enough proof, I cut them off.

Now after my med school test which didnt go well, I had to go to the hospital for a working experience (1 month). Didnt see anybody during that time but everyone knew and understood.I wanted to meet up with Person B last Tuesday. She kept cancellig on me because she was going through a hard time. I asked her multiple times if I should call her or come over, she didnt want to. I then drove to Berlin for 4 days because I was still depressed from how the exam went(didnt tell anybody because everyone was talking badly about me) and I needed to breathe. Person B just kept ignoring my messages and its just kinda disrespectful. On Tuesday she said that she was not mad, I then asked another 4 times if she needed someone and then she started ignoring my texts in the rudest way. I am honestly tired of people twisting the reality when all I do is isolate myself and study and even when I dont say anything PEOPLE STILL TALK ABOUT ME. I honestly just messaged her and said how I felt and if she wanted to end our friendship for whatever reason, then so be it.


what so you guys think? should i be sad?

tldr; My friends are randomly mad at me even though I dont talk at all and just sit home and study. They keep talking about me badly even though I thought that we‘re adults and that we‘re just busy. a close friend is randomly mad at me and ignores my texts even though I have been working for a month straight (medical field) and didnt have the time to talk about her.",09Sep2020,1
35,"Hey guys, thanks for reading this. I'm 20, F and I'm probably not coping as well as I hoped to.

I found this person online who I thought I connected with pretty well. About 2 weeks in when we sort of have a routine of messaging, that friend just breaks that routine without any warning y'know? It made me a little upset especially when the excuse was that the weather was too hot for him to reply. I could be overreacting but it felt like a smack to my self-confidence?

Anyway, I was upset and that paved the way for making mistakes. I called that friend's excuse pathetic and they could have said they wouldn't be available that day or something. That friend then said I was possessive, frightening, etc which really was unexpected and stung.

My first instinct was to hit back because it was infuriating how this was turned against me. So, I said ""Are you gaslighting me?"". Clearly a dumb anger-induced move because I got blocked right after. Initially it just felt like my pride was wounded but then it's just sorrow once I swallowed that pride.

This really bothered me because I've never been told all these things before. It's likely the same for them, so I sent an apology and offered to set things right. Of course, there wasn't a reply, I can't expect them to come back after that, it's a hard-to-swallow pill.

So it's clearly time to move on and if they do come back, then they do. All I can do is improve and make sure to never make that mistake ever with anyone else. I guess I got too excited after finding someone to connect so well with.

I've been trying to distract myself through a series of different activities from this issue and have already gone for counselling but nothing seems to help. The only thing I regret is probably not being able to talk it out and resolve our issue, which is impossible to do now since I'm blocked and all.

Problem here is that it's been nearly a month and I tell myself I should be alright but that painful bit keeps coming back like a constant reminder and I literally have to take deep breaths to chill out. This feeling is honestly eating away at my health. 

I haven't been able to cry which really removes my choice of catharsis. There's a lot of sorrow that I can't seem purge. I can't tell if I should forget all this or just let it be because I'm still quite fond of what used to be our friendship. Unfortunately, I can't seem to move past it. Send help",09Sep2020,1
37,"For a very long time, at least 20 years that I can remember, I've had a case of athlete's foot. I've tried soaps, sprays, powders, ointments, vinegar, and still I have it. Most of the time, if possible, I were open-toed sandals (flip-flops, slippers), as I spend most of my time living in the Philippines.

Two days ago, I was attacked by a small puppy on my toe. While I felt really bad doing so, I smacked the puppy away from my foot and had to hit it with a rock to stop it from attacking me again. I thought this was very strange -- being that it was a puppy and was so aggressive. The puppy didn't look sick -- actually, it was fairly fat for a stray dog in the Philippines. After the bite, which was barely more than a scratch, but did break the skin, I rubbed the wound with isopropyl alcohol and continued to my friend's house. At her house, her dog almost immediately came up to me and was sniffing the area the puppy had bitten.

This morning, while at the park, I started to worry that I may be showing signs of rabies, because the bite area started tingling. When I looked down, there were a bunch of red ants attacking the same area.

Is it possible my athlete's foot is doing something to these animals? Maybe the smell or chemicals is upsetting them?

Bonus: Can I do anything about the athlete's foot? I try very hard consciously to keep my toes separated -- especially after bathing or getting my feet wet, but naturally relaxed, there is very little space between.

&amp;#x200B;

Side note: While here in the Phils, I feed and care for sick and injured dogs, and Thursday I will be going to the hospital for rabies shots (as supposedly the hospitals are busy and prioritizing cases).",09Sep2020,1
38,So I broke up with my x a few days ago. Ever since then I’ve been trying to meet new girls. This girl on Instagram add me and was very flirty and it was nice. She asked me a download google hangouts and talk on video call. So I did( I’m a idiot) one thing to another now there’s a video of me jerking replaying on the video call to me. It really scared me I was pleading and begging not for it to be posted. They wanted 3800 dollars to delete the video. I have like 500 total so I try to get them down to 500$ and they said 1500 minimum. So then I called my dad saying that I fucked up and told him everything. He told me to stop talking to them and to delete the accounts. He gave me the ability to say fuck you to the extortionist. So now here I am anxious as fuck wondering if a video of me jerking off was sent to all my friends and family I follow on insta. Some black mirror shit. So I ask y’all how do I cope with this? How do I respond to those who got the video? Pls any help would be greatly appreciated.,09Sep2020,1

43,"Hey there. Sorry english is not my first language.

I have been living in the same  rented house for 7 years. Parties per se are not allowed in mi house by contract but we can still make dinners and invite people. The main problem is a neighbor that we have near us cause he complains about the  most tiny noise he can hear and he use it to bully us, say that we have no respect, and then call the police (he used to do it at first, but then he stopped, probably cause the police said it wasn´t serious enough.)   


So now, he just calls my landlord to scare us. Then our landlord text me about what this neighbor had said and tell us to be more mindfull. He never had threatened with evict us, but still I don´t like the posibility and having this guy on my back like I am a child. (we are all in our 30s)  
Through the years we have had problems with roomates that were more noisy.   


To put it clear, he doesnt live next door. My house has a back garden with a wall, and he lives behind that wall and a small patio. There are actually an elderly woman right next to us that never had complained about any noise and another couple in the other side, and nobody ever came except for this guy.  
 He is a man in his 50s that lives alone. He doesn´t seem to never have friends over or social life of any kind (surprise!) a loner.  


This last time I wa s hosting a night in with friends in the living room with music. No problem till they go outside to smoke for a moment. they tell me my neighboor had screamed at them to not talk so loud. It was 9pm on a saturday. Its totally legal to make noise till 11 pm more or less.  
Still, not happy with that, he comes to my door, and very angryly says to me that we are being very loud, and waking up other neighboors (a lie, cause nobody else complains) This man is like 2m tall and it gets very scary to deal with him. So even though I am right he still goes on  about respect and calling my landlord. (by the way, my landlord texted me saying he realized it wasn´t late on a saturday. And he knows this guy has issues of himself, he just wants not hearing from him I guess.)  


Another roomate recomended me to record him next time he shows up. I think I should call the police but I don´t know if they will believe me. I feel that I can´t have a normal life because of this guy, that is totally overreacting and I am running out of pacient. Any advice? I live in Ireland.

44,"I just got news today that my kitten (that I've had for a week) has a broken leg. The vet initially didn't catch it because she was walking, running,  jumping, etc. just fine. She did have a wound like she got into a fight but that's it. Now that the wound has healed, I had x-rays done and the leg is in fact broken. They gave me 2 options. Surgery to place pins/plates or amputation. The pins/plates surgery will cost $3k+. And the amputation will cost $550. I want to do amputation for money reasons and faster recovery with less complications down the line. My mom says if I amputate, she'll never come to my house again and will be pissed at me for making that decision. I work for my parents so I feel like tension between us will make work harder and family gatherings awkward. She offered to pay for the $3k surgery but knowing her financial situation and the fact that I hate people paying for anything regarding my life, I said no. She started crying and making me feel worse about my decision. What do I do? Still go with what I think is best for the kitten?

45,"My older brother, who is basically the last person left in my family I have a strong connection with and can talk openly with about most anything, that I have always looked up to, has just asked me how I would feel about him dating my ex. They started hanging out recently “as friends” and he thinks he’s developing feelings for her and she’s giving him loads of attention and he thinks there’s something there. 

Her and I had a very toxic, destructive and painful relationship and both of us were unhappy and unhealthy people at the time. When she dumped me I was in the worst mental state I have been in the past decade, and my brother was who was there for me when I needed someone to turn to. He heard a lot of the details of our relationship, and I’m really surprised he is seriously entertaining dating her. 

I have since moved on and found stability and have started a family across the county. My brother was to be the legal guardian of my kid if anything were to happen to us. Now, hypothetically, my ex, whom I have forgiven; but don’t necessarily trust, and don’t maintain a relationship could end up helping to raise my child.

I want to trust my brother, but this has come completely out of left field and immediately made myself and my partner feel pretty uncomfortable. He expressed he didn’t want this to get in the way of his and my relationship and that’s why he was approaching me before making a move rather than asking forgiveness. My initial reaction is it’s just cringey, hers too. My ex is no threat to her/our relationship, and it’s not an issue of being possessive of an ex, it just doesn’t feel right at all. It feels like a violation of a brotherly code or something. 

I was very open and honest and I expressed all of this to him more or less and it seems he feels like moving forward and having a relationship with her...he basically said he wanted to give me the option to veto, but that I passed on it when I told him he was an adult and could make his own decision. I’m not testing him, just feel like it shouldn’t be that hard to make what I feel is the right choice.

It is tough as I want my brother to be happy but there were some key words and things he said in our conversation that made it clear to me that he is not doing well and is lonely and probably pretty depressed. It’s possible I’m wrong but his attitude reminded me of when he’s been in the dumps before, as well as how I would speak about myself and my situation when I was at low points. I want the best for him and for him to find happiness but knowing the person he is trying to date (who I believe has been discreetly pursuing him for a while now) I truly don’t think it’s a good choice for him. It’s even possible it is a weird revenge situation as she has said multiple strange and passive aggressive things long after our relationship ended, and there was a very awkward business transaction between her and my current partner. 

2020 is fucked, I’ve been working the last few weeks at really putting an effort into finding my footing and reclaiming my mind from the shit storm of life and it feels like I just got dealt a big old pile of weird bullshit.

A few weeks ago I woke up with a sore right wrist (I’m a righty). I thought ‘no problem, I slept on it wrong, it’ll be better tomorrow.’ This, however, was not the case. It got slightly worse over the next week until it was no longer just an ache. At this point it hurt to rotate my wrist (turning my palm face down to face up, or like turning a door knob). My dad took me to an urgent care center and they took X-rays. Nothing is broken and they gave me a wrist splint to wear, but I can still turn my wrist in the way it hurts while wearing it. I had a regular doctors appointment a few days later for unrelated issues, so I brought it up to him and he suggested rest and anti-inflammatories. He also managed to get my orthopedic appointment (for my back) moved up to the 10th. I’m worried of what the answer may be, even though I’m 95% sure I won’t get my answer on the 10th. I’m worried this might need surgery, or I’ll be in a cast, or I’ll just be told to rest it more. My worst fear, though, is that they don’t know what’s wrong and will not be able to fix it. I don’t know what to do with myself in the meantime...

Way back when in the 7th grade, there was this girl who I really liked who was on my bus. She said/did stuff to me, and I was wondering if it counts as bullying or simply her being flirty.

She basically called me a nerd and made fun of me a lot. If I'm sitting with someone, she would go tell that person, literally right in front of me, of how sorry she was for him/her because that person had to sit next to me. My locker was also right above her locker, and sometimes my books would accidently fall on her. I was very clumsy and awkward as a kid, and I would apologize to her. She got frustrated sometimes. Sometimes when the bell rang and everyone went to their lockers, she would kick me in the shins and tell me to ""move move move"". She also kicked me a lot on the bus as well.

However, I had a mad crush on her, and weirdly enough I kinda enjoyed how she interacted with me. But now I look back and I'm getting second thoughts, and feel it wasn't right, whether I realized it at the at the time. I wasn't really scared of her, but rather I was attracted to her.

Anyways, I'll just get straight to the point, I had a fucking internet crush. I know how pathetic that sounds. I was on r/MakeNewFriends or one of those sort of subs, I clicked on the first thing that said, ""20f something something"", went to her profile, saw she was cute, and immediately went into simp mode. We never actually talked (She didn't respond to my chat request, although we did very, very briefly exchange comments on a few of her posts, and we followed each other) but of course, I started lurking on her profile and imagined I had some sort of a chance to, I don't know?

His mom is an addict and is only allowed to have one 2hr supervised visit with him per week (she has made many careless choices that put her in this situation: missing visits, relapsing on heroin every 6 months, using heroin while she was supposed to be watching him, no job, loves with abusive boyfriend, etc...). Recently, he has been asking questions like: “why can’t I sleep over at Mommies house?” Or “why can’t I stay with Mommy longer?” My s/o and I are struggling to figure out what to tell him, how much to tell him or how little to tell him. We don’t want to lie to him, but we also don’t want to be too honest. He’s only 5 years old so we think that too much information could damages him, but we also need to give him some answers to his questions because he is slowly starting to realize things.

62,"After being unemployed for 1.5 years, I managed to get a 6 month paid internship at a call center in a local council. After the 6 months, my team graciously offered a permanent position. My only experience prior to this position was working at Hungry Jacks. 

Before working for council, I had no idea of the magnate of work and processes and stuff that was undergone through council from aged care assistance through to engineering.  I’ve been working there for 8 months now and I still make mistakes, I put in requests to the wrong department, I ask people in departments to call a customer back, only for them to tell me I could have got the information from the website. At 20, I’m definitely one of the youngest employees at my council and the youngest employee for customer service. On top of all the information that I had no idea about and had to learn, I’ve had to adapt to covid and there’s mountains of information that old and new that I need to be aware of and I’m struggling. I’ve told my team leaders and they all say it’s okay and that I’m doing a good job but with other departments, I feel like they don’t like me because of my mistakes even though that haven’t voiced that to me. Some people have been sympathetic because customer service is a very difficult area to work in. I guess my question is, how do I get over feeling horrible for making mistakes? It’s getting to the point where I think the council is better off not having me as an employee. 

Tdlr: I’m still finding my job extremely difficult after working for the council for 8 months and continue to make mistakes, how do I get over feeling so horrible and thinking that people from other areas of council don’t like me/ judge me based on my mistakes?",09Sep2020,1
63,"Yes. I’m a 21 year old having an existential crisis. 
Yes. I know this is a very open ended/annoying question but i’ll explain. 


Okay so. Basically I’m wondering how does a person manage to pursue something in their life for longer periods of time? 
There are many things on my mind that I wanna do and develop (me to me: “hmm yes i want to draw and ah yes i want to create videos and oh yay i could also learn to program”) but I feel like whenever I have free time I get extremely lazy and I never do anything or I don’t do it for long. Its just easier and more convenient and all that stuff about short term satisfaction.
I feel like if I won’t ever develop as a person if I keep going like this. 

I think the problem is that in my mind going to college(or going to work when i have work) is “enough” so my mental state is fairly fine and my mind doesn’t feel like it needs to panic about me doing nothing with my life when I’m studying, but besides college, there’s nothing. 

I also turn around and see how many people my age are so much more talented/personally developed/successful and can never see myself getting into that mix so I give up straight away or don’t last long in whatever I’m trying to do. 

So, for the ones who are actually making something out of themselves, working on their interests, developing themselves as people, how do you do it?

65,"After graduating from college, I feel like I’ve lost my spark and energy. I am only 24 and I feel like I’m just not the same as I used to be. 

I feel like I was always on the go in college. I was going out, I was independent, and I always kept busy with my studies and friends. 

I graduated from college with a degree in communication studies in hopes of getting a job in PR, advertising or something with writing. I liked writing in college and figured it was the only thing I was good at. I had such horrible luck landing a job. I also was taking care of my father who was dying of cancer while my brother and mom worked. I worked at a diner twice a week only making $80 a week. The chefs would sexually harass me and I was too scared to say anything to my boss because those chefs have been working at his business for decades and I knew he wouldn’t fire them....Unfortunately my father passed away months after graduation so I put my job search on hold to focus on my mental health. I then got a job at a daycare that paid more than the diner and I was able to grow/learn. Don’t get me wrong, I like working at the daycare and it is much better than the diner, but I want to be able to utilize my skills and grow. 

I’ve always wanted to work with children and possibly get into elementary education but was scared I was not smart enough. Now I am studying for my GRE in hopes of going to grad school for elementary education. Despite myself making this huge move, I can’t help but feel meh. A lot of my friends are moving in with their boyfriends, getting engaged, or have stable careers and I feel extremely behind. I don’t have many friends at home. With Covid, I’m scared to travel and visit friends. Looking back two-three years ago, I see a different person with more energy, determination, and fun...

However, I just don't know what's giving him bad breath. Maybe he isn't brushing properly, or maybe he is eating snacks and I don't know about it. Anyways, his breath smells horrible.

76,"My little sister and I are super close. A few months after she turned 18, she shipped out into the navy. Now after less than a month, she is being medically discharged. She already had mild depression before she went in, but now it’s a huge depression. My parents were heartbroken hearing her on the phone as she sounded so scared and childlike. It breaks my heart, too being someone who struggles with mental health and even more heartbreaking that we are all states away from helping her. She’s coming back in a couple of weeks. In these few weeks, she is going to be psychologically evaluated further. Anytime that she’s able to do a phone call with my family, she’s unable to elaborate as the calls are time-restricted and someone is listening. I of course am incredibly worried that there are more things that transpired in the military before it became too overwhelming. 

With that said, my parents have tasked me with keeping tabs of her mental health since I am more in tune with my emotions right now, as they say. I’m more than happy to help my sister, but I’ve never been a willing “therapist”. I’m very much anxious on wanting to ensure I give her the right tools, advice, and support so she will be back on her feet. I don’t know how to approach her properly in regards to it whilst keeping the promise to my parents that she needs to be somewhat better in a week to star looking for jobs. 

I don’t know how to approach her on self harm, suicide, and depression even though these are things she expressed (has not attempted) during her evaluations. These are things that I am familiar with, but I also have self harmed and attempted suicide in my past. I’ve only been clean from self harm for seven months which makes my bipolar ass worried I might not be quipped emotionally for sensitive topics. However I do know I’m one that can at least openly, sympathetically talk about it. She’s also somewhat uneducated in mental health so that makes her case even more difficult. I want to know how to approach her in regards to these topics without accidentally shaming her, deterring her from help, or enhancing her negative perception of her current life. 

I also would like resources on coping mechanisms since I know mine are completely different from hers. She’s very much a homebody so outside activity is her worst nightmare. I want to encourage her to be more proactive to help her mental health, but without pushing her to do things she doesn’t want to do. 

I’ve talked to my parents about sending her to a therapist, though I know we need to do work at our house so she can see it as a safe space. I just want advice on how to approach her in regards to mental health and how to work through it from the familial end. 

Since I’m doing school online and working four days a week, I have plenty of room for her and I’d like to utilize that room as much as I can so I can see my little sister smile again. I’m just really, REALLY sad with how scared, shy, regressive she was on the phone which very much opposes her usual abrasive, cold, but silly, loving, and aloof personality.",09Sep2020,1

78,"Well, you're probably thinking I'm about to ask the neighbors to come over for our get together with our friends. Well unfortunately I'm not. Lol 

We have a planned day this coming Saturday evening to have a little ""Coachella"" at our house because we all missed it this year. So the reason why I ask is back when we had moved into our new home (newly built in a really small neighborhood) last November we had a ""little get together"" or a ""house warming"", some music, some food, some good times a couple months after the move in. It was our first house! So it was bound to happen. I was out on our patio about 10pm and the neighbor politely asked if we ""could turn down the bass. The music is fine, just the bass is all."" So I quickly ran inside and turned down the bass as I could easily do so with our stereo system. I then found out how loud our bass actually was and have ever been since aware of how loud we keep our bass and music over all. We love our music so we play it a lot. And I also dont want to be a rude neighbor no doubt, were not like that. We're a little introverted ourselves to make this upcoming question awkward. But we're not here to make enemies lol. We only met once and this was after that get together and they have never attempted to make eye contact with us when we see them. And its a bit often because we have the mailbox right in front of us across the street. We say hey and do attempt to make eye contact for some kind of interaction but they give fake smiles when I do get a wave or hi.

So this is where.. anyway about month ago (6 months pass) my wife was trying to connect back to our WiFi and had noticed another SSID being broadcasted and it was named... ""TurnYourBassDown"". I was a little confused, laughed a bit, but i connected it all fairly quickly pointing to our neighbor that said that exact quote. So I walked around our house testing the signal strength to that SSID and it gets stronger towards the now what we see as passive aggressive our neighbors. I'm totally cool  and respect with whatever they got going. Exactly why I have been so aware of what are bass sounds like, just out of respect. The other side neighbors are cool and wouldn't know how to change the SSID unless the kids did so. They literally just moved in. So they check out. 

Do I leave a polite note on the door informing them about the upcoming get together we are having, in which they may hear music? We'll keep the bass on the low no doubt. My wife is giving this task to me, as she decided she's letting the cool neighbors know. Ha idk if advice can be given. Just gotta let em know I guess. Or just invite them.",09Sep2020,1
79,"I am 23 F. My living situation is kind of unique. For the last five months, I have been living in a cabin-style building on my family property. I pay rent and help out with things around the property, but I live my own life somewhat separate from my family. I pay my own expenses and have a mini kitchen in the cabin that  allows me to prepare my food and store it safely. However, winter is coming soon and my cabin is not built for winter living; it is also not feasible to make it livable for the winter months because I live in an area of Canada that regularly gets temperatures of -10 C.

Look I (29F) don’t know where to start so I figure I’ll dive right in. My best friend (27F), who I’ve known since high school, has been having an affair since March. She and her husband (27M) have been together for 8-9 years (married for one). I can’t support her decisions anymore. When it all first started happening I tried to be the supporting understanding friend. Giving this whole situation benefit of the doubt that maybe she really fell in love with someone who wasn’t her husband which is unfortunate and sad and heartbreaking but if this new guy is who she wants I can only support her new life going forward, no matter how rocky the road will be. Well. It’s been months and she’s continued to live this double life with no end in sight. I was ready to support my best friend when I thought she was making a decision to either stay and confess to her husband or leave her husband for a new man, but it seems she can’t make a decision. Her husband has become like family to me over the years and it pains me to see what she is doing. Instead of calling me to talk through what she should do about this situation her phone calls have turned into bolder and bolder statements about her husband almost catching her and the fuckboy talking on the phone, face timing, emailing, how it gets harder to explain late nights at the office.... and I don’t know what to do. It is not my place to tell her husband but it’s breaking my heart that she’s being such a piece of shit and won’t make up her mind. She’s just a sitting duck hoping somehow this situation solves itself. 

I guess the advice I’m looking for is what can I do? I mean none of this situation is my problem but it has riddled me with anxiety.

I’m a new Teacher at a Montessori School for young children. There is a 2 year old boy (just had his birthday last week so exactly 24 months) in my class named “Matty,” and then his 4 year old brother “Nate” in the next class up.  Nate I know a little based off of the afternoons when classes may merge or during outside/ gym play. Matty I know well and adore. 

Well, I’ve always noticed that Marty and Nate act like they’re not even brothers.. Especially when compared to all of the other siblings we have in the school who actually play together and act like they love each other.

The worst I saw was today when Nate came into my class in the late afternoon when we merged. He got himself a chair and sat down next to Matty (they will always sit together but I have never seen them talk or interact otherwise..!?) and Matty said, “Hii” and reached out and put his hand on Nate’s arm, and Nate pushed his hand away and didn’t even respond to my sweet Matty.. (I say sweet (because he reallly is) but earlier today he actually tried to bite two other kids 🙃) 

So.. Is this just a case of sibling jealousy coming from Nate like my co-worker suspects?

She said that the parents are married, so my first thought of them maybe each living with a different parent has been ruled out. Also they are supposedly amazing parents. So I mean, what else could it be? They’re nice kids, just have 0 interest in each other. And now maybe I’m thinking Matty has been pushed away so many times from Nate that he has learned to just not interact with him..

Just curious on your thoughts of what this could be, and if it’s worth bringing up my observations to the parents? I’m sure they see the same thing at home right?",09Sep2020,1

I can buy clothes for almost nothing. I’ll eat one meal a day. I think I can live on almost nothing.

102,"hi

so a few months ago, probably in may or maybe june (my sense of time is blurry because of quarantine), i started having these really vivid visions. almost like dreams or nightmares, except i couldve sworn i was awake. in both instances i was sitting on my bed in my room. in the first dream, there were four demons. three of which were zipping around my room, possessing inanimate objects and contorting them into hideous unrecognizable gore (the most grotesque was when one transformed into my wall and turned it into moving human flesh while another turned into my windowsill and made it transform into a sill made from random assorted human limbs). the fourth demon, possibly the head honcho of the group, was talking to me and telling me that its going to make my life a living nightmare and a hellscape and that not even god will be able to protect me. the other hallucination/""dream"", i was still sitting on my bed in my room, and i was actively fighting against possession. while in my head, the demon was coaxing me to k\*ll myself and to succumb to death because everything is so much better in the after world. i will have all the things i cherish in the mortal world and more. every time i was about to give in, something would (for lack of better phrasing) snap me back out of it and clear my head and i'd say ""no, im not ready to die yet"" and then the demon would try to coax me back into giving in. this happened repeatedly, with me falling in and out of the demons hypnosis and consciousness, until i finally snapped and yelled ""no!"" and i ""woke up"" from the ""dream"". both of these dreams happened in the same week, so after the second one, i followed the advice of my roman catholic mother and i put salt in the four corners of my room and prayed for the cleansing of each individual corner and finally the room in its entirety. 

&amp;#x200B;

everything has been mostly fine since, up until now. every now and then id get uneasy or feel like im being watched, but then id immediately say ""goodbye"" or ""go away, i believe in christ"" and i'd be fine. in the past month or so though, i had a bad falling out of my christian faith, and about a week ago, i started getting similar visions. a few days ago, i was convinced i was actively being possessed. 

&amp;#x200B;

i fell asleep around 12 am i think and i woke up randomly at 3 ish am and  couldnt go back to sleep. i kept falling asleep for like 5 min and  waking up again. at one point i thought i heard someone behind me, and i  got a lil freaked out. i kept panicking but trying to convince myself  it was nothing since i didnt hear anything again after. and then maybe  half an hour later after that noise (around 5 am), i heard this really  weird loud noise so naturally i hid under my blanket cause i was mad  TERRIFIED. and then i had like this weird thing and i started speaking  in french? but i wasnt talking??? but like i was talking about paris?  and as soon as i spoke, i had like my whole body spazz out and i genuinely thought i  was going to die. i dont even know how to describe it. i wasnt in  control of my movements. i was paralyzed but i felt my body writhing  around, almost like a seizure. it felt like something was trying to come inside of my body. i  could hear myself speaking and i was moving, but it wasnt me doing  anything. i remember at one point i tried to hold my breath because i  was hyperventilating and i wanted to get my heart rate to slow down  since i was getting crazy light headed. i tried holding my breath, but  my lungs kept filling up, even though i \*was\* holding it. it was like  something was breathing inside of me. i remember i kept thinking ""god,  god, i need you"" and then finally it stopped a little after. the whole  thing must have lasted anywhere from like 30 seconds to 5 minutes. and  it freaked me out so much. i couldnt go to sleep at all after that. i  did get super lightheaded at one point though and i thought i was gonna  pass out. my natural assumption would be sleep paralysis i guess?? sleep paralysis, except i was moving and talking and i couldnt see anything. whatever it was, it freaked me out. i 100% thought i was getting possessed. i  literally cannot stress enough how much it felt like something else was  inside of me and forcing my movements. i felt like a puppet. like it  felt like something was trying to inhabit and take control of my body. maybe this was me having a weird mixture of being half awake and asleep where im actively dreaming, but i still have motor functions? 

something similar happened to me last night. i fell asleep at 9 pm, and woke up at 10 pm and i couldnt fall back asleep. at 2 or so am i was finally tired enough to fall back asleep, and i almost did when i heard someone talking and walking around my room so i sat up in bed and screamed. nobody was there. every time id start to get comfortable, id feel my body seize up all over again, just like it had the other night. finally i was able to fall back asleep, but all throughout the night i kept waking up and having very vivid nightmares. im now terrified to go to sleep.

&amp;#x200B;

im not a big believer in the supernatural or demons or anything, but is it possible that i could be dealing with an otherwordly spirit? or is it a weird psychological issue? im more apt to believe the latter issue, so if someone could give me some advice or inkling to what im experiencing other than demons, i would be so grateful. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: i dont even know how to sum this up other than i think im being possessed but id very much like someone to give me a more plausible alternative haha

105,"This is a throwaway. I am sorry for any formatting/ grammar/ spelling issues I am on mobile and typing this as fast as I can on my break. I just really need advice. Please don’t share. 

Background: I (21f) have a very toxic mom that I have finally gotten away from and have set boundaries with her. I love her and I am finally starting to build a health relationship with her, but she can be very manipulative and selfish. I don’t want to go into it much but she does the whole “I am going to kill myself...” thing. The worst was when she told me she would kill her self if I didn’t give her a large amount of money every month. What hurt the most was that I believed her every time and it is only in the last few months that I have truly gotten away from her and her toxic behavior. 

Actual issue at hand: I am in a 3 year relationship with BF(24m). He has a very toxic father(TF). His father and my mother are very similar in toxic behavior , but I think his father is worse. 
Bf and I just got an apartment together 1.5 months ago but BF is just today moving in because of TF. He has been telling BF that he will kill himself if he leaves. For the past three years I have been trying to give bf l support when it came to his father. I have given advice on what I could and given him all the resources I I knew of and offered to look for solutions with him. I forgave every time one of his fathers demands came above me and our relationship. I have really tried to just be there for him and help him understand that no matter what he does he is not responsible for his father or his actions. And I am honestly so proud of him for finally moving out of his dad’s. I know that this was a really hard thing for him to do. But I don’t feel like I have any more left give. I feel drained from this relationship and I don’t want to be in it anymore. I am out of chances. I feel like this past two months of him saying he would move in next week, and then turning into the week after that, was the last straw. 

I am just so tired of feeling like I don’t matter. I am tired of helping him and not getting any help from him. He didn’t support me through any of my process of getting away from my mom. He haven’t be available to give me any support of any kind in the past year. I have been stood-up Morse times than I can count. I have been ditched to many times, including when I what having a mental break down and was crying and all I asked for was to be held for a while. I have been stood up by him at family gatherings plans months in advance for drinks with coworkers. And I have been ditched on dates before because his dad called and wanted him to come home. I am tired of talking to him about it and seeing no changes. I am tired of his sexist jokes and racist thinking he picked up from his father. I am tired of him allowing his friends to make inappropriate comments on our sex life around me. I feel like I had a basket for of love and support and chances but it is empty now. One of our issues was we wanted to love together for a while and he never did anything. We would go and view a place and we would both like it and I would fill out and appreciate and he never would or if he did fill one out it would only be half done. And I am happy that it is finally happening but it just feels like it is too late. 

I finally broke and realized that I no longer wanted to be in a relationship with him about two weeks ago and now I don’t know what to do. My name is on a one year lease with him and I can’t afford the place by myself and I don’t have enough money to move. I can’t go back to my moms but I don’t have anywhere else I can go. I think he could afford the place by himself if he stopped spending so much money on his hobbies and eating out all the time. I also feel like it would be mean to leave him when he is finally starting to really make and effort and set up boundaries with his dad. I love him and care about him but I just don’t believe any of these changes are going to change the way I feel about this relationship. I know that if I stay with him there are just going to be more issues with his dad and I really don’t have any more energy for it anymore. I just got away from my mom and I just want to heal and process it, and his dad is just to similar to my mom. 

I don’t know how to go about what to do next. I don’t know where I can go or if I should just stick it out for the next 10 months and see if any of the changes actually stick. I just don’t know what to do but I know I can’t keep feeling like this.

109,"I (28F) graduated college in 2014 and since then I’ve been living at home with my parents. At the start of 2019 I finally got a secure job that pays well enough to enable me to move out on my own, and since then I’ve been saving up as much as I can after having my savings wiped by a few previous job losses. I have about 6K saved so far, and for the last few months I’ve been taking a rent payment out of every paycheck to simulate having to pay rent. Today I submitted an application for an apartment, it’s affordable in a decent area so I wanted to jump on the opportunity. I make about 3.5 times more a month gross then the cost of rent, which includes everything but electric. I’m pretty confident I can afford it and I’m going to try and keep as much of my savings as possible as an emergency fund. If I do get the apartment I applied for and sign the lease the move in date would be mid December which gives me even more time to save. 

The issue I’m having is my parents are planning on downsizing from our house to an apartment very soon after I move out. Our family is very small, and both my grandmother and my aunt and uncle have already done so. I guess the fact there wouldn’t be that safety net of home to fall back on is making me question if I’m really ready. When I told my mom I submitted an application she said she didn’t realize I was moving the process along so quickly, and I’m unsure if she’s right even though moving out is something I’ve wanted to do for years. 

I can’t help but worry that I’ll sign a lease, move out, and then somehow something will happen I didn’t think of or cost more the I thought and it’ll mean I can’t afford rent and I’ll be SOL. I don’t have any friends I could move in with, so if I were to try and find a roommate it would have to be a stranger which I would rather not do.",09Sep2020,1

111,"In my school parking lot, I was backing out and didn't realize another car was parked too close to me. I caused a scratch a couple inches long that I think was pretty deep. My car doesn't seem to have any noticeable damage, but I feel so bad. The problem is that the car's owner completely saw me scratch his car. I drove away before actually registering what happened. I'm planning on emailing him tonight and offering to cover the cost. My scratch, unfortunately, seems like it scraped the paint off and into the metal. About how much would this cost to fix? 

I also feel guilty because if he didn't see me do this and we weren't parking spot neighbors for the next 2 months, I would probably not tell him or offer to pay. 

Is this the right decision. I should tell him? The other issue is that I'm only 99% sure that the guy who saw me scratch his car was the owner of the car. I don't want to make it worse by admitting that I scratched someone's car to the wrong person. It was my school parking lot, so a lot of kids were walking around and waiting for their friends.

About 30 minutes ago someone who I considered a friend sent me an un-titled video telling me to ""just watch it"" on Discord. It wasn't until after I saw this I found out about a certain tiktok video being spread by people online currently. I won't go into details as I don't want to trigger people, however the video was trimmed and it only showed the actual suicide.

About 4 years ago I slipped really badly with my mental health as I used to work in a train station cafe and witnessed someone commit suicide in person. Wasn't great however I got over that after a year or two. Now this was a video so it's not as extreme as how I felt back then, and of course I guess I am now somewhat desensitised but there are also a lot of feelings I currently have that I remember having back then too. Especially sounds and I feel like it's bringing back sounds from the past too.

Do I simply try to ignore this and keep my heading in life, or should I go to speak to someone incase this builds up? I'm not really sure what's the best choice as I'm turning more apathetic the more I think about it and this is how I used to bury stuff away in the past.",09Sep2020,1

My husband lost his job, we were struggling and his mom who was recently single (was living with some guy we didn’t know but broke up after a few years) told us she’d love if we moved in with her. She was lonely, had plenty of space and could use the help since she has a condition, plus she wanted to be with her grandkids etc. It all sounded great so we agreed to move in with her. 


We have been here for a couple months. I pretty much do all the housework which doesn’t bother me in the least since I not only do it for myself and her but for my children. I pride myself in being clean. I sweep, mop, do dishes, take out the trash. I even clean her car and do her laundry. We buy all the food and I’ll cook meals for everyone including her. My husband found a good job and we have been saving to leave if need be. Me and my mother in law have grown close and as such she confided in me that her last relationship was really abusive.

That the man she was with would yell at her, call her names. He used to be in jail. And that he didn’t have a job and every paycheck she had, he’d take from her to use on liquor, drugs etc. He also wrecked her car. Wouldnt call an ambulance the day she fell. Doesn’t have a license so she had to drive him everywhere.  Would call her job constantly to find out where she was or to ask for something. Tried alienating her from her siblings and kids (two of which haven’t forgiven her for it apparently) the list goes on and on. But because she was lonely and has low self esteem she never kicked him out until she found out we needed help. I offered her a friendly ear, would hug her and tell her it’s over now and that were here. Back to present time...

He’s apparently come out of the woodwork and has been calling her months later and asking her to take him places because he’s close by . She is paying for hotels for him to stay in, buying him food, driving him around. All the while he’s still talking shit to her saying “she can’t do anything right” “she’s an idiot” He’s trying to get back into her life inch by inch and I know bc she will come up to me and tell me these things. I told her as long as we live here I do not feel comfortable with him around but she’s a grown woman and can see and talk to whomever she wants no matter what I think about it. My husbands also spoken to her and said he will not allow that man in the house or around our children. And she agrees so she doesn’t let him come into the house. They meet up in the driveway and leave. The problem is this man is now telling her lies saying that he thinks we are hitting her pets. That we only want her for her money. Just filling her head with bullshit to try to get her to hate us. She confides in me and tells me these things and I can’t fathom why she still sees him despite what he’s saying about us. I told her he’s trying to alienate her again. But no matter what I tell her it’s like she can’t say no to this man. And has even gotten upset with me when I roll my eyes and tell her she shouldn’t be seeing him which hurts my feelings because this is the same woman who cried in her room with me saying that man took years of her life away. My husband is angry at her now and wants to move out as soon as possible because he doesn’t trust her judgement and the fact that she’s getting us, including the kids, in the middle of a bizzarre and negative situation. I agree we need to leave ASAP, no doubt about it, but a part of me wonders if we should do anything else besides leave..should we keep getting involved in this grown woman’s love life and talk her out of seeing him or just leave and let her sort her own life out?",09Sep2020,1

My description:

* Introvert
* No friends
* Perfectionist
* I have passive income
* I don't go out - I don't have reason to go out. I don't have things to do out alone. I can imagine that *with* someone going out could be interesting.
* Hobbies: Games, programming, internet etc. - I spend all time at computer
* Sometimes lonely and without motivation - for these reasons I believe that it is necessary to have some girlfriend or at least friend
* I am otherwise pretty satisfied with myself

Problem is that I want to have girlfriend or maybe at least friend. And I really don't think that I am in situation, when girlfriend will magically appear as someone could say.

What I did:

* I am registered on different dating sites. Problem is that many sites are somehow dead with low amount of active girls. I write message to some, but it is not very successful. Sometimes one write to me, so it is not completely bad. But I see it as very unreliable way to find girlfriend.
* Tinder and similar: I really don't like it. They require my photo and I really don't like to put my photo in internet. And also they require that I will like many many many girls. What I really don't like. Though I spent some time in this sites.
* One chat site with random strangers. I found some girls there and then I talked with them in this chat or in other sites, when I got their contact.
* So I have in contacts some girls that I can talk to them. Though I don't talk to these that I get before. And generally I was pretty passive in conversations. In general, I left the initiative to them.
* Then I go to this chat even today. But it is problematic. In this chat I spend lot of time by just skipping men that don't want talk to me or there are many very very young persons. And I can spent big part of day here. I think I am kinda addicted. But I see it as big waste of time.

So it is nice that I can talk to some people in internet. But I want to get some people in real life. In internet are many people (majority) that are too far from me.

And *maybe* I don't need these people necessarily now(?). But I want some good strategy that will probably give me some real life people over time. Like when I will go to gym I will probably get some muscles over short time.

And in internet is many advice that maybe can work for someone. But I need something that will work for me and I need to believe that it will work.

# Ultimate goal

To have girlfriend.

# Alternative goal

Be satisfied with myself that I do *enough* to get girlfriend in not too far time.

Hey all, I wanted to ask for advice on something that has been weighing heavily on my mind recently; I have recently returned from a year abroad in Belgium, and I am now enrolled in an american university. With the recent commitments that I have made (car loan, university tuition, and new job as an electrician), I am starting to feel as if the window to return and study in Europe is closing (if not, has already closed). I want to ask your advice on the matter.

From a financial point of view, from what I have been told (and from what I still have to figure out), it seems to me as if student life in Belgium will turn out to be cheaper than in the United States. My host families informed me that the maximum a foreigner could be charged for tuition would be around 5,000€ per year. Another exchange student who had decided to stay told me that most students are able to find part-time jobs that pay a minimum of 10€ per hour (and that there are higher-paying jobs out there). I am still finding out how much the other essentials will roughly cost in order to put together a rough budget and see its viability.

In the United States, it seems that with my current job, and my hours, I should be capable of paying off the essentials (except for the tuition, I have not set up a payment plan nor run the numbers).

I fell in love with Belgium, and the way of life in Europe. Ever since I had gotten back, I find myself criticizing a lot of aspects of life in the United-States. I feel as if I can’t be impartial in the situation, because all I know how to do is to look at things from a financial point of view, since there has almost always been financial struggle in my family’s history. I don’t know how to think for myself and make decisions such as these on my own. I want to be happy, and even before leaving the United States, I had had the idea that life in the United States (or perhaps around my family) always seemed to be a downer rather than something positive. There is always a new dilemma that occurs in the family that weighs on my mental health, and I feel that if I take myself out of this context, it would be to my benefit. I feel as if I will be happy in Europe, but a decision this big worries me about making the wrong move.

And so I would like to ask you for your advice. What am I not taking into consideration? I’ve dealt with indecisiveness all my life since all of my biggest life decisions were made for me, and so when it comes to this, I want to tell myself “I believe that I will not be happy if I stay here”. Am I wrong?

Thank you for your time and aid in advance.

**TL;DR:** I came back from a year abroad, and I regret coming back. Is it better to commit further to the United States or try to go back and study+live abroad.",09Sep2020,1
122,"I recently adopted a kitten (Eggy) with my Bf and we currently live in an apartment. We are both college students (he is an international student) and were living with my family and moved out near his school before it went online. We had both wanted a cat for a long time and having our place presented itself as an opportunity. During the school year we are relatively busy, but aren’t party goers and mostly stay in and study at night. Since his school is online, however, there’s nothing much out here to do and I am very isolated from my friends and family. I told my parents that we wanted to move back, which they were excited about, but told me I would have to give Eggy up if we wanted to move back. I have tried to tell her that Eggy is my BF and my responsibility alone but they still oppose. They seem set in the idea that I should surrender Eggy to a shelter, but my bf and I agreed that we aren’t going to give him up.

Some context: We had a cat before that was allowed outside. He got into a run-in with a coyote and it didn’t end well. We haven’t had a pet since. my parents (mostly my mom) seems opposed to the idea of Eggy living at our home mostly because my uncle’s (her brother) wife and my cousin are allergic to cats/dogs and would refuse to come to our home if we had a pet. They don’t come over to our home very often (every 4-6 months or so), but they would inevitably find out. Although we have tried to present other places that we could meet when we got our previous cat (restaurants, other family’s homes, etc), their opposition persisted and their interpretation of us letting a pet into our home is that we chose a pet over them. My mother fears that me staying at the house with my cat will provoke the same reaction.

All in all, I don’t know what to do or how to reason with my parents. In telling them, I knew they may not have a great reaction, but I didn’t expect that they would bar us from coming home with Eggy altogether. I really want to come home and spend time with my friends and family, but I’m not sure if my parents are going to budge. Thank you to whoever replies &lt;3",09Sep2020,1
123,"Long story short... i currently have a 2008 Nissan Altima. It’s a beautiful car cosmetically and has been extremely reliable the past two years. Then last week my transmission died literally out of nowhere (which apparently is common for Nissan). I paid $1,800 for this car and it would cost about $2,000 to fix it. Basically it’s totaled. I’ve been looking for a new car because i would rather just buy a new one than fix my Nissan to potentially have this happen again in another two years. 
I found a Subaru i really like (2010 Subaru Legacy) but it’s a little pricy for me. They’re asking $5,900 with a 6 month warranty. It has 130,000 miles. I scheduled a test drive but now I’m panicking. I have the money in my savings but it would leave me with not much left over. But i have heard Subaru’s are good investments and they last a long time. 
So, what should i do? Although my car is technically totaled, would it be smarter to fix my nissans transmission for $2,000 or buy the Subaru for $5,900 (i would try my best to get the price down a little if i went this route) PLEASE HELP.",09Sep2020,1
124,"At my family’s house, I lived with my parents, 2 brothers, sister, 3 nephews, and dog. About 10 people, and my other brother and his family visited often. Point is: I was never alone or bored at that house. Now, I live all by myself in a tiny, old studio. I moved for college. My classes are fully online, and they’ll probably be fully online next semester as well. I moved even though my classes are online because I thought it would be good for my overall well-being. I’m in my 20s, and I wasn’t super happy at my parent’s house. I felt stuck - like I met my full potential and it was time to move on to the next chapter. I was going to work on my health and future. Now that I’m moved, I want to go back. I have little to do everyday and nobody to talk to. My motivation to be productive is low. I’m just sad, bored, and lonely, and stewing in these feelings are making them worse. I’m scared that it’s going to progress into a full blown depression. I’m mostly missing my dog. I feel like she was my unofficial emotional support animal and I was her human. She was pretty much my dog, and I hate that I couldn’t bring her with me. Obviously I miss my other family members as well. 

I live only 45 minutes away from my family. It’s very hard to not go there every single day, and I can go there every single day. My parents said I’m always welcome and that I get to keep my room. The reasons I don’t go home everyday are 
1.) I do have schoolwork, and it’s much easier to do it here; 
2.) I moved all of my possessions to my apartment. It would be hard to haul a bunch of stuff back and forth; 
3.) I’m a poor college student paying for rent, gas, and bills. Going home everyday would be a lot of gas. I feel like I would also be wasting money on rent and bills if I’m not actively living at the place I’m renting; 
4.) everybody knows I’ve moved. I feel like I would be judged by them for some reason if I come home a lot; 
5.) I do feel like going home a lot will stunt my growth as a person. 
The issue I have is that I feel like my mental health and happiness would be better if go home often, which would make it worth it no matter what. 

My options are:
1.) go home very often,
2.) visit home less often, 
3.) sublet my apartment and move back.

125,"Personally I think I am usually a very logical and strong willed person. When I say I will quit something I will. 

However lately, I got my heart broken and am feeling very sad. I don’t need alcohol by any means, and I maybe only drink it twice a week, but when I do, WOW I feel amazing. It gives me the feeling that everything will be okay! I could easily stop drinking though because it’s not something is usually crave. I just drink it to accompany a meal but then when I do end up feeling the alcohol, it makes me feel really good.

128,"I'm 20 yo and I've been an atheist since around 17, before that I've always believed in God  without thinking much, but when I started to rethink my ""faith"" I came to realize that it was based mostly on fear, a little bit of hope and avoiding questioning religion.

I've had a rough childhood for many reasons and circumstances, which culminated on me turning atheist at 17, first it was liberating but then I started to get sad with the notion that life is so feeble and meaningless. I fear losing my loved ones, I hardly get excited for anything in my life anymore and I also have trouble sleeping.

There is nothing I'd like more than to have faith and hope again, I gave up on christianity once I started reading the Bible and I couldn't make excuses to keep believing with it being so human, incosistent and flawed, leading me to question myself until I became and Atheist, I can't see any logical reason to believe in soul, or heaven or hell, or any sort of Benevolent God when I look around and see the world around me.  


So I'd REALLY love some advice on how to get some hope back in my life, be it a solid reasonable reason for believing in any religion, God or benevolent entity,or anything that could help me feel any sense of hope and joy again.

131,"AITA for getting mad at my uncle about politics after he gave me a gift for my b-day?

My uncle (M50s) and I (F16) have always gotten along. He’s always been a generous person to me and my family, so he came over to give me a gift and wish me a happy birthday a while ago. While we were talking about the pandemic, the conversation drifted to American politics. Both my parents and my uncle are immigrants, and they have said and shown through their actions that they care more about politics there than here. That’s fine by me. They don’t know much about American history, which is expected given they grew up in a totally different country. 

He started talking about how Black Lives Matter doesn’t care about black-on-black crime in Chicago, George Floyd is a criminal not a martyr (he thought that BLM was building a statue of him in a nearby Democrat city), communists are spreading this propaganda to children like me and his daughter through TikTok (but he admits systemic racism exists &amp; Floyd died wrongfully). My dad started arguing with him; by the end he was mockingly agreeing with him and laughing.

I’m fine with people expressing their beliefs on policy. But politics that deals with morals is a dealbreaker for me. Up until then, I tried to explain to him that public execution is not how criminals are dealt with in America, BLM is a political organization that aims to end police brutality not all murders involving Black people, and TikTok is a national security threat because it steals data not because it disseminates ideas (all social media does this). 

This was the breaking point for me: I told him that slavery is still legal in this country under the 13th amendment as punishment for a crime, 41% of falsely convicted persons are African-Americans, and we have 25% of the world’s prison population but 4% of the world population. He did not know this before I told him about it. Right in front of me, he decided to say that slavery is okay if used as a punishment. When I said that Abraham Lincoln only freed slaves out of a desire to keep the Union together, he called it propaganda.

My dad and I share similar beliefs on human rights issues like these. He is the definition of a pacifist, but both of my parents told me to go apologize because we have respect him even if we disagree on politics. He said that they (my parents) don’t agree with my aunts and uncles on politics back home, but they stay in contact anyway; said my uncle was sad about what I said to him before he left (I gave him his gift back and told him to get out) and that he was just joking; said since my uncle already apologized, I should. I asked him what is the line supposed to be? Should I wait until he is pro-genocide? Now he won’t talk to me and my mom is taking his side.

I’m starting to think they’re right and I should apologize so things go back to normal. I feel horrible about what happened &amp; how I responded. Please understand our culture is not flexible about this. AITA?",09Sep2020,1

She eventually saw that i was a stoicist and was super cold,introverted and look unintrested in her (even though i was the polar opposite inside) and she moved on a now has a boyfriend which she has been going with a long time.

However i got reformed and a snap back to reality,my confidence has drastically imrpoved and im much more clearer in my itentions and if i had the same chance i would for sure take it.I would even have success if the COVID-19 situation didn't get out of hand and separated me with her.I was close to giving up,even though im deeply in love with her still.

However some very weird shit or ""coincidences"" have been happening,like meeting her randomly in my city outta nowhere after all the time in quarantine,and having experiences with her all by ""coincidence"".I might be selfish,but i really want her to be mine,and i don't know what to do currently,im pretty sure she has still her boyfriend but not 100%.

I had some short communication with her about 2 weeks ago which was amazing since we never spoke 7 months ago,however she looked very unintrested and didn't wanna keep a conversation going.I refuse to give up,i want to try my chances.

Even if she does i still want her,at least to be a close friend of hers at first.Her birthday is coming up soon and im planning on writing her a lovely message wishing her a happy birthday,in order to get closer with her and eventually maybe have her.Any suggestions or opinions on what to do?Thank you all in advance!",09Sep2020,1

I’ve seen that she is hardly on her phone at all... except for Saturday nights. I saw on one of her stories last week that she doesn’t want a bf, which is fine because I don’t wanna date within the next 2 months. So I’ve asked a couple of friends what to do. Both of them said I need to find ways to get her attached when texting. One of them said send fake streaks and type random stuff then delete it. The other said purposely wait a few hours to look at the messages she sends. 2 days ago I got really impatient and just decided to tell her how I felt and tell her that I understand she doesn’t wanna date and I don’t either, but I want to be friends and maybe see in the future if we date.

My mom lied to me that my dad was dead (and someone else, conveniently one of her close friends who had no living family). She told me the truth when I was 18 (now 23). She did this because he was abusive, and also very paranoid/delusional and she wanted to protect me. I wanted/tried to find him for a while but then gave up and figured it wasn't meant to be. Then we got connected through a mutual friend and talked on the phone 1 week ago.

I thought that he was super cool on the phone, but then he was texting me a lot and liking my FB pics. I know that he's always loved me/known I was his and is making up for lost time. However, he's very mentally ill. He said that his dad was killed and had an elaborate story. When I spoke with his brother, he said their father had a heart attack when they were kids. My dad told my mom a while back that his father committed suicide. He seems to have a ton of trauma related to his dad dying because his mother was very abusive, and re-married and basically abandoned him. He said that he's very lonely and supposedly only has a few acquaintances, and am thankful that now I'm in his life.

We talked on the phone, and I told him that this is a lot for me to process, that I love him and am not going anywhere, but that I need space, and would like to text maximum once/twice a week and catch up on the phone every few weeks/month. He said he'd give me space and let me reach out to him. But then he texted me the next day. I re-stated the boundary and he apologized, and didn't text me the next day.

He's in a different state and I don't think that he's dangerous \*knock on wood\* but idk what to do. 

Am I being too harsh and ungreatful? I wanted to talk to him 5 years ago when I found out he was alive, but now after finding myself and working so hard to heal and appreciating who I have, I don't really want or need a father... especially a very dependent one.

155,"Let me start off by saying that I am not depressed.

The idea of having to work an entire lifetime for just enough money to keep coming back seems like a vicious cycle. 

It feels like the matrix where I am imprisoned by the machines. 

It makes this life seem like the real hell for something bad I did somewhere else. 

It is like a prison sentence.

Now, I know that I can go chase hobbies, get friends, excel at my job, learn..etc, to distract myself from this ultimate truth.. but what is the point? Regardless of what I do, the reality will remain unaltered i.e. its a vicious cycle of working to cloth and feed yourself.

Maybe this is why I got addicted to Marijuana a while back. It gave me a great high. It got me excited. Normal life just does not do that. But the issue with devil's lettuce or any other drug is that .. the higher I go, the deeper I fall.

So what is to be done ? How did you, if yet, come to terms with this reality ?",09Sep2020,1

158,"(Sorry it is kinda long:p)
Okay so today was my first day of work, and like first day of work ever so I am kinda freaking out because of this reason. So the job I am going to work at is a retail store, and today I had to start with basic training online. So at the beginning of my ""shift"" my manager taught me to punch in and then ushered me to the break room next door to complete me training. She helped me log in and told be where to start and then said i could have my break at 6-6:30 and that she would be heading to the store floor and if I had any questions I can go find her. So okay I started working.
It was all fine until after my break. I went out to my car for my break and ordered something, ate, and headed back into the store, but when I was about to head to the back I relized i had no way to get in because I was in training and had no code to get in yet. So okay, my manager said she would be around so I tried to find her but couldn't find her anywhere, and I had no other way to contact her. The way I had been doing it is having a worker page her, but the store was so busy, I didn't want to disturb them so I decided to just stand by the door of the back room to wait for a worker to pass by, and it was fine because I had 7 mins left in my break, and someone walked by soon to let me in.
So I went to the break room again to do the rest of the e-training work, and I ran into more issues. I had questions on what to do next, where to have these pages printed, and more but I didn't want to leave again because if I did there was no guarantee she would be on the store floor, and again I didn't want to have bother the workers who were already so busy, so I just did what I could and waited to see if she would come back at the end of my shift, but she didn't. I headed out to the office to wait for her at the end of my shift to see if there was anything else she wanted me to do, and to see if she could answer my questions, but she didn't come, so I decided to just punch out and head to the store floor.
I then proceeded to look for her again to see if i could run into her, but I saw her no where and so I just left. Idk what I should have done, but i am nervous that my manager will be mad tmr cause I have to back again tmr, and my siblings and parents aren't giving me any hope or good advice. Please help what should I do tmr, what should I say to her, especially if she gets mad 😥",09Sep2020,1

The pandemic brought a lot of financial problems. Now, my fiancé (who made 2k a month) was laid off, and i work to pay the rent for both of us until he gets back on his feet. Now, my parents have trouble with work and my little brother will begin his studies and they asked me for money to help pay for his accommodation because ny mon was laid off too. Everything i had saved for 2 years i gave it up. Then my fiancé’s car finance/renewal didn’t go through, and i had to take out a loan in my name to help him. I love everyone and i’d give them money again. But because i get paid by the project, i have been working for the past 2 months everyday non-stop to cover expenses that i can’t cover. I pull all-nighters 3 days a week. I was wondering if you could give me some advice on how to stay sane and not be angry. My brother is 18, he doesn’t realize and he keeps messaging me about my opinion on getting a macbook pro or an imac. He never worked and it seems like he doesn’t appreciate me helping him, he acts like it was my job to do so. My fiance is saying he’s next to me whatever i need, but i don’t feel it.

The conversation was basically her asking him if he still loved her or are they just friends. He replied that he’s not her friend and they’re more than that and he mentioned that he deletes their conversations so his wife doesn’t see. 

I’m torn whether or not to tell my husband. I know it’ll break his heart, especially since he’s defended their relationship. I don’t like keeping things from him but it’s eating at me.

The only thing that's really changed about my appearance from before and after people started saying I looked attractive was that I lost weight, but the only time people comment on my weight/body now is to express concern about my health, so I'm pretty sure that's not it.

162,"Sounds silly but I’ve known this girl since literally kindergarten, been in same classes our whole life and we go to university together now. I’ve always liked her and we’ve been in Christian private school together with only about 150 people kindergarten through 12th so she’s a solid 9/10 blonde but everyone else there is ugly to be frank. We’ve been sort of on and off together before but in the summer after 11th grade we really got into it and we were together all the time. One night she’s with me and we finally get a clear window of time and we were making out like always but soon enough this time we were butt ass naked, we moved to oral and I asked “do you want me to get a condom?” And she was like “I’m alright” and fuckin dipped on me. It was so awkward and we never really got into each other again like that. We still are friends and are around each other almost every night. Wish I could shoot my shot again but she hasn’t shown as much interest and I don’t wanna make things worse than they already were. The problem is I just want her and her only. I really like her, not in an obsessive way but it’s weird because growing up in private school I never really was exposed to anyone else and I literally can’t remember a time she wasn’t there and any time I’m with another girl it’s not near the same. There’s hella sexual tension between us but a bad tension as well we don’t wanna fuck with our friendship and I thought it would be something I would grow out of but I haven’t been able to. I really wanna forget her in a sexual way and I just think it’s gonna be as simple and mentally blocking it but it’s not.

163,"I don't know if this is the right reddit page to post this on since other people have bigger fish to fry, but it was the first thing that came to mind so I apologize.

I'm a 16 year old female and I've recently been concerned about the amount of hair I'm losing on the daily. It started towards the end of 2018, but I always put it down to weather and stress. However, about a month or two ago I noticed that my hair has become worryingly thin. It used to be very thick but is now maybe half the thickness it used to be. I've tried many different things to help with the issue, and none seem to follow through with success. I'm going to leave a list of things I've changed, do, or have done to my hair just for further information:

·I dye my hair black only once a year so it has healing and growing time

·I stopped brushing my hair while wet and only brush once a day unless very knotted

·I started using cold water to wash my hair in the shower instead of hot

·I began taking vitamins to help aid in strength 

·I do a thorough conditioning once a week since my hair gets very oily very fast

·I barely experiment with hairstyles (besides ponytails) because my hair isn't long enough to do so anyway lol

·I trim my hair when dead ends occur (I don't have money to go to a professional don't come for me over it)

This is about it as far as I can remember right now, has anyone else had similar issues? If so, what did you do? Is this even normal?

165,"Hello!

I've previously had issues with my boss but they've been mostly resolved. He's overbearing and emotionally erratic. He's been emotionally abusive in the past but seems to think he's very good to me. Because he lets me take time off, hasn't been requiring me to be at work and helped me with HR once. He complains consistently about how much work he's doing and how tired he is. I've offered to come in numerous times to lighten the load. Literally every time he says he's overworked, I offer. But he says he prefers doing stuff himself. When he does call me in, I stay for whatever length of time and at whatever time he wants. I've never turned down his request for my presence.

Whenever we work together, he brings up how hard he works, how he's so great because he doesn't ask me to come in. I've offered to come in, so he's choosing to be so stressed out. I don't understand how it's my fault.

I went in today from 10a-3p. He has a habit of not letting me know about overtime, until I'm in the elevator. I completely forgot to double check with him before I left. I started to head down at 3:15 and he saw and berated me. I agreed that I should've checked and I'll make sure to do it in the future. When I got downstairs, he messaged me saying that he didn't need me the rest of the week and he'll be fine. I went back upstairs to talk to him.

I reiterated that I was sorry, that I was okay coming in to help him. He stated that me leaving was a clear sign that I didn't want to work and that he was doing so much more because he was in the office. I told him that I didn't appreciate that he held that fact over my head and that I was willing to work. He got extremely upset that I was implying that he was wrong, to the point of crying. He said I really hurt him and that he was dealing with seeing the office so empty. When I tried to explain, he interrupted me and said I clearly only care about myself. He said that me walking out was fucked up. He said I was wrong and he knew I was wrong.

After going in circles, I finally suggested that we bring in HR as an intermediary. That pissed him off even more. He accused me of only bringing this up because of my depression and that I needed to leave my emotions at home. I felt that I was pretty calm the whole time.

Finally, he angrily told me to go to HR. I know I was wrong about not telling him I was leaving but his response seemed extreme. Unfortunately, it's pretty par for the course. I'm considering contacting HR or just quitting. It's not a great time to look for jobs but his response was ridiculous. Should I work to improve our working relationship?

167,"This is gonna be a bit of a ramble so forgive me. Basically I've had the same group of like five (including myself) friends since high school (about 11 years now). I've always had mental health problems, mainly depression and anxiety related to my depression. Like a lot of people, this whole covid-19 situation has obviously exacerbated mental health issues, and I've been dealing with major imposter syndrome as I took on a huge project right before quarantine and it's the first project of my professional/academic career that has really given me a lot of trouble. I think I'm starting to realize my friend group is not good for my mental health. We've always been the ball-busting type, and our interactions thrive on bits as we are all pretty charismatic and funny individuals, but over the past several months as our interactions have shifted to mostly online, a couple have moved over to just being straight up mean, and on top of they have some weird idiosyncrasies where they'll just ignore others and leave people on read for whatever reason almost as if they don't consider what you said funny enough to even necessitate a response. On top of that, whereas we used to actually have friendly conversations, the last time I shared a success story about something I was really proud of, it got dragged through the mud a bit, which is fine, I've definitely done it too, but idk somethings different. I can't remember the last time someone brought up a topic that didn't immediately get put through the shredder.

 All of that being said I'm thinking of just dipping from the group as a whole, but I'm a person who likes to have a small group of close friends. Not to mention two of the group, we'll say M and his fiancee D, I would consider my two best friends. Can't decide if I should just give it some time, or if I should maybe contact M and D and just let them know I still love them but can't really handle the other two any more. I'll add D has expressed she is pretty much done with one of them as well. It would definitely be hard to remain close friends with M and D though, and basically drop the other two, as we are all the small close friend group type. Any advice for making a new group of friends? Obviously right now is a terrible time for that as well, which is another layer. If I was to dip, being a single person, in a career that's almost completely individualized work (plus I don't shit where I eat), I'd basically be completely alone outside my family who lives two hours away, with my parents back and forth living between two different states. I feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. It's a terrible time to be alone, a terrible time to make new friends, and a terrible time to be friends with my friends. Sorry for the ramble.

168,"I've lived in an apartment for a year and a half now. I understand that in shared living, shared noise is something you cannot escape. However, I feel this does not apply to my neighbor blasting his bass throughout the day such that no matter where I go in my apartment, I can hear it. I also feel this does not apply to his TV very clearly leaking through my walls at 3-4 in the morning and waking me up on an almost daily basis. I've gone over several times and asked him to turn it down, and it even got to the point where I had to file a noise complaint. After the noise complaint, everything was  great for about a week, until he threw this party 2 days ago and now the problem has gone back to persisting. I met with him several times again and even filed another noise complaint and it is still persisting. I wouldn't be as bothered by it if it stopped around 10 pm, but this persists until 4 am, and I'm a student just trying to get what little sleep I can already manage. I tried to get the people in the office to come listen to the noise, but instead of coming inside my apartment to listen, they just knocked on his door and told him to turn it down. I'm at a loss. I would've believed this is just a simply case of ""he mounted his TV and woofer and speakers on my wall so that's why it's the issue,"" but that doesn't address the music I'm constantly hearing, or the fact that for about a week I had no issues with him in the slightest.

170,"Hey everyone! Very first time posting and seeking advice. Also please excuse any spelling mistakes or grammatical errors, I am on mobile and working off no sleep.

Recently had new neighbours move in at the beginning of July, was very exciting to have someone move in next door up until we realized they are partygoers. To give some background they have had parties consistently (I mean our little street is full of cars kind of parties) since they moved in. In the beginning I assumed it was just housewarming but now it’s every other weekend of noise until 2 in the morning.

We are trying to be patient but we had our daughter the very last weekend of June. Nights are very difficult as it is and we treasure every second of peace we could get. To deal with this and raise a newborn is something I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy.

During their second party my husband ended up calling the cops to report a noise complaint (thanks to advice he had received here on Reddit). Also during this time they disappeared for a week but they thoughtfully left 6 bags of garbage. Our city only accepts one unless additional tags are purchased for the rest. Of course with them gone the remaining five were left for the animals to completely destroy and spread across our lawn. They tidied what was left when they got home but all directly in front of our place my husband and I had to clean to try to prevent the critters from sticking around our house.

This brings us to today. I am here, sitting at 11pm dead tired. Been trying to get my two month old to sleep since 7pm. Sleep is so hard to come by and I am feeling especially bitchy because of our new neighbours throwing yet another party. They are screaming up and down our street (at least it sounds like it) and all of their lights are on, making our bedroom bright.

Not to mention schools in our area started today, it’s a school night and there are a lot of young families that had moved in this past year. We can’t be the only family getting irritated with this.

My husband and I really don’t want to make a bad relationship with our new neighbours, we met them once and seemed really nice but I cannot take one more sleepless night of constantly soothing my baby only to immediately be woken up.

ThrowRa. I 21M dated a 23F for 3 months. I really liked her and went on lots of dates with her, I could tell she liked me back because she would set up about half the dates. She told me that she had trust issues so I made sure to make my intentions clear to not add to her trust issues. She asked me to ask her out (as in to ask her to be my girlfriend) and kiss her, which further made me believe she was interested in me. I asked her out and to my surprise she said to ask again in a month. I never did and started to notice weird behavior by her. For example she texted me she misses me and I texted her back that I missed her and she replied that, “enough we had our moment”. Then I realized she never asked me any personal questions. I brought up that maybe she just wants to be friends and she immediately said yes. 

I felt like I was being used a bit, I explained in person how I felt and wasn’t harsh. I had second thoughts about being her friend because I didn’t want to be strung along. 

To make a long story short, after the break up she started posting trivial photos and it really bothered me because I could tell she didn’t care and she dropped me like I never mattered. I blocked her, not to get back at her only to not see her posts anymore. 4 days later I texted her that it’ll be the best for both of us not to be friends and I wish her the best.

I respect everybody and i consider myself to be a very nice guy. 

What i mean is, for example if i see my friends are lifting heavy weights at the gym, i tend to train harder and aspire to increase my lifts. I don't like the thought of somebody else being stronger than me, or being able to lift more than me. Its more of a ""if they can do it, why can't i?"" sort of thing.

Or another example would be at work. If i see other coworkers are completing tasks quicker than me, or more efficiently than me, i tend to find ways to improve my work in order to be the best at what i do, because I simply am not happy with someone else doing things better than me.

179,"Look, I[19M] don’t care what or how you feel on liking loli porn (porn of little anime girls who look like children). I PERSONALLY don’t want to be/feel this way anymore and I don’t like that i do and want to change and i want to learn how.

I started looking at loli porn when i was hella young, when i was actually close to the age of a lot of those girls, but i just turned 19, i feel like i’m just too old for that shit and have been for a long time. I genuinely regret looking at porn at such a young age because of how it messed me up, I should’ve just let those innocent crushes stay innocent and not become fap material.

Granted i’m not addicted to it like those creepy lolicons or anything; lolis definitely aren’t, won’t and never will be my main type or anything. Tbh its not even really an obsession, i just personally find it unhealthy for a person my age to feel attracted to it at all. It treads the line of child porn so closely to me that it makes me uncomfortable around real kids (which is bad cause i want to have some someday and i can’t go to anyone for help with this irl for obvious reasons)so it makes me so ashamed to be attracted to it in any way. I’m not dumb, i know they’re not real kids and nobodys getting hurt, but i still want to be able to feel some level of disgust or at most nothing at all towards loli porn, i just don’t want to like it anymore, because to me personally, its wrong.

Its like when someones a bit chubby and wants to lose weight, they’re not saying chubby people or ugly or anything, they just personally don’t feel good with the body they have and want to make a change.

As i'm not going to be able to afford any upgrades i just decided that i'll donate my money for some COVID-19 Treatment campaign or a local food bank.

I am underage so they all decided it would be a great idea to get a fake id for me and they are convinced I won't get caught. My boyfriend purchased the id for me and I think it looks fake. I told him this but he says that i'm overreacting. I don't want to ruin their vacation by creating my own itinerary but I think I need to. I don't want to get caught and possibly face police but I feel like I will. He and his family are all set on drinking and gambling the entire time but I don't want to do any of those things. The trip is next week and I don't know what to do. My boyfriend told me that he wants me to stay with him the entire time because he doesn't want to be stuck with his family alone. I paid for my own plane ticket and his parents are paying for our hotel, and I hate to look ungrateful but I'm scared of the trouble I might get in over something I don't mind waiting a few years to experience.

She wants to do it cuz she thinks it’d be fun and silly, and I’m typically down for that type of stuff. However, I feel like the retrieval of the garter from under her dress would be incredibly uncomfortable to do in front of family (especially cuz both sides are pretty conservative). I mean it looks like I’m coppin a serious feel with all eyes on me😂

when they were done the transwoman said they squirted. the transwoman still has their penis intact

would that be some sort of deception and manipulation from the transperson so they could have sex with the guy since squirting is a term for female ejaculation?

is the guy at fault for not asking?

the guy is only interested in having sex with biological females.

192,"I met a guy on tinder two years ago and we finally started going out late last year. He has a slight disability with a radial club hand and I felt bad for him when he said every single girl has rejected him and he is a virgin. I was also coming out of a difficult relationship so I decided to try things out with this guy. Fast forward, I consummated our relationship in February 2020 and he made it seem like it was his first time. Turns out, he confessed to me sometime in May 2020 that he has had sex from 2018 - 2019 with multiple prostitutes from Asian massage parlors. They were naked, many positions, doggy etc. He told me he was in a dark place and that he had come to terms with the fact that he will never find someone and be alone forever. He was 32 at the time.  He went to get a STD check before we had sex in feb and the results were clear. That’s why he had sex with me. After many fights and difficulties, I found it inside of me to forgive him. Now it’s September 2020 and he tells me he is as monogamous and loyal as ever. I started bleeding after sexual intercourse with him. I went to see a gynae and my worst fear has come true - I have a high risk type HPV and they found abnormal cells on my cervix. My results come out next week and I’m shaking in fear and anger. I have never led a promiscuous life. I have only had two boyfriends, and sex with my ex boyfriend of 6 years. This is so unfair and now all the memories of him sleeping with the prostitutes are resurfacing and hurting me ever so badly. 

I feel worried for my health. Why am I being punished for his actions? He says he is guilty and will do everything in his power to make sure I get better. But I secretly resent him inside. I am crying everyday. Should I forgive him? I thought I forgave him but now due to this, I find it so difficult! Why, just why, would anyone want to have sex with 20 prostitutes from diff massage Parlours? I find myself googling experiences of “full sexual service” and imagining the positions. I keep asking him what has he done exactly - did they blow him? Did he touch their boobs? Are their bodies nicer than mine? Help me. I think im going crazy.   He maintains he wore condoms at all times then how did I get HPV from him! It seems as though HPV is not a STD test that can be screened for men. He said if he had known, he wouldn’t have had sex with me. 

My life is ruined. I really don’t know what to do - is he a bad guy? Are his reasons of loneliness and desperation justifications enough? What should I do!",09Sep2020,1

The difference is whilst my brother was diagnosed as a child, my housemate is a middle-aged man with no idea. 
The some of the symptoms of his ASD mean he can't hold a proper conversation which impacts his ability to make and maintain friendships as well as his ability to get a job as he would interview terribly.

So, I am a 13 year old girl. I live in a small town, no COVID cases yet. 

About a week ago, my boyfriend (M14) decided to invite me to his house. My mom let me go.

I arrived at his house, and he invited me to his room to play video games. When I got upstairs, he locked his door. I was a bit freaked, and I asked him what he was doing. He's quite a bit taller and stronger than I am, and he pinned me against his wall.

I was yelling at this point. ""WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?"" He just laughed. He grabbed my waist and slipped off my pants and panties. I was kicking him at this point, and he just pinned me against the wall. 

He let go of me for a second, and took off his pants. he did this weird hip manuever thing, then pinned me against the wall again. He physically grabbed me, and set me on the ground. I was kicking and punching, but he was completely unfazed. He shoved his penis into my vagina, and was mumbling all sorts of weird things, like ""Good little kitten"" and ""You're mine.""

Eventually, he stopped, and I ran out of the house.  I live about 10 minutes away on foot, so I got home pretty quickly.

My period was supposed to start around the 6th, but it hasn't. 

On top of that, I have been feeling really sick for the past few days. I've been peeing quite a lot the past few days, and my boobs hurt if I touch them.

203,"My dad died when i was 11 and like those movies where the kid goes mute after a parents death, i went half mute. I would speak when spoken to and no time else. This lasted for a long time, as i didnt have friends from 11-14 because I had moved cross country after his death. I became a very overweight and depressed kid, so connecting with people was extremely difficult and it seemed anytime i said something I would be looked at like a weirdo or told to be quiet, basically not very much hyping me or my ideas up. So I learned to just get by without people or saying much to them.

My problem is I am in my head now like 95% of the time, I dont know how to relate my thoughts into normal conversations, I hear podcasts with just one person talking for hours and im amazed, I couldnt even talk about my favorite subject for 20 minutes. My girlfriend, which I love is starting to run out of patience with how little i can express myself, unless she chit chats and carries the conversation, there is radio silence on the phone from me, and the whole time im just beating myself up inside for not being able to have a freaking normal conversation.  Then when I do talk apparently its not enough so she gets angry and asks why im not talking. 

This no talking has held me back in many social situations because I cant express to someone how much i appreciate something or really get to know someone aside from very minimal surface level interactions. 

How can I break this?  How can i be the chatterbox my girlfriend needs me to be, and at this point in my life I also want to be. This same problem affects my relationship with my mother as well and my sister passed away 5 years ago so i really want to open up completely with her as well.

It’s usually related to what’s on my mind. Like I do it to get embarrassing or anxious thoughts out of my head. And I think constantly of those things so it’s loooovelyyy. Doing it gives me a sense of relief. Like I need to do it, and it feels better when I do. But I have to keep doing it.

213,"Hello! This is the first time I post something and this is a throwaway account. I’m a little nervous about posting things online but I really need an advice.  

I’ve (30F) been in a “relationship” with a guy (30M) for about 10 months. We don’t see each other that much because of his job. I don’t mind see him once every 1-2 weeks because I understand he is busy. What I don’t understand is why he always ignores most of my texts, however he always tells me that he does want to see me and wants to keep going out with me. 

I’m getting depressed because I don’t see him as often as I would like and because of his attitude towards me. I’m falling in love with him but he is not. He says he just likes me a lot. Sometimes I think that maybe it is too soon for him to have feelings for me but I don’t know.

What I know is that I don’t want to feel like an option no more. I have to clarify that I do not want to receive texts from him like 24/7 but sometimes I would tell him  that I miss him and he never answers. I send him messages telling him that I love him and he doesn’t answer or comes out with a totally different answer/comment. 

We have talked about this messaging issue many times before but he tells me that it’s nothing against me, it’s just that he is very busy. I don’t believe because when I see him he always has his phone with him and checks who is texting him at that moment.

I really want to walk away from this relationship because I feel like I’m just waisting my time with him. I feel like my love and attention for him is going to the trash. I just don’t know how to do it and what to tell him that’s if I have to give him any explanation. Some friends have told me to block him but I feel that’s very immature. I know it will be hard for me to leave him because I have feelings for him but he is not putting any effort into this.

220,"Hey! So I'm gonna start this post by telling you a little bit about myself. I'm a 21y (M) who has never experienced any kind of romantic affection, I'm a kissless virgin. This happens because not only I am a bit traditional (I would never have sex with a random girl, only with someone I deeply like), but I'm also an introverted guy with an awkward personality who spent all his life feeling different from everyone else, so I guess that made me feel left-out and alienated and that's probably why I have so much trouble making emotional connections, even though I'm conventionally attractive according to what people tell me. I also think I may have Asperger's Syndrome (a condition that has some similarities to autism). Apart from that my life is very normal, I study, I have friends and usually people like me and respect me.

Recently somehow, I started to chat with this girl. Out of nowhere she just  texted me (I already knew her, we used to be classmates on pre-school so that made things easier lol) and we started to spend a lot of time together. Later we started to like each other and now we are in a sort of a relationship. We haven't even kissed yet but we spend a lot of time together in real life, text and in video-calls, plus we already talk to each other like a couple. So yeah, I guess I can call this a relationship. I like her so much and I know she likes me a lot too. She has been accepting me for who I am and loves my odd personality, I honestly can't remember ever feeling this happy in 21 years of existence.

But then, a huge problem comes. According to what she told me she has been in other relationships before me, and she is experienced in sex which is the opposite of me, a kissless virgin. I haven't told her yet because I couldn't find the courage to and I'm ashamed of it (no one knows, even my parents don't know I'm a virgin), I'm really afraid that she won't want me anymore if I tell her about this because she is really attractive and honestly she could get any guy that she wants (I have no fucking idea why she chose me lol), but I still feel like she has to know. So, what do you think? Should I tell her about this and explain my situation carefully? Do you think she will understand? Has anyone been in a simillar situation? I don't know what to do and I feel so insecure about this, things are going so well and I'm afraid that this may fuck all up.",09Sep2020,1

223,"I recently decided to try therapy again. I (f21) was molested when I was 7 by a neighbor. I didn’t tell my parents about it until I was 12, and they divorced shortly after so I didn’t end properly keep up with therapy. Re-opening this can of worms is terrifying and the biggest thing I’m struggling with is that I am realizing I have been trying to forget other possible trauma that occurred when I was a bit older. I’m confused and scared of how it will change things for me and my family if I address it. After my session today I was feeling very raw and vulnerable and during my drive home I remembered two instances that left me shaken and confused. Now, this is where is gets very confusing and difficult for me. This is what I remember- when I was 15 there were two different occasions at my dad’s house where I was sleeping and woke up to the feeling of someone touching me inappropriately. On both occasions I woke up, but pretended to stay asleep and kept my eyes closed out of fear and after the initial shock I rolled around a bit to try to make them stop. Both of these felt so real and I remember laying awake crying both times after wondering if it was real or something my brain made up. I often would have very realistic flash back nightmares from the abuse I went through from the neighbor, but these two specific occurrences were different. This makes me feel sick and scared when I think about it because if it did actually happen the only person who could have done it is my dad. We didn’t have a very good relationship when I was growing up, he had a gambling and drinking problem, and cheated on my mom quite a bit. But now he is remarried and has seemed to try harder at a good relationship with me and my siblings (we’re all adults now). I can’t brush this off because I now have two year old son and four week old daughter. My fear is I ignore this and chalk it up to it being like my other trauma related dreams and then something horrible happens to my kids by their grandfather. I have another session in two weeks so I will be bringing it up then, but it’s already driving me mad with anxiety.",09Sep2020,1
224,"So I'm going to try to make this complicated story as simple as possible without missing anything important...

So I knew this girl in high school, 3 years ago, almost exactly. I never really had close friends but for some reason I felt close to her. While it was a very genuine friendship, I did also want to pursue a romantic relationship with her. A few years into high school though, she tells me and a few others that she was gay. It hurt, obviously, and I went through a lot of different emotions with it, with those emotions always being undercut by guilt over making it about me or whatever. So, because I was (and still am, to a lesser degree) young and dumb, I thought it was best to just not keep in touch. 

Now, I'm pretty much alone. I have a couple online friends and a pretty close family, but it feels kinda empty by comparison. Basically, I've grown to miss her just as a friend and am constantly beating myself up over the decision to stop talking to her. I've tried to find her on social media, but she doesn't seem to be on it. I don't have a number to call or a place to go because I was too awkward and introverted to try to talk to her outside of school. I can't seem to get in touch, but I also can't seem to just move on after 3 years of constant trying and failing. I don't know what to do. 

Thanks for whatever you can provide to help.",09Sep2020,1

228,"This year has been one disaster after the next.
Today I found out that I failed college at 25 years of age.

So I'll first explain how this happened, I actually first started college when I was 19 and the first year I was a shitty student, barely passed most of my classes and failed one.

Turns out the one class I failed (intro to C), is actually one of the pre requisites required for the majority of my next semester classes and I also couldn't take intro to C next semester as it wasn't available, only next next semester.

So what do I do? Be a man and tell my parents the truth? 

NOPE

I lied and told them that I passed, and proceeded to practise pick up(as in picking up girls - I kid you not)

And wasted a whole fucking year doing this shit.

When next next semester came around and I could take intro to C, I actually went hardcore and managed to be one of the top guys in the class, prolly cus it was my second time doing all the labs and shit...

But dam it felt good to be a genius, until next semester hit.

Same shit happened, in the beginning I did well, like really well, but then got lazy and barely passed... And failed one class - guess which one?

Intro to C++ (I'm not even fkin kidding man)

So what do I do? Stop the lies and tell my folks like an honest man?

NOPE

I went straight downtown and really got into the pick up game, but this time instead of returning to college, I fkin became a club promoter for all the major downtown clubs here in Toronto (rebel, EFS, Cube, etc) all because I made a shit ton of connections with other pick up guys and eventually one thing lead to another and I was driving downtown every fucking day to party.

I actually thought I could make it big as a club promoter as a buddy of mine was making big bank (like 5k+) working at the clubs there per month.

3 years fucking went by and wanna know how much I made?

A total of $101.38

Funny eh.

Did I care though? NOPE

I was having fun, hot girls, I got into clubs for free and  used my promoter gig to get girls in for free as long as it was before 12.

Never got paid much as you have to bring 10 girls or more to get paid, which I'm pretty sure I did some times but the main promoters were prolly scamming me but I didn't give a shit I just liked the validation and girls twerking in front of me.

One day, I came home late at night and both my parents were sitting there as it was past midnight.

So I knew some shit was up.

I never forgot that night, my dad looked at me like I was a total stranger.

And frankly I was. I went from typical brown nerd style to that douchebag in king st you wanna punch in the face style.

My dad yelled at me the whole night but the thing that really got to me was when he mentioned how much money every month I was charging him as, at the time I was a fking piece of shit using my dad's money.

I was spending close to 3k on gas and other shit when going downtown.

When he said that I felt like a fking bitch and immediately stopped going downtown and quit the pick up game.

I couldn't go to college as the new semester hadn't begun and I was now really looking to find work just to pay back my dad and earn their trust back.

So I got an interview for one of Canada's major banks  and went for the interview.

Now, I will admit the one thing I learned from pick up/half-assed club promoting and being a total fuck boy is that I got realllyyyyy good at socializing.

I mean I had cold approached chicks and sometimes had same day lays at the girl's place!(okay that was a rare occasion) but my social skills had been honed as fk for the past 3 years.

I made friends with all the guys there, was probably the most confident and lively of the bunch but made sure to not be too cocky.

And guess what?  I GOT THE JOB!

Now this was for a customer rep job(call centre), but the pay was nice - $2,400 per month which for me was the most I had ever gotten.

So pretty much after getting this job I decided to not fuck around and went hardcore learning all the banking ins and outs, even shit that wasn't in my department, like credit cards and fraud disputes - I knew them all babbyy.

But after some time I realized the new college semester was approaching.

So what do I do? Be smart and take a break from work to focus on college?

NOPEEEE.

I pushed college to the side and used the excuse  ""oh I'm working and making money, college can wait"" and didn't go to college.

2 YEARS LATER

I've been working at this job non stop, I'm pretty much one of the best guys on the floor got a lot of awards that don't mean shit, still making $2,400 and I absolutely hate this job. If it wasn't for my team and my sick ass boss, and money, I would have quit.

ALSO I've been saving up pretty much EVERY single penny, I got close to 60k but then COVID happens in March and this is where the first disaster takes place.

In March I decided to look at the stock market since everyone saying all the stocks are cheap and I'm looking at the Tesla stock at around $380 (this was before the split lool).

I go to my dad and mom, and like all brown parents they tell me not to risk it and I for the most part hesitate and agree, and ignore the stock market.

This was the worst decision in my money making fking life.

I look at Tesla every month and see it increasing and increasing, and as a noob investor I think meh it can't go forever it'll prolly drop.

In June it hits(I kid you fkin not $1700 per fkin share pre split)

Let me remind you that I saw this stock in March at $380.

I fkin FOMO so hard at the prospect of losing an opportunity to 4x my money.

So what do I do? Be safe and keep saving or invest in safe stocks?

NOPEEEE TO THE MOOOON

I go into a fucking penny stock becuase I see it going up and DUMP ALL MY FKING MONEY INTO IT ON MY FIRST DAY, and guess what?

As soon as I dump my money the price goes down and like an idiot I panic sell - at A LOSS.

But how much of a loss you say?

13k, motherfkin 13 000 USD I lost in one day and I'm canadian, so at the time the conversion was 1.36 so I lost around 20k CAD which is almost a year of me working LOL

I remember crying the whole day and my hair falling like crazy hahahaha

In the end, I couldn't hold it all in and balled my eyes out in front of my parents and they hugged me all night, that's right I was in such a fkin turmoil that I ended up sleeping with them in their room like a baby needing its ass wiped at the ripe age of 25 years old.

The next morning I realized how much of a fkin embarrassment and loser I was. I immediately called my boss and asked him for overtime and went hardcore for my bonus - which was 3k for the quarter, better than nothing, but I had to be the top 5. Easy pest biatchhh, I got top 1 lol but...

This is also the time when some thing crazy happened with my dad.

My dad has had some bladder issues in the past where he couldn't pee even when he wanted to, it got so bad to the point he was sometimes peeing out blood 

Now the doctors, oh these fkin doctors, told him to take a medication called dutasteride which helped with the bladder and I did research on this shit and I was okay with it. 

For the most part it was working, but then some stupid ass quake doctor gave him another medication and told him to stop taking dutasteride for some bullshit reason and the problems started again.

So we went to a 3rd doctor and got back on dutasteride but this time he couldn't fkin pee at all.

We rushed to the emergency room and I couldn't go in cus COVID shit, so I had to wait.

I waited and eventually saw my dad walk out but my heart fkin fell out when I saw him limping with no pants and a wire hanging from within his underwear to a bag container wrapped around his knee.

It was a catheter that's a special tube for people with enflamed bladders that pretty much goes to the entrance of your penis and the other end is attached to a bag, where the pee goes to. 

The pain is horrendous and I for the first time I felt so small when I saw my dad's red eyes and traces of tears coming from his eyes.

But that wasn't the worst part, what the doctor said to me and my mom next made a pin drop in the pit of my fkin stomach bro, like srsly I felt like throwing up, fk.

""There's a chance it could be bladder cancer""

The doctor said we have to do another check up on the 15th of Sept which at the time was 3 weeks from today.

So, I immediately took my dad and mom home, and told my dad not to work, I read all the doctors instructions and gave him a shit ton of positive affirmations LIKE a SHIT TON BOIII.

I fkin remember hugging my dad and massaging him the whole night with my mom beside me in their bed. I just wanted to get him to be his old positive self and couldn't bear to see him be so lost...

So after all the massages and shit, I put on a show called suits and we watched like 5 episodes the whole night.

The days go by and my dad's in pain, I mean of course bro, the guy has a tube up his dick like shit that hurts just thinking about it.

Now the important thing to know, is that when you're using a catheter, you have to clean the tip of your penis to disinfect with some polysporin or some cream we used.

Now I could tell my dad was in a shit ton of pain, so I fkin toss my ego out the window and rub the ointment on my dad's penis(I ain't even fkin kidding bro, I love my pa) no homo.

I could tell my dad is super embarrassed but I tell him, me and my friends looked at each other's dicks all the time when we were in the lockers, a true man never cares.

(P.S. I've never seen my friends dicks, full homo)

 I just didn't want him to get embarrassed and shit.

So 3 weeks go by and I'm still taking care of my dad but, he's actually back to his usual self and we're confident it's not cancer as he's feeling much better and doesn't have trouble doing most of the things but he can't do any heavy lifting so I'm doing all the chores and shit.

The doctor called us and told us he can do a procedure called green light surgery but we wanna try all the non invasive stuff first as my dad's a lil scared of that shit cus the success rate isn't 100%.

So I researched a lot and we're gonna try a non invasive procedure called rezum as there's barely any negative side effects to it.

Now a couple days passed and realising I hadn't gone to college in over 3 fkin years I decided to boot up the website and see when the next semester starts but I have trouble logging in.

So I call them myself and see what's up, and that's when the news hit me.

I've been away from school too long and essentially to sum it up you can't skip college for too long cus they get a new curriculum or some shit, so yeah I pretty much have to start college again from the beginning at the ripe age of 25.

I considered keeping this to myself cus I didn't wanna worry my parents but I said fk it they deserve to know, so I told my mom everything first and she was so disappointed and blamed a lot of shit on my past actions which I expected and then we decided to tell dad.

As my mom told my dad, I became a bitch again and balled like a little crybaby because once again I felt like a failure and that this was it, this is what became of my life - just a loser who can't even make his parents proud.

Bro, it's funny tho as I was crying my dad hugged the shit out of me and told me the same Positive affirmations that I told him.

My mom eventually got around and said sorry a lot for freaking out on me and we hugged it out that night.

Honestly I still feel like a failure but I can't really dwell too much in this, gotta think for the future, you know?

I still got 45k CAD in my chequeing acct, I'm honestly gonna save up for multiple houses that I can rent out so my parents don't gotta still work but it'll take a while.

In the meantime I'm waiting till next semester lool, cus the classes already started but I'm gonna study for CSC in the meantime and get a promotion at my current job to direct investing, gotta increase my wealth.

Honestly I'm still lost on what to do so any peeps wanna help me out by giving some advice or memeing to make me laugh... I'd like that",09Sep2020,1
229,"I was looking for a place to live and a friend of mine let me know his cousin, Ben, was renting a couple rooms in his house.

233,"Is she toxic or am I?

Hello everyone,
Let’s just hop into it. I have been friends with someone now for many years. We are practically sister. We know each other very well. I can read everything she does. If she has a look on her face even if it’s subtle I know how she is feeling. She can do the same with me. But after the first 2 years of being friends she has gotten into this habit of poking and prodding me without any of our friends noticing, making me irritated or even mad. When I finally say something to her she pretends I’m crazy and she has no idea what I’m talking about, which makes me even more angry and upset which leads to an argument. One of my worst qualities is being headstrong not giving into a fight. Basically the whole argument she is pushing me along in front of everyone. Like saying “Oh, here we go again” and just saying things she knows get under my skin. If I get fed up and decide to go to my room. In five minutes she is in there whispering to me that this is the reason no one likes me because of the way I act and that she in my room trying to help me. I ask her to leave me alone because I just want to calm down by myself but she refuses. After asking her to leave about 10 times, I finally get up to leave but she rips me away from my door by the back of my shirt and pins me to my bed, gets me in a lock hold, or sometimes will even block the door from letting me out. As she doing this she is whispering that this is why no one likes me and why they talk shit about me. (She always does this when friends are around but if friends aren’t around she constantly is talking about how no one likes me because I get angry all the time) When she refuses to let me out I get loud and start yelling to let me go and let me out because then she doesn’t have a choice but to let me out but I know she plays innocent when my friends ask her what happened. I just don’t know what to do. I know I shouldn’t give in to her poking and prodding me but she knows exactly how to get under my skin without anyone noticing.",09Sep2020,1
234,"I’ve been friends with a group of girls since high school. Let’s say girls 1,2 and 3. 

for two years, I had a huge falling out girl 1. We finally made up recently, but things are still awkward between us. I feel like everything I do and say she’s always judging me as she stares me down, smiles creepily at me and doesn’t say anything or looks at the other girls to make fun of me. 

I’m kind of closer with girl 2 as we’ve always stayed civil but we aren’t like best friends. 

I recently stopped being friends with girl 3, which changed the whole dynamic of our group. 

Now, they all drink and hang out together. Noone invites me and they post all about it. It kind of upsets me because of fomo but I also don’t really want to be around them anyways for a lot of reasons.

since me and girl 3 stopped being friends, girl 1 and 2 have barely reached out to me. We have extremely short convos over text or send each other tik toks but that’s it. I never talked about what happened between me and girl 3 but I’m sure she told them &amp; they all gossiped about me. Because they all gossip about everyone and each other, the past few months it’s made me feel so uncomfortable and nervous to think anything I do or say will be talked/used against me when I’m not around. 

Today girl 1 asked she and girl 2 can make edible cookies at my house when my parents are gone. they’ve never hit me up except maybe once since me and girl 3 stopped being friends. 

I feel like they are using me and I honestly feel so uncomfortable letting them do that in my house. I feel like they would make the cookies, then leave right away to hang out with the group. Do you guys think they are using me? How do I say no to them or what do I do? 

I’ve been wanting to keep them in my life at arms length bc I don’t trust them but they still are friends, but my body just keeps telling me to let them go.

236,So we just moved in to an apartment complex and it hasn't quite been a month yet and our next door neighbors are not the nicest people. Literally on the very first day we moved in (could have been 2nd but it was either the first or second) they hit a broom from downstairs (not sure if it was a broom obviously) to signal we were being loud. And I know as being an upstairs neighbor it can be hard as the sound tends to travel downwards but the first day was a bit much. Now we have a kid so the kid can be loud so we are trying to work on that. But they just did a second broom hitting again today. And now let me just say that they are not the quietest either. The dude plays his racing game super loud often in the mornings even on weekends and their tv has surround sound that we can often hear. Also I heard them banging about a week ago and it was super loud. We haven't once done any of the passive aggressive broom hitting they've done despite their loudness. I honestly know that these sounds come with apartment living and for the most part you just deal with it. Also never have we ever had people do this to us and we've been upstairs neighbors in two separate complexes before this. Trying to figure out now what to do here as this seems unsustainable for the year long lease we are in. Should we ask to move? Should we just file the complaint letting the managers know they are loud? I'm not sure how to go about this. I don't think talking to them is an option. The guy looks like angry white trash and the woman seems unfriendly and I actually didn't even know she was that neighbor at first. Any and all advice would be appreciated!,09Sep2020,1
237,"I don’t know if I should put this here or in relationship_advice but here I am. My sister has been dating a guy I’ll call Eric. Just yesterday we were finishing up with moving and he was invited over to help finish moving some stuff. The thing is, is that my sister is telling everyone he’s just a friend (except me). My mom told me to watch over those two and they were doing your typical couple things like kissing and cuddling. Honestly it made me feel lonely but that’s besides the point. One of my uncles actually caught them hugging and started telling everyone. Luckily at the time my mom was out getting the rest of the stuff at my old house. And when she came back everyone was rambling on and on about it to the point where my mom actually yelled at them to shut up. She later apologized and everything was fine until she asked my sister what happened, sister used me as a witness to convince my mom that the two weren’t doing anything. I obviously sided with her because I didn’t want to break her trust. My mom believed me because she thinks of me as trustworthy which made me feel so bad. The aunts and uncles continued ratting my sister off but since I was used as a witness my mom automatically believed me. It’s been a day since then and my mom is still having to deal with them talking about it which stresses my mom. I feel extremely guilty and I don’t know what to do. My sister isn’t a good person, at least towards me, she’s rude, obnoxious, and very self-centered. But I don’t know how I would feel if I broke the trust of my sister, it just doesn’t feel morally right.

238,"First of all, I want to preface this by saying I know how ridiculous and childish this sounds and I would really appreciate if people could not be too harsh on me.

I'm a 22 year old woman and an extremely picky eater. I have been for as long as I can remember. In fact, I feel like ""picky eating"" doesn't even begin to cover it.

I suffered from anorexia for a very long time, which I received treatment for and have since recovered from. However throughout my treatment, my extreme picky eating was never addressed. To clarify, I don't think I'm fat at all, in fact I'm a bit underweight, and my picky eating is in no way because I'm scared of gaining weight. I actually even want to gain a bit of weight! So I know this is a separate issue to the anorexia I suffered from before.

I would absolutely LOVE to be able to eat a variety of different foods. There is nothing I want more than to overcome this. My picky eating has such a negative impact on my life. I definitely do not get a balanced diet from the limited group of foods I do eat which is why I think I'm a bit underweight. Physically, I don't feel healthy and I feel tired all the time despite taking multivitamins and vitamin D tablets prescribed by the doctor.

It also has a negative impact on my social life. I would love to be able to go out for meals with friends and family, or to go on dates to restaurants. It's also a huge dream of mine to travel to different countries and enjoy the local cuisine. I even see pictures of meals on apps like Pinterest and Instagram and I think ""wow that looks so nice, I'd love to be able to eat that!""

But despite how badly I want to, for whatever reason I'm just unable to try new foods. I genuinely have no idea what most foods even taste like because I've never eaten them before. It terrifies me and I have no idea why. I know logically the worst that can happen is I don't like it and spit it out. I *know* it's such a ridiculous thing. But I freeze up, I panic and I'm just unable to try the food. I'll even cry because it gives me so much anxiety. It's so bad that if it came down to starve or eat a new food, I would honestly probably starve. I have no idea why I'm like this and I wish I wasn't.

So what I'm asking is has anyone else suffered from a similar problem? Or have any suggestions as to how I can overcome this? This is genuinely something I want more than anything.

Please try to be kind despite how ridiculous and childish this seems.",09Sep2020,1

242,"My gf and I have been together for 2 years but we’ve known each other for four. 

When we were friends she had a best friend - let’s name him J - who had a lot in common with her from high school, and they hung out pretty frequently. When her and I became friends she was in a relationship at the time with someone else, but occasionally her, J, and myself would hang out. One time we had drinks at the bar, I had significantly less than them so they were pretty hammered and I was barely buzzed. That time I remember J jokingly suggested we had a threesome (keep in mind while she was already dating someone), to which she declined and drunkenly forgot about it. 

My gf describes their friendship as well-rounded and genuine, however, she never had intentions of seeing him romantically. She describes that he let her stay over when she got evicted and helped her a lot when she struggled in the past, but she always treated those actions as platonic. 

Then we started dating and J faded as an old friend, however two years into our relationship now he suddenly wants to rekindle his friendship with her. Which is fine I won’t judge or object who she wants to be friends with. However, he recently started posting old photos of them hanging together on IG as if they were going hanging out and having drinks like they were in 2017, almost making it look like they’re dating. He also recently started saying stuff to my friends about my previous relationships and criticizing our current dynamic. My best friend immediately brought this up to me after he overheard him slandering me over a private discord chat. 

I don’t want to hurt my gf’s feelings because she is grateful for things that he helped her with when they were friends. However, I have to put my foot down somewhere and I draw the line at him trying to actively ruin and sabotage our relationship. Where should I even begin?",09Sep2020,1
243,"I (16 enby) currently have no idea what to do with my life. I have no desire to go to college after high school, but it's so pushed onto me (I live in America) that I feel like I should go or I will not be able to find a job. I also struggle with depression so I lose motivation incredibly easy, and former interests of mine--like art and writing--are career ideas I no longer want to pursue in the future.

My biggest two goals in life are to get bottom surgery and to live with my friends, but that's it. I'm possibly thinking about going down the bioengineer path since I really like science and I've gotten to spend summers shadowing at Mayo Clinic, but I genuinely could not see myself passing the required classes.

I don't know what to do. I don't want to go to college, I don't know what I want as a job, and I don't even know what type of life I want to lead. What are the first steps I should take to making a solid life plan?",09Sep2020,1
244,"So I want to start off by saying I never thought I would be asking for help like this on reddit, I don’t know where else to go. 

I’ve struggled all my life with a fear of abandonment and being alone for the rest of my existence. It feels as if I can pinpoint it to my sophomore year, the first time a girl ever told me she liked me, we had one date, then she got back with her ex boyfriend the next week, and I found out through Instagram. That summer was genuinely the worst summer I’ve ever had, after that I’ve had a string of almost relationships/ and or friend ones, including one that just happened to me today. Within that span of time (about 6 years, I had two girlfriends, the longest being about 1 and a half years long, it ended when I broke up with her. 

I feel extremely lonely when I’m not talking to a girl,like nothing is happening in my life. I feel like I’ve always been searching for somebody else to fill the void I have in myself. I feel like I’m always the one being hurt by other people. But deep down, I know it’s because I need to change. My personality, I’m slowly realizing, is mostly made up of whatever I need to be for somebody else in order for them to fall in love with me. I feel as though s sometimes I don’t have values/ confidence of my own. I am asking for help on how to focus on myself, without feeling as though I am unloved and will forever be alone.",09Sep2020,1
246,"My girlfriend is my favorite person in the world. Recently she has been taking on more difficult projects at work, and as she is working from home due to quarantine she visits often to unwind (as its draining to work in the same place you sleep and live). 

She is introverted and I am doing my best to read her mood when she comes over so I best know how to treat her. I understand that sometimes she needs space to re-charge, something in the past I struggled with but I am trying to get better at (as I am an extrovert). There are times when she needs me to be attentive too, but those times are much harder for me to see as I am pretty used to needing to give her space.

Today was a day where she needed me to be close to her and I instead gave her space. It bothers me that I am this bad at reading her mood. We have been dating for over 2 years and for the most part it has been fantastic. She is my best friend and is really good at reading my mood. It is hard for me to talk to her about these things without getting emotional or just mind-barfing out of fear of hurting our relationship, as irrational of a fear as that is. 

What can I do to be a better boyfriend?",09Sep2020,1
247,"hiiii tomorrow is my first day of sophomore year so just gonna type this and go to sleep :)

IM SO FREAKED OUT TBH 

next door to my aunts restaurant is an antique store,  a couple months ago me ,my mom ,and brother went there . Casual looking and shopping. 

and there was this sparkly music playing green Ferris wheel 🎡  that I totally fell in love with. I needed to have it. I begged my mom, she kinda said no, then we left. 


Turns out she told the cashier to hold it and that she’d pick it up another day, and she surprised me with it soon after ! I was genuinely so happy. 

It just sits in my room, but about a month ago it started playing music randomly. Happened about 3 times, 
once it happened, i was so freaked out , my parents were in the middle of an exorcism in the movie  they were watching 💀💀💀

eh , just something natural happened I thought. a couple days ago though I was rearranging my room and put the Ferris wheel on top of my heater stupidly... and my puppy ran into the heater aNd broke it:(


I was crying so much lol cause I’m attached to it (I still have the broken pieces )my mom said she’d glue it


And my dad pointed out that through the Ferris wheel is a special star. He said it was evil, but google said otherwise idk. if I wasn’t  laying in bed I’d enter pics of all of this.


ANYWAY!!!! today I NOTICE A STAR! on OUR WALL! In my grandmas house! (I live with my parents and 18 year old brother. None of us would do that. That’s plain disrespectful to our grandmas house. Especially upstairs (downstairs is ours) ITS NEW, I pointed it out and my mom said she also noticed it recently for the first time. We talked to my grandma, whole family, they all think it’s weird. They are praying. But not afraid. A freaking star on our wall I started crying when I pieced together the star on the Ferris wheel&amp; random music playing.


If anyone were to write on the walls, it would be me. And I didn’t do it. My grandma washed it off with bleach, but u can still see it a little bit.",09Sep2020,1
248,"I’m a 22 year old college student living with my family. We are 5 Including me. Due to our values, and beliefs I have not left the nest yet. Growing up we struggled financially, so I never had my own room. I always shared it with a sibling and when a sibling ran away, yes I felt heartbroken, but a part of me was secretly  happy because I had a room to myself but that only lasted for a month. We moved and because she (the sibling that ran away) was gone we decided to go from a 3 bedroom to 2 bedroom (financial purposes) and I ended up sharing rooms with my other sibling. I feel terrible admitting this, since her running away caused immense pain to my family especially my parents, but When she came back, I kinda felt bummed out because that meant I’d have to go back to sharing with her... 
Today: I am sharing a room with her and man everything she does bothers me. 
- Her side is untidy 
- her music is loud 
- she stays up late 
- or when she doesn’t stay up late her music/YouTube/ Netflix on her phone is loud. 
- when I’m  trying to sleep she turns the light on to change or look for something 
- when I have to leave early to work, 5am I don’t want to bother so I have to rummage in the dark. 
- Lately I’ve been the only one cleaning our restroom. If I don’t clean it, it gets filthy. 
- because my side of the restroom is clean, she places some of her stuff on my side. 
- her used Toilet paper is on the floor from missing the trash can. 
- when she showers her hair, she has long hair, is plastered all over the wall. I don’t even want to shower there, so I use my parents most of the time but even that is awkward because of the fear of my brother or dad walking in and even my mom. 
- she leaves piles of her clothes EVERYWHERE. 
- when she uses the restroom she leaves the restroom door open so I hear and smell everything. 

Lastly because all my classes are virtual due to covid, no one can STAY QUIET OR HAVE DECENCY TO CONSIDER TO AT LEAST TRY TO BE. My professors call on me often and they are always turned off from hearing me because of all the noise. 😓
I want to participate in class but I hold back because of the noise. And then they get upset because they can’t be locked up in their rooms, they have lives too. I just can’t take it anymore... uuuuuuugh. 

I love quiet mornings. Wow, how priceless silence and solitude are, it sucks how much I wasted it when I had it. Or just didn’t value it at all. I want quiet mornings, I want to be able to study. I want to be able to keep things clean, I just want a space I can call mine. I just want to grow... 
I’m probably just venting.

He and I agree on a lot of stuff like both of us being pro choice, the right to bear arms, and that gay marriage is a good thing. However, with these riots and protests it is just getting worse. He listens to a bunch of right wing youtubers and always says that these guys aren't biased and only tell facts and not opinions. 

I don't think that defunding the police is the right thing but re-allocating funds is better. He thinks since its called ""defunding"" that I don't want any police and want havoc. He thinks that this BLM is totally out of line because there aren't any laws that make it harder for black people.

254,"Hi! I am a freshman who was doing sorority recruitment at my school. I had never really planned on rushing in the past but I thought it would be the best way for me to make some good friends. Because of covid, it was all online. I thought things were going well and that I got a good feel of all the houses, but I don't think my assumptions are true. I got into a house that I liked and ended up putting in my top two, and at first I was really excited. I thought these girls would be similar to me and I would find a lot of friends. However, after being added to the group chat, the girls all seem to be way different than me. They all are crazy partiers who seem to be focused on weed and alcohol more than anything else. They're all super excited to meet for our in-person bid day here soon, but I am dreading it. I don't know what to do. I feel stupid because I originally thought this would be a good fit, but now I feel so uncomfortable with the idea of being in this house. I haven't met everyone yet, and I am trying to keep an open mind about everything. However, I can't really see myself being friends with any of the girls in my pledge class or any of the ones from the pledge above who have typed in the group. I really would appreciate some advice.

256,"Just like the title says. We’ve been dating for two years and I just didn’t know she would keep something like this from me. I feel kind of lied to and cheated on in a way. I want to be clear I don’t hate bi people or anything I just wish I known I was dating one before I got into it. 

She says it’s been like this for a while and she admitted it to me when I said a joke. She’s just said so many things that make it seem like she’s not. And again I don’t hate bi people but I’m pretty conservative and just have my views and would’ve rather not been dating one. I don’t think it’s a make or break for me but I just feel weird.

She has some weird friends and one of the reasons I feel really uncomfortable is because her and her friends act super gay and I thought it was a joke and it very well could be I guess but I just don’t feel comfortable knowing that one of her friends kissed her and that they change together and that they touch each other boobs as jokes. It just makes me feel cheated on now because is touching a nothing guys penis a joke now too? 

I’m just super tired uncomfortable with idea because of how she acts around other girls as a joke or maybe it’s not a joke. I just feel betrayed right now and idk. Maybe it’s unfair of me but I just don’t know how to feel. And I don’t hate her and I want to support her and we’ve been together so long but I don’t know how I feel about dating her anymore.

258,"So this new girl (28f) at work, works in a different area as me (29f) but we crossed paths in the dining area. She was nice and we had a nice conversation and each tine we had the same lunch we would just kind of chat. 

She confided in me that she was having issues with her husband and cat since she had her baby (the husband was convinced the cat was gonna hurt the baby despite the cat showing no aggression ever in his 10 years in the home), and she knew I had cats and asked what to do, as she was worried she was gonna come home one day to the cat being gone. She knew he needed a new home and was asking me about rescues and shelters. I had space and was considering getting another I said I could take him, that way she knew he was in a good home and could get updates and I’d show her pictures. We exchange numbers and a couple days later I had a new cat. Since we had exchanged phone numbers at this point we started to talk a little bit more, and one day she asked me about one of the necklaces I was wearing and I told her it was my mothers and I got it when she passed. She said I was awfully young to have a deceased mother and I agreed and I said it was a tragic loss to a heart condition. She said that when her grandmother passed her church had really helped and to be honest I was kind of used to this because when my mom passed everybody invited me to church and though I’m not religious I kind of went just for the tradition of it and to be around people that I knew cared about me. 

She asked if I would like to go to her church with her, and I was like sure why not. Here’s where I made the mistake. I thought she was well-intentioned like all my other friends that invited me when my mother passed, so I agreed. After we already make plans and everything she tells me the name of the church and the faith that she is part of is one that I consider to be a very toxic cult like sect. But I had already like agreed and I didn’t want to back out especially since she gave me her cat I felt guilty like but what could I say “thanks for the cat but you’re in a cult peace out”? So I agreed to go and I figured I could just back out after one visit.  Well she keeps inviting me and I just don’t know how to back out she keeps sending me the links for their online zoom courses, And I keep making excuses as to why I miss them and she keeps asking about it, and then our phone calls which used to be just about normal stuff and the cat have just become Lake and I keep making excuses as to why I miss them and she keeps asking about it, and then our phone calls which used to be just about normal stuff and the cat have just become like “ religious study sessions” she even called them that like she was like hey “can I call you Thursday for our little study session?” 

And I just want to go back to what we were before she brought religion into. We had great conversations and I don’t want to ghost her because I you know have a cat she’s had for 10 years but at the same time she’s proselytizing. 

I just don’t know what to do at this point anymore. I feel like I can’t escape, because I don’t want to be rude but I’m solely losing my mind because she’s figuring out my free time and trying to suck me in to this.",09Sep2020,1

261,"My husband has often been out of work throughout our 9 year marriage. For various reasons which I won't get into because it makes me cross, and I'm tired of being cross about it.

He is wonderful when he's at home, doing his fair share, and then some, because I'm the main bread winner. He's also a great cook, so, I think I'll keep him, heh heh!

Now, he has a job, earning a tiny bit (I'm still the main bread winner). Potential for him to earn more in the future. But he now does almost nothing when he gets home. He comes home, talks about his day, goes outside and smokes all night. Okay, once he bathed the kids and fed the pets, because I locked myself in my office, blared my music, worked, and ignored everyone for the evening.

He says he'll wash the dishes, but the next morning there they are, nice big pile. He says he'll hang up washing, but the next day there it is still in the washing machine. Good intentions don't get things done... 

I get that he's worked all day, but so have I. Just because I sit behind a computer doesn't make it any less work, right? Plus, I multitask during the day while working: cooking, cleaning, washing, taking care of kids, etc.

Small things in the big picture, but still annoying. The main thing though: He hasn't ONCE asked me how my day was.

264,"I’ve been really stressed lately as things have not exactly been the greatest in my household. I live at home with my sister and mom.  I work a job that just barely pays the bills and for that I can’t really afford to take time off to return to college any time soon. I never really knew what I wanted to do so I worked smaller jobs while taking some classes but now I feel in order to better my life I need to better my education.  Unfortunately, I’m stuck right now.

About a year ago my mom had a very good job paying over $25 an hour and things were a whole lot better back then as far as family finances. We also did a lot of activities together as everyone was working decent to okay jobs.  However, my mom has always been discontent with every job she has ever had and always complained that she was being unappreciated or that her work was stressful. This has always frustrated me because I too have worked, and am currently working, a pretty stressful job but I don’t complain because it’s life and, well, life requires money to work properly.  Also keep in mind that she has held very good jobs in the past only to randomly quit or sort of force herself out of several of them despite being one of the main sources of income back then (I was too young to work).

Anyway, for some context, my mom is heavily Christian, which frightens me for several reasons.  My main concern is that one of the times she quit her job in the past is because she felt God told her to pursue other things, such as preaching, etc and she needed to free her schedule, so to speak.  Mind you this happened during a time when my parents had just divorced and our living situations was pretty poor and money was ESSENTIAL.  That’s the thing—I feel like she places her faith over reality and doesn’t fully consider the ramifications her actions will have on our family and our living conditions.

Fast-forward to now and my mom hasn’t held a job in over a year and I don’t think she plans on it either.  She is basically devoting all her time to pursuing a hobby that isn’t making real income. Her only current income is $800 social security a month and well the rest of the house/utilities/car/insurance/grocery bills fall on my brother, sister and my own shoulders.  And no, I’m not saying any of this to make it sound like I don’t want to help pay for bills, but I barely make 1800 a month and have lots of bills myself and now my mom randomly asks for more money to pay for simple things like doctor appointments because she can’t pay for them but isn’t trying to find work either.

Simply put, I feel like I’m slowly drowning in debt.

My brother doesn’t make much more money than me and unfortunately our relationship is pretty bad as he has mental issues and we never talk.

My sister has a small job that pays way less than both of us and a lot of her money goes toward my mom as well.

I’m not really sure where I’m going with this but I feel as if I try and talk to her about how I feel she always says, “Why are you worried Everything is fine!” but I just walk away disappointed because I know the truth about our bills and it makes me somewhat angry she just abandoned everything to chase after a dream
of preaching or whatever. I also have dreams, but I understand that unless a miracle happens where I can make a career out of it, I’m not just going to quit my job and rely on my siblings to take care of everything, which is how I feel. 

All I am left with is regret that I didn’t figure out what I wanted to do with my life earlier so I could have finished school by now and had a better job.

I’m not saying this to throw my mom under the bus or sound ungrateful, but I feel like she has sort of lost her touch and is incapable of understanding how I feel. Also, our family used to always go places together and spend time together whether it was going out to eat or to the mall but now we never do anything because I’m always working or there is not enough money and it kind of depresses me. Most days I don’t even feel motivated to get out of bed.

I know this is long and sorry but I just needed to get it out.  Again, I’m not looking for pity but I just feel lost as I don’t know what to do with my life and now I feel stuck in an endless cycle and I don’t really have any other family to seek advice or help from.

266,"So I have betta fish and I love them a lot. I do my best to give them the best life. Unfortunately I’ve had several die. 2 died bc they came from “a bad batch” as the store described it. I got them at the same time and apparently none of that order of fish had survived very long according to the shop and they don’t know why. 2 other fish both died after nearly 3 years (?) I cant remember exactly when I got them but it couldn’t have been more than 3 years before they died. My fifth fish was called Bruno and I had him for 3 and a bit years before he died. He was the first fish and I remember when he died I was so devastated. I cried when all my fish died and still today will cry when I think about them.  
I get the water tested, and clean the tank regularly, and they’re tanks are all very large (I’d never put my fish in one of those small tanks), they have toys and plants but they still died. I just feel like it’s my fault they died. That I could’ve done more. Sometimes I think about how some of them were looking kinda sad before they died and I knew they were going to die and couldn’t do anything and I regret not euthanising them bc I saw a tik tok on how to peacefully kill a fish and I think of how their last days would’ve been so painful. 
It took me awhile but I got some new betta fish and I make sure they are living in the best conditions possible but I still worry so much. They have lots of places to hide and plants in their tanks so sometimes I can’t see them and I freak out and think they’re dead. I check on them every time I go into my room just out of worry. 
I still feel bad for my other fish and like I’ll kill these fish like I killed my other fish and that I’m a bad person for just letting my fish die and then moving on with new fish. 
I don’t even know what to do bc if I talk about ppl will just tell me that they’re just fish so I shouldn’t care and that makes me feel worse bc like what if I subconsciously don’t care and that’s why my fish died?

267,"Dude, here - before my inbox gets flooded by thirsty guys. The question mark is there because I always thought addicts of any kind will neglect all responsibilities in the constant search for their next fix. I also have heard that sex addicts will resort to anything for satisfaction. Cheating on partners, paying for sex and stuff like that. I haven't. I work my job, pay my bills, maintain my home, stick with the Mrs... the whole bit.

But I think I must be an addict or something, because I want sex every single day. Ever since I did it for the very first time, a day has not passed where I haven't wanted to have sex. 

I was told in my twenties by other guys that this feeling would fade as I got older, either after getting married or having kids. I've gotten married, but will *not* be having kids and I turned 30 this year. I know 30 isn't particularly old, but that's a number that got dropped a lot in these conversations.

What happened to my sister that night was going through my mind. My coworker and him broke up way before this happened because he was toxic. She ended up quitting her job and became distant from everyone at the time. She never messages me nor do I but I really want to. A part of me wants to rant and open up. At the same time, I’m afraid of what she might think with the information I’m giving her. I also don’t want to burden someone with negativity.

There was no evidence of the assault since my sister told me 3 days after what happened. I remember talking to the people who were the last to see my sister and him before the assault happened and they chose to get away from the “drama”. Long story short, I lost 99% of my “friends” because of this. Everyone mostly blamed my sister for the assault. The way we were treated was absolutely terrible and I wouldn’t wish it upon anyone.

272,"18 years old and am looking for advice. This past year I was debilitated from medical problems due to contaminated water and mold growth in our house. During this time, my symptoms were minimized, and my mother called me ungrateful, “OCD”, and claimed nothing could be done about the situation. I’m now reliant upon my parents for necessary supplements, as they are too expensive for me to afford myself. Apparently my insurance doesn’t cover the cost of treatment. 

I need to save enough money to move out, all while juggling responsibilities for my senior year of school. I have no idea how to make any of this happen, and feel exhausted and overwhelmed right now. I plan on working part-time, and learning investing in my spare time, in order to save enough money. My health is not improving, as my parents have not addressed the mold issue, which isn’t surprising. These problems seem insurmountable to me, and I feel I might have to discontinue high school in order to fully address my health right now. Does anyone have any advice? Sorry for unloading all of these problems at once, just don’t have anyone I can really talk to about this",09Sep2020,1
273,"Hello,

I know this sounds very silly. I'm 27 years old and I feel like I'm stupid, and I know nothing. As a kid, I wasn't really fond of reading because my parents and family always made me do it as a chore and I hated it., but they also didn't read to me as a kid because they didn't know the language too well. therefore, teachers only read to me when i was school but even then as a kid i was usually in my head and never paid attention. I don't think I have adhd because I've trained myself now to be able to pay attention by reading as i got older. however after university, i felt i stopped reading and i also didn't do too well in school because I wanted to be a perfectionist but instead overthought everything and had anxiety over tests. I would try to read everything when we would only be tested on a few things... I felt that most people study effectively and efficiently whereas I didn't. I thought that if i didn't read everything then i really wouldn't understand wouldnt get the tough questions. and sometimes I wouldn't even get to finish reading the chapters by the test came around. therefore in undergrad i felt like when i had studied for tests, i was only studying for the tests. I was interested in the subject but i felt like i had a lot of personal challenges that made it hard for me to focus. I graduated but i didn't do too well. a couple months ago i tried to retake a course i did in undergrad because I was debating whether or not i wanted to do a masters and this was a test for me to see if I can handle school. But that course went too fast for my liking.. I didn't like it. 3-4 chapters a week and i felt like i couldn't read and understand within a week.  i ended up dropping it :(, because it went too fast.  
the course was an economics course btw. I really do like economics, but i think i hate the school systems because of the tests. i don't feel like i genuinely study for myself, but just for the grades.  

&amp;#x200B;

I really do want to become an economists one day and help save the world and its embarassing when i meet someone i really like, they ask me about economics and i just feel like everything i study disappears.

**I'm starting to get into the habit of reading. but sometimes i have a hard time retaining the information i read. Do you think this is normal and that like it gets better as i read more and more?**

276,"Hi, I'm 14M. On the 1st of September I started a new school and none of my old friends went with me. I don't live in the US so some of the stuff I'll say might be different in your school. Most of the kids in my class are my country's equivalent to fuckboys I guess, there are only 3 or 4 kids that seem nice and that I could be friends with.  I'm usually a very friendly person and make friends really quick but this time it's harder. We go to school 3 times a week and learn from home 2 days a week(because of corona). We have a mutual friend but he's not in my school anymore, he told me their hobbys and intrests but we don't really have much in common (they spend their day gaming and I don't play games at all). I went to school only 3 times up until now, and I spent almost the entire day in silence. They sit at the other corner of the room so I can't really hear what they're talking about so I can't join the conversation if they talk about something that I like too. They just go somewhere at recess and I don't wanna follow them or anythig, I don't wanna come off as annoying or clingy. And on the days we have online school It's even harder because we don't have recess or time to talk at all. And most of all I don't wanna seem like the weird quiet kid. What can I do to make new friends? Should I start a conversation? Should I wait for an opportunity to join a coversation? Or is this just a time thing so in a few months we'll just naturally get along? I mean the 3rd day felt better than the 1st one for sure.  (We are all the ""smart kids"" of the class so at least we have that in common) Thanks in advance!",09Sep2020,1
277,"Well r/Advice, I fucked up.

I have algebra two with this one girl I've known since middle school. We'll call her Isa. We don't talk much or get along well but we usually use eachother for work and answers because our teacher's a mean one and we need all the help we can get. She's particularly not fond of the man and has regularly sent me rants about how much she hates him, thinks he's pathetic, wishes him a bad life etc. etc.

So a couple days ago I accidentally turned in an assignment with only the first part turned in. I realized the second and third hadn't been turned in just earlier today, but he gave me a 100. Coming to the conclusion that he only reads the first page, I excitedly texted Isa about this thinking she could use this info handy like I would plan to. She asked me for proof. I showed her the proof. Then I realized I made a grave mistake by giving this to her.

See, Isa has always been a snitchy type and with that given to her I realized she could definitely snitch and get that grade down below a 100. I'm borderline failing the class, so I messaged her an inquiry about whether or not she was snitching. She responded with dodgy and evading answers, at first saying she did but then saying she was joking (didn't buy it at all), so I resorted to this: I told her that if she ratted I would send the angry hate-filled rants she had about the professor to him. I know, scummy thing to do, but I'm not the best person. She started sending answers that seemed more and more afraid. Her last message was a "". . ."" and she didn't reply.

Now that I thought more, doing that was a piss poor idea because...that's fucking blackmail, no? At the time I didn't see it as that but now that I think more it's probably blackmail. I frantically texted her but she hasn't been responding. I naturally thought she's probably talking to her mom or some shit and they might speak to the principal or something about this and possibly have me suspended or expelled or some horrific shit. I don't know if she's doing this for sure or anything or what, but it wouldn't be out of character. Am I just paranoid? What the fuck could I do?? I know I did a shitty thing but by now I can't do anything but live with it and I would very much appreciate any advice I could get.

279,"I landed a nice government job a couple years ago and recently bought my first house with a sizable down payment and a mortgage I can easily keep up with. The pandemic has actually been really good for me, I was staying at home for about 4 months with full pay, overall spending about 80 bucks less a month on downtown parking. Now I'm working at home in a relaxed environment, so life has been pretty good for me lately.

My little Brother unfortunately hasn't been doing as great, he quit his regular job just before the pandemic with another job in graphic design lined up, but that fell apart during the transition and he was left unemployed with only his patreon to keep him afloat. He's not broke because he had considerable savings, but he's eating into it quick now I imagine. It sucks because he wanted to buy a place soon too.

Anyway, he's got self-esteem issues, and with all the crap he's been going through, I'm not sure it's going to be great for him to come home this Christmas and see all this evidence that I'm doing better than him. I know I have a sort of reputation among my siblings as the spoiled one, not that I didn't earn what I have, but things always just seem to work out for me compared to them, and maybe he doesn't need a reminder of that just now.

286,"I’m very new to this reddit thing just btw

So i work at a fast food joint and recently, without getting too into it, have been feeling pretty shitty just about life in general. I’ve had these feelings a lot and they usually last a few days but i’m usually able to push them down and move on. Lately though, it’s just been a bit harder to muster up the energy to go into my high stress job and deal with both my shitty coworkers and shitty customers. I guess all this stress about the job and my depressing thoughts has resulted in me feeling super nauseous all the time lately. So I called out of work and was told by the company that because of my symptoms i’m not allowed back at work for a week because some of my symptoms were symptoms of covid. This has made me even more stressed as I can’t help but feel like my managers absolutely hate my guts and are secretly judging me for not being able to come into work. This fear has only increased. When I got the initial call from the company (this was on Monday morning) about being excluded from work, I asked if I needed to call my store and explain to my managers, the man I talked to said I did not need to because they were already informed. Flash forward to tonight (Tuesday) , my phone is blowing up while I am away for a few minutes and when I finally get to it it is my store calling. I answer and it is one of my coworkers, she asks in a rather stern tone “did you know you’re supposed to be working tonight?” I get flustered because I am in fact not supposed to be working but I suddenly am scared that they were never informed. I tell her “no, someone from the company said i’m no supposed to come into work. The managers should have been informed about this?” she just says “okay” in an annoyed tone and hangs up. Now I am freaking out a bit because I feel as though everyone at work hates me and thinks that I am faking it and that I am gonna get fired or something when I am able to go back to work. I have a feeling that I am being absolutely unreasonable in my way of thinking but I just can’t help it, and it makes me feel even more upset with myself because I feel like a failure for being so afraid of people’s thoughts of me all the time. Basically, I need someone’s advice on if you think I am being completely insane about this whole thing, or if I do have reason to worry about being hated and possibly fired for missing a week of work?",09Sep2020,1

288,"Before I get flooded with “bum” messages, please hear me out. I’m alone. I have no friends. I haven’t had any friends in roughly 6 years. I just turned 26 and my 65 year old parents are the only thing keeping me alive. The thought of their mortality paralyzed my mind so I don’t think about it. 

I want to make them proud. They tell me everyday that they’re proud of me. I struggle with horrible depression that only gets worse during the winter. I feel so empty inside knowing I don’t have any potential girlfriends. No “Bros”. Just me and my insecurity and lonesomeness.

My parents admit that they’re afraid I’ll kill myself. I’ve said I’ve wanted to before, but I ultimately won’t because I love life too much just to throw it away during some hardship. I want them to see me happy, but they know the severity of the issue.

I had a few therapists that didn’t work out. I tried medication but that only made my depression worse. I event spent a few nights at a psychiatric hospital when it all started several years ago.

I had a girlfriend I loved very much cheat on me. She’d lie then threaten self harm if I ever said I was going to leave her. Eventually I just let her go. I let my “Bros” go too because I was hardly their friend. I was their chauffeur. They never gave me any gas money and all they’d ever do is disrespect me.  I felt so small and insignificant. 

Now I have nobody and I don’t know how to carry on. I’m not ambitious enough to work because I don’t want to work at Target, Walmart, or Amazon for 40 hours a week just to sustain my miserable life. I feel like nobody can help me. I feel swallowed up by self doubt/hatred.

I was voted most likely to fall at graduation. Which is hilariously hypocritical that we’re just now starting to live in this bubble wrap world of sensitivity.  I wasn’t shown any mercy in high school. Plus I live in a small town. It strange being 26 with nobody. I could die tomorrow and nobody outside my parents would care. Even my own brother didn’t call me on my birthday this year.

Plus, I couldn’t connect with people my age even if I wanted to. My city is the city of single moms and soundcloud rappers. I just don’t relate. They’re all scum bags and none of them have any morals. They just tattoo themselves because nothing else makes them unique. I just don’t connect with this generation of internet born narcissists. Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook are like gods to people my age. You’re only truly relevant if you have a solid internet persona. Plus this whole tinder era of swipe right or left feels so desensitized to the reality of dating. I’m sick of it. Hooks ups suck but what else can you do in a small town that offers you nothing but depression and isolation. I hate thinking that I want to die. Life is too beautiful for me to be feelings this ugly. 

I just feel insignificant, small, and irrelevant. If my only hope of survival is becoming a wage slave then dying can’t be so bad. I’m looking for some hope. I’m desperate.",09Sep2020,1

I fully consider him my brother, I call him as such and I adore him. I trust him completely. He used to have a crush on me when I first started working. (He is NOT a creep. He is not neurotypical, he didnt act on his crush, and when I told him no he took no for an answer and never pushed the topic. Hes gotten over me and considers me his sister.)

After I slept, it was gone, so I forgot about it. 2 days after that, strange marks appeared on my side/thigh. It was shaped like a stretch mark, and was a deep purple, but it was definitely NOT a stretch mark. It went away a couple days after that.

The only way to travel into the states rn is through air, I was hoping if I quit I could come back to Canada with her after becoming married and hopefully buy a property with my savings and start a new life. 

But this would cause my parents to be disappointed in me for quitting as well as mad at the fact I'm going to the states where coronavirus has been surging.

316,"I know this isn’t probably the sub for this but I really do need some advice on this. I posted in another sub about this but I really need as much input as possible. So let me elaborate. I do live-streams and I just recently started streaming again (I took a long hiatus because of...well...life). My first stream back was pretty good honestly, I had new and old viewers that were just overall chatting and everybody had a good time and that is what I like my streams to be is just chill and make sure everybody has a good time. It’s when I think of bringing up anything that involves money that I begin to feel almost like I’m overstepping boundaries. I don’t want my viewers to ever think that they need to donate or anything because that’s just bogus.

Now my mother has been through hell and back practically since I was born. She’s got numerous financial debts (due to her ex-husband who was a greedy prick) and also including student loans (for a college that she couldn’t even finish in the first place because she had to take care of my 2 little brothers AND my little sister by herself).

On top of that, I have an incredibly close friend that I really want to help as well. She is currently enrolled in med school and is trying to get into a PA school after she graduates. She currently has car payments and student loans to pay off and each application for the PA schools is anywhere from 50-75 dollars. I told her that I can help send her money each month (from whatever I make from doing my Uber eats runs) that will be enough for at least 1 application per month. But I want to do more. I just can’t currently because literally my only “job” right now is doing Uber Eats deliveries (which, quite frankly, isn’t doing so hot as of lately).

I know that I can potentially use the platform I’m on to potentially raise enough money to help BOTH of them out and potentially greatly impact their lives in a positive way. But I worry that if I were to set up something like that on my streams then people might think I’m just being a beggar or just trying to milk people for money, which couldn’t be farther from the truth. I actually don’t like asking people for money(even people I’ve known for years), if someone donates to my stream I actually feel slight remorse because I know that they may need that money down the road.

I know all of this probably sounds like a “modesty trip” or something but I’m being serious. I really want to help them out but I also don’t want to be seen as a beggar either. What do you think I should do?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",09Sep2020,1

321,"I (19) don’t think I am, I really don’t. I’ve spent my whole life doing everything they’ve asked of me and trying to do it well. 

“You’re going to play football and do well” I try 110 percent. 
“I want a letterman” I make it into Varsity Swim in my sophomore year
“You need to get straight A’s” I graduate highschool with a 4.3 and get into prestigious college.
“I need you to go to the grocery store and get the stuff I forgot” okay dad sure

I never ask him for things. I flat out refuse to ask for stuff I want and don’t tell him when I need new shoes or clothes until they’re falling apart. I even ended up getting a job recently because I had things I wanted to get but didn’t feel comfortable asking him for money. He made me get a credit card for my 18th birthday and he has me buy food, gas, and education stuff with it. Whenever I used my own money he gets upset. When I finally got my job he started letting me pay for food on my own, which I have been. 

So I thought I’ve been the ideal son so far. Sure sometimes I make a small mistake but I never mean to do it, such as mixing up dates for a few applications (I still turned them in on time). But today he told me that I’m entitled, that I act like I’m owed the world. 

What did I do?
I was in my room folding laundry after a very long day and he comes in asking me if I can take my aunt hone tomorrow. My brother and I take turns taking her home and today had just been my turn. All last week I had taken her because my brother couldn’t. Being that it’s an hour drive, I sighed softly and went :T “sure ok” and that set him off. He said that I need to treat him with respect and then called me and my siblings downstairs and told us that we are all entitled and need to do things without complaining or making faces. 

So I guess my question is, how do I convince him that I’m not? I try so hard to make him and my mom happy but it never feels like enough and if it is I need to hide how I feel at all times or I risk getting in trouble. It’s so tiring. I’m so tired. Tired and sad.",09Sep2020,1
323,"Hey, M 23 here! Thanks for taking the time to read this. Recently I’ve been noticing that since late December of 2019 I just can’t seem to genuinely get romantically attached to someone. My last real boyfriend/girlfriend relationship ended in June of 2018. It ended in a true heartbreak as I was blindsided and suddenly stripped of the feelings I was so happy with. I still don’t know if I loved her, or the feeling I had one with. For a year I just wanted to do me. I’d fool around but with different partners but I wasn’t really taking initiative. If things happened, they happened. So come the 2019 holiday season I decide to get back into going on dates with people and investing my time into something I could see working. Since then I’ve gone on dates with numerous partners. To be quite honest, they were all amazing, fun, and unique women. However, after a few weeks I just wouldn’t feel it anymore, and eventually we’d fade out. The only time I thought it would be different was almost 3 months ago when I had REALLY liked this person I was seeing. Alas, she had different plans and shit hit the fan. I hadn’t been bothered by something like that in a while. Since then it’s just back to the same thing, going on dates with one person, thinking I really like them, and then not being that into things anymore.

325,"My parents are both in their early 70s. We all live in canada, although they live in a different province than I do. I have one sibling who lives in their city but they aren't really involved. While my dad hasn't had any major health problems yet, my mom has a history of a neurological illness and stroke (one large and multiple small) that have left her cognitively and physically impaired, including significant loss of mobility. My dad is an incredibly kind and caring man and has dutifully looked after my mom for most of their more than 40 year mqrriage; however, he is reluctant to acknowledge that her mobility is decreasing and that her need for care will increase at a faster rate than his own. Im very worried about her wellbeing now and in the future. My biggest concerns right now are:

- she can't walk far and uses a 4 wheeled walker. That's fine  but he mostly pushes her on it like a backwards wheelchair. Its not supposed to be used like that and the wheels are starting to bend inwards from the weight. She also sits high and it has a narrow base so on small bumps I worry the walker will tip and shell fall backwards, hitting her head. My dad says its not a problem.

- they live in a split level house where you need to go up a flight of stairs as soon as you enter. My mom has trouble lifting her legs. Its only a matter of time before she can't do this. I tried to tell my dad that they should get on wait lists for a seniors living building because the waits can be 4 or 5 years. he has no interest and says its fine. The house has 4 bedrooms and they never use the lower half of the house so its not like they need the space.

I just can't seem to get through to my dad that mom is aging faster than him due to her illness. I think its anxiety that holds him back, I had to harass him for 2 years just to make will and assign my mom a guardian in the event he passes away before her. He just deflects and denies, saying its not a problem. One positive sign is they they did recently get her one of those chairs that stands her up, so he's acknowledging it to some degree. I worry that if she falls and can't do the stairs anymore she wont be able to return home and they have no other plan. Im worried she'll tip over on that walker and get another brain injury or hurt her neck, im afraid that living alone if something happens to ny dad theres no one there able to assist or call 911. 

Im not suggesting they move to a full care facility,  just one with stepped care where the first step is basically an apartment with some meals. And to get a wheelchair.

I’m a 19F and I was wondering if anyone could give me some tips on how to ask a stranger for his number. 

I work at a clothing store at my local mall and there is this guy who works at the Apple store and I have never seen his face (because corona and face masks) but whenever I’m standing in front of our shop, handling the line he always walks past (I’m assuming cuz our shifts just happen to line up). 
Whenever he walks by I only see the back of his neck and his arm and he just has these super cool tattoos and I just generally really like the way he walks (like a cool anime character? Lol) 
At first I just thought he was cool (like ya know if I was a guy I would wanna be cool like that), but then a couple of days ago before my shift started I walked past the Apple store and he was standing outside assisting a customer (corona regulations) and then he smiled under his mask (I think) and his eyes crinkled up all cutely and he just seemed like such a kind person. I like how he always wears his white cap backwards with his Tsukishima (haikyuu reference hehe) glasses. 

ANYWAYS so today I had a shift and I decided that I would finally master up the courage to go talk to him, I even wore mascara! (And I don’t wear makeup, ever), I dressed all nice, but then I chickened out last minute because I just didn’t know how to ask him without sounding like a noob.

332,"I (22) am currently in Medicine Year 3 at my small EU uni, but got a place to start reading Psychology next month at a UK institution.

Medicine was my Plan B as I narrowly missed the conditions of my Psychology offer at the UK uni after finishing school. I reapplied this year because I found Medicine wasn't engaging my strengths (throughout school I was best at Humanities and Maths). I couldn't really see myself as a doctor and thought the environment in my current uni was too limiting.

My outlook on staying home to study Medicine has kinda changed though. It might have to do with me being in therapy for over a year now, but I've realised I probably enjoy result oriented work with people more than pure research and academic discussion (which the Psychology degree is based on). By extension, I do see myself becoming a doctor now and putting in the effort along the way. And I'm not sure what I'd want to do with a Psychology degree anymore.
I should also mention that I've found an amazing social group here, which means I no longer find the environment quite so limiting.

So the question is, should I even try making the change? I don't know if the right thing to do is ask for opinions, but maybe r/advice could at least give me some thoughts.

For years, shes leeched off of the family (asking things but never paying them back, stealing our shit, making a mess, and generally being a nuisance). I’m asking whats wrong with my sister, as in how I can ignore her and tune her out, and what mental illnesses and disorders she has. I’m concerned for her.

Okay, lets start. Heres some shit she does.

- Insults people during arguments
- Acts like shes over everybody else
- Is racist to white people
        - We live in a predominantly white town. One time when I was a little kid, she told me she would “take down the white neighbors” if the purge ever happened. Not a joke.
- Constantly repeats her sentence louder and louder to “win” arguments
- Yells when losing arguments
- Asks for stuff (money, food) and never gives us back anything in return. (deadbeat)
- Argues with her boyfriend in front of us, refuses to go into the garage or some shit so we cant hear her.
- Constantly derails arguments when she is losing
- Whenever we tell her to do something, she evades.
- Says these phrases constantly:
Gaslight(ing)
Toxic
Pull Up
Bruh
- Does whatever other communities do
- Hordes items and spaces 
- Whenever we tell her to put her shit away, she says she has no space. (she has an entire closet that barely has anything in it
- Takes over 80% of the room (my side of the room is literally just my desk-bed and thats all.)
- Extremely arrogant
- Extremely self-centered and narcissist 
- Literally just follows whatever the black community does, no matter if its bad or not.
- Blames white people for everything
- Brings race into arguments
- Acts like SHE needs everything first
- Calls me a “white boy” whenever I show disrespect towards her

Heres some more stories.

Earlier today, I heard her say this to her boyfriend over the phone
“Im gonna mute you and block you”
“There, your muted.” (you cannot mute someone on call or facetime.)

The thing is, I’m white, I’m Italian-Irish heritage so I look like a ghost even when the suns out. The problem is is that when I went to find black paint for my face, none of it was vegan. I morally object to using products tested on animals however I knew my friends wouldn’t be happy that I brought a vegan product to their party. 

In the end I chose to go for the vegan blackface option, I went to the party and we re-enacted the George Floyd video. I wasn’t thrilled with it but we all love dark humour so we went with it. When we were drinking I casually mentioned that the face paint is vegan (I was drunk drunk) and they were enraged. 

They immediately called me a soyboy liberal cuck and to GTFO out of the house. They told me that people like me should be lynched (dunno if they meant the black part or the vegan part) and said that I violated the code.

About three years ago, I moved in with my now ex bestfriend. We'll call her Jackie. Jackie ended up spilling some truth to me that hurt me to the core!!!! She told me her and Alex hooked up. At this time, Alex and Kayla were together but only had their first child. Point is Jackie, didn't tell me till three years after it happened. 

It was always suspected by Kayla, that Alex and Jackie had something going on because they flirted. I also once caught them what it looked like to be kissing. At that time, I told Jackie if she did something with Alex I couldn't be her friend because I love that child too much.

After Jackie confessed, I was so hurt and in disbelief. Guilt started to rise off of me. Jackie and I stopped being friends for different reasons and that reason as well. Altogether, she wasn't the greatest friend to me obviously. I kept that secret inside. For one, they were drunk when it happened. She was 17 and he was 22.

Tonight, all of it ended up coming out. Guess how many years it's been since I found out? 3. Kind of ironic. The way it come out was terrible too. Details that I can't even go into. I ended up telling her yes that did happen. She hung up in my face. I know that I should of told her. There's many things that Alex has done to her that she's justified and ended up staying with him and marrying him anyways. Jackie wasn't the first and she might not be the last. 

I care about both Jackie and Alex so I kept the information away to withhold hurt. I thought that she would get mad at me and end up stop being my friend because Alex told her it wasn't true. I also thought, Alex would be mad at me too. I tried to spare feelings and hide the truth. As we know, all truth must come to light. At the end of the day, I know she is going to be with him obviously. I just don't know how to feel. I know that Jackie and Alex are the wrong ones in this situation but I can't help feel so wrong...It hurts because now I'm no longer able to see the kids.",09Sep2020,1

342,"My wife and I are 21 and 22, respectively. We’re freshly married and full-time students. I’m going for computer science; she’s going for nursing. I love her very much. She’s selfless and genuine — often to a fault. We’ve been together for 1.5 years. Married for 6 months. 

Unfortunately my wife comes from a troubled family. A few years ago, her parents split up and her mom found a new guy. Not long afterward, the two of them had a baby girl who is now two years old. That makes her my wife’s half-sister. We’ll call her X. 

My wife’s mom and her boyfriend are recovering meth and heroin addicts who’ve been in and out of jail multiple times. Her mom has bipolar disorder and is generally a very volatile, immature, manipulative, and disordered person. I would describe her boyfriend in a similar manner. Anyways, you get the picture. Not the most reliable people. (Her mother has a long history of abuse. She neglected and abused my wife when she was younger). 

Well, recently they were both arrested for child endangerment. Without getting into too many details, my wife’s mother attacked her boyfriend while they were driving with three kids in the back — including X. They were driving through a canyon so it wasn’t exactly a safe place to be reckless. The car behind them noticed their swerving and called the cops. 

Anyways, they’ve been in jail for 2 months now. They were both sentenced for 3 months. You know  who’s been watching X this whole time? We have. All of her other family members are either too old, too estranged, or too untrustworthy to watch X (at least in the eyes of my wife). It’s been a hard few months. Being in quarantine had already put a strain on our new marriage. We were fighting a lot before any of this stuff happened. Suddenly having to take care of a two year old that wasn’t ours while we both went to school full time did not help our situation. Initially, I was pissed to hear about what happened - I still am. We were both out of state (For my work) when we heard about the news and had to buy an emergency flight to leave and pick up X. 

Although current times are tough, My wife and I are more worried about the future. As of now, X is set to be reunited with her parents once they get out. But we don’t expect her parents to be able to reliably raise her going forward. Whether it be 5 months or 5 years, eventually something like this last fiasco will happen again. Now, my wife is guaranteed custody of X, as per her mother’s will, in the case that she dies or has to forfeit her rights to X. We have told her mother that if she messes up again, we will take X away from her. (Her mother has a long history of abuse. She neglected and abused my wife when she was younger). 

Although me and my wife don’t want our own kids for another 5 years or so, my wife is dead set on, if necessary, adopting X over anything else because that’s the only way she can know that she’ll be safe and taken care of. Fair enough. I would probably do the same for my sibling. The problem is that I do not want kids right now, especially not someone else’s kid. Moreover, I don’t want to be intertwined with X’s family’s drama by adopting her. 

What do I do? This is a constant source of tension for my wife and I. It seems to be a lose-lose scenario. Either I’m resentful because I have to adopt a kid I don’t want to raise, or she’s resentful because she has to give up her sibling for adoption.",09Sep2020,1
343,"We were together for five years and I never thought we would break up. I was stupid enough in my early twenties to think it would last forever but of course it didn’t. Everything was great until I got a job at a bar and actually had friends that enjoyed me as much as I enjoyed them. I was a sheltered kid growing up so honestly, working there broke me out of my shell and I became a bit of an alcoholic. I started going out everyday for about three months until one day, he texted me telling me basically we were done. It was a shock, but now I realize how much of a fucking idiot I was! I’ve finally grown up in the past three years. My mind is clear because I’ve changed my ways. The problem with that is, all I think about is him. I’ve never felt this way about anyone else, even my previous husband. From the time I wake, until I shut my eyes, all I think about is him. It’s been a lot worse lately for some unknown reason but I can’t stop. I don’t look at other guys because all I do is compare them to him, and honestly they don’t. I don’t know what to do. We have been in contact recently and I’m hoping we can get back together but, it’s all up to him. I know I fucked up and I want to prove to him that I have changed. I don’t know if I can move on. It has proved fruitless. I dated someone last year and it was the worst relationship I’ve ever had with a single person, boyfriend or otherwise. I’d rather not do that again. I’d rather be single if I can’t be with the one I love. If I should give up, please tell me how? Because it’s just as fresh today as it was three years ago.",09Sep2020,1
344,"It is supposed to be an easy decision to make if Covid-19 never exist, but now I've to make a choice.

Initially, me and my wife both are working in another country, while our son is taking care by my mum at my home country. After this pandemic happened, my wife who missed his son so much, quit her job and went back and take care of our son together with my mum while I continue to work alone here.

It has been like that for so long, now my son birthday is coming up on October. My wife asks me, do I want to take a long leave from work and go back to meet them and celebrate birthday together, of course I want to. 

But the thing is there is a rule implemented by home country government, if I were to go back, I will need to apply for permission and quarantine for 14 days at government dedicated facility, and I need to pay for the cost of quarantine and swab test, it cost about $600. If I go back to my home country, after the celebration I will have to return for work, I will need to make payment for swab test again which cost about $150, total cost is around $750.

We are by no mean rich nor poor, but it is still an extra spending. My wife expecting me to go back but I'm yet to give her an answer. I've told her about the cost for me to go back but she says it is our son one year old birthday, it doesn't really cost that much and we can afford it, I told her let me think about it, I know she will be very upset if I say I'm not going back.

Now the deadline for me to apply the cross border travel is coming, I have to make a decision. What will you guys do?",09Sep2020,1
345,"I have severe anxiety. I'm only going to school for 2 hours now and I feel like even that is too much. I can't deal with going to class very well because it's so overwhelming. 

I'm scared I'm going to fail my exams and fall behind because of it, and no teachers are giving me work to do at home or even telling me what they did in the classes I missed.

Today, I was meant to have Media class, which causes me extreme anxiety because everyone in that class dislikes me, and there's about 5 people that make me extremely uncomfortable and anxious, it's also exactly the same for my Art class, which makes both of these lessons are hell for me. 
Yesterday was my 2nd day back at school and I walked past 3 of those 5 people, and they all shouted an insult at me.

I know avoidance feeds anxiety but I keep crying and having anxiety attacks whenever I even think about these classes.

My mom is angry at me because I had an anxiety attack this morning and I couldn't go to school because of it. I told her how I felt yesterday about these classes and she doesn't really care.
She's just talking about how I'm making her lose work and money and how she's so anxious about having to take me home early and anxious about her work and how everyone is anxious and it's not helping.. it's just making me feel guilty and bad and wrong for something I can't even help.

346,"Okay. Hhhhh. This is a very hard post to make and I'm really in the need for some help. I don't have much of a support system wrt my toxic, borderline abusive (? I struggle calling them that but have been told that's what they are) parents irl outside of my fiance and things are escalating quickly.

My father is probably going to be diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's soon. He's reached a point where he can't really work or function completely on his own and if it turns out he does have Alzheimer's and he continues to decline, I am the only one within my family in a position to care for him and help him out. I'm the youngest of 3 sisters, my oldest sister is 32 (I'm 21) with a college degree and her own family and full time job. My second oldest sister is largely absent from our family which is a whole other issue. I live at home right now (but am hoping to get my own place with my partner next month) and am disabled in such a way that it prevents me from going to school or getting a typical job (currently doing some postmates delivery and working on getting on disability). My mother has sort of taken my very open schedule to automatically mean that I'm gonna be the one staying home and helping my dad out

She's already asked me not to move out, and made me feel guilty for working on getting my own place. I need my own place because I recognize my current living situation is extremely toxic. My mom is super codependent and has no concept of adequate emotional boundaries, and it's in a lot of ways the worst with me. She treats me like a parent, she and my dad are both alcoholics and gambling addicts and have been neglectful my entire life, and I never learned how to stand up for myself or set boundaries. When I try to set boundaries with people, especially my parents, I feel genuinely evil. This is partially due to the way they've treated me and partially because I'm severely mentally ill (have ocd, depression/anxiety, c-ptsd, and bipolar schizoaffective)

On top of all this, I've just spent the past 3 years helping care for my grandmother with alzheimers and she died just last week. On top of just not wanting to lose anymore of my young adulthood to caring for my dad, I also think it would be borderline traumatizing due to how fresh my grandmothers death is.

Anyway, hopefully that's enough backstory to paint the full scope of the situation. The point of this post is that my mother is very bad at comprehending boundaries and I am very bad at setting them, especislly with her. I dont want to care for my dad. I dont want to live with my parents anymore. I want to have my own life and enjoy my young adulthood the best I can with my fiance. But if I tell my mom that, she will, intentionally or not, make me feel extremely guilty and I will probably have multiple panic attacks and feel like the worst person alive for it. Despite this, i know I need to say something anyway. So if anyone could give advice on what might be the best, most productive way to do this, i would really appreciate it. Sorry if this post is nonsensical or disorgwnized its 2 am and I'm very tired",09Sep2020,1
348,"It's been a while since I came to reddit but well

I want to preface this with saying that I do not have any medical condition whatsoever, I'm just a little shit who can't sleep.

Since I was a kid, I have a very hard time sleeping. I hated ""sleep time"" because I knew it would just be hours of me staring at the wall. I genuinely hate the dark and have hated it since them, so that was another reason. Eventually, I could convince my parents to leave a light on at night, so I started using this time to read comics/draw on the wall/do whatever.

Ok, so the problem is still up, and it's a major pain in the ass.

It's not like I didn't try over the years. When I was 7 we visited a doctor who prescript medication which was supposed to get me sleepy immediately but it did literally nothing for me. I drink calming teas every day before bed. I even tried to listen to those ""mind training"" videos, and I stayed up for the whole 4 hours of the video.

The only thing that seems to work is getting me absolutely fucking exhausted. Like, sweating and all. In nights where I had just got back from a major chess tournament, or had just ran an entire block, or had spent the day debating with someone, or just danced literally every fucking song on Just Dance, those were the only nights I could sleep properly. But everytime I exhaust myself physically or mentally to sleep, I wake up feeling like shit™, so it probably is not the best decision.

I may have an cellphone addiction, because I always have my cell with me, so that's probably the reason too. But I have tried going to bed without the cellphone and I can't sleep either, so I'm hopeless.

I just want to fucking sleep.

What do I do? One of my friends suggested Dramin, so I'm tempted to buy it. Also, I saw somewhere a bunch of heavy rated medications that make you sleep and I think my father has one of them, so I could try that too. I'm desperate at this point. Sorry if this is confusing",09Sep2020,1

351,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. Honestly this is probably considered petty drama but I still have no clue how I should go about this.

For some context, all of my friends are in the same grade (grade 12), and we've all been best friends for well over 10+ years.

This all starts at the 8th grade. I was pretty socially awkward back then, and only had a couple of friends that I made in the previous year in my classes. In enters a new character, we'll call him R (for anonymity's sake). R was a pretty popular, extremely sporty guy (used to be a national competitor for an Olympic sport for the US) who took a liking to me because I was extremely funny to him. The entirety of the 8th grade we would walk home talking to each other. 

Now, next year hits. Things get a little more shaky. We were much better friends at the time, and we would Facetime on Snapchat pretty much every single night and stay up all night playing video games, but there were some weird red lights going off in my head since we began to get closer. First, he was keen on insulting anyone who sees fit, whether good person or not. He viewed Instagram followers and likes as a competition, like an ego contest. Much bigger red flags was when he would talk about his dog (weird, taboo subject alert). We would be facetiming during freshman and sophomore year, and he would touch his dog's (male) genitals and play with them and exclaim what he was doing like it was funny. I honestly was so f\*cking weirded out by this, but I never said anything because I felt like if I called him out on doing some weird sh\*t he would deny it, sh\*t-talk me, and just trash and insult me. Also, all throughout this his main source of jokes would be using the N word excessively or being homophobic.

By junior year, we were still considered good friends despite me being weirded tf out. We wouldn't Facetime anymore but would still chat on Discord now and again. By the end of the year, I added him to me and my best friend's personal Discord because f\*ck it, why not. He's cool, right? Wrong. At least that's what I think. He became what seemed like good friends with my friends, despite sh\*t-talking them prior, and would still continue to shit-talk them in my DM's and I would just say something like ""eeeehh"" or something like that in response because I'd hate to cause drama and I have no clue what I'd do to deal with it. 

What really started pissing me off is him insulting some of my best friends, which we'll call C. C would be talking about typical high school stuff and R would be messaging me all this sh\*t like ""Look how cringe this is. You think C is relevant? He's so f\*cking irrelevant to society."" (I'm not making this up, this is pretty much word for word what he said), and he would sh\*t-talk his at the time current GF, and his ex DMing me stuff like ""They're so irrelevant to society. Both of them are ugly as fuck."" R would also tell me stuff in a 1-1 voice chat about another friend saying stuff like ""You think he's really ever gonna get good at (passion)? He's dogshit at it. He'll never learn from watching videos.""

My best friends and I also started noticing something about R. He would say some creepy stuff, like why he wants to have sex with this one cartoon character because of how innocent she is. He has a literal obsession with this character and it gets mentioned by him pretty much every day. He would also randomly bring up some questions/thoughts that were... interesting like ""I wonder how I would react if someone close to me died."" I thought it was a legitimate question... hell, I have no clue how I'd react either in that circumstance, but he would keep mentioning it almost every week which would weird me tf out.

Nowadays he hangs out with us IRL which was okay at first, until he slung insults at my friends a lot of the time. So C would drive us around a lot, and at this particular time I was in the front seat next to him, when R starts making fun of C's exes. I know this probably sounds petty and dumb, along with the entire post, but I watched C tear up after R told him ""You only date ugly girls, bro. Go back to (ex)."" This really made me pissed. I've never witnessed my friend C get remotely close to crying to petty insults, but R managed to do it in record time. He also won't do anything with my friends unless I can guaranteed go with them, which makes me question him a lot. Hell, I was sick one weekend and didn't respond to anyone's DM's due to it, and he ignored me for the next 2 weeks. To add on a bit more context/information, he wouldn't just insult people during Facetime/Discord, but also throughout the school days, summertime, etc. If you don't talk about video games or school to him, his go-to topic will be people. And never anything good about these people, either.

I honestly think my ""friend"" is an egomaniac and I have no clue what to do about it. Most people will probably see this as really petty to complain about, but when someone insults my best friends it really pisses me off, which is why I decided to post here. I kind of broke down today explaining that and some other drama to my mom, because describing that one of my best friends that I genuinely love almost started crying due to his R's bullsh\*t insults really hits me hard. When I saw him teary-eyed in the car I felt immense stress build up and I almost became teary-eyed too, and even looking back pisses me off and makes me feel depressed. A couple of hours ago I dmed C about some of the various sh\*t-talking, out of frustration.

Anyways, thanks so much if you read through my ramble, I know it's pretty petty but I have no clue what to do about it and was just seeking some advice.",09Sep2020,1

353,"My (23F) ex (24M) wants to get back together with me, and I’m unsure of how to work this out.

So back like three weeks ago, my ex of 1.5 years broke up with me. He said it was because he felt there were other people more compatible with us long term. I was a wreck for awhile. Granted I had a few other things going on (I’ve made posts about my other problems if it helps to read them) but losing him was a big stressor on my already hectic late August. 

Wednesday he told me he thinks he made a mistake, and that he wanted to get back together. He said he missed me, that I’m really everything he needs, and that he could see himself marrying me. The next day, my friends revealed that in the time between the breakup and his saying this to me, he’d been on a tinder date. My friends were also a guilty party in this but that’s another matter. Point is, I was hurt. I felt betrayed that he’d gone on a date only a few days before coming back to me. It just seemed so unlike him, so out of character. I felt like I lost trust in him. 

Some more info, and this may be NSFW but I don’t know. Sex is a very very personal thing for me. I only give that when I fully trust someone, which is why I’ve never been able to do hookups or anything. Sex is also a very important thing for me ex; his primary love language is physical touch, and the main way he expresses that love is through sex. 

What I know about myself is that I’ll need to spend time with him before giving that to him again. I need to get to know him again and I need to know for sure that all that he’s said is true. I need to know that he actually thinks I’m the right person for him, and that he doesn’t just miss me. I feel like the only way to do this for me is to spend quality time with him. Like going on a picnic, making dinner together, etc. Meaningful things we can do together during covid. The problem is, he has a very busy schedule. He works a lot and also is preparing to graduate, so his classes are hectic. He’s told me that he doesn’t have a lot of time to spend freely. He states that he wants to show he loves me, which for him is through sex. I honestly don’t think I can give that to him in a meaningful way until I trust him again. 

I don’t know how to work through this. I need that time with him, not just time for sex. I need that meaningful time we used to have so I can trust him again. Help please?

TLDR my ex wants to get back together, and wants sex as a way to express his love in the best way. I lost trust in him and can’t give that back until I spend more time with him, but he is very busy.",09Sep2020,1
355,"So I'm 19 years old.

In my country military service is mandatory for 3 years and not doing your service is usually looked down upon.

Since I took anti-anxiety SSRIS before the military I couldn't be placed in anywhere I wanted (Intelligence or infantry or navy).

So they told me basically my options are be a truck driver, armoury, or fix tanks and military vehicles (or go to jail).

So I took the armoury where I give reservists weapons for training every week.

I'm at the base 5 days a week from monday to Friday and I come back home at like 8PM on Friday because my base is 4.5 hours from home. (Which isn't much for US standards probably but for my country it is kind of much and I get paid very little).

So I stopped taking my medication since I thought that would help me get somewhere better but since I'm a good soldier I guess my commanders are not really helping me and telling the mental health ""wokers"" that I'm not fit for infantry/intelligence/navy so I'm stuck here.


I'm unsatisfied and unhappy, I don't really have any friends I'm thinking a lot about suicide or going awol.


My options are basically to be a ""bad soldier"" and not work/ go awol, go to jail for a few months and get a better ""job"" meaning I'll get to a base closer to home and return home everyday (because that's how it works sadly in my military).


Or get out for mental reasons but that'll cause me to not be able to be become cop or work in Government institutions.",09Sep2020,1

360,"I met a guy on Tinder. Honestly i was just trying out the app for the first time in 2 years since i was 18 years old and used it for awhile. There i started talking to this guy that was being really nice and i eventually gave him my instagram so we could talk there instead. 

When we started talking it started getting a little weird... he first sent me a picture of his hand asking me if i thought he had good looking hands because that is something he this is attractive in himself that not a lot of people notice. I just jokingly replied to that message, and later he sent me another picture of him shirtless asking me what i think. Now at this point i was ready to block him right away, but before i did that i actually sent him a message saying something like “in my experience guys that send stuff like this only wants to get laid, and i am looking for something more serious”  and to my surprise he immediately apologized saying that that’s not what he wanted to do at all and that he is also interested in something more serious. And since his apology sounded very sincere i decided to keep talking to him. 

When we continued to talk yesterday he was being super nice and it turns out we have a lot in common. Eventually it started to turn a little weird (but this is where i’m unsure if it really is as weird as i think it is and this is mainly why i’m making this post) because he started being a little too personal for someone he has never even met. For example he started asking me if things were to get serious if he would be able to stay at my house for the weekend and if my parents would allow that? He also after we noticed how much we have in common (in personality and interests) jokingly said things like “i love you already” “are you my soulmate?” And stuff like that. 
After he started saying this i was a little put off by it and i was almost ready to stop talking to him again... but then we really bonded. He opened up to be about his difficult time growing up moving to another country two times and how he now teaches kids at his old school about being a immigrant which i was just super impressed by! I also opened up to him (which i never do) about my struggles and he was incredibly supportive, honestly he was being more supportive than many of my own friends. 

Is this weird? Should i go on a date with him? I really don’t know what to think. I mean he is the nicest and most supportive and inspiring guy i have ever talked to but sending me that shirtless picture as well as him being a little too (in my opinion) forward with asking me if he could stay at my house and things like that.",09Sep2020,1

I avoided hopefully seeing it as a sign that I haven't read it even though I know what the message is

I've gotten into anime and im a big weeb, but my parents disliked it. Even though im not addicted and I keep myself controlled. They always have to mention my love for anime or video games in a negative way and its never positive, and then they wonder why I wont talk to them about it. My mother and father are divorced so I had to go to my dads every 2 weeks and he is terrible, he would always take us to places where my mother said no and when we would go with his side of the family, if I was against them. They would talk shit to me and I had no defense to myself and even if I did, I would get in trouble for it. He would act likes hes god himself in public. When were alone, he would make me feel like im nothing, and my mother didnt do that, but whenever she would get mad at me. She would say ""Ill send you to your dads and youll never see me again you rat!"" I would feel terrible, and sometimes my mom would take my tv remote or my mouse and I couldnt do my schoolwork. Then I would get in trouble from my teachers, One day they took all my things and my money, they both said that im too ""addicted"" and I need to face reality. They said im not allowed to ever talk about Television or Computers. The only time I got to use the computer is when school starts and I get a hour extra for homework. Whenever I would go to a family members house or a party. No Games and No Television. I would be forced to read,exercise,eat only vegetables, so I could be a ""good impression"" for them (im 12 btw), and they figured out that I had online friends and I was into a girl at my school.

369," 

Hi there. I'm a 14 year old kid from New Zealand and I got some really bad depression.

So, my depression is that the fear that all there is at the end of life is pure hell.

What I imagine is that there is a being in a finite universe with nothing else anywhere else to destroy it, it has a way of living forever and we are all just a simulation and when we wake up all there will be is eternal pain and suffering.

I know that it is incredibly unlikely, and therapy could help and all that. I tried myself to scientifically disprove but I don't know how. I'm looking for someone to give me some kind of answer why it is impossible. I've tried thinking ""well even if that's all there is it can never really have my life"", but I if it did have this absolute control then it could just give me the depression I have now except a million times worse.

Please just help me, I don't know what to do and I hate this so much. I thought at the start that maybe I would find an answer quickly but it has lasted months now. Just someone please god tell me how it is all impossible or give me some kind of solution.

If you can't, at least upvote this so maybe someone else can, I don't care about karma I barely ever go on reddit but I just need help.",09Sep2020,1

I'm a 21F, and I have trouble falling asleep alone at night, or sometimes I have trouble falling asleep in general, because of my thoughts and darkness. I am scared of ghosts and whatnot, and along with this, several thoughts are rushing thru my head, like my past mistakes and such, but that's the least of my concern at the moment.

Yes, you read it right. I'm a grown adult who is scared of darkness/ ghost for no reason at all.

I can sleep, well before I ask for advice, I will leave my health conditions at the moment: I have migraines, I have a low blood pressure (kind of anaemic, is that similar? Idk). My doctor is always telling me to sleep properly but I can't!

The moment I doze off (I'm so upset at myself because even though I'm sleepy it always felt like something scary is around, thus making my body literally froze that I find it painful to move even though I scream at my head telling my body to wake up and move), I open my eyes and there you go, I can't sleep even though I now share beds with my brothers.

I am alone at the room
In the night
With such fears

379,"Emotional right now. Sometimes share too many details when emotional. 

I’m 38 weeks pregnant. Supposed to give birth in 2 weeks. 1st child. Quit my job in March w/ husband’s blessing. Morning sickness. I never went back to work Bc COVID complicated everything and I have history of miscarriage. 

I saved enough money to cover basic needs over the pregnancy. Student loans payments etc. We maintain separate bank accounts. I don’t ask him to pay my credit cards or my student loan debt. 

I declared personal bankruptcy to get out of my credit card debt. That’s in process right now with a local lawyer. Returning to work right now isn’t possible bc of my imminent birth and delivery and Bc it would really screw up my bankruptcy. 

Since March, I’ve been basically living off my husband’s paycheck. I manage all household finances and keep his credit in great standing. He makes the money, but I disperse it. (His car payment, car insurance, rent, our phones, groceries etc). 

I used to make more money than my husband, so I used to pay all the bills. His money was HIS money. Beer. Weed. Video games. His car payment. He doesn’t know how to pay monthly bills. So even though he’s paying everything now, I’m the one writing checks. I’m not trying to control it. I send him emails with details of where his money goes. He doesn’t read them. If I didn’t pay the bills, they would not get paid. He doesn’t care. He says it would be fun to “see what happens.” He doesn’t object to me initiating payments out of his account though. He just doesn’t care one way or another.

Since I’ve been off work, my house has never been cleaner. It’s not perfect, but it’s better than I was ever able to manage working 40-50 hour work weeks. I do all husband’s laundry. Home cooked meals. I take care of him in the bedroom, morning sickness or not. But he’s grown mean. Cruel even. He tells me my thoughts are vapid and that leaving work has made my brain mush. He says I’m lazy. (I nap during the day. I play on my phone. I do housewife stuff. True.   But he’s always fed, laundered and the house is clean). He says I’m needy Bc I do t have friends and I talk to him too much when he gets home. He smokes weed as soon as he gets home from work. He usually does not clean up after himself (except for an occasional anger cleaning). He makes huge messes, and then tells me I’m lazy and a slob. (I think he forgets he’s the one making the messes?) He talks consistently and openly about wanting to have sex with girls. Girls on tv. His massage therapist. Girls at work. This is new behavior. Since I quit work

He’s maintained most household expenses since March. But if he mismanages a paycheck, I would always just cover the rest from my dwindling personal checking/savings account. I.e. odds and ends like the cable bill or phones. Between $200-$700 a month. Doable. He doesn’t notice that i do that of course. 

This month, he spent September’s rent on weed. I covered it with my bank account... we communicated that he would reimburse me with his next paycheck. When he got his next paycheck, he spent it on online sports gambling.

My personal bank account is... very low right now. That money was supposed to last me until end of year. If he mismanaged money next month, we are screwed. 

So this morning, I freaked on him. I used swear words at him. I told him he was selfish. I told him I was going to my parents’ house. And I brought up his cruelness to me. I’ve been trying to ignore it. But we don’t make love anymore. the bedroom is about his needs only now. He doesn’t give me compliments anymore. He tells me he loves me. But it feels like the spark is gone. 

In return for my outburst, he burned our family photos. He also burned every single ultrasound photo I have of our Baby girl. That’s all I had. I can’t get more of those.

He told me I’m a “hoarder.” He has PTSD from his mother being a hoarder. He accuses me of hoarding regularly Bc I have personal possessions. He has very few possessions himself. 

He hit himself in the head most of the day.
He told me that he doesn’t like what I’ve become. He told me I’m lazy. I don’t cook for him. I don’t clean (complete lies). He’s also angry that I talk to my parents on the phone and invited my sisters to our house. He told me “I’ve seen you at your best, I’ve had the best of you. This is not the best of you.” Another of his arguments is that I ask him to
Lift things around the house (yes, lately Bc I’m. Not supposed to lift more than 25 pounds being advanced in pregnancy.)

I’ve tried to ignore the mistreatment. Bc we are codependent and we love each other. It’s been 7 years of really bad fights like this... and then making up and having the most connected and heavenly relationship. He does have family history of bipolar disorder. He has history of suicidal ideation and reckless behavior. (Drinking a bottle of NyQuil, driving at excessive speeds). 

But now I realize. He thinks I’m a loser. That’s new.l for me. Past fights... I at least believed he liked and loved me. Now. I don’t think he likes me anymoreZ 

So. Am I the bad guy here? I need perspective. I’m considering calling my mother, telling her everything and moving in with her until. I can get back on my feet financially.

My ex and I have been divorced for about 4 years.  He had gone no contact a year before. So he had deserted the marriage with no indication of any reconciliation. 

Now I know that texting him or keeping any contact with him is a terrible idea, but it's become a bad habit now. Like an itch that I just have to scratch. 

I end up staying awake most of the night, just hoping he'd text me.

Sometimes, he sees my status updates within seconds of me posting them. Other times, he blocks me.

Then, He puts up some racy messages and deletes it within seconds of me seeing it. 

Just typing this out makes me wonder if I am losing my mind.

* Feel I am too dumb for further study. Feel burnt out from GCSEs and A-Levels. Cannot for the life of me pursue university. 
* Potentially stuck with working minimum wage. (RE: First point.)
* The thought of moving out - massive transitions is incredibly scary and daunting, and the slightest bit of stress causes me to experience suicidal thoughts.
* Can't stop thinking about the future, and now that I can't think of a future, I feel stuck.
* Every time I manage to land a job - warehouse, call centre, customer service - I experience severe anxiety and panic attacks, and quit within weeks. Financial burden on my family. 
* People reckon I'm either on the Autism spectrum or ADD/ADHD. Terrible short-term memory, awful at maths. Without these qualities, then, in terms of careers, I'm essentially screwed.

We eventually talked things out and got back together, but even after that, I felt distant from him because it wasn’t the first time he’s done this or wanted to “take a break” from our relationship over something stupid. I felt like the “on/off” type of thing made it hard for me to have the same high hopes for us as I had in the beginning.

On my end, I feel as though the spark is gone because of the times he’s hurt me and let me down, and I feel I deserve better. After 2 years of dating, it took him dumping me, me starting to realize my worth, and start to move on, for him to beg for me back and say that NOW he wants forever. But I don’t, and I’ve been straightforward about it but he starts sobbing and begging for me to come back and it makes me uncomfortable, as if he’s guilting me to stay. He’s also been getting his parents involved, who then text or call me to encourage me to stay. It’s feeling really toxic right now, but because he’s someone I had so much love for, and still care about, it’s hard seeing him hurt. 

It’s just getting extremely hard to stand my ground, so I think I’m asking for advice on how to stand strong and explain to him that I can’t come back, even though the thought of hurting him is really getting to me. Please help, guys! I’ll take any advice; bad or good!!!",09Sep2020,1

Hello people of reddit, 

For years i have struggled with stuttering and this year has been the worst so far. Stuttering has always been a self-confidence problem. When I meet new people or when I have to do a presentation at school, it always causes mental problems like depression or extreme anxiety. This week I'm going to a new school and I'm already scared about introducing myself to my class. All my life I have only had traumatic experiences with stuttering and i keep thinking about it all the time. I'm really devastated and have to find something that will just make it go away! I already have therapy but I just want there to be something that will make it less and not have constant anxiety issues. Do you guys know anything other than therapy that will help?

I never took account or any subject related to account in School. I didn't finished the last two years of School.

During these 3 years that I searched and applied for jobs, I have seen lots of accountant jobs and the salary was on a different level compared to the jobs that someone like me can qualify to apply.

Also I am an extremely quiet person. So much so that I don't even have friends and stuff because I am that quiet and like to stay alone most of my times.

I heard the two best areas for someone like me can get into without spending lots of money is being an accountant or an IT guy. I have no interest in IT related stuff and it is an area that I would need to keep learning all the time because technology keeps getting advanced everyday.

397,"This guy and I have been dating for over a year now. Just like every couple, we went through both amazing times and rough patches. However, a few months before the end of this year together, we started fighting more frequently.

 He was stressed out about the thought of leaving the country to continue his college degree abroad and thus was constantly in a bad mood. Since I understood his stress, I mainly accepted that it was going to take some time before he comes back to being bubbly and spontaneous. However, I never stopped pointing out things he did that either bothered me or that I considered unacceptable. After some time it just got from bad to worse, none of the things I pointed out seemed to get to him despite him telling me he would stop repeating this behavior. At the end I was done with just hoping he'd actually listen and told him that I wanted to break up, that when he was leaving the country we should also part ways. I think the fear of loosing me or whatever hit him because from this day till the one he left he became a sweetheart. He was no longer displacing his emotions at me, no longer complaining about everything... it was just great. I figured that since I still had feelings for him and that he was still willing to put in some efforts than there was still something to try. We got into a long distance relationship

Just like everything with a new start, it all went well in the begining and then gradually a distance started appearing between us. I no longer felt like we were dating just communicating and telling each other empty words of love. Since I was so used to being with him I figured I'd just let it slide and see if that little spark would grow again with time. However, as I mentionned before we had a long rocky phase (4-5 months) and I struggled to keep it out of my mind. So I started questionning if it was even possible for us to be happy again together and even if we were good for one another.  I am not unhappy with him, neither is he bad for me but I just don't really feel in love anymore. I think I should mention he's my first serious relationship so I may be overthinking everything.

Point is I messed up. I was out with a friend with whom I used to be a thing before my boyfriend and we were just hanging out. Nothing ever really happened between us so we just became good friends. However at the end of our night we were just chilling in my car and we started playing play fight. It was really just throwing stuff at each other and trying to hit one another but it escalated. He started grabbing my hands so I couldn't move and pulling him to him to stop me from fighting back. It even got to the point where we were jokingly bitting one another. I know how horrible this looks from the outisde but I genuinly felt like we were just friends messing with one another. Nothing more than that happened and then we just parted ways. I am a strong believer that if someone wouldn't act a specific way just because their so is not around then they shouldn't act this way to begin with. Needless to way I went against that principle of mine.

I know that I shouldn't have let it happen and that it was completely out of the line. I feel genuinly terrible for letting things go this way. I talked to my boyfriend about it he was pretty okay since he knows I wouldn't cheat or anything like that. I also talked to this guy with whom everything happened and told him it shouldn't happen again, he agreed. Yet I can't help but feel shitty. I know what I did was bad and that I shouldn't have done this but I really don't know what to do about this whole situation. I don't know if I love my boyfriend, I don't know if I should break up. I am really confused and dissapointed in myself. I'd really like someone's opinion on the topic please.",09Sep2020,1
398,"So I booked an appointment with a therapist/psychologist last week just because I feel lonely and need someone to talk to. I have friends (but they moved outside the country to study abroad), I have less closer friends too that i can hang out with here, i have family that loves me, I go out every weekend partying/drinking. I hook up with guys if I want to. I sometimes go on dates. I work as well. So yeah my life is good. But the problem is me and myself and my brain. I feel very lost, lonely, craving attention 24/7 (from guys), i feel there is a lot of hate in me, i have commitment issues, i distance myself from ppl as soon as i feel we are getting closer (probably because ppl have betrayed me in the past).

Anyways im really lazy to go see the therapist now. I also dont feel like it will help in any way. (Ive been to a therapist a year ago and that was useless. She told my parents there was nthg wrong with me). Should I just call in sick?",09Sep2020,1
399,"So I just graduated C/O 2020, I live with only my grandma and I have been working for about a year now because I have literally no one else but her to rely on to live. She is 72 years old and cleans houses still, it is her own cleaning business she has no type of retirement plan. We have been just trying to get the bills paid on time and we have been doing okay but obviously I don't want to live like this forever. She already has. 

I tried to get on route for college but with all this online shit I honestly don't know how im going to do it. Ive been trying though I missed Fall semester because all my classes were on waitlists so im going to wait until January. Still not 100% on what im going to do but nursing was up there for me (just for pay).

Now here we go, ive been talking to my girl for about 4 months and we have connected so fast, (ive known her since middle school) we needed each other in that moment we were both going thru some deep shit. She's my bestfriend and ill do anything for her I know she'll do anything for me. 

She is living in a very very abusive household and she needs to get out of there. She has very bad anxiety and depression, she already tried to do shit to herself but she is doing better now. I just dont know how much longer she can deal with being in that house. She turns 18 in May and graduates in June, we have been talking about her moving in after graduation.

We went through it all already about how if she comes she will never be able to go back to her parents (no matter what her parents do to her she will still love them she is just that type of person), what if this happens, this and that. We both know what could and what will happen. I know she will come here and help me and my grandma out, she works and is going to be i  school so she will help out with bills and hopefully get some of that pressure off my grandma. 

Obviously a part time job wont help as much but I am thinking of just dropping school and just go full time at my job. I basically have been working full time but I have been just slacking calling off and shit just due to laziness and depression. But those two women motivate me. 

I guess im just asking if having her move in? And what I should do about school, i fucking hate school and to me college is such a scam but thats how this life is.",09Sep2020,1

402,"Lets just start this off by saying I haven't had any sleep at all tonight.

I got hired at a Country Club serving. Its my first day at work, the week before HR asks me to bring in my 401k paperwork filled out with a second form of ID. The receptionist makes me wait for HR for 20 mins. I came in before my shift at 3 to get fitted for a uniform. The uniform ends up being way too big and the pants are flooded. Super tacky for fine dining. I get paired up with a young woman who seems really nice but now that I think about it, she never had me go on a break, she kept messing up with tables (I've never had people train me who have had mistakes like this. looking back these kind of feel like this is just who she is) by not bringing out the correct amount of cookies at the end for each person, she fucked off towards the end of the shift and decided she wanted to go get an ice cream (steal) and I know its dumb but she didn't even offer me one so why did she have me come with her, then she took 20 mins talking to her friends in the other part of the building (she kept finding reasons to go over to talk to them), then instead of doing the sidework we SHOULD have done, we end up taking 30 more minutes (when everyone else is finished and gone. and on top of that she left me to do part of it, again). I have class in the morning. It's late, and I'd like to go home to my partner. It feels like she just dicked around on the clock to beef up her hours at my expense. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm feeling so anxious. She asked how I thought it was going and I was honest that I felt like I wouldn't be able to keep working here after this and she seemed surprised. When we finally got to the break room one of her friends asked me if I'd be staying and I told her I didn't think I could after this shift. The girl who was training me just stormed out.

&amp;#x200B;

But now that I think about it I'm starting to wonder if maybe she just didn't want me to work there? Or maybe she was just a bad server/trainer. She kept gossiping by putting it off as ""I'm telling you for your own good"" about the other coworkers or saying how some of them were weird. But they were all really really kind and helpful to me. Except her...

Liam is a friendly guy, as am i and we became friends and would bring each other energy drinks to get thru our shifts from time to time. we have opened up to each other somewhat and **(TW)** has told me that if he ever saw new cuts on me he would 'test out all his kinks on me', i laughed at the time because i was a bit uncomfortable. Last night Liam walked me home from work as it was dark by then and i waited and talked with him while he was waiting for his uber. He was trying to hold my hand and had his arm around me and seemed like he was psyching himself up to kiss me. in the past he has done a middleschool type bullshit like texting me 'if he had kissed me what i would do' etc.  i have a girlfriend and i kept bringing her into conversation while Liam was making dirty jokes directed at me, only for him to tell me 'she can join us' and 'she wouldnt mind'.

404,"Hi,
my neighbours were hostile against us even before they moved in (we think it's because the previous neighbours we had was bad as well, although perhaps not as bad as them and they might trashtalked us). They've been annoying us for 5 -7 years or so.
In general we have a good relationship with all of our neighbours and as far as I perceived, they don't do any social activities.

In the past, they've done things like being loud a lot, or doing stuff like painting their big-ass shed with some weird stuff that smelled horrible and toxic for 1-2 days, observe us and smoking.

Especially smoking has been a big problem. I have asthma and my mother has a even worse disease on her lungs, so we both must not inhale this shit. In the past, both would smoke directly at the plot boundary, watching us. In the meantime, we build a wall (2m high) so they would stop staring at us. However, it obviously does not help against smoke and she's still be able to eavesdrop on us.

In the past days I've talked to them several times.
In short: he's nice, she's an inconsiderate, aggressive person that can't be arranged with, hates my mother and she won't be going somewhere else.

Now I'm frustrated and angry. I mean, in approx. a year I'll be moving out to go to a university and don't have to deal with them as much anymore. But it's unfair that my parents will still be suffering from her and it seems like we can't do much about it.
If I go outside I'm afraid that she will be smoking and I don't wanna think about her, but I do again and again.

405,So I’m a middle age man with a wife and 3 kids I have a ok job and probably lower middle class. Anyways I am a 2nd generation here in the states. So I’ve had a history of drug use and alcoholism and gambling I’m not to proud of but I have gotten over with and they are in the past I’m just trying to remove o. With my wife and kids but I have a big issue with my father. He lives about 20 miles away from where I do but never seems to keep his mouth shut about my misconduct in the past he’s always bringing it up with who ever speaks with him whether neighbors family or if we all attend family events he’ll bring up innuendos of people with drug problems or gambling issues and I hate it so much it caused me to stray away from him. I don’t know if this makes any difference I was hanging out with my uncle one night after having this huge argument with my dad about 7 years ago and my uncle told me you know your dad isn’t an angel himself in the 70s before you were born I had to pick him up on Reno once because he spent all his money gambling he was stranded with no car or nothing and he goes on to tell me his run in with some drug use and alcohol as well. So many times I felt like saying what I know to my dad and I never find the courage to when I see him I see this old 73 year old man who means no harm but it’s like he’s doing it more and more.

411,"Aloha, reddit.  This one's a bit long, but humor me.

&amp;#x200B;

I've worked professionally as a cook/chef for about 15 years now. I love what I do. Not just as a profession, but in general. My passion for cooking started as a kid watching my single mom cook for her four kids. She always had time to cook, despite working 3 jobs. There were the occasional nights of take-out from the Korean or Japanese place down the street, but most of the time it was always something she made sure we had; a nice, home-cooked dinner. I started helping her in the kitchen around age 6, and watched her like a hawk! I knew this was what I wanted to do after she gave me a challenge. What was that challenge?  ""RedEyeCouncil, can you please cook dinner for us tonight? I need a nap."" I remember what I made, but to put it shortly, my mom and siblings loved it. And I loved how happy it made them. Since then I cooked dinner as much as I could.

&amp;#x200B;

Now to present day me: Started working in kitchens my senior year of high-school and put myself through culinary school.  I have a great network of chef and farmer friends and all their excitement and curiosity does is bolster mine. We would often get together (pre-Covid, of course) to either play with the ideas we've been having or just have a good cook-out. A friend and I were in talks to start up our own food-truck when Covid hit. I lost my job, my friend lost his and mid-April he had to return back home to Oregon since he wasn't able to make ends meet. This hasn't hampered my desire to be in the kitchen, or even start up the food truck on my own. It's my health that has me worried.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a narcoleptic, diagnosed at 17. During the shutdown, I took another sleep study and found out I also have chronic insomnia. I put my body through hell as a flat-footed kid and well through my twenties. As a result I have arthritis in one knee, a floating knee-cap in the other, chronic pains in my ankle from when I broke it in high-school, and a bad back. My hands both have carpal tunnel and my knife hand has chronic pains from when I broke it in a hiking accident. My doctor for the passed few years has suggested I switch careers. With my lack of ability to get a good nights sleep, and the weariness of my conditions, my body has not been able to repair and recover as much as it should have. Couple that with 14+ hour days of constant moving, bending, lifting and the countless amounts of cigarettes and drinks I've had over the passed decade and a half, and it is not pretty.

&amp;#x200B;

My rheumatologist said something on my last visit that really sunk in. Essentially, my arthritic knee looks like someone's almost twice my age, and if I do not find a different career my quality of life will drop severely within the next decade. I've had a few tear-laden conversations with my girlfriend and family about it, and they all agree that I should find something else.  But whenever I think about it, it breaks my heart. It's all I've ever known, it's all I've ever wanted to do.  But I know I have to. Both for my sake, and the sake of the kids I hope to have one day. 

&amp;#x200B;

One thing this shutdown has helped me realize is how much shit I've put my body through. Actually slowing down and relaxing has made me aware that I am falling apart. As if that wasn't enough, I'm currently on crutches because of the swelling in my knee. There is a bright side in all this; I'm nearly five months cigarette and alcohol free (Besides the alcohol I use in my cooking) and it feels great. My sense of taste and smell have tripled.

&amp;#x200B;

My big question is where do I start? Should I go back to school? Can I leverage my skills developed in the kitchen elsewhere? Any advice is appreciated.

416,"My boyfriend's (25) mother (60s) has been suffering from multiple system atrophy (MSA) for the past 7 years and my bf recently found out that people typically live about seven to 10 years after MSA symptoms first appear. For those who don't know what MSA is, MSA is a rare, degenerative neurological disorder affecting your body's involuntary (autonomic) functions, including blood pressure, breathing, bladder function and motor control (Mayo Clinic). 

Ever since my bf found out about the average lifespan he's been pretty devastated. She's been suffering for the past 7 years so he thinks the deadline is approaching really fast which breaks both our hearts.

418,"Hi. We are four members in our family, my mother, father, brother and I. 

Mother - A cancer patient. Has a terrible marital life for the past 30 years, where she was humiliated and left uncared for in many serious circumstances. Is naive and is having suicidal thoughts recently. 

Father - The only bread-winnee of our family. A narcissist. But, also has a complete change of personality sometimes, so much that I end up questioning myself for judging him. But, our last interaction cleared all my doubts. He talked ill of my mother behind her back when she was in the hospital. Reminded me everyday how they are almost divorced. When I ask him to actually get a divorce and stop living together, rather than telling me regularly how bad their marriage is, he blames me and tells me I want it. 
We haven't been on talking terms for almost a month now, despite living in the same house. This deeply saddens me because he used to share a very good bond. 

Brother - A 28 y/o man child with a kid on the way. He feeds on the earnings of my father. And has no intention of doing a job, ever. He says he'll homeschool his kid, so that he won't have to spend on him. Got into my a fight with my parents in the morning when they found out his stash. Rather than apologizing, he owned up to it. Says he will continue doing it because he wants to. Shouted at my mom who is in a fragile condition. She said to him that she wants to commit suicide, but I'm the only one keeping her from doing it. He pays absolutely no heed to her. 

I have a sister in law too, but she has been living with her parents for the past 4-5 months due to pregnancy. Although, she is very kind to me, she is very immature and threatens my brother that if he won't talk to her, she'll jump off the stairs. 

I particularly feel very sad for my mom and my future niece/nephew. My mom has only suffered in this house and I wish to make life better for her. But, I'm currently studying and can start earning and supporting her only after two years. Till then, I feel very helpless. 

And needless to say, this has been affecting my mental health very badly. I have been living at home because of the pandemic and it is being increasingly intolerable. My psychiatrist prescribed me medicines but my family doesn't want me to take those, so I can't. Additionally, I am a law student so I have immense pressure from my college. It's being a somewhat difficult for me to juggle everything. 

I am seeing a therapist online and it's really good to get some insight, but that's kind of temporary because the madness in my house consumes me completely. My mom told me to move on and think that I don't have a family. That way, I won't have expectations from them. But hearing this really hurts. 

I really feel like cutting all ties with everyone except my mom. They are very very toxic. They see me crying and pass backhanded comments on it or don't acknowledge it at all. 

So, dear redditors, do you have any advice for me?",09Sep2020,1
419,"A bit of background as to why I'm (18M, providing this as my age might be a cause for why I'm reacting this way because I'm not fully-matured yet) asking for advice here: 

Over the past 2 years, I've been able to largely overcome some depression by self-improvement (writing and listening to music, exercise, eating properly, having hobbies, leaving a 2 year relationship with someone who is also mentally damaged and was just dragging me down, and finally getting a job) and I've been happier than I've ever been.

But, for the past few months, I've been having an existential crisis (not for lack of direction in life or the fear of death, just the fact that it's going to happen eventually and I've been thinking about my dog and my mother getting old) and that's been affecting me really badly, leading to me having sleep issues, not taking care of my hygiene and grooming and not exercising as I used to. I got over it for a bit, but it has come back just as I wanted to start exercising again.

It came back in the form of me taking my dog (maltese, female, will be 11yo soon) for a grooming service for the first time yesterday (either me or my sister used to do it), to see what it would be like. My mother took her in while I was at work and after about an hour, she called me and said that the grooming parlour needed help because she was barking and trying to bite constantly and they couldn't cut her hair or nails. I finished up some of my work and went there to see what was happening. The lady cutting her hair had accidentally gave her a few cuts and scrathes (nothing major, and you can't see anything today), but I'm sure that dog very obviously didn't like it. So we left after finishing up her hair and trimming her nails.

Once we got home, I gave her some treats for going through that and then the existential dread really started setting in. I noticed how saggy and wrinkly her skin was (due to her age), which I hadn't took note of because of how furry and still fairly energetic she is. I managed to fight it off before it got too bad and took a sleeping pill to go to bed later on.

The following morning (today), it got the best of me. I just broke down in tears for about 45 minutes and typing this out seems to have stopped it. So, even if no one has any advice for me/didn't read this, I'm thankful that this helped a bit.

Have a fantastic day/evening, everyone.",09Sep2020,1
420,"So for starters, I just want to say if you read this post and think I’ve made a bad decision, or I’m dumb, an idiot, etc. Please keep it to yourself. I’ve heard enough of that and I’m down about myself enough. I’ve made the decision I’ve made and I’m sticking to it. You’re not gonna change my mind. All I want is advice on how to be encouraged again. 

So to make a long story short, my fall semester for community college started a few weeks ago. I also got hooked up with a pretty awesome, but demanding sales gig around the same time which I was really excited about because I’ve always been a great salesman. I told myself I could balance both sales and college at the same time, but a couple weeks in I realized that wasn’t possible. I realized I either had to focus solely on the sales gig or college, or put half-assed effort into both. I decided I wanted to pursue sales full-time because I’m so good at it, so I dropped my fall classes. 

My Mom had helped me pay for my classes and I respected that so I reimbursed her for every penny of her portion of the cost. She’s not satisfied though and she is still very angry at me for the decision I made and said I was foolish. After a lot of back and forth, I went to my Dad’s house to talk to him about it because he’s usually pretty encouraging when it comes to taking risks but for some reason he was in the same boat. So after getting torn into by both of my parents, I went to a subreddit to tell my story thinking I could get some encouragement there or at least some affirmation that it’s okay to take risks especially since I’m so young (20M) but even THERE I got absolutely torn into. I was called a stubborn, foolish idiot, a retard, an arrogant fool, etc. To be fair, I definitely chose the wrong subreddit to go to for affirmation and idk what I was thinking lol but that’s why I’m here now. Regardless, I was super amped up about this sales gig before but now I’m feeling really down about myself and incredibly discouraged. Every time I open my laptop to study the sales tactics we were told to learn, I can’t get my mind off of everyone telling me I’m an idiot for pursuing sales instead of my fall classes. It’s like there’s a nagging voice in the back of my head telling me “they’re right, you suck. You’re an idiot. You’ll never succeed at this.” 

How do I get this voice out of my head? How can I be encouraged and motivated again? I know deep down I have it in me to kick ass at sales but I feel stuck in a rut of self-loathing and apathy. 

Anything helps, even if it’s just a few kind, encouraging words. 

Thanks in advance :)",09Sep2020,1
421,"Hi all,

I'm a 28 yo M who dated a girl for about seven months last year (July 2019 - February 2020). I broke up with her in February for a couple of chronic problems where I felt I had to and that the maturity level of our relationship just wasn't there. Since then, we hooked up about three times spaced out between March to May, with the most recent being in late May, a combination of her reaching out and me reaching out, the one in late May being her reaching out.

I started dating someone new in July, but I ended things with this girl about two weeks ago. Since then, I cannot stop thinking about my ex and how much I miss her and how no one else has measured up to her. 

I've considered reaching out to my ex again, but I haven't for a couple of reasons for which I could really use advice with. First, she appears to be ""dating / hooking up"" a new guy that she met in June. They have no official pictures together at all, but on one of my ex's most recent instagram photos, this guy commented with a guy hands up emoji, and she commented back with a kiss face. She's liked one of his photos which was back in July, and he's liked all of her photos since like late June, so it adds up with the timeline that she met this guy about three weeks after I last hooked up with her in late May. My friend did point out that none of her friends follow him on instagram, but it still appears that she's hooking up with him from the emoji kissing face post (and the fact that he looks like her type, and I've never heard of him, and they met recently). The other thing is that she has one of her best friend's wedding in about three weeks from now, so I'd imagine she has already asked him to go with her to the wedding.

This is where I could really use some advice: I'm absolutely dying to reach out to her, I can't sleep, and I just want to tell her how I feel. I'm worried that if I reach out when she's already hooking up with someone (and probably already invited this person to a wedding that's happening soon) that I'm just setting myself up for failure and that it would be a horrible time to try and win her back. I had a couple ideas/options of what I could do:

1. Try  to win her back now, even though it's likely that she's with someone else. I never got my stuff back from her place, so I could reach out about that and then try to set up a time to talk with her in person or drop flowers off with a note explaining how I feel. However, I can't help but feel like I'm setting myself up for failure and more heartbreak with this method
2. Don't try to win her back since she's almost certainly dating someone else (nothing official, no photos together, but its likely). Her birthday is in December, I could wait until after the wedding passes, then reach out to her in December on her birthday (she may be single then, or if she's not, at least I have a decent reason to reach out to her and it might be a better time?)
3. Reach out to one of her friends that I know about her, ask if she's dating anyone officially and tell them how I feel, then proceed with 1 or 2?

TLDR: Dated my ex for six months, last hooked up with her in late May, I am dying to get back together with her but don't know what to do if she's been dating one guy for the past 2 months or so, though no official pictures together. I was wondering if any girls/guys could weigh in on how they would feel if their ex reached out to them in this scenario, or if its happened to them and how they went about it. Thank you!",09Sep2020,1
422,"Aloha reddit! This one's a bit long, but humor me.

I'm a 32 year old male, and I've been working as a cook/chef for a little over 15 years. I love what I do, not just professionally but in general. My passion for cooking started as a kid watching my single mother cook for her 4 kids. She always made time to do it despite working 3 jobs. There were the occasional nights of take-out from the Korean or Japanese place down the street, but more often than not she always made sure we had a nice, home-cooked meal. I started helping her in the kitchen when I was 6 and I watched her like a hawk! I knew this is what I wanted to do when she asked me to cook dinner for the family while she took a quick nap before going to her next job. To put it shortly, they all loved it, and I loved how it made me feel.

Now to present day me: Started working in kitchens my senior year in high-school and put myself through culinary school. I have a wonderful network of chef and farmer friends, and all their curiosity and excitement does is bolster mine even more. We would often get together (Pre-Covid, of course) to play around with the ideas we've been having or just to have a good cook-out. A friend and I were even in talks of opening a food truck when Covid hit. We both lost our jobs, and mid-April he had to move back to Oregon since he couldn't make ends meet. The current situation that the world is in is not why I need to change careers. It's my health.

I'm narcoleptic, diagnosed at 17. During the shutdown I took another sleep study and found out I also have chronic insomnia. My right knee has arthritis, the other a floating knee cap. I have chronic pains in my ankle from when I broke it in high-school. Both my hands have carpal tunnel and my knife hand also has chronic pains from when I broke it in a hiking accident about 6 years ago. Couple all of these with 14+ hour days of constant moving, bending, lifting, and kneeling, with only a smoke break or two. Add on a countless number of cigarettes, night-caps and various other drugs, and it is not pretty. Without being able to get a good nights rest, and just the weariness my conditions leave me in, my body has not been able to repair itself as much as it should have. As a result, I am essentially falling apart.

My rheumatologist said something during my last visit that really sunk in. My arthritic knee looks like someones almost double my age, and if I don't change careers my quality of life would drop severely. I've talked with my girlfriend, friends, and family, and they all agree that I should. Killing myself on the line isn't worth it, and I agree. But every time I think about it, it breaks my heart. It's all I've ever known. It's all I've ever wanted to do. But I need to for my sake and the sake of the kids I hope to have someday. This shutdown has really made me realize how broken my body is. Actually slowing down and relaxing has made me aware of the torment I was putting my body through. As if that wasn't enough, I'm currently on crutches because of the swelling in my knee. There is a bright side in this though; I'm nearly 5 months cigarette and alcohol free and I feel great. My sense of taste and smell have tripled!

My question is, where do I start? Should I go back to school? Can I leverage the skills I developed in the kitchen elsewhere? Any advice is appreciated.

423,"Hi, I’ll try to make this brief and sorry for any mistakes, English is my second language.

Recently I got a job that pays really good for my age (22), at the same time I’m currently studying on the afternoons, the problem is that it is a 10hs job with 1 hour or so to commute, which is a lot and really far from my house, if I miss the morning bus, which is only one, I have to Uber and that cost extra, and it’s taking a toll on my studies, one day I slept on my online class given how tired I was, I’m at a dilemma here since I got the job thanks to my dad and I dont want to leave since I feel he would feel like I dint appreciate the effort he did and will make him look bad before the people that he recommended me to. 

The best option would be to get a car, it would make it much easier, but i dint have any savings plus since I haven’t work for a long period of time I don’t think I can get a loan.

Any opinion or option to the matter would be highly appreciated, Thanks!",09Sep2020,1
424,"Hello redditors, this is my (22f) first time posting so I'm not quite sure what I'm doing. 

My grandma, who is turning 96 this December, just found out she has cancer. The doctor said, that due to her age and frail body there is almost nothing they can do treatment wise. All they can do is find out where the cancer is (pelvis or uterus) and hopefully lesson the pain to come. 
Now, my grandma is a very smart woman. She's been in the stocks for years and has always had a smart and sassy comeback for everything you throw at her. She is quite independent and lives at home with part time care. So my family never saw this coming. 
My Grandma is being really strong about this but our family is absolutely devastated. 

The doctor said that she probably only has until the end of this year. I keep pretending I'm fine but all I can think about is how any moment could be her last. She'll never get to see me graduate college, or get married. I didn't know if she would have made those events without cancer but now it's really hitting me. Sorry, this is quite depressing. 

Since her birthday and Christmas are coming up I was wondering what I should get her? I have absolutely no talent in art or crafting. I just want to give her something meaningful...

I guess I also wanted to talk to someone else...
Thanks!",09Sep2020,1

428,"What do I need to do to get full custody of the family dog? My brother stupidly bought a dog when he was going through a breakup and can’t look after him whatsoever, the dog is a burden to him, I am his younger brother by six years and have walked him every morning before work without fail for 1.5 years now, I even walk him most nights because he’s not around (he is supposed to do the night walk) or doesn’t take him when he is suppose to take him. I have arranged his food which comes every month from Tails.com which costs me £23/month and I have been doing this for over a year now. I have bought him several harnesses, a little dog shirt. Several toys, one of every treat from the dog section of the store. I am now considering purchasing a dog training collar which is around £100, a water fountain and a dog bowl which opens on a timer so that he can get his food when we aren’t going to be home in time. As this is how I believe a dogs life is suppose to be, the dog is only here for between 12-15 years and you need to make its years the best possible and to live it to it’s maximum potential. I make sure he has been walked when he needs to be walked, I make sure his water is topped up at all times, I make sure he is happy and I take him to the woods when I get the chance. I just want him to be cared for and acknowledged. My mum and brother are taking his love and affection for granted, a dog loves you more than it loves its self. I am afraid my brother will have a stubborn immature response and will say it’s his dog because he wants to have that title and wants to feel like he is capable when in actuality he isn’t. It never once has sprung to his mind that Oscar needs nice things, multiple treats, multiple toys, boxes full with both. I am 21 this Sep 23rd and I know I am definitely young for such responsibility but I’d rather it was me than both my brother or my mum. For me, oscars comes first. Even when it comes to my Dad it feels as though he doesn’t want him even though I thought my dad was a dog lover. Regardless, Oscar is relying on a human to love him and care for him as much as he is willing to love and care for us and I feel I am the only one that can reciprocate that. It saddens me to know that he is turning 2 in November and he doesn’t have over a dozen toys, he hasn’t been to doggy training yet (I took matters into my own hands again and booked this but it was just before the pandemic so Oscar hasn’t been able to go), his own wardrobe etc. All advice is much appreciated",09Sep2020,1

My friend suffers from Bipolar disorder and is very vulnerable to depressive swings because of this. He's been put on anti depressants since this happened as it was after this I pressed him to get help knowing he'd do something stupid with how he was ostracised by his main community he uses for socialising. 

This was all started when he had a bad swing and became lonely at the start of the virus lockdown in the UK he went out of his way to try and find people to talk to as to help him stay sane, but being desperate as he was he ended up within a chat of people that from what i can tell act like high schoolers (when i say this i mean a group of childish bullies) as they spend their time hating on many groups. I will admit he took too long to leave the group but in the end he did when he got himself into a state where he was able to see the wood from the trees. But by this point it was too late and trying to fit into the group and not get rejected he said things he thought were just jokes but from how the chat is it's hard to tell what is and isn't.

435,"i've been obsessed with her for almost a year...

first year at college... first couple of weeks, i didn't really care much about her... i thought that she was attractive, but i didnt really give a fuck...

then i started to develop feelings towards her...

i could see that she definitely was interested in me as well...

i started looking at her socials... 

she gave me those looks every time (she gave me other signals as well,, but its kinda irrelevant) we happened to be together... 

ironically, didn't like her back in real life...

can anyone explain me ffs? that's one of the weirdest parts... when i was away from here, we didn't have same schedules, didn't see her everyday, i used to be like, oh, def gonna make something happen.. pictures of her didn't help too... used to think about her... than i'd see her again, and BOOM.... every feeling gone in a snap... and i regretted every second i thought of her.. 

but.... IRONICALLY same thing happened... AGAIN, AGAIN AND AGAIN!!! it was a cycle..

literally, the whole semester...

then unfortunately, corona happened...

now it got even more FUCKED UP...

i couldn't see her anymore... so, as i explained, my feelings became stronger (i obviously stopped seeing her and the weird thing that i just described stopped happening)... i started looking at her instagram everyday, thought a lot about her... felt fucked up, had mixed feelings, lockdown didn't help either, neither did the fact that i kinda cut everyone off (i spent the entire time at home)... regretted not doing anything... but also, knew that i would regret THAT thought as well, after seeing her...

anyways,, the whole spring semester was like that... at home... fucked me up mentally... i even developed the fear that she might have known that i stalked her the entire time... even tho i wasn't even logged in into anything...

then the break too...

anyways,, now we're back again... its thankfully not online anymore... tho it did still fuck me up that we didn't end up together in any of the classes... cuz i was kinda hoping i would.. but see, again, WHY TF AM I EVEN THINKING THAT WAY???

tho still haven't see her... the schedules are different... tho i definitely will at the end of the week at least...

but see... 

i know it sounds creepy and stuff...

but im just so done.... and fucked up mentally..

i dont even know what to do about it anymore...

as i said, she always gave me ""signals"" but i dont know how i'll react if she won't tho anymore... (Tho im kinda sure she doesn't even have any idea that i even liked her... even a bit, i acted super standoffish towards her, and didn't even respond to her attempts of starting a conversations (Tho she did it for like 3 times))

it might fuck me up, even if i'll stop liking her (there's  a big chance of that doe, cuz its been like 7 months, and i literally dont even use any social media (anymore), so she hasn't even seen me even virtually ever since)

&amp;#x200B;

I may “be the problem” in housemate situations but I’m not super annoying or anything, Its just that I find I’m ALWAYS the one uncomfortable or unhappy with roommates. The most simple things cause me panic attacks. 

I moved out at 18, and clearly have trauma from having never had a safe secure space to call home for the past 10 years. So naturally, every little thing sets me on edge. A roommate coughing from the living room, triggers me to all the times I lived with people who would throw up everywhere constantly because they were alcoholics/druggies/sick all the time. 
Laughter from the other room gives me anxiety because  I’m triggered to the times friends turned roommates ganged up against me to try and illegally kick me out. 
Sounds in the kitchen trigger me to all the times my food was stolen and personal things violated. and the list goes on. 

At the very moment I live with a couple. They ignore me 95% of the time unless I say something first, which is fine. But they consume the apartment like it’s 100% their own.

More context: I go to sleep around 11:30pm and wake up at 7am. I start studying literally the second I get out of bed and finish at around 9:30pm normally (with school for 6 hours in between). Afterwards I play piano from 9:30pm ish until around 11-11:30pm, then go to sleep.

I'm kinda concerned because it's starting to mess with my studies (my brain fogs and I get distracted easily). But I keep pushing myself to study, otherwise I feel guilty thinking that I've wasted time. 

I have a pretty ""shit"" mindset (my friend's description) in the sense that I think I should always either be studying, eating, or sleeping (not wasting time on netflix or youtube or anything of the sorts) so I never really 'relax' anymore.

So I guess what I'm mainly asking is:

\_ Am I still adjusting to my new timetable? And that's why it's tiring at the moment? And is it possible to stop getting so tired?

\_ Should I keep pushing myself until I finish exams? Am I pushing myself too hard?

\_ Should I change my mindset/attitude towards studying? (I have the same mindset towards my piano, practice, practice)

\_ How do I deal with the guilt I feel when I've wasted time?

**I could really use a second opinion, even if it has nothing to do with these questions, any advice is appreciated!**

One last thing, I'm still fairly motivated but I'm starting to stress and worry because I feel like I'm running out of time. I don't know why, but I just want to do really well (way better than I need to to get into the course I want).

456,"I'm staying at my husbands parent’s house and my MOL is currently defrosting salmon just by leaving it out on the side. My MOL puts herself down about not being a great cook and often says she's sorry it's not anything special etc., because my mum is a really great cook and my husband has spoken about her food a lot. I'm ok at cooking and do cook here sometimes, I'm not amazing but my husbands family are ”eat to live” people so have never given thought to flavour (lol) whilst mine are huge foodies. I also have emetephobia so I’m terrified of getting food poisoning. So there's a ”thing” about me being a fussy eater. I have politely refused to eat things before here, e.g a full frozen chicken defrosted in the microwave then cooked in the oven. I would say I am particularly cautious because of my phobia but I would also say that they definitely do some dodgy stuff with their food that would generally be deemed unsafe. But then they never seem to get ill so???

Anyway, my question is what do I do here? I think she’d feel patronized if I was to say ”oo you should really defrost that in cold water, or cook it from frozen, or anything other than what you're doing” but I also hate the awkward conversation of I can't eat this because I'm scared I'll get food poisoning. or do I just eat it because surely she's done this before and been fine?

460,"Hello everyone. I will just make this short and sweet...

I live on my own in a 3 bedroom house. I adopted a cat 8 years ago and I love her so so very much. So much that I decided I would adopt another cat recently (1 year ago) and give it the best life I could. 

My mental and financial status was very well off and stable when I made this decision. So I now owned 2 cats. When I went to the shelter to get my second cat her shots, I was approached by a woman asking if I would be interested in adopting a special needs cat. She was fully paid for, and I was even offered free flea treatment for her for several years. 

I thought long and hard about it and decided I would take her. So now I own 3 cats. The special needs cat is so very sweet, but she is mentally impaired. She often gets disoriented and poops outside the litter box, knocks over food bowls, water bowls, chokes on things and is basically close to the equivalent of taking care of a child. She is a handful.

Also, my live in ex also brought his dog and left her here as well and told me to just “go drop her off, he doesn’t want her anyway.” 

I have since then lost my job due to Covid, become severely depressed and am finding it extremely hard to keep the house clean. The litter boxes, all 3 of them, must be cleaned daily , wiped down, and poop scrubbed up off the floor. The dog sheds an unbelievable amount and she is all white, so I just vacuum everyday or hair builds up.

Recently I have not had any motivation to even brush my own teeth, let alone clean up after 3 animals... they’re not abused or going hungry or anything but the house constantly smells like dirty litter, I literally just can’t stay on top of it. I’m embarrassed to invite anyone over , including family. And I just wish I would of just kept my 1 cat.. I feel SO guilty even thinking about getting rid of any of them because I promised them a better life ... I signed the papers...

I am diagnosed with Depression , anxiety disorder and paranoia. I am not mentally sound. Any advice from an outside source other than my own mind is so greatly appreciated. Thank you",09Sep2020,1

463,"I dont expect anyone to listen, but just need to vent where someone can see it i guess so, here goes. I'm a 23 year old happily married man with a 2 month old daughter. My wife and her are my world. When I was 9 through about 13 years old my Aunt molested me countless times. Sitting on my face and giving blow jobs, she took my virginity on my 11th birthday while my younger cousin was asleep in the bed next to mine. This really f****d me up for awhile. Having problems trusting those closest to me and found my escape in drugs and sex. The rough kind, with her legs shaking after, music and sweaty kind. Ever since I can remember sex makes me happier more then anything. PCP Cocaine and Codeine are a very close second. The sex at the same time makes me crazy and not the good kind. I've gone to such long lengths to fulfill my sexual needs, I have never been able to keep a relationship because I couldn't resist sex. I was always a cheater through high school, afterwards dating and even briefly in my marriage. I regret doing that to my wife. The guilt is with me everyday, she throws in my face still, but I get it. I probably would too in her situation. I've been doing better now, a little over a year without any incident and actually resisted a lot of temptations that past me would've crumbled. I've made strides as a person, I'm sober for 298 days. But I feel like there's no real healing going on with that part of me. Its as If my heart is ripped and stitched back together but that section keeps withering open again. My wife knows I was molested, but not to the extent I'm sharing here. I've never told anyone else, and I don't think I can. So thats why I'm posting here. Anyone been through something like this? And if so, how are you doing? What helped you the most?

PS not that it makes it less bad but my aunt is adopted into the family so she's not blood related. But still I was only 9, Fuck you Aunt Loretta",09Sep2020,1

So after we completed it, we were waiting outside the event and talking about how it went and things like that. There was a group of guys outside, they weren’t allowed entry to the party cause neither did they have tickets, nor were they willing to pay for one. Also they do this often and try entering parties for free. They were sniffing glue to get high and were messing around with everyone. Regardless, me and my friend were a little away from them. They come up to us and start talking random trash and honestly i did not like one bit of it. They said they would hit us and what not for no apparent reason. I am a person who doesn’t fight and hates being around such situations. And these guys really pissed me off. Remember that they aren’t part of any gangs, nothing of that sort because where I stay, majority of the people are expats so we don’t really have that advantage. So I don’t really know but it felt like they had a personal grudge against us but it really affects me because he broke a chain i was wearing and i wasn’t able to do anything.

Me and my parents are living in Belgium, but my sister is currently studying at a university in Chicago. We had planned to visit her a few months back way before the whole Covid thing started. Needless to say, this didn't end up happening. 
At this point my parents haven't seen their daughter in over a year and a half. It's really hitting my mom hard. We've tried contacting literally everyone we can think of both in Belgium and outside, but they're always telling us they can't disclose anything because if we arrived at the border and we were turned back, we could sue them, and I guess they're scared of that. We've been looking around if there's a country we can stay for 14 days and then transfer to the US, but again, all the institutions won't tell us anything.

If anyone has any advice or help to offer as to what we can do, it is greatly appreciated. My mom refuses to believe that there is no way to reach her daughter, especially since seperated couples can travel from Belgium to the U.S now. We're kind of desperate.

468,"Hi, I’m looking for some advice about this. I have a friend who I’ve known for 3 years and have been super close with for that amount of time, but recently been drifting apart due to the fact he doesn’t live with me anymore. 

My mental health has suffered this year and we didn’t communicate much unless it was for him to get a cigarette off of me and vice versa (which has frankly always been the case). He’s never been the type to hang out for a long time and this year he’s met a lot of ppl who we’re into drugs etc and he hung around them for most of it. He’s out of that now but still hangs around them. 

I recently had to move back home due to being suicidal and extremely depressed. Since then he’s contacted me twice. Both times was him talking about how something good has happened for him such as an interview or a job. Ive msged him a few times but not much as this had been the extent of our friendship for admittedly a long time. I won’t lie and pretend I’m not jealous, because quite frankly looking at half my friends doing something with their lives when I can barely get out of bed hurts. I want to be happy for them but I feel incredibly lost and feel as if no one really cares that I’m suffering. 

I’ve lost practically most contact with my friends, however I have another that actually checks up on me without having something else to add and I do the same with her. 

I feel a little conflicted as I know my screwed up thinking may be getting the better of me but I wish he would just contact me to catch up or ask how I was going and not about something good that happened to him. It doesn’t really feel like a friendship to me anymore and I’m not sure what to do about that. I’m having a breakdown as I type this. I don’t know how to reply to them.",09Sep2020,1

Currently I work at a decent sized company that generates several million a year in revenue with the *pieces* they sell. The place I work at is a very poorly run business and not much is up-kept correctly. I've asked for promotions and wage increases to be slapped in the face really (not accurate) and at this point I don't see myself being able to move up in the company.   


Come yesterday we were having some domains issues late last night that almost looked like we had lost our domains to myself and another employee, I went to go check if they were available for purchase just in case so I could snag it for the company. I check and I see that the .ca variant of our website is available so say our main website is [google.com](https://google.com) (and we do own other variants of our website) I own [google.ca](https://google.ca) now. I don't believe we owned .ca before, but I can't say we didn't either. It seems we have all our other website variants still.  


What do I do? Do I just give the owner the .ca to be nice as I originally intended, I 100% won't get anything for it probably not even the money I spent getting it originally to help them so someone with mal-intent didn't get it.

so the guy is sitting there, talking to his stream, idk i had the volume off. i saw him put his phone up to his ear once or twice. then, out of nowhere(it was right in frame but i didnt notice it) the guy grabs a shotgun and, before i could shut the video off, bam. 

i couldnt believe what i just witnessed. and now i cant forget it. i was gettign all cozy for bed and i shut my eyes and its all i could see. all i could picture on my mind was those quick couple frames of video. on repeat. now 5 hours later and im still awake searching for solutions to get that shit out of my head.

He gets to keep the comic even though he requested a return but won't ship it back even though eBay gave him his money back ($5 for the book, $5 for shipping - $10 back) yet he still has what I sold him? I checked this guys eBay reviews he has been a seller since I was 2 years old... so he is much much older than I am.

His 2nd excuse was ""Oh it doesn't look the same as the picture."" YES IT DOES. I put it back up and never touched it again until the day he bought it. After I told him there was nothing wrong with it his next excuse was ""Moron! My daughter has autism and she told me you overcharged her, moron."" I said ""Lol, it's not my fault she has that, but no I never overcharged either of you, dude.""  

The total was $10... it was a comic book from a cartoon show that is kinda rare. I don't see how $5 for shipping was even too much when in reality shipping was actually more than what I charged them. 

Then after that he said he won't ship it back but eBay will give him his money back which they did. How is this fair? eBay support said they'd try to help but I'd have to wait til September.

Also when I first shipping it out he would message me constantly saying ""if its not here by tomorrow you better watch out.""

I am also someone who trys to always see the best in people and I have been getting driving lessons from a group that has volenteer drivers.

I am nervous about posting this incase anyone sees it but what the hell, why not.

So I've been with this driving program for almost a year, I have only had 30 hours with my instructor who is in his late 60s. When we started he never talked, I am a talkative person, especially when I'm nervous, so when I'm driving and get nervous, I talk alot. Well after 30 hours of this and 30 lessons with me, my instructor and I started talking alot, purely friendly. He had driven me home afew times in his personal car and I trusted him. 

Well with us being in stage 4 lockdown and I know he lives alone, I check in on him every now and then. I text him asking how he is coping, just the basic friendly stuff. Well now there is a new rule where people living alone can nominate one person to come see them. I wanted to make sure he knew because I wasn't sure if he kept up with the news.  Well then he ended up asking me to be the nominated person (this goes against the contract we signed but I forgot that) I said yeah sure because he had always been kind to me and it's not like I've got much else to do. Then he started getting abit more intense saying things like ""I've been at home alone for awhile, when we meet can I give you a hug and a kiss"" . I may be naieve but this just felt wrong but I don't want to upset him so I said that a hug would be fine, thinking that when he said a kiss, he meant like what older people do with a kiss on the cheek to say hi. He asked what about the kiss and I said a kiss on the cheek seems fine I guess and he said ""damn!"" I asked why and he asked for lips. I said that that would be a hard no. 

When I looked back at other messages they seemed creepier in hindsight but at the same time what if I'm over thinking it. And what if I came off flirty and it's my fault. I put a :) in every now and then to because that's what I do. For me it is like giving someone a smile to make sure they know they are appreciated. I know it sounds dumb. But what if by being nice, I came off as flirting and led him on to think there was something else there. 

Either way I feel really uncomfortable and anxious at the thought of meeting up with him because it would be just us alone in his house, how do I get out of it without hurting his feelings?

480,"Hi,

I work a full time job at the airport. During the interview I made sure to tell my soon to be boss that I am going for school and will put my school over anything. I remember her saying something that we'll work around it with the team in terms of schedule and shifts. I begun working and while attending school, it was tough and grades fell during the first semester that I was employed. I contemplated quitting but I pushed, I got alright grades next. It was hard, not gonna lie. The job is very demanding and sucks all of my energy out (9 hours of talking to people and customers nonstop and when a disruption happens a lot of not very VERYYYY nice customers come and just suck my soul out). Sometimes It left me miserable 

&amp;#x200B;

I pushed for two reasons:

A) I am not young -- 26 when I started the job and do not want a gap in my resume while attending school (for the second time). 

B) I needed the money. 

&amp;#x200B;

My school schedule was alright, but this is the last year. With online learning I was very happy that I will manage since I can still study and attend classes at work  (with my iPad). However, I was informed that exams will be on campus. I have to show up, which was not an issue when I started the job -- since I could manage to take time off. 

&amp;#x200B;

NOW, from our team, only one person can take time off at a time, and it is a first come first serve kinda thing. Most of my coworkers already asked time off. I managed to request 5 days for my midterms, but for final exams (in December, someone else's already asked for time off so I cannot ask for a leave) I was already beginning to accept I will have to take my exams while working at the same time, no time off. However, I checked the work roaster for December and I AM SCHEDULED DURING MY SCHOOL HOURS, AND WILL BE DURING MY EXAMS HOURS. Meaning, It is physically impossible for me to show up at either work.... or school for classes or exams. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure what to do anymore. I texted my team leader about this and she still has not responded. If she refuses I will talk to my manager, but what if she refuses? should I quit? I cannot leave school this is my last year. The job I'm at is a dead end one, my degree will hopefully open up more doors for the career that I want. BUT I'm scared of staying unemployed for like, 5-6 months until graduation. I have spend the last few months saving money that I believe I can survive off, but having money coming in every month is nice.

So she let it happen and when she came back her computer was ""fixed"". By this time she called me panicked and asked me what I thought and that he was supposed to call back at 10pm (it was a bit after 8). 

She was really distraught to hear I said that was absolutely a scam and to NOT give them any money or any more information or answer them. She gave us the number they were going to call from and my boyfriend called the number. It was an online number with a fake waiting tone, it then finally rang once and the person immediately hung up and it then told us it was an online number. I told her that she was to totally shut off her computer and unplug her wifi and we would come help tomorrow.

My boyfriend and I removed all the shady shit they installed on her computer (an illegal version of an antivirus program for about triple what they actually charge and some other weird stuff), ran two different firewall scans, and told her what to do and not do about it. We moved the next night. Ever since then they have been calling and emailing her nearly every single day. She's so worried they're going to lock her computer up or steal her info/money. We had her move the money from her account so if they actually did manage to scan her check and cash it somehow it would just bounce but she's still super worried. They keep emailing or calling with different threats of legal teams and legal departments and giving her time frames to send the money. 

This is obviously and absolutely 100% a scam and I've shown her the evidence and told her to ignore them and if she thinks they're ""in"" her computer at any point to shut off her wifi and computer totally for awhile. However, she's still pretty reasonably freaked out and I can tell their constant harassment is weighing on her and stressing her out immensely. Does anyone have an advice for this type of situation? I'm not sure what else to do other than what I have already, I just want them to stop and leave her alone. She doesn't deserve to deal with this mess.

TL;DR: a computer scam ""company"" won't leave my great grandmother alone and ate harassing her nearly ever day with calls and emails threatening legal action if she doesn't send them hundreds of dollars. What can I do?


I believe [this](https://www.webroot.com/blog/2015/04/27/fake-security-scams-2015-edition/) is the scam if that helps",09Sep2020,1
485,"so theres a “bad” girl who wants to drop out of school, and has found the excuse to say: “people in this class hate me, so thats why im dropping out”

So the teachers got to a decision and said, “we can change your class to the one next to us, please dont drop out”

also, theres a girl from that class who switched to OUR class so there’s obviously an empty seat for the “bad” girl to take in that class

- so i talked to my teacher, and said: “since this girl switched to our class, why cant i go to her class cause theres an empty seat?”

then my teacher said “because the “bad girl” is switching to that class instead, **but in 1 or 2 weeks, a person might drop out**

so i asked WHO? **obviously it has to be the bad girl** and then the teacher said “someone”..

i really hope that bad girl drops out because this is just unfair.. the 2 guys from the other class also want me to change to their class

488,"I don’t usually post often so I apologize if this isn’t the right place to post this.

Here’s some background info:

My (20M) parents have always had relationship problems and haven’t really talked to each other in a handful of years. My mom is planning to get a divorce. My mom (59F) currently works two jobs and pays the rent &amp; bills, supporting the family. My dad (57M) is self employed but doesn’t really get a lot of business. 

Anyways flash forwarding to the present day, my brother (18M) is moving to his college dorm in a couple weeks leaving me with my mom and dad. Our lease for the house will be ending at the end of October, and my mom told me she doesn’t want to support my dad anymore. My dad has little to no income and a bad credit score. 

I don’t go to college so I’m still dependent on my parents for the meantime while I make enough money to move out. I’m so conflicted with what to do and how to handle this all. I could move with my mom who has a stable income but my whole problem is that I don’t want to leave my dad and put him on the streets. My dad doesn’t have a stable income so I’m extremely worried about him being able to find a place to live in time as well as finding a way to support himself. 

I understand that he’s a grown adult who should be able to take care of himself but I mean come on, he’s my dad of course I’m going to worry. It just feels like we’re leaving him out to rot and this situation is really heavy on me, I don’t know what to do. 

The thought of him being alone without seeing me and my brother (we are like the only thing that makes him happy) kills me. Obviously if he did move out somewhere I would visit him but my friends and I might move far away in the future. 

This all just sucks and I don’t know what to do.",09Sep2020,1

Last time we were at a meal, he done his usual complaining routine, spoke absolutely vile towards staff &amp; walked out having not paid, then smugly told me it was the best burger he’d ever had. It genuinely angered me &amp; I promised him I was going to teach him a lesson one day, to which he laughed &amp; clearly didn’t believe me.

At the end of this month, I’m going for a meal once again with him &amp; acouple others. He’s ALREADY bragging how he’s gonna complain &amp; get his food for free, now I’m absolutely teaching him a lesson once &amp; for all. I’ve considered acouple ideas, like sending a letter to restaurant beforehand warning them of him. Or standing upto him &amp; confronting him when he tries complaining.

493,"Long Story Short.
I Joined An Online Game. Was harassed because i was a girl so i switched my avatar to a male. 

Soon I met a girl and we hit it off ( Im Straight ) but for some reason i began catching feelings for her. Note : I only imagine me being a male having feelings for her which i know is strange because :

A) Im straight and wouldn’t want a lesbian relationship
B) I only see my male character being with her.

Eventually she wanted to see how i looked like and I created a fake insta profile off a selfie of a normal looking guy. We only shared selfies (I wont ever want to take advantage of her because my goal here is only to convince her im a male).

I immediately felt guilty and told her that we are only dating online IN A GAME and she agreed that IN GAME we are a couple but IRL we are friends. PS the game has many role playing couples that are aged 13 to 18 so yes me and her are only teenagers. 

Anyways i know most catfishes sends abusive messages, taking advantage of their personal private nudes and even trick them to send money over but i have done none of that.

I wont ever want to hurt her because she’s a nice friend and i did try to break off with her but she insisted we date online but remain friends irl because we are in a ‘role playing relationship’. 

No trolling or mean comments please, I really do feel bad and any advice is greatly appreciated :(",09Sep2020,1
494,"I started seeing a girl, we'll call her Georgia, around Dec 2019. We met on a pier about 4 months prior, and I liked her, but she had a partner, so we swapped IG tags, but never spoke, up until she asked if we wanted to meet up n chill.
We ended up meeting at a local nature reserve, I'd bought us some food, and a speaker so we have a lil picnic-scran thing, idk. We spoke for, gah, like 4 hours n we kissed, and it was perfect until she had to leave.
She messaged me a little later, asking if she could come over, n I mean, who am I to say no, ey??
Things really soared with us, n we spent so much time together. I eventually started falling for her, and I admitted my feelings but they weren't fully reciprocated. She then explained to me that uni was too far from home n she gets too homesick to have a long-distance relationship, but essentially, there was a lot of sexual chemistry, n if I was willing to let it carry on, then so was she ((sort of FWB situation)). Obviously, muggin's 'ere, blinded by love, said YEAH ITS FINE, DONT WORRY, and I practically tortured myself for 3 months until I started speaking to someone else. This really upset Georgia, but we sorted things through, and thought we would have one last weekend, after my birthday, to spend together n enjoy at her uni campus.
I got the train and we had an amazing time - I watched her play in her band, their first live gig together. Needless to say, I was bursting with pride. I cooked for her flat mates, and we went to a cute cafe, n just got to properly know each other.
But when the last day came, I got so upset. I wanted her to love me, n we spoke about it, and she almost said it but she stopped herself... Maybe a committment thing, idk. Anyway, we hugged and cried at the train station, and as my train left, so did she. I stopped speaking to the other girl, broke things off and tried to heal, yanno. Wouldn't have been fair on either party to carry on speaking to each other while I was still so hung up on Georgia. 
I barely heard from her after that. For a year, i've been recollecting myself and i'm still doing it. I never properly got over Georgia, even tho we were never actually together. I still think about her, a lot. I even kept the food list for the curry I at her uni campus, and a letter she wrote n left on my pillow. She never tried to talk to me, n I understand that. She ignored any messages, which wasn't a huge amount, btw, that I sent.
However, there's been a recent development - we matched on Tinder. I honestly don't know what to say, how to act. Does she still want that space?? Was this just to see if I liked her back, still? Idk, but if u guys were in my situation, what would u do?? Cos, yeah I miss her n I do still have like, 1 or 2 feelings for her, but I sure as HELL dont wanna go through the last year over again... ((could make a bad 2020 joke, not going to)).

I also wanted to do different things with my life and our futures didn't match up. He was a very sweet guy and I enjoyed being around him, we just weren't right for each other. I think he continued to have feelings for me for years after our breakup.

Admittedly, I wasn't always the best to him. I was a very troubled kid and didn't know how to express my love in a healthy way. Despite being a bit immature, he was always very courteous, patient, and unendingly kind. He helped me through a lot. But due to this idea in my head that I was a terrible partner to him I have trouble reaching out. I'm sure he would gladly talk with me again, but that would just make me more upset. I want him to realize that he truly deserves happiness. Most of all, I want to reach out to know how he's doing. I want to know if he's happy and healthy. I need to know he's okay.

I had a friend that I had a crush on. Ended up not telling her and she started seeing someone. (This was like a close friendship we had and at one point I think she even liked me as well but after a while I guess she changed her mind as ppl do). After some time the fact that she was dating someone else started to drive me crazy. she started ignoring me as well but she didn't know about my feelings. After a few incidents and stuff I decided that it was best that I tell her the truth and being the idiot that I am I told her everything and how my feelings started to grow over time (not considering the effects that it will have on her relationship because I was selfish). So we had a very mutual conversation about how I needed time to move on and it was best that we stopped talk to each other. She said that for what it was worth she wasn't happy. And so we kinda left it there and we hadn't spoken for 3 months. I wanted to contact her but I was worried that my feelings would get in the way again. And so a few days ago she messaged me and wanted to know how I was. I asked her about her university and stuff and she asked me about my stuff as well. It was like a 5 minute convo. We haven't talked since and I think that she wants me to make the next move.

Now Ik I shouldn't contact her again and move on.
And the friendship we had may never return because things aren't the same.

J has said that she wants to see her grandmother with what would be her FINAL grand grandchild but says she just isn't ready right now she still lives with her parents said honestly doesn't know how to handle her money it'll be gone within a few days to a week.


 and than there's me i have pcos and don't get periods but if I lose weight then I have a higher chance of getting a period and getting pregnant, i love kids and want to be a mother my friends know this and understand what having a baby would mean to me. 

Last night I messaged the girls on GC and said I had a super cute idea the idea was that when me and J got pregnant whenever that happens in the future that we put our scan pictures together so it would be ALL 3 of our kids and when the babies are here there can a picture of all 3 of the kids together since we're best friends our kids would grow up together. 

We all throught it was a cute idea and K30 another girl in our GC said it sounds cute. I'd like to add that K bearly knows me we met at a party ONCE and never really talk tbh i just kind of forgot about her because she bearly talks in the gc and she CAN'T have kids due to years of drug and alcohol abuse she's recently gotten clean, anyway she said ""I can't wait I'm included right?""


 I have autism and can't really say no because I hate drama and hurting people's feelings but I personally don't really want her involved with the idea as I bearly know her and to me it would be weird having a stranger's kid hanging on my wall and with all 3 of us having our sisterly bound and knowing what this means to each other i just feel like it's innoprerate, K is their friend not mine and I honestly get uncomfortable talking to her in general, 

I feel bad for not including her but I feel slightly guilty and annoyed at her and myself and before some of you say ""why did you ask that in a GC with her in it if you knew she was there"" she rarely says anything and we 3 talk all the time i completely forgot she was in the GC",09Sep2020,1

She seemed tense and dazed and didnt really seem to follow what I was saying when I was talking to her. When I asked if she was ok, she just said she had a headache and was tired and went to lay down. She pretty much stayed in bed and slept all day with the exception of going to her one online class this afternoon and throwing up twice
I noticed the spot where she hit her head has been bleeding on and off throughout the day.

At first, I just thought she was sick because she has a fever and hasn’t been sleeping or eating well as she has been super stressed for about a month, but I was looking it up and asking around online and was worried it had something to do with hitting her head. Pretty much everything said to take her into the ER asap.

I took her in earlier tonight, they did a CT, and said it was a concussion and needed 10 stitches where she hit her head.

I feel absolutely awful about the whole thing. I swear I didnt do it intentionally. I swear I'm not trying to cover for being abusive. It was an accident. I apologized a billion times since and told her it was an accident, but Im scared she doesnt believe me. I just don't know how to make it up to her.

TL;DR I accidentally elbowed my girlfriend in the head causing her to fall last night and she has a concussion. It was an accident but I'm afraid she doesnt believe me and dont know how to make it up to her.",09Sep2020,1

All guys in high school likes a girl. Even a geek like me who study’s his ass off to get good grades. 

My friend who we will call John has proven time and time again u can’t trust him with personal things. Last year my friend told him who he liked and John basically manipulated him into thinking he has got a chance just to see him get embarrassed by his peers and laugh about it. I don’t know why but when we were studying I told him who I liked. This made me feel like I was stuck in a corner knowing he could do anything to ruin it.


A bit of backstory on me but when I look for relationships I don’t typically think “oh yea I just want a girlfriend.“ but want one who I truly care about and can hopefully be there in the long term. So when I found someone like that I feel like he is going to ruin it all


But I also know who he likes. So we both basically have each other in the corner so if he doesn’t say anything then I won’t.

523,"So this is a very long complicated situation and its driving me crazy so I'll try to keep it short but will try to answer questions as well.

About three years ago my friend (well call them jane) came to me asking me if I could take in her dog (rusty) because she had just gotten out of a really fucked up abusive relationship and had to move in with her parents while she found a new house, and she had finally found the perfect house for her and her kids. But it was a rental thing and they didnt allow pets. (Which o dont get you allow kids but not a dog who generally would make less of a mess than kids but whatever). I agreed thinking she would come back to get him within a year cause she said she was gonna try to find a permanent house so she could take him back.
She didnt come back for him for 3 years. Barely visited him and was barely in his life.

After many fights and arguments, since we both wanted to keep him we agreed to kinda share him. 2 weeks with me 2 weeks with her. She also suggested we get her husband's dog pregnant so that I could keep a puppy and she could keep rusty. It was the best i could get. 

So we tried in like june to get the dog prego and the whole time jane swore up and down the dog was pregnant. It got closer to the time of her to ""give birth"" but this dog didnt look pregnant at all. 

-side note there was a time that I had rusty and she called me saying her dog wasnt eating and that it was seperation anxiety cus I had rusty. She said if she lost the puppies because I wouldnt bring him back(I had literally just picked him up from her) that it would he my fault. That's her husband's dog. It is their responsibility to take care of her not me. It was wrong of her to put that shit on me and I demanded she take her dog to the vet but she had a ""vet tech friend"" who also insisted the dog was pregnant and that it was seperation anxiety. I know she was bullshitting and just wanted rusty back. She also kept saying rusty isnt my dog. Even though he WAS mine for 3 years. So basically shes being a total bitch to me. Turns out the dog was just constipated and that's why she wasnt eating.-

Fast forward a bit to like 2 weeks ago. She finally admits the dog isnt pregnant so I'm pissed. She suggested we try again and for fear of her ""not allowing"" me to see my dog again I agreed. I keep trying to find legal ways to keep him and cut her out like the festering tumor she is, but my hands are kinda tied.

I just dropped him off again yesterday. It gets harder and harder to drop him off and be without him for a couple weeks. I sob on the way home everytime. It's just really hard to be without him.

Idk what to do. Honestly I just wanna take him and not respond to her. But cus she has the basically receipt of buying him he's technically her dog and shes threaten me with court bullshit before. I'm also afraid her gun toting trump supporting all lives matter shit husband with come after me. (If you're for trump please just dont this post isnt about politics just know I have extreme distaste for him and people who support him) 

I'm crying every day I'm without my boy. Please someone help. If anyone is a lawyer please message me so I can maybe find a way to keep my dog away from her. Shes returned him to me injured twice! One was a huge gouge under his eye that needed stitches. Shes got five kids one of which is a year old baby, with a cat and another dog. She claims if I keep rusty then she gets nothing. Which is bullshit cause I have nothing but my partner and we take excellent care of rusty.

526,"Hi, I don't know what might be wrong with me, so I don't know what to look up to find more information about it or help with it. Could someone point me in the right direction?

&amp;#x200B;

I guess it might be similar to OCD, but it's not exactly the same. I like things very organized and I hate germs. I have many germ phobias but what's even worse is that they keep getting worse. Any time someone mentions a phobia they have about hygiene or sanitation, it becomes mine too. A year ago I never thought about dust mites, for example, but now I cover my pillow and top of my bedsheets where I sleep because if not, I can't sleep at night. I think about dust accumulating while I'm at work or something, and I feel ""itchy"" even though I know dust mites can't really bite anyway

&amp;#x200B;

What makes me think it might be similar to OCD is that I've noticed I kind of have ""rituals"" people talk about. I never realized until someone pointed it out to me. When I shower, I have a specific system or order that I use. It's not even that I do it out of some compulsive ""need,"" but just that it makes sense to me and I can't do it any other way. 

&amp;#x200B;

This part impact my life a lot, because I can't go about my day unless these rituals or systems are complete. As a result, I'm really bad with time and I have a hard time being on time for work and school. I usually make it on time, but it's not easy and I tend to speed and rush to get there. 

&amp;#x200B;

I tend to obsess over things, and if I have an imperfection in my hair, skin, or nails, I have to fix it or I can't think about anything else. 

&amp;#x200B;

It affects my life and relationships, because I get angry when people do things ""against my system."" I don't want to get mad at them, but I can't help it sometimes. I have a certain way I like things done and organized, and I guess I just expect everyone else to understand them and respect them.

527,"I just bought a house in March. My girlfriend and I  decided that we wanted a privacy fence. I had posted on Facebook looking for recommendations from friends/family. I was contacted by my second cousin, who owns his own fencing company. I have maybe spoken to this man maybe twice in my life but he's family so I figured I'd give him some business. He said that he would come over and give me an estimate. I have done some research on the subject and felt I knew what an average cost would be for my yard size. ($4-5k). He came over and took some measurements and quoted me $7k. I told him that felt a bit high and told him I was expecting $4-5k. He also mentioned that he subcontracts for Lowe's and Homedepot and other fencing companies so I was hesitant to contact another company only to have them send him out.

He agreed to do the job for $4.5k. I paid him the money upfront so he could purchase the material. (He's family so I figured why not). He purchased all of the material and dropped it off at my house. He said he could get the job completed in 3-4 days tops. I signed a contract with him, showing how much I am paying and for the installation of a 6ft privacy fence. Everything seems good so far. (timeframe not listed in the contract)

Fast forward 2 weeks, he hasn't started yet. I contact him and he agreed to start that weekend. He only showed up for about 3 hours and hardly got any work done. Fast forward another 2 weeks. (I've been asking him to come out in the meantime but his ""breaks went""  in his truck). They actually get a decent amount of work done this time.

Just an FYI, I have a small 1 car garage. After they worked the last time, they filled my garage with 80lbs concrete bags, digging tools, wheelbarrows, etc so I couldn't even use my garage to park in. Fast forward another 3 weeks of me pestering him to come back and work on the fence. He decides that he can come on my daughter's birthday. We're having people over and having a party for her. We ask that he leaves before the party starts so we don't have to deal with the noise and stuff. He's about 2 1/2 panels and a gate from finishing.

I have been asking him to come out since then and it's been nothing but empty promises since. During this whole process he'd tell me he would be coming out to work on the fence, then just doesn't show up. I have him on Facebook and he posts pictures of other fences he's completed titled ""another happy customer today"" so he's obviously still working

I've been nothing but patient with him since the start of this. It's been over 4 months since I paid him and signed a contract and the fence still isn't finished. I also forgot to mention that he took it upon himself to use my wheelbarrow and other tools without even asking. I also noticed that the handles on my wheelbarrow were missing about an inch. You can see obvious cut marks. I questioned him about this but he denies any damage to my wheelbarrow.

I mentioned the issue to my friends and they suggested filing a BBB complaint, some suggest leaving a bad review on social media/google. I don't want to start any family drama but I just want this fence completed. I obviously know to never mix family and business again....

529,"Hello Reddit,

Today I come to you because my life is disastrous and I truly need serious advice and help. I'm 25.

My life summarized, I went to school, high school, every thing went ok, I joined a good college to pursue an engineering degree in my country, there I was a top student successful for 2 years. At 20 I started having very serious health issues, I tried to continue and at first my university was supportive but since I was sick for 3 years they let me down. I went to another university to try to continue, but fell sick again and again. My disease is mostly unknown according to doctors, I have lung, digestive, eye and skin issues but they can't pinpoint a diagnosis so I can't be recognized as chronically ill or disabled. So here's my situation, I'm sick at 25, with no college degree, unable to work and not recognized as disabled or sick.

I wanted to try again to study at other universities but at 25 in my country I'm refused everywhere. I wanted to apply to work but in my condition and my country being very judgemental on age I'm refused everywhere then again. So I can neither work nor study. I've lost my parents so I'm going to go financially bankrupt anytime soon. I have 10 000 bucks left on my bank account and when they run out, I'm basically over, going homeless and with serious health issues. I'm really thinking about ending myself and I really need help.

What can I do? I speak 3 languages, English, French and Spanish and beyond that I have nothing except a 3 years long unfinished college degree.

I was thinking about learning a language and moving in a country with free healthcare if that exists for strangers, to try go get healthy and then find a place to work if I'm not judged due to my age to make some money while trying to pursue my dream of becoming an engineer, but I know no such country that would make this possible.

Please reddit help me, I have no way out but one and it's bad one. I have just had so much unberable pain and sorrow in my life.",09Sep2020,1

532,"I feel as if most of my life has been a long food coma. I eat so much, just enough for my brain to barely work. I do what is strictly required of me and I spend all my free time brainlessly procrastinating. Even more so, some beast awakens and I go on an even greater food spree for something like two weeks to a month.

Being so full all the time makes my brain barely function. I stop talking to family and friends, I fall behind at work, I stop doing the things I love...

Funnily enough, after I've consumed tremendous amounts of food and my life slowly turns to ruin, a switch flips inside of me: and I begin eating very little and in what I can only describe as godlike productivity, I sort all my life out. I do all my chores, I catch up on all my work, I pick up all the conversations that I've been avoiding with friends and family, etc.

In those moments of hyper self awareness I feel fantastic. Everything comes so easy to me. I begin to resume my old hobbies, I read, compose, work on coding projects, give 200% at work, meet up with people. I feel like the guy in Limitless.

BUT

All it takes is one bad decision of having just a little more food than necessary, and I'm back into my default foggy brain state, where I do strictly what is required of me and slowly fall behind.

 And this led me to the conclusion that subconsciously, for some reason, **I look for opportunities in my life to inhibit my cognitive abilities with food, because my life becomes too stressful when I don't**.

Now this has had some odd consequences in my life:

Health wise, I'm overweight and my self-image isn't great, but I can still run/play sports and I don't tire easily.

Professionally, I'm a relatively successful software engineer and I make a good living, although I use the moments when I'm hyper-productive to establish myself as very capable and gain the trust of my colleagues, but I don't work that hard otherwise, and I have a habit of falling behind.

But most tragically, family and friends think I'm unreliable, because in their eyes I clearly have a high capacity of accomplishing things, but don't do so consistently enough as I should. My family is always slightly disappointing, and my girlfriend doesn't know how to help me, and it's hard for us to act on long-term plans we've made together.

I also realise that I may have caused some mental issues to myself by doing, but it's hard for me to distinguish them from what I consider my personality at this point.

In conclusion, my life isn't objectively bad. But I realise that living life in the extremes like isn't good. I've began dieting many times, but it all goes to ruin as soon as find the first reason to drown my life in food. I started going to the gym and progressed nicely, until a hiccup in my life prevented me from following my daily routine and I'm back to where I've started.

536,"I'm 22, and live in the UK. I've struggled with academia since A Levels, due to mental health problems related to depression, anxiety and self esteem. After fucking up my A Levels, I decided to try again with a BTEC Diploma in electronic engineering. I fucked it up, again, due to mental health. Every teacher/tutor I've had has remarked on my ""great potential"", but I flaunted the opportunities I had due to lack of internal motivation. I've spent 2 years not doing much of anything; partly stagnating, partly working on my mental health. Someone close to me found an Access to Higher Education (science) course, which I took great interest in, but have now been rejected from because it wouldn't lead to the degree I want to do (BEng in Biomedical Electronic Engineering).

No access course that I can find nearby is suitable for the degree I want to do.

The only facility in my area that does A Levels has closed those classes for 2020/21 due to covid.

There are no companies in my area that work in the field I'm interested in and also offer apprenticeships.

I'm terrified that my enthusiasm to push forward is going to fizzle out in a month, in light of no apparent options. I'm sick of stagnating. I want to do something with my life, but I can't see any way to progress. On top of all this, I'm terrified that if I'm able to somehow pursue my goals, I'll find that the degree I want to do is simply the least boring option I see to take through life, as I've never been particularly driven by something I see as a viable career... but I guess I can save that worry for when I actually achieve something tangible.

Do I look around for more academic options available this year, presumably late entry? How would I even go about that when googling every reasonable query seems to yield a dead end?

Do I just try to make money off the internet, through gaming or sex work?

542,"MY CONFLICTING CHANGE OF THOUGHTS

I've started feeling as if wanting people to hang out with me in their free time is selfish. I had a series of dreams that left me feeling rather guilty when I woke, it kinda changed the way I think about this particular topic. How much should I trust these dreams or is it some weird asocial propaganda my brain is throwing at me?

Okay, well there's this girl I like hanging out with, right...and we kinda fell out of contact, but we'd see each other in passing at a common friend's house, anyway, the last time we were 'in passing' she's like, yo, we gotta catch up, been forever, let's chat sometime...so she came over, we caught up, talked about stuff, NOTHING HAPPENED because my entire family was home, including my younger siblings, so we just hung out, caught up... thing is, she's very busy...she works a lot, has crazy family, etc, and I told her that I don't ever want her to put me before her responsibilities with work, school, family, mental health, etc... I have to be responsible for inviting her over so she won't feel like she's inviting herself over, she said that eased her conscience and she'd hit me up when she got some free time.

Then a couple nights ago I had...the dreams and woke up feeling guilty, and I feel like if I'm to be logically consistent I can simply never invite her over. Either she's dealing with her life which should take precedence over chatting with me, or she has free time, and she'll feel obligated to sink it into 'appeasing' me in some way. I feel like mentioning it more than twice is pushy.

 So now my brain is telling me that wanting people to hang out with me in their free time is selfish. Is there something to this, or is my brain just affirming my less than sociable qualities?

547,"I’m a sophomore in college right now and I felt like things were going good before covid hit. My freshman year went great. I started my biology major and I loved everything about it. I was interested engaged and overall excelling in my material. My social life was great too. I was making new friends, enjoying the college party lifestyle, and I still had time to work a part time job. Then, the lockdowns started and ruined it for me.

I’m doing hybrid learning where I have 2 classes on campus and 3 online. The classes on campus are an absolute chore. I hate the commute (about 35 minutes) and sitting in a mostly empty classroom wearing a mask with a teacher who’s afraid for his life (rightfully so) is overall a bad learning experience.

Online is even worse. I’ve always been a pen and paper guy, now everything I do is on the computer. The software is confusing and convoluted. I can’t engage with my teachers whatsoever. I’ve lost a lot of my connections with the friends I made at university given they are either living on campus full time or miles away in different time zones.

I’ve lost all passion I originally had for my major and my grades are slipping. Everything seems to just go in one ear and out the other. I can’t focus at home with my family around all the time. I’m just struggling 

I don’t know what to do anymore. Everyday I’m scared to fall asleep because when I wake up I have another day of torturous and boring work ahead of me.

What should I do? Should I change course completely? Or should I just grit my teeth and try to power through?",09Sep2020,1

549,"It's not an end of the world problem... just one that makes me feel kinda shitty to be on the receiving end of.  

In 2015 Twitch streamer Thorlar set a record in Minecraft for largest Pixel art.  In 2018, Mysticlloyd broke that one, and in 2019 I broke his.  The logical place to announce this sort of thing is in the Minecraft and gaming communities of reddit, I've tried a few times, and tried to do so in a way that was not a self promotion for my YT channel or anything like that.  (I want to go out of my way and say that I wasn't being a dick about it and would always try to communicate with the mods so that my post would fit the posting guidelines of the sub)  

Looking for advice on how to get around the suppression of information when the story is legitimate and as a community the small groups of people who have seen it have reacted in an overwhelmingly positive way already.  It sucks to have a rightful claim to it, and to have that information ignored by the people who are supposed to care about that sort of thing.  Or maybe I'm just an asshole for wanting my achievement to stand beside the people who paved the way before me.  I just can't solve this one... I need help and not being able to help myself with this has me feeling down.

The more I dig into this, the more it looks like the previous champ has some sway with the actual gatekeepers of the community to keep this and any other world record pixel art news quiet, because any time a post ( that is constructed off of posting feedback to make sure falls within their standards) catches and gets more than a couple hundred upvotes, it's taken down with no citation of why (their right of course, not disputing that.. have to make these things read like a contract sometimes hahah), but still very strange.

When I reached out to the current 2nd place record holder he told me he had a bad experience with Thorlar (the current 3rd place guy) and said that back in 2018, Thorlar made efforts to limit the exposure of his record being broken then, I had a similar experience when I messaged him as a courtesy in 2019 to let him know he had been bumped from 2nd to 3rd place.  It was not what I expected based off of his online persona, but I still don't fault him for that.

The deeper I go, it just seems like a coordinated effort to keep the information quiet out of fear that it will somehow diminish from Thorlar's brand as the world record pixel art champion.  I think the entire point of a record is to grow a sport or event.  Living in 2015 at 1.1 million isn't good for the game, but having that amazing record get shattered and then shattered again by a dude with two subscribers on twitch is good for the game.",09Sep2020,1

552,"Using a throw away because I don’t want this connected to my main account. 

I’ve been working for a major fast food chain that makes coffee and donuts for the past 2 1/2 years in the US. I started out at the job with wide eyes and a bushy tail, worked my ass off for that company without expectation to rise because I knew I wasn’t going to work there forever. I enjoy the work, I have regulars who will go out of their way to have me make their orders, they appreciate it when I recognize them and have it ready to go so they can bounce in and out and the physical labor isn’t too bad. 

Then I got hurt on the job and that put me out for a year (I dislocated my knee and that’s another story for later if you want the dirty details) which was completely covered by Worker’s Compensation. However when I returned, my store made a complete 180 - for the worse. 

Now, there are two stores in my area within a 10 minute drive of each other and the managers of both places are in a relationship. I don’t hate on that because I understand these things happen (love is love) - however, they feel entitled to combine the issues of both stores as well as their personal lives, causing internal drama and a toxic work environment. I told my boss one of my coworkers was harassing my younger female coworkers and all of them threw me under the bus by denying it - despite them telling me how uncomfortable they felt around the harassing coworker and what that person did to make them feel harassed. That situation was the turning point for me because it showed me how much my manager changed, she used to be zero-tolerance on harassment and yet this person is still on the payroll despite physical text messages that have been brought to my attention as recent as LAST WEEK (“you give me a huge dopamine rush every time I’m near you” is not cute nor sexy - especially when it’s coming from someone 14 years older than the recipient). Dare I even mention the rumor mill spreading around that the harassing co-worker is sleeping with the manager of the other store too? 

Both locations have been understaffed since I’ve returned for the past two months and the staffing size has only decreased because a lot of my co-workers have returned to school. I told my manager that I needed at least three days off a week because my knee is permanently injured to which I had to fight for. I had a doctors note but at the time it only stated that I needed about a 5 minute break every 3 hours (that was a fun one, my manager made me count the minutes until I hit up the district manager pissed off because smokers - including my boss, would step out for 20 minute smoke breaks). My manager knows what happened to my leg because there were 4 cameras pointed in my direction when it happened as well as the countless paperwork I had to give them and updates with how it was being treated. They gave me three days off a week for two weeks until someone else literally rage quit and since then I’ve been pushing around 44 hours a week - I originally only wanted 24. I’ve been working 8-14 hour shifts and now both my knees are aching so bad that I’m having trouble getting up from chairs or out of bed. 

This entire situation since returning to work has been stressing me out, it’s been causing relationship issues between my partner and I, and I have been having more frequent mental breakdowns. My mental health has deteriorated to the point where I’m legitimately freaking the fuck out every time I even THINK about my place of work. I called out yesterday thinking a day of rest would help, but today I feel just as manic as I did yesterday (although I didn’t call in today, I know that’s not good but that’s how bad I’m freaking out right now). I tried talking to my manager about my mental health and how it’s something that I’ve been trying to control and their response was basically “suck it up buttercup, we all have issues here”. 

Now for the reason for the backstory: My question is what can I do to make my work situation easier on me until I can get hired at a new (and hopefully better) place? I have an appointment with a therapist on Monday but that’s still several more work days away. I want to quit so bad with every bone of my body but I’m terrified of doing so because I don’t want to be short on my bills. I’m in the East Coast of the US and my family is literally 5,000 miles west so there’s only so much they can do. My partner’s family lives in my area but most of them are broker than we are so any financial or living situation help is non-existent. I feel like if I spend another day there I’m going to freak out and do something I will regret. The last time I felt like this at a job was about 5 years ago and that resulted in me being fired because I went off on the managers for mistreatment of the employees (that place closed a year later). 

I’m sorry for the long read, and I really would appreciate any advice with this.

I cant explain how devastated I am and I cannot seem to shake that sense of grief. She is gone from me forever and i can never meet her again. It’s ironic on how I always take my time with her for granted and even tried to push her away sometimes.

She means so much to me and I wasn't always the best daughter. Now everything in my life is chaos and I don’t know who to turn too I just wish that she was here with me still so I could ask her for advice. She was an optimistic person, like a sunflower always facing the sun, until the night vale come and took her away

559,"Hey reddit, I know that compared to other posts, this post doesn't seem like an issue at all or even kind of stupid, but I'd still gladly appreciate it if you guys could take the time to give me some advice. This was initially posted to r/succulents but I felt like this was a more appropriate sub.

So basically, I've recently bought my first batch of little succulents (the green basic ones). I was really looking forward to planting them, but after I received them today, I'm actually getting really stressed out about keeping them alive and it's making me really anxious. :C

I've done the research before getting them (getting the right soil mix, watering requirements etc. ), but somehow the realization that they're here to stay for a long time and one mistake and they're gone forever is somehow giving me an existential crisis. I know that these plants aren't 'high maintenance' and not that easy to kill, and I really really want to love these little guys, but I'm afraid that my clumsy ass self will hurt them. Kind of why I stopped getting pets after my last one died when I was like 12, hence why I opted for plants, though I can't believe that I'm actually anxious of not being able to take care and provide for tiny plants.

A few of my fears are as follows: 

1. Somehow getting hospitalized/ away from home for more than 2 weeks and having these plants die because I don't have neighbours/relatives who will take care of them, 
2. My grow light's batteries breaking and not being able to find a replacement in time
3. Power outage hence not being able to use said lights
4. Forgetting to turn on said lights
5. Tipping over the pot causing everything to spill and severely damaging the plants
6. Random fungi/bacteria growth
7. ... and more

I know, it seems stupid and irrational, but somehow I'm still very afraid.

I guess I'm just looking for advice to help me rationalize my fear so I can stop worrying and actually enjoy the company of these guys, help me to accept these fears, or even just view things from another perspective.

Thank you guys in advance, I'd appreciate any help I can get.",09Sep2020,1

That’s fine and possibly helpful to my sibling but my parent has started to give me a few worksheets in this particular subject and has needlessly started helping me with my summer reading book(I’m totally competent enough to read it on my own).

566,"I don't really know how to start this because there's too much going on but basically: I lost my dream job/life situation a couple months ago which in turn made it so I had to move somewhere completely different (Cornfield town), had to end a relationship of 1 yr and start again in the middle of nowhere with no real friend/family group. 

I am a very, very outgoing and extroverted dude so the loneliness is completely killing me. I've taken a bunch of steps to make my situation better like: 

\-Throwing myself at a new hobby (Which in turn gave me people to talk to)

\-Going to a big city on the weekend and hanging out (Meeting new people and doing cool stuff)

\-Tried to come up with a list of goals for myself (Focus on learning things like language but also being more fit)

\-Play with friends online + talk to people on the phone (Playing videogames/building a personal website) 

&amp;#x200B;

But at the end of the day during weekdays, after my 8-4, I am completely alone in my house because I'm in a town where nothing goes on (and not much to do at all), and I get lost in my thoughts and realize how lonely and sad I am. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know deep inside that I am not happy, even though I do cool stuff on the weekends and have some sort of constant distraction over the week I still can't shake the unhappiness and dreadful feeling of being alone. I hate being forced to be alone. To not be able to do the shit that would make me happy (Like living in a big city and doing all the stuff I would like to do: Biking, rock climbing, chilling at a cool park, going to museums, taking walks, etc etc) 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, it's not as easy for me to up and move, because it is hard finding a job in this economy/pandemic situation; and to be completely honest I have a really good thing going on financially. I make good money for someone my age, I don't pay rent, I have a job that I don't love but I am good at, etc etc.

Additionally, I am not from the US, so having the opportunity to be here and have such a stable job and career in the middle of all this madness should feel like a blessing but it feels like a curse because I truly don't feel satisfied and happy. 

Some days I just wake up and feel like I can't be here a day longer and that I need to chase my true happiness. ""Fuck money, fuck stability if I can't be truly content and wake up everyday like my life actually means something""

Thanks in advance.

I was job hunting prior to having to schedule surgery and I am not sure if I should continue or if I should post-pone the hunt until I am able to work.

572,"TW: Suicide and Suicidal Thoughts.

Preface: 
My uncle died by suicide when I was young. Suicide prevention is something that is near and dear to my heart. 

The Story:
I have a friend, let's call Alex, has had someone take care of them pretty much their whole life. Their partner right of high school pretty much paid the bills and they lived in their parents rental for low to almost free rent for a good portion of their early twenties. 
Alex has thyroid disease and has lived with it from being a teen to now and has learned to manage it. Alex is also an attractive person and doesn't have a hard time getting what they want... 
Well, because of this, Alex has an affair and their partner breaks up with them... Causing Alex to live on their own for the first time in their life... Which one can assume is where they began to develop anxiety and depression (because before this, Alex never had any issues with mental health). This was around 2014 / 2015 I wanna say....
 
2016 rolls around, Alex has been laid off of multiple jobs, they are moving house to house and learning to manage new brain meds. 
 Alex struggles with the pressures of being on their own... And suicide attempt 1, parametics are called. Alex is placed on 48 hold. So all of us come together and start rotating checking in on Alex for a few weeks after they are released... Things seem good, we talk with her and another friend asks about sitting in on a session with their therapist to see how we can better assist/understand Alex so we can help them better and avoid this again ... 

Between 2016 and 2019, Alex makes several suicide threats...Even police house checks have been called because of Alex's social media posts got dark and scary.  People come to Alex's aid. Offer support and counseling... Alex refuses the support... But still sends tons of mix messages to people. To the point where a lot of people just start checking out on Alex ... 

Well, I check out after suicide threat number 5 (not attempt)  Apparently they wanted to check into a institution, but their roommate threatened to kick them out so they didn't. A lot of people mentioned this is illegal... And a lot of other things... Alex doesn't listen. 

2020
I get a message from someone I met last year who knows Alex and wants me to do a wellness check on them... I tell them the name of the person I know who currently lives around the corner from Alex, and that I cannot handle Alex's suicidal threats anymore because they are given lifeline after lifeline and swats them away... I wish my uncle had those kinds of life lines, because maybe he would still be alive today... 

TL;DR: friend constantly threatens suicide, I can't handle it anymore because of family history of suicide. 

I feel like it's getting to a point of attention seeking, am I wrong? Also, does that make me an asshole (should I cross post to the am I an asshole subreddit?) for thinking that or am I an asshole for checking out on a friendship with a person because of their constant suicide threats? How do I politely tell my other friends to stop asking me about Alex?",09Sep2020,1
573,"So Friday I got my wisdom teeth removed, and it went about as well as you can expect pulling teeth to go.

Yesterday was my first day back to work, and I went to take some ibuprofen and my antibiotics when I almost choked on something. I've choked on pills a LOT, enough so to note that whatever I choked on felt way smoother than the ibuprofen I'd just taken. 

It was later on I noticed my tooth felt weird. I'd had a chip in one of my molars for a while, with plans of getting it fixed later on after my wisdom tooth recovery. It was smoothed down, and felt soft like the enamel was gone. When I peeked in the mirror, I found that's exactly what happened. 

Since that near choking incident, that specific tooth has been hurting every time I eat, and I've come to the conclusion that I had some sort of protective coating put on where they smoothed it down and I swallowed it. 

The issue is: I didn't ask or pay for the chip to be fixed, I wasn't even informed it was done. Had the protective coating stayed on I'd be really happy about it being fixed for free, but now it hurts and I'm not sure how to proceed with getting it fixed. I haven't seen any record that they've done it, and so I'm at a loss as of how to even ask for help.",09Sep2020,1

576,"I am 22 years old and come from a central/western European country with mandatory military service.

Right after school, from 19 to 20 I had to do my alternative service (\~50% of young men here do military service, 50% alternative service) in an institution for mentally disabled adults. 

While my female classmates were 'traveling the world' or started studying at university I was cleaning the toilets - you can imagine that the disabled were often unable to use the bathroom properly (most of the time through no fault of their own). In hindsight I was not prepared for this. When I cleaned their behinds I felt anger towards them. I am not proud of what I thought in these moments. However I do believe to slightly understand how concentration camp guards could behave so inhumanely. One of the disabled bit my finger - after threatening to do so multiple times - while I had to put his prosthetic teeth in. This left me with a minor but persistent tremor in that finger. The pay was less than a fifth of minimum wage, just about covering my travel expenses. There was no place to talk to anyone, nobody I could complain to, nobody who was doing his alternative service with me whom I could have shared my thoughts with. 

I was the best student in my high school, very skilled in certain areas, I could have been put to better use. I now avoid classmates who had gotten better positions though a parent with good connections.

When I read the news/social media there's an article about discrimination against women every other day - sometimes well founded, other times vague and without data. In the last two years I've only come across one article critically talking about military/alternative service. It is so evidently clear that this is forced labor based solely on my sex, written in the constitution, yet nobody cares.

I read articles concerning refugees - stating that it would be a grave violation of human rights if they had to work at minimum wage while waiting for a visa (which it probably is). But then again - where were my human rights, it's no different? *(I know that military service is specifically excluded from being a violation of human rights, but it shouldn't be)*

I've become so bitter, every time I read the news.  
I do believe I was discriminated against, yet if you are male and part of the majority population nobody cares. I've become angry at people who didn't have to serve. I feel unheard while everyone else gets a voice, has community support. I become angry when I read an article about how privileged I am.

I've become embittered and that's making my life worse. What am I supposed to do?",09Sep2020,1
577,"I think I am going to fail my masters thesis. I am an international student in the NL and I am regretting why did not say STOP to myself when I had the chance. I came here in 2017 as a mechanical engineering masters student but i changed to  management of technology course next year. So in 2018 i started a brand new degree, did well, passed all the courses and was happy about it. Side by side gained whatever little bit experience I could gather (coach for introduction program, student consultant for 6 months where me and all the consultants had training sessions with Deloitte and pwc). Started my thesis a long time back and while there were some elements of procrastination involved, i did my work. The previous submission was green light was failed because they said I need more theoretical discussion and conclusion is not nice. Gave me from 25th august to 9th sept to revising it. Today they said I made it worse and want me to work with the previous version, thus removing any bit of hope I had left. They have given me two more weeks + pushed the greenlight to mid october. I wouldn't say i did something out of ordinary (sleepless nights, sacrificing eating etc) and I finally thought I had it but their feedback is so awful I feel like go drown in a canal nearby because I dont know swimming. 

It has been more than three years, oh how the time flies, and I feel like I have ruined my life (I am 27). All that money involved I think more than 50,000€, sponsored by dad+loan and what do I return to my parents. Nothing. Nada. 

Returning to home country with such a shame is something that I cannot contemplate but I know killing myself will absolutely devastate my parents. But going back home, without a diploma, after three years of GAP (my bachelors completed in 2016) +worked one year in retail. I really think I should give up but what exactly is the real consequence? How the fuck would I get a job back home? How would I ever recover from this self-inflicted trauma. My mental health has been poor since a very very long time but since there were moments of happiness in between I just thought it has a bit of sadness due to stress level. All of my colleagues who came to the Netherlands in 2017 have graduated. Hell the new class of 2018 are also 50% graduated. There is no doubt I am a failure and I really have no clue. Since morning I have just laying on bed, staring at the ceiling, to exactly what the fuck am i supposed to do. 

I am itching to purchase helium tank but have to look where I can get it in the Netherlands without raising suspicion. also purchase a plastic tube. The problem is I live with two other friends and if some mishap happens such as gas leak I dont want to harm themselves.

I don't know if this the correct place to public this and I'm sure of it isn't as big as other problems but here we go.



So, on March of this year my girlfriend cut me off, it wasn't a log relationship but I don't know why I still like her and I can't got over our break up. Actually, I still trying to be friends again at least but I know that I have no chance (I'm afraid of looking like a stalker too). As well, she had has some behaviors that quite disappointed me but even though I ignore everything and fell for her every time I saw her. 
On the other hand, there is a girl who I was talking with in the last days, and I don't want to sound egocentric but I'm almost sure that she fell something for me but I can't see her like a romantic interest (I feel bad because I think that I'm playing with her in some way). So, this made me think that maybe if I give her a chance in some point she could makes me feel something for her (And forget my ex girlfriend)


In conclusion, should I keep trying with my ex girlfriend despite the fact that she give not chance or give an opportunity to a girl who I feel nothing for?

582,"My boyfriend is a drug addict. Plain and simple. I won’t lie, I’ll drop an occasional (literally twice or maybe three times a year) tab of acid or the VERY occasional (once a year) psilocybin soup. I’ll have an occasional (once every 2-3 months) joint and have only ever done pills twice in a 3 month period and never again. He however has been smoking pot since he was 14 and been doing hard drugs since he was 15/16. It’s been years since then. In February he overdosed and almost died but has been begging me to allow him to have that drug since. I’ve told him time and time again, I can’t tell you what to do but I can’t tell you how it’ll make me feel, not even as your girlfriend but your best friend and how it’ll affect me. He’s always then chosen to not do it. (I’m worried that makes me controlling but it’s a really strong and EXTREMELY addictive drug, especially for people with anxiety like himself and illegal for a reason). Over lockdown he smoked everyday, at least 3 times a day. Often up to 6 times. It was constant and I allowed it because he had nothing better to do. However, now we’re heading back into education, he asked me to make sure he sticks to his weekend only rule, and to help him smoke less weed. And that wasn’t even for his health, that was for financial reasons - it wasn’t “financially sustainable”. I agreed. 

He has exams at the end of this week. Really important exams. He’s going out to revise today and wants to roll a spliff. He’s claiming “oh it’s just a .5 (half a gram) it’s harmless” and that he’s “not trying to get baked” but he wants to “vibe in a field”. I tried to convince him not to but he’s insistent he knows what’s best and is begging me not to be mad at him. I’m unsure about how to proceed. I’m just getting irritated because at the moment it feels like everything revolves around weed. He wanted to see me on Friday but begged to bring weed, we were going to go out last weekend but only if there was weed involved, he offered weed to some family friends and it’s just Mary Jane all the time with him. He won’t listen to me about how he’s overkill and admits he’s an addict but won’t get help, but is using his addiction to write a book about addiction. It’s like some joke to him. I’m worried that trying to tell him not to is controlling and toxic, I don’t want to be that girlfriend and so I need some sort of pointers or some help on how to proceed and whether or not telling him he needs to stop is toxic or not.",09Sep2020,1

585,"For the last few months, I’ve been studying a foreign language so that I would be able to apply to a university abroad. My original plan was to study said language and apply in January. 

Recently, my depression struck back hard and I’ve lost all motivation to study. To be honest, I was already depressed when I started the language course but now it’s getting much worse. The fact that I haven’t met any friends or family members for 5 months, besides my parents, didn’t help my situation. After reading some suggestions on other subreddits, I decided that I would address my depression and motivation issues before I go to university or even continue my language course by taking some time off.

Now I just have to convey my thoughts to my parents. I’ve talked with my dad and he said that it was alright under the condition that I busy myself with something productive, not just lay in bed all day. He said that if I tried my best, he’s happy. Note that I still plan to go to uni, just delayed by a couple of months or a year. 

Now the hard part is talking to my mom about it. It’s usually hard to talk to my mom about these issues because she’s stubborn, very straightforward, narrow minded, and oversimplifies things. In the past, she’s said that I should just “get over” my depression and I should “work” for 8+ hours day during quarantine. Although she’s pretty hard on certain subjects, she also cares about my future. She would tell me to get more info on my university or tell me to join webinars. I can only imagine her freaking out once I tell her that I would like to pause everything to compose myself. Any advice on how to explain it to my mom? Sorry if my post was very long.",09Sep2020,1

Stage 4 is meant to be finishing this week but it’s extended until the end of the month. The only place I have been is work, the doctors and the supermarket to buy food. Everything is shut, a part from supermarkets, pharmacists and doctors pretty much.

The mats were heavy duty and made with Kevlar....not particularly comfortable for working out on IMHO but they look nice and will last 3 lifetimes.

I responded something like “yeah, a little over the top for a workout, but they wipe down nicely”

He responded politely but firmly “you know you should disclose that there’s Kevlar in the mats so it doesn’t trigger Veterans”

I was a bit dumbfounded, I don’t remember my response, but I’m sure it was something stupid as I was processing what he was saying. Thankfully he was with a group of people that absorbed him as they were walking out.

when i tell my parents i want to disappear they just say that i will, but i need to follow life’s course before that. a few nights ago my dad screamed that i was shit after i told him this advice was shit, woke up my mom, and she finally realized how bad it was for me to listen to this and how only made my situation worse.

I have always had social anxiety to a point that I have my hands shaking when I meet more than 10 people. I always enjoy and have fun but I don't usually speak much when it's too many people. So, back to today. They came and played with my dog and I gave so many awkward answers while we were chatting. These people are not very out spoken as well so, there were a few moments of awkward silence which I hate when I'm around them because they're such good friends of mine. 

I have now come to a point that it pisses me off when I am awkward around people because I want to become more confident in life. I also am not very witty when it comes to giving replies to insults or just talking in general and now, that pisses me off as well.

592,"I’ve known my friend for years. We basically grew up together. I’ve been to his house a bunch of times throughout my life. It’s like a second home. All this time I remember his little sister being around, but we never really talked much. She was a little kid after all.

Now my friend comes from, with all respect to him, a family of fuck-ups. Divorce, fired, pregnant too early, broke, drug addicts, etc., I’ve heard it all. And seen part of it whenever I was at his house. Luckily my friend’s mom, him and his sister seem like the relatively competent ones in the bunch, but I don’t think his mom ever expected much from them given the rest of her family’s history.

Then I come in. I decided to go to college with the primary goal of being financially secure. I did decently well and managed to find a good job and a place of my own. I still visited my friend’s throughout this whole process and his mom mentioned how happy and proud she was of me, which I just took as light encouragement. But now I think it just means she wants me to take care of her daughter.

She started making his sister join us for things. My friend and I were going to see a movie? His sister had to join in. We were out to eat? Guess who needed to come with us.

It got especially weird when I didn’t visit for a few months while I was out of town and finally came back. She made me hug her daughter (which I never did before) and said “look how pretty she’s gotten. She’s turning into a fine young woman, isn’t she?” I could tell her daughter wasn’t comfortable with that.

But that didn’t stop all the subtle messages and hints she dropped whenever I was around. Finally my friend and I were going on a road trip and he straight asked me “do you like my sister?” I said she was underage. He shrugged defeatedly and said “my mom really wants you to date her. She even said she’d wait until my sister graduated.”

Until my younger bro stepped in and just ruined everything again, a few moments ago we ended everything on neutral terms and he told me that he will lose contact with me and that he will never talk to me and I should never talk to him again.

That broke my sanity mostly because for a large majority of time he helped me in so many ways. Now I lost him and I just feel broken, unloved and hurt in many ways. I don't know where to go or what to do anymore

601,"This is /old/ and also I’m on mobile so excuse format lol 

I (21) met my partner (22) my junior year of high school five years ago. We’ve had our rough patches but clearly we’ve always managed to work it out. One big issue back then (when I was a junior/senior in high school (my last two years of mandatory school for my foreign friends)) was my parents were overprotective and it took a lot of fighting with them to let me go out as a 17/18 year old as much as I wanted (cue memes about not asking parents to hang out with someone because it’s “too soon” (also i completely understand why they didn’t let me, they were just scared and worried about their kids)). 

I had two best friends at the time, one I’ve known basically my whole life and the other a year less. We’re gonna call them El and Che. 

I was the first person El came out to, I consistently asked how they were doing, how they were doing as far as family, if they’ve told the family, and even went as far as trying to find therapy recommendations for them because they were required and wanted them. I tried to support El in every way I could think of. I barely saw them outside school though, I didn’t really hang out with anyone outside of school (important) and they knew that. 

Che was close to us but never fully opened up to us no matter how hard we tried to be there. No matter how many times I tried to. They were just such a closed off person it made it hard. 

So cue where my partner ( Dave) comes in, we start dating and obviously I was a teenager in a new relationship so the few times I’m able to leave my house I spent time with Dave. I’d talk about my relationship with them but not often because any sign of aggravation from me regarding Dave always ended in them telling me to leave him. Like it could be over something stupid too. He forgot to pick me up from work one time and was late. I was told that’s grounds for nearly ending my relationship? Like no he was late chill lol so I stopped talking about my relationship with my two best friends because I was sick of them telling me to leave him every time I vented about the littlest thing. This eventually led to me just not talking about my outside life. I was already going through depression so that made it even easier to keep my shit to myself even if I knew I shouldn’t be like that. 

Come graduation I forget why but El was giving me the cold shoulder for absolutely no reason. We were fine before that, talking and everything. But that day they couldn’t give two shits about me ( I think it’s because Dave was there). August after that, I go on vacation with him. I’m in the mountains with a great lack of service for a week and a half. They wanted to hang out when I got back but I told them I wasn’t sure when I’d be back I don’t have service I’ll hit you guys up as soon as I can (they knew I was going on vacation too btw). They ended up just hanging out without me. 

A month later I broke up with my bf, it was my fault. My decision. All me. None of it was him. I texted them trying to vent for once and the result was them ganging up on me telling me I “only care about myself” “I never liked hearing about you and Dave it made me uncomfortable” and apparently me trying to support their coming out and being a supportive when it came to them wanting to start relationships was wrong of me too. I was told that telling El to shoot his shot with a guy was wrong. Che was like “youre never there for me and don’t care about Me” but how am I supposed to support someone who doesn’t open up to anyone? Basically told I’m a shit friend for being in a relationship and “never making time for them” which wasn’t true because we constantly Skyped, played video games together, texted, etc. and I’d make my partner wait for us to be done sometimes. I just didn’t see them outside of school as much as any of us wanted, and once I had more freedom from my parents they already cut me off. 

It’s been 3 years now and I’m still a little salty. I see their instagrams all the time and have thought about reaching out but I really just don’t know if I should let the dead lie or try. 

Also: El after the fight turned around and got mad at me for 

Also: El got mad at me for reblogging a sexual consent awareness poster from their tumblr because I stopped responding to them ganging up on me because every tile I tried to defend myself they came back with “you’re making this about you”.

The same day I post on instagram about my flight, Anne sends me a message telling me she was gonna invite me to her village, which is wonderful. 

The thing that bothers me is that we talked thorugh whatsapp during the summer and she never hinted that. Besides, It was not necessary telling me this the same day about my trip. If it's obvious I  can't come has no sense. Besides, a week before I already  told her I had planned this trip. 

We're both in our early twenties. Anne never had a boyfriend before but the last winter she met a wonderful guy. On the other hand I never had a boyfriend. 

A week ago, out of nowhere, she send me a pic a of expensive reservation in a hotel of our city. She had told me this before, but I don't understand why she would  send me a pic like that. The last straw was yesterday when ,out of nowhere again, she sent me pics with her boyfriend in the hotel. 

On top of this, we still haven't seen each other since the early summer. I say jealous, because I don't understand her. Maybe I am exaggerating and this is nothing.

Now, I am sexually active and find her to be beautiful and sexy I would totally be up for a friends with benefits scenario but the problem is she will always want more and I just cant hurt her feelings like that. I don't quite know what the right move is in this situation I really dont want to make things even more awkward between us... maybe I should just tell her I'm flattered but I'm not ready to be in another relationship and I just want to be friends.

My grandparents live alone in a different state which is under lockdown.

622,"My partner and I (and our dog) were supposed to move from Boston to Los Angeles this fall. Many COVID-related mishaps and delays later, we are both working remotely and eager to turn this into an adventure.

We want to move somewhere that we normally would never have the chance or thought to live. Since we can't really socialize or do much anyway, we figured this is a great time to pick up and move somewhere temporary that has a lot to offer.

We are hoping to take off in early November and stay somewhere for at least a few months. Here's what we're thinking / our wish list:

\- AFFORDABLE! Keep in mind we are coming from Boston so basically everywhere seems more affordable. Ideally less than $1,500 a month for a one bedroom and a reasonable cost of living in the area.

\- SCENIC! We're sick of being stuck in a crowded city during this pandemic. We want the option to go outside, breathe fresh air, and explore. Maybe a cute town center, hiking or outdoorsy activities nearby, other sightseeing within a few hours drive. Neither of us have lived near mountains before and we'd really love to!

\- REASONABLE WEATHER! This one is tough given the previous comment, but we aren't thrilled by the idea of packing up all our winter shit and enduring a brutal few months in a tundra. We don't mind snow or cold, but ideally we'd be moving somewhere that is livable (if not pleasant) in the winter months. We also definitely don't want to move somewhere hot or humid, so basically all southern states are out for us.

Before i start i just want to say, that I apologize for every grammatical mistake that i'll make in this post. English is my 4th language that im learning.

I will try to keep it short, oh and a tl;dr will be below.

So there is this girl that has been interested in me for almost 3 years now. We meet back in school, and she  actually had a boyfriend for a majority of our time in school, yet she continued to flirt with me and do all that stuff that tells me that she likes me, like close proximity , really good chemistry and so on. One thing she especially loves doing is staring at me, for minutes sometimes. She broke up with him right before we graduated and i decided ask her out. She agreed and later on cancelled it. After a month she got together with another guy( which of course made me sad) from my school, and i thought ""well guess shes not that interested in me as it seems"". 

And here comes my problem.

We are actually studying together now and will for the next 3 years. We see eachother every day. After i stopped paying attention to her, she again started to do all this flirt stuff as i've described above earlier. Im trying to ignore it because its childs play in my eyes, but then again there is a reason why i asked her out, so there is still a small portion of me left that really likes her.

I will not try to engage with her again, nor will i try to make something happen. I only want to understand why people like this exist , and why they just cant be honest about their feelings.

She really has been doing this ""i think i really like you"" stuff for 3 YEARS FOR EVERY DAY. EVERY. SINGLE. DAY.

Im 21 and shes 20 if that helps in any way.
Oh and sorry if this is actually the wrong subreddit.

Have a nice day! :)

tl;dr a girl with a bf is flirting with me for 3 years now and after they broke up i tried to shoot my shot, and she got together with another guy. We graduated but still see eachother every day, and she keeps flirting with me.

For context my mom has suffered through divorce due to infidelity of her husband, pet dying, and dealing with the stress and anxiety of a global pandemic while in a medical field. She is in a difficult mental and emotional state.

Recently she was cat-fished by a man she met on OurTime after the above events. We found significant issues when we investigated his background after our mom had limited her communication with her 4 children and he moved into her place after only 1 month of dating. From public records we were able to find domestic abuse, child abuse, 3 marriages not revealed, lies about military service, lies about job licenses, and tens of thousands of dollars in creditors trying to recover debt.

We compiled all this information and presented it to her as we were very concerned since he had access to social security cards, addresses, banking information, tax statements, etc… She broke the relationship off that day.

However, she is not right mentally. It is impacting her ability to make rational decisions and it is making it incredibly difficult for us to remain empathetic. We believe she is continuing to see him. She is dismissive/angry at us for interfering with her life. Has severely limited all communication to family or friends. She is severely depressed with the negative thoughts that no one will ever love her.

We are looking for advice on the following areas:

1. **Other safety issues we haven’t done or considered outside of:** (*Changing her locks, SSA watch, fraud alerts, security freezes, changed and upgraded passwords to require 2 factor authentications on all accounts, and IRS affidavit.)*
2. **What else can we do to support her if she is unwilling to seek mental health help?**
3. **How do we remain empathetic and supportive knowing she isn't in the best emotional state, has lied, and is destroying our trust in her?**
4. **If needed, how to best create and communicate boundaries to maintain a relationship with our mom.**
5. **Are there any other resources out there to support her that we have not considered?**

**TL;DR:**

630,"Most people like me or atleast are okay with my existence. I have a good network even when I make no effort to take care of it at all I'm working on that, I tend to just disappear on people and they don't deserve that. I'm an ambivert but I am a very private person and I don't like the attention and even though I make zero effort to stay in touch I am friends with every person I knew since I was a child to adulthood. This is not a brag, it's a thing I need to fix. 

I just deal with cattiness from obese women who look a very specific way, I was never prejudiced before this about them, but I think it's a cultural problem, they all look alike and have the same body shape to the point I have started to seem like I have specific prejudice issues. I find it difficult to get rid of them. They persistently stalk me for years. They are very persistent and I do listen to feedback and criticism but I like taking that from people who are good at what they do or they are great at that task. They are also very delusional. It's like talking to a wall that is envious and codependent. They are also, I am being objective have no redeeming qualities about them, even if I completely overlook the lookism aspect of it and their behavior and where they come from and their nature. I understand they follow me around cause I have everything good about me they don't. I'm sure, I have met dogs that have more redeeming qualities and I am a very open minded person, I think creative people tend to be high on openness and in any other circumstances where these people were not delusional and not stalking me, I would be okay with the idea of them. I would still get them in touch with a therapist and a trainer and keep my distance, but I won't look down on them as much. It's possible people can have all these qualities and be a train wreck and a bad person and still have some value as a human being and deserve love, sure, as long as they are in jail or getting treatment for it. 

My go to thought process on most people is ambivalence.

631,"Actually, the situation is simple to explain. I feel like it is complicated inside though. Here is an example:

I see my ps3 I used to play, and get a weird feeling inside. Its not like nostalgia. It is something else. I  see my mp3 player, and remember the fun times I had with it, why I  can't experience those etc. I look at my FAMILY, and think we used to be better. Those make me really depressed. That feeling doesn't accur just for objects. It happens when Im in a room as well. (mostly afternoon) Maybe it is because of poor lightning since I don't open any lights until the sun fully goes out. 

That happens almost everyday, and I also have existential crisis, which makes it worse. This feeling used to occur when I was little too. I could often feel sad about the toys I lost or not using. I often feel like objects I like or used to like have a personality. I inject some personality into them. I used to do it when I was little, and still do but lesser. I NEVER confessed this to anyone. Including my parents and ""some adult/proffesional that could help me""

I don't feel like telling my problems, keeping them inside seems like a better option, since I got over existential crisis myself. I can handle it now. In some days, I think of telling my issues to someone but words won't come out of my mouth. And that though often comes at night, so I say ""I will tell it tomorrow"" and forge about it the next day. This becomes a loop over time. This may be happening because of my family too. My dad had parkinson's in one stage of my life(still has it but he is better compared to the earlier days of it) which increased stress levels in my family. My mom had to take care of everything, and when she became overwhelmed by all that work, fights in my family became more common. (mostly my mom and dad)

So here we are. I feel like my communication with my family is drastically shifting, and I have that ""weird feeling"". As I said, I didn't confess it to anyone, and I don't want to since my family has enough problems to solve, and I don't want to cry or something infant of them. What should I do to solve this ""weird feeling""? Do you have any advice that could help me?",09Sep2020,1

634,"Hey, guys!

So, I moved to a new country on January, which means I have been pretty much locked up since I came here, which also means I haven't made new friends in this country. However, I did have the opportunity to start dating a guy before quarantine and we've had a relationship ever since. At the beginning, I felt incredibly enthusiastic about him and constantly thought he was everything I was looking for in a guy: smart, with ambition, good talker, mature, has same interests than me, kinda romantic, always supportive about my projects and my feelings, etc. But I feel more indifferent towards him every month. 

And I feel guilty because of that. I mean, I know he actually loves me and I think he has many great qualities, but I can't help feeling bored with him more often than I would wish. I've been missing my friends a lot lately, so we have talked a lot over Discord (a platform similar to zoom, for those who might not know it) and I just realized this weekend, as I laughed out loud several times with them and had so much fun that I hardly ever laugh as hard when talking to him (let's call him ""J"" for now). I sometimes feel like he's quite too serious. He's pretty much into politics, history, and stuff like that. Which I am too! But I feel like sometimes he misses real life. I mean, I love talking about deep stuff and I even consider it a ""requirement"" for a guy, as I know I would get bored with someone who can't debate with me or handle those kind of conversations. 

But I also like talking about dumb shit. I also like just doing something very stupid and having fun. And I love hanging out with friends and meeting new people. Which he doesn't. He has been more than pleased with lock-down. I'm starting to feel I'm going crazy with the lack of social interaction. And just talking about more ""funny"" stuff is just not an option with him because he directly tells me he's not interested on that kind of things. We even had an argument once because of that.

So, guys, I have so many doubts now. Should I just be honest with myself and break up with him? Or maybe I'm being too picky? Maybe I should talk to him about this and try to solve it? But I don't know how if he's just not willing to talk about things that don't interest him. I mean, I feel like it's very sad to let go someone who has a lot of great things and who truly cares about me. But sometimes I can't help feeling like talking to him is more of a duty instead of something I enthusiastically do.

636,"A little background: my dad passed away about a year ago after a short, but rough battle with cancer. I have no siblings, just my mom &amp; I now. I’m a college student &amp; I’m living at home due to covid/all my classes are online. My mom and I have never really been close, but at the end of the day she’s the only parent I have left so I have been trying to bend over backwards to try and make her happy and keep some sort of relationship. 

Shortly after my dad passed away, she started to “hang out” with this certain guy. I’ve known who this guy was for many years now, but I’ve kinda just tried to brush his existence off. Over the past 6 months she had started to “hang out” and have long phone conversations with him. Many of the phone calls would end with her yelling at him/crying/etc. At one point she had told me that he had said some hurtful things to her, including talking bad about my dad. This is about the point when I started to tune into their whole relationship/“friendship”. I started to notice she was talking and texting him a lot. She would “sneak” over to his house as well. It was clear that there was a relationship going on. Mind you, throughout this whole ordeal she would never talk about him to me other than the one instance that I mentioned already. (Not sure if she was trying to save my feelings or what?) But, nevertheless, I could not stand him. He had come over to our house a handful of times to fix things (he 100% did not need to) and through those times I notice how much of a rude person he was. He would tell my mom that she needs to get over my dad, she needs to stop holding onto his stuff, etc. At this point is when I finally decided I had enough. I felt uncomfortable with this guy coming around. It was enough for me already when he had first talked bad about my deceased dad who he didn’t know, now he’s just being rude and disrespectful towards my mom. 
Fast forward a week after this, my friends and I decided the best route of communication to tell my mom that I did not like this guy and I did not want him around me would be through a text or a letter. My mom is not the one for confrontation, she does not like difficult conversations, and she also has a very bad temper. Naturally, I was being kind of distant because she wouldn’t tell me about this relationship she was having, but further that she would allow herself to be in such a toxic one. Over the course of three days she would push and press me to tell her what is wrong and I wouldn’t, I knew it wasn’t a conversation she would be able to have. Eventually, I just exploded in almost like a word vomit manner about what I was feeling and how much I didn’t like this guy, I also included that I knew about her little relationship and that I couldn’t believe that she wouldn’t be upfront with me. She shut down, she got defensive, she wouldn’t talk to me for days. Two days later she told me she cut all ties with him and that she would just “never date”. I told her that is not what I wanted, I just didn’t want him around me. The day after that, she acts like nothing ever happened and that’s been how it has been since. 
Until last night. Last night he came over, she didn’t tell me that he was coming over, he just showed up. Of course, I decide to leave because I didn’t want to be around him. As I was getting in my car my mom asked that where I was going and I responded telling her to let me know when he leaves. I wasn’t going to argue with her or cause a scene, but I didn’t want to be there so I removed myself. I sent her a text shortly after when I got to a friends house saying that I do not like him and that he makes me very uneasy. She ignored it. She didn’t care. She hasn’t talked to me since, she shut herself in her room and won’t even look at me if she leaves the room for anything. I don’t know what to do. Should I try talking to her? Should I just leave her be? Is it even worth trying to mend the relationship anymore? 


I understand that she has a right to be with whoever she wants, I’m not saying she can’t be with this guy, but I also don’t think it’s too much to ask for her not to bring him around me. I will never respect him based on the things he said about my dad.",09Sep2020,1
637,"Long story short, my mother was diagnosed with schizophrenia around four years ago. Prior to that, she exhibited suspicions of my friends and relatives.. She’d trash a gift I received from a friend because she’d think it’s planted with something, and she’d distance herself from relatives because she thinks they’re conspiring against our family. Other examples include seeing random posts on the internet or watching the news and thinking they’re talking about her. To make matters worse, she is religious in a bad way, so she believes God sometimes speaks directly to her, and she watches religious videos all day which probably feed her new conspiracies.. Having rational discussions or arguments with her has been impossible for awhile, and I would even say she’s been affected by this condition for over 10 years. We put her on medication before, but the side-effects sap her energy and she would spend a lot of time just lying down, so it’s hard to put someone through that if they don’t want it.

Recently she finally explained the reason for her suspicions of our relatives in a written letter. And it’s absolutely insane conspiracy talk, and according to the timeline of how long she knew about this it’s been going on for over 30 years even. I try to give her the benefit of the doubt and ask for proof but none are given. While we quietly tolerated her zealous piety and conspiratorial tendencies, it feels like we just hit a new low and we need to do more about it, quick. Revisiting a professional and considering medication is a given, we’ll try to force her even if she does not want to. But at the end of the day, I would almost rather she be delusional but happy than miserable that her closest family treats her like she’s insane. So I have no idea how to approach this. If anyone has experience dealing with family members with mental illnesses, I would like to know how we can deal with it and help her without making her feel unloved and isolated.",09Sep2020,1

639,"For frame of reference, I am 17 years old, and am a senior in high school. Ever since we were old enough to have technology, it hasn’t been allowed in bathrooms or in bedrooms at all. Obviously, I’ve struggled with this, being a teenager and all. Most recently, I’ve gotten in trouble for having an iPod touch in my room to listen to music at night. I can’t fall asleep without music, and I like to be able to play my own playlist. Also, about a month ago, I got my drivers license. I haven’t been allowed to drive anywhere on my own in the past month. I was finally going to be able to drive myself to work this week (about 5 mins away), when my parents found out I had an iPod in my room, and now I still can’t drive. My parents say we need to talk about me respecting family rules before they can trust me in a car, but every time I ask to have a discussion about it they brush it off and ignore me. I’m so frustrated because we’ve had the same rules since I was eleven years old, and now I’m close to being an adult. Am I overreacting, or are my parents being too strict? All I want is a little freedom.",09Sep2020,1

I'd always defend women when they're under attack , whatever the case but something I've seen makes me question if somr women are rly fighting for equality? When I go on twitter, I cannot go a singlr day without seeing at least on post with something likr ""Kill all men"" or something along those lines but then you search quickly through the tweets of these people and they have boyfriends or always saying they like men. And this to me seems like completely hypocrisy. My question is: Am I wrong for thinking this? Cause a lot of the time I see people agreeing with this and most of the time I can just ignore it.

I made a lot of friends in my old school and I have grown a very personal connection to them and I feel like I can tell them anything and they can tell me anything. But there's one friend that came with me to college and he did a different course to me which is fine but seeing him making new groups of friends really worries me because I feel like he's going to drift away from me and I really don't want that to happen. I know the chances of that are low because of how good friends we are but it's just the chance of it happening terrifies me. My other friends, I feel fine with because I can't see them during the day. I know I sound like a massive prick for saying this because of course he can make new groups of friends and I do too but I just have all this negativity that is making me think of the worst outcomes to everything.

645,"Okay so. We're both 18, and we're just getting into university. We've been together for a month and a half now. I asked her to be my girlfriend on the top on a ferry wheel, on her birthday I called her at midnight and we had a really romantic chat. I kept telling her how much she means to me, and that she's a very special person, and she appreciated everything I said and told me love you (without the i). A week later, I did a prom proposal to her in my house, I gathered our friends group and did it. It was so romantic; I brought candles and lit them up, and did a ""prom?"" word but instead of the O it was a heart, and it was all surrounded by red petals. At the end of the night she told me the three magical words, ""I love you"". After this we hadn't seen each other for 5 days but we kept in contact by chat. When I saw her after 5 days, something was off with her. She didn't seem interested to open up a convo with me, I kept trying to open topics, she'd answer in a really short answer. But when some of my guy friends went to talk to her, she was really excited to talk to them and she kept the conversation going with them. She never tried to talk to me in the whole gathering but she was talking to everybody else. After 2 days, she messaged me good morning with a heart, and acted like nothing had happened. Then, 3 days later after continuous chatting, our whole friend group we went to swim. We had an argument in the morning, but I thought she wasn't mad at me, because she ended it with ""forget about it"", then she made a joke, then she asked when I was going to the pool. So I thought everything was okay. I arrived there, we talked a bit, everything was okay. Then I tried to have fun with her by splashing her a bit with water because she was too scared to go in because the water was cold. She got annoyed. I got surprised. Like wow. But she didnt say anything. We would talk a bit after this but she wouldnt give me much attention, she wouldnt start convos with me. So just before leaving for home, I went up to her and asked her Whats up? She said she was mad because of the argument we had in the morning. I told her that I had no idea you were mad at me, I thought we got over it, and asked her if she wanted to talk about it and she said no, it's all good. The next morning she texted me Good morning, and then everything was okay again. After a few days we talked on the phone one night for 25 mins, she said her mom is calling her and shell be back after 15 mins. She hung up and didnt call back, in the morning she said ""oops I slept"". Now university is starting. We dont talk like we used to before, we dont spend as much time as before, we dont have fun as much as before, I feel like shes not giving me enough attention now. I feel like she doesnt have time for me anymore, and doesnt try to make time for me. Any idea whats going on with her? Why shes not giving me attention? What suddenly happened?

647,"I posted this on ym main account but deleted it. And decided to post this in here. This is a throwaway account

Actually, the situation is simple to explain. I feel like it is complicated inside though. Here is an example:

I see my ps3 I used to play, and get a weird feeling inside. Its not like nostalgia. It is something else. I see my mp3 player, and remember the fun times I had with it, why I can't experience those etc. I look at my FAMILY, and think we used to be better. Those make me really depressed. That feeling doesn't accur just for objects. It happens when Im in a room as well. (mostly afternoon) Maybe it is because of poor lightning since I don't open any lights until the sun fully goes out.

That happens almost everyday, and I also have existential crisis, which makes it worse. This feeling used to occur when I was little too. I could often feel sad about the toys I lost or not using. I often feel like objects I like or used to like have a personality. I inject some personality into them. I used to do it when I was little, and still do but lesser. I NEVER confessed this to anyone. Including my parents and ""some adult/proffesional that could help me""

I don't feel like telling my problems, keeping them inside seems like a better option, since I got over existential crisis myself. I can handle it now. In some days, I think of telling my issues to someone but words won't come out of my mouth. And that though often comes at night, so I say ""I will tell it tomorrow"" and forge about it the next day. This becomes a loop over time. This may be happening because of my family too. My dad had parkinson's in one stage of my life(still has it but he is better compared to the earlier days of it) which increased stress levels in my family. My mom had to take care of everything, and when she became overwhelmed by all that work, fights in my family became more common. (mostly my mom and dad)

Im not brave enough to ask for help irl, so Im asking help from the people of the internet.

So here we are. I feel like my communication with my family is drastically shifting, and I have that ""weird feeling"". As I said, I didn't confess it to anyone, and I don't want to since my family has enough problems to solve, and I don't want to cry or something infant of them. What should I do to solve this ""weird feeling""? Do you have any advice that could help me?",09Sep2020,1

Would even go on about him masturbating while thinking of her, keep in mind she kept telling him over and over again it made her uncomfortable. She eventually blocked him, but now in the future he’s contacting her again and she’s confronting him.

653,"So, I'm a post-grad 23-year old that graduated with my BFA in creative photography. I worked previously for a high-end tech company in their customer service branch but was let go due to the pandemic. I didn't qualify for unemployment, but I have been lucky to live with my parents rent-free and they helped me out a little. However, I have had many emotional issues with my family in the past, and they stifle my own personal progress by treating me like a child. I've been applying and applying for jobs, over 80 at this point, and I don't know if I'm going to ever see an opportunity be thrown my way. I also don't know if I'm going to be happy if I continue to work a 9-5 and never use my degree for its intended purpose. They think I need to find a job first, save, then move. BUT... because of the pandemic and life's uncertainty, I don't know if that will ever happen, and I'll waste away in my parent's house.

That being said, I think I want to focus on pursuing my art career full time. A friend of mine, who is basically a mentor of mine, has flirted with the idea of me using his warehouse space as a photography and printing space. I could do freelance work there, run the studio publicly and make a profit off of renting it out, and working on my fine art so that I could freshen up my CV, my portfolio, and start submitting artwork for exhibiting. However, this would require me to move north, about three states away. I wouldn't be immediately promised work,  and it's incredibly hard to find anything due to the pandemic. My family would also not be able to understand their adult daughter just moving for the sake of pursuing my passion. I feel like the future is so fucked, and fucked in a way never experienced before, and I don't know if I should continue chasing after the status quo instead of just letting go of that notion to do what I dream of doing. 

I guess what advice I'm asking for is: how can I strategically plan for a move like this? How can I tell my family that this is the best thing for me right now, and I have a right to just move to live my dream? I think that this will be SO good for me, and I can escape my troubled past to just be myself.",09Sep2020,1

He starts aggressively talking and asks me about why I don’t wear shorts that fit me and that the clothes I wear “send a message”. I usually wear revealing clothes bc that’s my style. He asks me why I go out like that and other shit that just kept getting worse and worse, and I told him that it’s because it’s hot outside.

656,"Hi I have some concerns about my Roommate’s ESA.
We have been in this rental house for about two months now, and the lease has a strict “no pet policy of any sorts”.
Only after I insisted on the owner to submit the ESA papers to the landlord on two separate occasions did they actually submit it two days ago. 
My roommate has an ESA dog, who is neglected. He is not trained, (not house broken and doesn’t know/come to any commands), he is part beagle and barks extremely loud. He isn’t a puppy.
He jumped out a window and broke his hip, and it took my other roommates and I to convince his owner to take him to physical therapy because he couldn’t walk. 
His owner feeds him constantly whenever his bowl is empty, the dog is now obese. His owner does not walk him nor are they ever home with the dog. They usually go out and party leaving the dog alone in the house.
This dog we did not ask for, has turned into our responsibility. We try to take care of him and train him, but his owner usually scolds us for how we go about it.
The dog poops and pees all over the floor. We often come home to find piles, and puddles. (either the owner is in their room not paying attention to the dog or they are not home and left him out of his crate)
We have tried talking to our roommate directly to no avail. How do we handle this? He is not a proper ESA and is getting neglected.

Normally, a crush wouldn't be that big of a deal to get over, but i have to see her almost every day. So I don't get the time or the distance to get over it. (Finding a different girl to chase after isnt an option right now thanks to rona)
 
Ive been biding my time because soon enough (maybe 1-3 months) I'll be in a different situation, and I'll be able to move on and forget about it. The idea was that as soon as that happens, I'll ghost her and move on with my life. But as that deadline has approached, I've become less and less willing to let her go. 
 
I think it's important to note that, logically speaking, I don't even want to date her.  There are a number of reasons why a relationship between us wouldn't work, so regardless of how she feels about me, dating is off the table. Emotionally speaking, it's a much different story. Its hard to explain our current relationship, but she's been pretty adamant and persistent about getting close to me and making me her best friend. I realized that the reason I want to hold on to her so badly is because she's the only person I've ever met who's shown me genuine love and interest like that. At this point, its not even a romantic thing that im getting from her. None of my friends or family have ever treated me like she does, and i dont want to let go of that.

I have Autism. My mom says that ""if you move out when you are 18, I will put a waiver on your ass!"". Im pretty sure this is refurring to some kind of Autism waiver that takes control of my life i.e. restricts me from moving out or something, idk.

My partner has verbally told his father many times, “I need therapy to help with my issues,” and “I would rather do online schooling because it would be easier and less stressful”. But he refuses to listen. 

Also, my partner doesn’t really have the money to do all this himself. He has a job, but school gets in the way of everything. He pays for a lot of things by himself, but still lives at home since we’re younger.

And I’m not a person that can dictate this situation. It feels like no one can. I just want to know if there’s something I can do. Because my partner feels so hopeless everyday, and he seems to just become more and more depressed.

He’s asking for help, but no one’s helping. And I’m doing the best I can to be there for him and listen. But nothing good is going to come out of it if nothing changes.

669,"Hey, guys. A little background info-- I'm a young person (19) living in Texas. I graduated high school and attended college for theatre for a semester and a month but had to drop out because of my mental health. I've been working for a few months now but have really had my future on my mind and I know that the place I'm currently in is definitely not a place I'd like to stay my entire life.
I've always had an affinity for acting and have many accolades for it. I'd always loved theatre and acting in high school, and it made me wonder about what I could possibly do in my lifetime. My theatre director always told me I'd be the next Meryl Streep, and although I definitely don't know about that, it was always very encouraging to hear. My peers, their parents, my family, and the community I am from seem to think I'm great at acting and could really go on to do something with it.
Is moving somewhere that acting, theatre, and television is more appreciated a plausible reality? I'm from a place where guys my age tend to grow up to be oilfield workers, high school coaches, and things like that. Girls my age typically grow up to be nurses, teachers, and hair stylists. I want to act.
I make an okay wage at my current day job, and as of right now have been catching up on bills with my significant other so no money is currently saved at the moment. I don't see myself doing what I'm doing now the rest of my life. I've never had a concrete idea of what I want to do in life as it revolves around art, music, and things of this nature and where I'm from there is not much opportunity.
How often do people who move to California make it like that? Is it possible I could do this? I've always dreamed of traveling and exploring the country and world. I really am at a loss for what I'd like to do in life when it comes to anything else, and this would be the ideal option for me. I just want to prepare myself as much as possible if this is a viable option. Thanks for any comments.",09Sep2020,1
670,"To start, I just want to say that I love animals and though I'm very much a cat person, have been around dogs a lot and generally get along with them.

That being said, I (29F) can't stop being rude to my boyfriend (29M)'s dog. We started living together about 6 months ago, and I realized that his dog and I just don't have compatible personalities. She's extremely relaxed and laid back, and it's almost impossible to get her to play. This is frustrating to me because I'm very high energy and I think I take it personally when she's unresponsive to me, and it results in me complaining about her. I wish I felt more of a connection to her, but when I look at her I just feel like she seems pathetic. The complaints are beginning to wear on my boyfriend, who takes her to dog parks to try to make her more social and also is responsive to me when I ask him to help me train her not to do certain things (scratch the couch, etc.), and is basically just a wonderful person and good dog owner.

I know I'm the jerk in this situation, which is why this isn't posted on AITA. I'm just looking for advice on how to stop myself from needing to say aloud every complaint I have about the dog (because me trying really hard to stop has not worked); my relationship with my boyfriend is very important to me and I know it is not ok to constantly verbally berate his dog with criticism and disdain, and that's the most important piece. However I'd also like advice on how to bond with this animal I just don't click with, because I know it would make my boyfriend really happy to see me enjoying her company.

TL;DR I complain constantly about my boyfriend's dog and feel like a jerk. I know I'm in the wrong and really need a strategy to shut my mouth and learn to love the dog.",09Sep2020,1

It has been demotivating, time consuming and stressful. I actually think it might not be making me do better. The marks I get have been reducing every few past papers and I'm not sure what to do at this point. On top of that, this April or so, I gained a sensitivity (and slight phobia).

I'm 23 and living back at home after a break up last year. I've been dealing with a lot of pretty detrimental mental health issues. 

Last night, I was having a pretty nasty meltdown only to find I'd run out of cigarettes. I'm currently unemployed due to the rona so I'm broke as shit. My stepdad left his wallet on the counter and I snagged a 20 out of it to get myself some cigarettes. I have NO idea why I thought that was ok. I have never in my entire life stolen anything from anybody.

Well, this morning I got a message from my mom asking if I had taken money out of his wallet. I admitted I did and apologized, and said I would talk to him. I'm still in a really not good spot emotionally, so I texted him and said, ""I'm really sorry I took that money. I don't know why I did that. I will give you back what I have left, and I can make the rest of it up somehow or I think I'll have some money on Friday that I can give you. I will apologize to you in person Im just trying to get my shit together a little bit. I'm really sorry.""

So I'm currently moving to Tampa next week to just try something different and become independent because, I am almost 30 and still living with my parents.. I've been to Tampa many times, explored the city, and I thought, ""hey, give it a shot"". So for over the past decade I've struggled with mental health/suicide, working bullshit jobs in order to try and live independently/pay for school, I've expressed many times to my parents that tuition is extremely expensive, they responded with "" we wish we could help but finances are rough"", I've pulled out loans in the past, I've had to drop out twice because I couldn't afford it, I even joined the Navy , (which I failed bootcamp miserably) in order to get tuition assistance, tried FAFSA and it was a joke. I then decided to put school in the back burner and focus on getting myself financially stable to just move the hell out.. I've also been helping my parents by giving them a couple hundred each month to send money to Mexico in order help my relatives down there. So long story short, they don't want me to move to FL and they made a generous offer to pay my tuition if I stay.. I felt very hurt that all of a sudden they can afford tuition, that they are magically interested on what classes I should take, etc.. I have been dying to leave my hometown and start somewhere new but this is making me so confused, mad, and even more lost than ever.. what would you guys do?

Turns out they're COVID deniers, think George Floyd didn't die due to the cop but because apparently drugs were in his system &amp; deserved to die due to his criminal past and seem to be leaning towards Trump to vote for. This wouldn't be an issue if my partner, (let's call them Doe), would have told me beforehand so I would be mentally prepared. Things only got worse when we all were returning to the cabin after spending the day on a local lake; Doe saw two Asian people wearing masks and taking pictures of the ducks and pointed to their sister while whispering something in her ear. They both laughed and when I asked what was up they both answered nothing. I'm worried they said something knowingly racist. Later that night we talked (at the time I was more worried if Doe still loved me), they reassured me and the next day everything was fine. But the moment I came back to my own home I felt like rift start and worsen as time went on. It's only been two days since I've seen them and yet I'm on the fence of leaving them. It doesn't help that a few weeks ago my ex came back into my life apologizing for everything he did and I've been talking to him off and on.

678,"I went to college for the first time on Monday and for some odd reason I threw up when I got to the college. This was weird because I wasn’t nervous if anything I was excited to see all my friends again after not seeing them in a while. So anyway after Monday’s events I shrugged it off as if it was no big deal.

Tuesday came and I woke up feeling fine and ready for the day and once I got on the bus to go to college I started to feel sick again (this also happened on the Monday) luckily this time I never vomited and the feeling of sickness went away pretty quickly once I got into the school premises.

Woke up this morning once again I felt fine didn’t feel sick at all but as soon as I got on the bus once again I started to feel the need to vomit and I managed to hold it in until I got to the school where I vomited in the school toilets. Just like Monday and Tuesday the sickness went away fairly quickly afterwards.

It’s not a travel or motion sickness problem because I was fine on all 3 days when I was coming home on the bus. 

I genuinely have no clue what this could be and it’s now beginning to worry me a little bit.

Any advice on how to defeat this problem?",09Sep2020,1

My aunts and uncles on both sides have the same qualifications more or less, but I just prefer my closest to me family more, cause they are really accomplished and a clear example of what right attitude can accomplish, with brains and hard work. I'm also loyal to my family cause I think, even though I meet parasitic people alot who tell me I should be more selfish, I had an early dose of reality on that and saw what made my parents stand out was their ethics, apart from their hardwork.

The biggest problem for me is the upstairs carpeting. We’ve had two dogs over the years who pissed everywhere and now it’s in the carpet (can smell it, get a sore throat within 10 mins).

686,"Okay, little background. 

My family consists of my mom (50F), My dad (48M), My older sister (21F), and me (13F). I also have two other older siblings but I haven’t talked to them since I was about 4 or 5 and they aren’t relevant to the story.

Also I don’t know my parents actual age cus every time I ask they joke around that they don’t remember and they won’t give me a legit number so I’m just throwing out numbers that I think are close. 

Anyway. My sister is up in her room most of the day (you’ll learn why in a bit.) and my dad is either working (from home cus COVID) or playing games like POE and Terraria so me and my mom are the only ones walking around the house. 

My mom has told us that she runs on stress and that usually wouldn’t be a problem but it shows. A lot. By that I mean she will get annoyed over little things like for example, she came in my room while I was cleaning with my headphones on and I (apparently) wasn’t picking up fast enough so she ripped my headphones off my head and threw them against the wall. 

I was lucky they worked still. She’s done the same with my sisters phone. That was a 100$ pair of headphones that she didn’t buy for me. My grandma did. And she jokes about it to this day and thinks she was in the right. No I didn’t buy it myself but I need to be 14 to get a job and I don’t get allowance or anything. I don’t have a way to get money. 

Anyway, back on track. Shes told me I didn’t care about my father because I accidentally left a shirt he bought me on the ground. Once. It was on my chair and it slipped off while I was cleaning my room.

This was going on daily for a long time. I cried daily because of her. I take myself to be a pretty tough person and I’m saying that because I’ve told my friends about this and they’re usual response was “Really? I’ve only seen you cry like, once.” And I was full on sobbing daily because she would come up to my room and scream at me for little things because of how stressed she was. I understand she was stressed but I don’t think she should’ve taken it out on me and my sister 

I eventually got yelled at by both my parents because I didn’t want to hug my mom after she yelled at me a few seconds ago. I went upstairs and called my best friend and told her what happened. I know it was petty but it was so stupid and I just needed to vent. I talked to her for a while until my door opened. It was my mom. She was listening to our conversation and she told me to hang up. 

I looked at my friend and hung up on her (we were on FaceTime) She yelled at me for about twenty seconds before I said “Am I still allowed to talk to (friends name)?” She said. “As of right now, no.” I cannot tell you how important my best friend is to me! She has got me through so much and I’ve done the same for her

We’ve been friends since first grade. And I can’t talk to her at school because she lives in another state. FaceTime is the only way we can contact each other and she means the world to me. 

That was my first ever panic attack. I felt like I was dying. But I got out everything I had been thinking. I told her that I didn’t like how she treated me. I told her that I felt like it wasn’t fair. I told her I’m trying to be better. 

I was told I could do a lot better. She did start treating me a little better after that but it’s slowly going back to the way it was. I want to be clear that I don’t think that I shouldn’t be yelled at ever. I think that I shouldn’t be full on sobbing every day because of things like I forgot to unload the dishwasher.

690,"Hello. I am a college student living in a student apartment complex about a mile and a half from campus. Information that may be relevant: It's not a great neighborhood, I am very small, I take the train to school, there are physically distinctive attributes about me that could be used to recognize me (e.g. I walk with a distinctive umbrella to protect me from the harsh sun and I am one of the only blondes in the complex), this complex does not have underclassmen, and I am 18 years old. This past Sunday evening, I was walking home from the train station with a little cart full of groceries. I was approached by this guy who was of the demographic that could be easily mistaken for a student. He was very tall but skinny and was in full clothing but no shoes and soaking wet (it was sunny, 112 degrees, and 18% humidity, making that seem especially odd). Just then, he asked to touch my hair, and when I declined, he asked to go up to my apartment, and when I declined that, he asked to help me with my groceries and THEN go up. He disclosed that he had been swimming in the pool before and that he had seen me before and has tried to follow me before but has not made the train and wonders ""where I go."" He also claimed to live in the complex across the street. I have never seen him before, and he cited many accurate details about my appearance and travel patterns, which has convinced me that he is not mistaking me for someone else. He then insisted upon pushing the cart and did not go away regardless of what I said or did. After passing through the pool area and falsely leading him away from where my apartment actually is, I was able to ditch him behind a locked gate when other kids greeted him. There are 2 gates, the one at which I lost him, which was locked, and the front one to get into the pool area, which was not. The front gate is tricky to open, as you have to unlatch something else on the other side, and he managed to do that, but he was not able to lift the cart over the curb or push open that same gate (heavy but obviously not such that any person could not open it independently). I informed management about this, but I'm not sure what I should do, because chances are, he hangs out here and would bother me again.

696,"Hey guys! I'll try to make this concise.

I work for my family business, I am the office manager. I also have a very rare disease that means if I get Covid, it will very likely be legitimate lifelong debilitation or death. I have to try really hard not to get COVID and I have been very careful in my personal life.

My issue is that my boss (who is my Dad) and my coworker (brother) refuse to let me work from home even though 95% of my duties can be done from home and the remaining 5% I can come in once a week, after hours for (essentially just need to collect mail or go over invoices with boss before sending out). 

There isn't always someone here so thankfully my exposure has been less this spring/summer but come fall/winter there are typically more people at the business and my father and brother come into the office every day or two and work within three feet of me, sometimes for hours at a time.

Originally, I was holding fast that I wanted to work from home, at the very least when people are at the business/office but that was refused. I gave in and stayed. I just recently told them both that if they come into the office they need to wear masks. They both outright ignored me. It hurts that they both don't take me seriously or respect that I could fucking die. My Dad finally agreed to wear his mask in the office but then came up an hour later without one.

Obviously I do not want to lose my job but honestly if this was any other job I feel they would have been much more understanding. People in the same role as me are working from home and have been since March. Also, if this was any other job that refused to be lenient during a pandemic I would be gone. It's only because it's my family that I stay. And of course I do like my job but the anxiety is getting worse, now that the kids are all back to school and cases are going to rise (my brothers kids are in school).

I have enough savings to float me through til next spring however I am worried about finding a job next year.

I've sprung some ideas on them, like finding someone to replace me temporarily, or have me continue to do bookkeeping from home and hire someone to be in the office, but they don't want to compromise. There's truly no reason for anyone to physically be in the office, phones and emails can be accessed from home but whatever, they are insistent that someone is physically in the office even though clients never come here. I think my brother just wants me out, he never wanted me to be hired here in the first place.

698,"I have graduated from high school and I am in the process of applying to different colleges. Most colleges have closed their applications. 

I want to pursue law which is very different from what all of my friends are pursuing and as a different procedure to apply to different colleges. In my country in order to get admission into any institute which offers law as a course, you have to take a national level exam. This is a really tough exam to crack because people prepare for it for years and they join institutes in advance which train you and prepare on how to pass the exam. I have not joined any of such institute and I am preparing on my own. I don't have any hopes of getting admitted into one of these colleges and these are government run colleges. 

I have applied to private colleges have as a backup. 

But I want to attend a government College which I don't think I will qualify for this year. If I want to get into a Government College I need to take a drop year to prepare for the exam which does not seem like a logical option.

I had applied to a backup college on one of my friend's recommendation  which I hadn't even heard about but apparently it is great in terms of placements and I have been admitted to the course which I wanted to admit. I have attended classes for a week. But for some reason it does not seem like the place where I belong we have linguistic issues as it is out of state (each state has a different language in my country) the people in my class are not my type of people if that makes sense. They all belong to a different state and have different social norms.

They are not the type of people which I would be able to relate to and I in general don't feel like I belong there even though I am pursuing the course which I wanted to pursue and the college placements are really nice and I'm going to get the same degree, which I really want. But I feel like my heart does not belong in that place and I don't want to go there despite having a 40% scholarship. 

I want to go to a government law college because a law course takes five years to complete and it is extremely costly and government colleges give you a degree at a subsidized rate, but they're really hard to get into. 

I don't know why I just don't want to attend this private college, which I have been admitted into and I do not want to stay in the same state which I am in right now due to personal reasons. I want to apply to colleges out-of-state. All the other colleges, which I have applied to still have to release their college admission lists, which will come in about two months. 

I have my national level exam later this month. Which I don't think I will qualify in I'm trying really hard, but I'm unable to score well in tests. 

I want to drop out of the private college, which I am currently attending as a backup. 

Because I don't want to waste my year due to corona in case I don't qualify the national exam which happens later this month, I'll have a backup college to pursue the same degree, but I really don't want to go. I don't know how to tell my parents this thing. I feel like itll disappoint them.

I don't know what to do. Should I really drop out of this college and go to some other college temporarily which offers another course in a different state while I prepare for this national level exam and give it again next year or if I should just drop out for a year and prepare for this national level exam on my own at home which I really don't want to do. I could join a coaching institute while I take a drop year.

But it doesn't seem like the right course of action. 

I am really confused as to what to do. I don't want to attend this college which I am currently attending and I don't know how to tell my parents that and I don't know if it would even be the right thing to do.

Heres all the options which I have. 
1. I can either keep attending the college which I am currently attending while I prepare for the national exam and in case I don't qualify this year, I can finish my 5 year degree here. But I am not looking forward to this. This is not what I want to do because I don't feel like this college is the place where I should be. 
2. I can join another College temporarily in another course in a different state. And join an Institute there, which will prepare me for the national exam and give the national exam again next year. But this does not guarantee me getting an admission into a Government College next to year. But in case I'm not able to qualify I can finish my degree in this new college, which I might be attending and then reapply for law for a 3 year course after I finish my initial bachelor's degree. But this would also require me to give the national exam after I finish my bachelors degree. Which would be tougher than the exam ill have to give this month.
3. I can take a drop year, stay in my own state and prepare for this national exam without joining anything else except the coaching institute and stay at home for another year (which i really dont want to do). But again, this does not guarantee me qualifying in the national exam next year and I might have the chance to re apply to different better colleges next year which I didnt apply to this year. But this is also something which I'm not looking forward to because I don't want to stay in my current state and home anymore.

In a way college is my Escape. 

I'm really confused what to do. Should I drop out of the college which I am currently attending because it was meant to be temporary in the first place. But what if I don't get admission anywhere else, even if it's temporary admission in another course. I don't want to take a blank year while I only study for law. Everyone is also advising against it. Please help me figure this mess out.

P.s. Why I'm talking about pursuing a degree in a different course and applying to a law college after I finished that degree is that in my country at high school graduation level you only have one option which is to apply for a five-year integrated course of your two/three year bachelors begree and the three year law degree.

Suppose I was already out of school and already had a bachelor's degree. I would be able to give the national exam again, but at a higher level which would grant me admission into the three-year law course. So technically I can pursue a degree in a different course for three years temporarily and then apply to a three-year law course through the national exam, which is compulsory for admission into a government college at any phase whether it is a five-year degree, which you are pursuing or the three-year degree. You have to take the national level exam but the level is difficult for the three-year degree. 

I tried to apply to a good private law college aswell but they also have entrance exams and due to my under preparation I did not qualify.

Please help me out. I'm really confused and in desperate need of some help and guidance.",09Sep2020,1

700,"We have lived here for 3 years. Lately, we have been having various problems with break ins to our vehicles, people walking on our cars (literally shoe prints on our trunks and roof), upstairs neighbors smoke coming through vents in the bathroom, leaking sinks creating mildew, it’s starting to smell like a basement, and just over all feeling of being unsafe. 

All of these were reported and nothing was done about any of them. No security measures put in place, no reminders to neighbors about the no smoking policy, and no response as far as the basement smell goes. 

For the first 2 1/2 years we had no major issues and never once made a complaint but things just keep racking up here recently. Monday, I found mold in the apartment. Immediately we tried contacting the property manager and it took two days to get ahold of her. In that time, i set up an appointment to see another place because frankly, i’m over it. 

I understand during normal circumstances that we would be responsible for paying rent until it was leased out. Is that true now? I just feel like with the mold and racking up problems there should be some way we can get out of the lease. Please tell me if I am incorrect in this thinking. I need advice on what I can do to not have to pay for a mold trap until somebody comes along wanting to rent it.

Will we be responsible for rent while they are taking care of the mold issue essentially making it inhabitable? If it’s extensive mold under the walls, would that not take a while to get cleaned up? The mold was found on one wall under wall decor in the living area, it was found again coming from a wall outlet, and a third area in the bathroom closet.

Hours after that I didn't call my parents or the police, I was just in dead shock. Every time I see an old person I get irrationally anxious, afraid that they're going to start dying and I'll have to take initiative and call for help. I don't know if I'll be able to that, I'm almost positive that I'll just freeze up again. I haven't visited my grandparents that are still alive since then, I can't even call or text them.

702,"Should I stay or should I go?

 

Hey all, I wanted to ask for advice on something that has been weighing heavily on my mind recently; I have recently returned from a year abroad in Belgium, and I am now enrolled in an american university. With the recent commitments that I have made (car loan, university tuition, and new job as an electrician), I am starting to feel as if the window to return and study in Europe is closing (if not, has already closed). I want to ask your advice on the matter.

From a financial point of view, from what I have been told (and from what I still have to figure out), it seems to me as if student life in Belgium will turn out to be cheaper than in the United States. My host families informed me that the maximum a foreigner could be charged for tuition would be around 5,000€ per year. Another exchange student who had decided to stay told me that most students are able to find part-time jobs that pay a minimum of 10€ per hour (and that there are higher-paying jobs out there). I am still finding out how much the other essentials will roughly cost in order to put together a rough budget and see its viability.

In the United States, it seems that with my current job, and my hours, I should be capable of paying off the essentials (except for the tuition, I have not set up a payment plan nor run the numbers).

I fell in love with Belgium, and the way of life in Europe. Ever since I had gotten back, I find myself criticizing a lot of aspects of life in the United-States. I feel as if I can’t be impartial in the situation, because all I know how to do is to look at things from a financial point of view, since there has almost always been financial struggle in my family’s history. I don’t know how to think for myself and make decisions such as these on my own. I want to be happy, and even before leaving the United States, I had had the idea that life in the United States (or perhaps around my family) always seemed to be a downer rather than something positive. There is always a new dilemma that occurs in the family that weighs on my mental health, and I feel that if I take myself out of this context, it would be to my benefit. I feel as if I will be happy in Europe, but a decision this big worries me about making the wrong move.

And so I would like to ask you for your advice. What am I not taking into consideration? I’ve dealt with indecisiveness all my life since all of my biggest life decisions were made for me, and so when it comes to this, I want to tell myself “I believe that I will not be happy if I stay here”. Am I wrong?

Thank you for your time and aid in advance.

704,"

I went downstairs today to grab breakfast and to my surprise I saw my car window broken, I was robbed of my wallet with everything license, health card, debit card &amp; hundreds of dollars worth of cash.

I live in an apartment building and there’s a 3 story parking lot and in order to enter that you need a key which only residents have.

A couple days ago (the guy who parks next to me, all parkings are assigned) me and him had an arguement, he said something disrespecting &amp; cussed at my mom, I argued back and he apologized. 

Reason;

1. You need a Fob to enter, only residents have them.

2. My Parking spot is very secure, my cars all the way at the bottom, who would specifically go all the way down onto the last floor and select my car?

3. My car is an old Toyota, seriously, there’s Jeeps, much better cars I can assure you and seriously an old Toyota...

Fast forward a few days the windows broken. The way the window was broken, multiple unnecessary scratches on the door, unnecessarily damaged when no need to scratch the doors.

The robber broke it with a rock, he used the debit card. We went to the police station and filed a report but will they even doing anything?

I am genuinely confused, as a 17 year old I have no clue what to do.

My concerns on can I even do anything? Will the police even be helpful?

Extra:

He purchased something for $300 from online with my card
Did grocery shopping at the middle of the night with my card

At the beginning of the year, she went through a separation with her fiancé and was under a lot of stress. She had to find a new place to live, pick up extra shifts at work, and work out a schedule with her son’s father all the while being a mother to a toddler which is enough of a battle itself, lol. Obviously we weren’t talking often, much less hanging out as I knew she was busy and stressed. I was completely understanding of her situation and just reminded her every now and then that I was here for her and her son and to let me know what I could do to help. 

Fast forward to now, 9 months later and I’ve only seen her 3 times since January and talk to her MAYBE once a month. We used to talk almost daily and hangout at least twice a week so our kids could play together. A few months ago she was excited to tell me she was dating a new guy, but everything else I know about her life is from social media. When I text her, she either doesn’t reply at all or is very short with me.

The other day she texted me to ask how I was doing which I was really happy about, and then she didn’t even respond to me 😅 I’m feeling like this friendship is one sided at this point.

I just started college and everything has been going great. I've met so many people and my classes are awesome. This particular college is in person, not online at the moment. A couple of weeks after I arrived I met this girl who had just come out of quarantine. Instant crush. She didn't really know anybody so I introduced her to a couple of friend groups, but I was happy to notice she always hanged out around me and my friends. 

About a week pass and there's a party one night. I get completely drunk and confident, so I start flirting with her. She flirted back but told me (from what I remember) that she didn't want to do anything until I was sober. Fine with me. She takes me back to my dorm and we watch a show or two. She ended up sleeping with me (not sex or anything). At this point, I figured I was the luckiest dude on campus because she was honestly so beautiful. 

The next morning we watch a movie together and she kisses me. She tells me she's a virgin but wants to have sex. Obviously this is completely consensual, and I asked her multiple times if she was ok with this. She was, and we hooked up. At this point, she asks me the classic ""what are we."" I wasn't really sure, but I said we should give it a few days and see how we feel. 

That weekend I ask her out and she says yes. The date was kinda last minute and I kinda fucked it up. My dad was visiting that day and he didn't leave until about 10 minutes before the bus was supposed to leave for town. She comes out of her room and she looks unbelievable. I didn't actually plan this as well as I should have, and we end up going to the only place that was open in this small town, which was a cute diner. But it was still a diner, and I felt awful for bringing her here and not planning it out. She says she truly doesn't care but whatever. It was still a fun date. We're waiting for the bus back to campus and it's raining a bit. I tell her how pretty she looks and she kisses me. I feel pretty amazing at this point. 

Back at campus, it's still pretty early, so we hang out with some people. One of them asks if we are dating. In my opinion, this was pretty rude because this put both of us on the spot. I wanted to say yes, but I still wasn't sure how she felt. So I didn't answer, which was a mistake. After an awkward pause, the girl says that we're talking. She stays quiet for the rest of the night and texts me to apologize if she sais the wrong thing. I'm back to feeling totally awful for not just saying yes. Or anything. 

Once she goes back to her room, she texts me to say she is a bit overwhelmed from the other morning, and she isn't sure what I want. So she needs time to process. This is completely understandable, but I make it clear that I really like her. She says she likes me too. I give it a week and I ask her out again, although I wasn't sure if that was too soon. She says that she wouldn't see the point in going out since she doesn't want a relationship. She says it as if she's already told me, which makes me think that I misunderstood what she originally said. 

This is a pretty big bummer for me, as I imagine it would be for most people. But then the next time I see her she doesn't interact with me at all. Things are suddenly extremely awkward between us. Which makes the whole situation even worse. Not 24 hours later there's another party and I see her cuddling up with some other dude. And now she's with him all the time. So yeah, when it rains it pours I guess. Obviously I still have feelings for her or I wouldn't be writing this. I'm not sure how much my actions actually impacted what happened and how much is just me overthinking things. Either way, this whole thing sucks, and it's made me pretty upset these last couple of days. 

This hasn't appeared to faze her at all. At least as far as I can tell. She doesn't seem to care that we haven't spoken. Should I make any attempt to rebuild a friendship? Should I be the one to approach her, or should I give her space? Is anyone in the wrong here? Obviously she has the right to do what she wants, I just find it odd that within such a short period of time she went from flirting and kissing me to not talking to me at all. What also makes it worse is that we hang out with roughly the same group. I'm friends with her friends. So I see her a lot, which makes it hard for me to move on. Any advice?

720,"Ok so about a month ago I somehow got an ear infection, it’s commonly known as swimmers ear but I don’t know the actual term. Don’t know how I got it but I did so yeah it sucked. It basically made my left ear go deaf and clogged for about a week or so and it was pretty painful too, puss would leak to which was not really a fun time (sorry for grossness). My mom recommended I go to the emergency room to get it looked at and after a while I reluctantly agreed and went. 

After about a horrible 3 or so hour wait with no contact from anyone I was finally called back to get the help I needed, or so I thought. I had someone give me a bill just to be there which I thought was understandable they bring out a physician and ask me some questions about what was wrong then they check my ear and tell state the obvious to me. I figure after all this waiting I’ll go home with what I need but they hand me a paper (prescription) for ear drops and send me out. So basically they did absolutely nothing. 

I take this to a pharmacy where they tell me this extremely tiny bottle of drops is $350+ and I almost broke down right there because that is a lot for me in this time we are at right now. The lady who was going to sell it to me (god bless her beautiful soul) told me of GoodRX which I really still don’t understand but it can help with medication costs for whatever you may hopefully need (I’m pretty sure she wasn’t supposed to tell me) and the company selling you is obligated to oblige by whatever price they may have set so I was able to purchase it at a 90% discount of $35 and I was ecstatic.  

All is good for the time and with that my infection is gone later that week and life is normal again. Until today where I am hit with 2 different bills from the hospital totaling over $1300+ for them doing absolute nothing for me whatsoever and of course my luck I do not have health insurance at this time.

Tbh, I was written up for things that everyone at my job does, and someone kept ratting me out. Like being on my phone for example. But it’s my fault for not saving my own ass and doing the things to begin with and I recognize that. I’m not gonna say that to a new employer or anything but I learned my lesson.

Basically are school did Dofe and most of my mates signed up. For some reason at the time I did not really talk to them about doing as I wasn’t that interested but would have done it if I knew they were as obviously they would have made the experience. I did not sign up and the majority of them did. At this time I felt very left out due to the fact it was all they really talked about at school and always met up after school for Dofe meetings leaving me alone after school by myself on Xbox or whatever I was doing. As time goes by and are friendship group has formed into a more solid group all the members even if I wasn’t mates with them at the time have all done Dofe together and my other mates at the time who didn’t do it have left school or become more distanced from our new friendship group. I just feel left out like I have missed a massive part of our school journey and it seems like to me that’s all they seem to talk about. It just makes me really regret not signing up and makes me feel like I’m a less valued part of the group because I missed out on this big thing. I’m not sure what I’m expecting people to reply to this but wondered if anyone has gone through something similar and how they dealt with it.",09Sep2020,1
727,"On mobile, sorry for formatting. 

I’ve (21F) never been able to stand up to my family, especially my mom. When I graduated high school I went to college for one semester, changed my major, was gonna transfer schools, then I panicked and just didn’t go. I recently went back to school after telling my mom, “yes I’m going back, I just gotta figure things out first.” 

I moved in with my boyfriend of almost 4 years in December and he’s the only thing in my life that truly makes me happy. I love him dearly. 

I recently brought up to him that I hate my life though. Besides him, I hate everything else about my life. I do have bad anxiety, which could be effecting my decision when it comes to college, but Idk. We had a long discussion about me potentially leaving school again. I have goals and dreams for my life but none of those require a degree, and given how unhappy I am with my life right now, I want to leave college... again. 

He’s totally accepting of this and knows how unhappy college makes me. He’s already a couple years into college, and is set to make a pretty decent wage. He loves me regardless of money, and I love him the same. 

The problem is, I don’t know how to tell my mom. My mom is terrible to me generally. She’s always made me feel as if the decisions I make are wrong, and I’ve never felt her full support in my life. I feel as if since I’m moved out I should be able to do whatever I want when it comes to my future but she strongly disagrees.

So I am thinking right now what I gonna eat tomorrow aftter the treatment. I know that for 2 hours after the treatment I must not eat anything but afterwards I already see myself devouring greasy stuff, like at least 5 Big Macs. 

However, as tempting as this sounds, I heard that after a colonoscopy you get the chance to build up your gut flora/intestinal flora from scratch and even can have a better flora than before if you do it smart. So what to eat after my treatment in order to enhance the gut flora? I was thinking of yoghurt and just plain meat (without sauces, toppings, or side-dishes).

733,"I picked up a restaurant job serving tables during covid and have only been working there for about 4-5 months. It’s a decent job and I make good tips even with covid going on. However, I don’t want to be in the restaurant industry. I’ve been a server for 5ish years I’m sick and tired of it. I actually dread going into work every day and get anxiety about having to talk to tables. 

This job has had LOTS of employee turn around. People get hired and quit/leave after a month or two. I’ve seen about 5-6 servers up and leave after only working there for a short while. I feel since I’m still fairly new there, this is a lot of people to be going through in the amount of time I’ve been there. 

Ive been applying to other jobs all throughout covid to get into more of a medical office which is the career direction I want to be going in. I’d much rather have a 9-5 M-F job it’s more structured for me which I like plus there’s benefits. I recently was offered a job at a company I really like. I decided to take it. But I was so anxious about telling my managers at the restaurant about leaving for a new job that I ended up not putting in a 2 weeks notice. I know this isn’t the best or right way to go about it but I couldn’t muster up the courage to give them a resignation letter. Plus, within the past few weeks other servers had recently just put in their own 2 week notice or left halfway through the shift. I feel awful about it because I ended up just not showing up to my scheduled shifts and didn’t tell anyone what was going on. I have the other job ready to start next week and I’m excited about it but my conscience is telling me I’m a terrible person for just outright leaving.... not sure if I should make amends and tell my managers the truth or if I should just keep moving forward since the damage is already done?  

I don’t plan on using this job on my resume since I was not there very long anyways. It was mainly to make some sort of income during covid. Has anyone else done this before and not given a resignation letter? How did it turn out for you? What should I do at this point?",09Sep2020,1

735,"I (25f) moved in with my mom and stepdad about a month and a half ago. My stepbrother (30m) came to them after a breakup a week later, completely broke and moved in. I'm just in a situation where I need a little help after being unemployed due to the pandemic, and have been saving money when I can so I can make it back on my own. The house has two kitchens, so I pretty much took over the second one and cook for myself every day.

I don't know my stepbrother very well, but I get the impression that he has no motivation to leave. He gets a ride to and from work and doesn't have to pay for gas, he gets all his meals cooked for him, he doesn't have to do his own laundry, he gets weed from his dad, he pays rent way cheaper than any apartment anywhere would be, why would he want to leave? Just yesterday he claimed he didn't have money for gas 4 days after getting his paycheck and his dad just let him take his car without question.

He's staying up in the attic bedroom, and hardly anyone ever goes up there. It's just his bedroom and storage space. I went up the other day to take a box up, and the whole floor reeked of weed. I know my mom doesn't allow smoking in the house, and I feel like this breaks their trust. I'll admit, today while he was still away at work, I peeked in his room and saw a huge tupperware container full of weed sitting on his nightstand. I don't feel good about snooping around, but it confirmed my suspicions that he spends all his money on weed. I couldn't figure out another explanation of why he makes almost $20/hr and somehow still has no money (and little to no debt as far as I'm aware).

Mostly my question here is, should I tell my mom about this? I'm not trying to be a snitch here, but I feel like it's also unfair that he gets a free pass and is never questioned, while I get hounded about not being able to find a job in the middle of a pandemic. Sure he's an adult and can spend money how he likes, but it's directly taking advantage of our parents' trust, money, and kindness. Am I right for feeling this way?",09Sep2020,1

And that's all I've ever wanted for the past 2 years. Flashback to the beginning of this year. I was starting to think I would never get a Girlfriend because I have such low self esteem, but then I met someone in my japanese class. We will call her H. So me and H basically became best freinds on the first day of school (sophomore year) and after about 3-4 months of building up the courage to ask her out, I finally did. And she said yes, and we were together for about 6 months. During those 6 months I was the happiest I could ever be. In fact we were so close to each other I thought we might even be together outside of high school, and she did too. Then Corona happend and we couldn't see each other for months. I was going to surprise her with movie ticks because the movies had just opened up. So about a week before the movie I tell her, and shes ecstatic. And I couldn't wait. I was finally going to see pretty much the only person I cared about at the time(other than freinds and parents of course) But then the day before the movies she calls me crying..... I ask what's wrong? And she tells me.... ""I cheated on you with my X. I was devastated for weeks, H was my literal everything, I treated her as well as I possibly could, and I thought I'd finally gotten over it, but now it's been a few months and I'm back at the start. I know I have people to talk to, but that doesn't help. My only cure for my loneliness now is somehow finding someone that will treat me as well as would treat them.

740,"My dad likes to make a lot of weird noises. For example, I can hear him watching him YouTube videos on his iPad late at night. He also listens to really loud music when he's doing stuff in the garage. Apart from digital noises, he snores really loudly at night. I can hear him from the other side of the house, and I constantly wake up, only to hear my dad snoring. We've tried therapy, medicine, acupuncture, and so much more, but nothing seems to be helping. I can barely sleep well at night, and I'm always in a bad mood if someone tries to talk to me early in the morning.

And then my dad makes gross noises as well. He constantly makes armpit music, and it's so gross when he does that. He belches out loud, stinky burps, and he has really squeaky farts. His farts are so loud, and they sound like a mix between an airhorn, a tuba, and a mosquito buzz. They smell really bad as well, and he farts when walking around the house. He farts even louder in the bathroom, and he uses the bathroom about 90 times a day.

When he walks up or down the stairs, or when he's driving, his just releases so many staccato farts. It's probably the vibration that's hurting his intestines. Who knows?

He is also too casual at home. He walks around wearing nothing but an underwear. He never wears a shirt, and he drinks milk straight from the milk carton. Then he lets out a gigantic rip, and everyone freaks out when he does that. I'm pretty sure he is lactose intolerant.

He slouches when he eats, and he eats with his bare hands. He drinks milk all the time, and he puts his feet up on the table when we eat. He puts the plate on his lap, and he constantly spills food on his underwear, on his body, and on the floor. He doesn't flush the bathroom after he uses it, and he considers pounding his chest and doing armpit music as exercise. He also goes through about 40 rolls of toilet paper each day. Another annoying thing he does is that he constantly puts a lot of salt or hot sauce in other people's foods. Like I would make a PB and J sandwich to eat, and then my dad puts a lot of hot sauce in my sandwich, and then I am spiced out I can't even talk. Or someone would get a cup of iced tea and then my dad pours half a bottle of salt into it. He's so annoying.",09Sep2020,1

I’m not dirty, I’m very organized and am kind of a perfectionist. I help with cooking somewhat often. I do a few hobbies but most of the time it’s kind of hard to do them.

I like to draw, read, I usually would be able to play the violin or keyboard but my violin is too small now and the keyboard is messed up from moving around so much. I like to run but we live in an apartment and the place would echo if I did that.

So I (19m) just got into college a few weeks ago, and I started dating this girl (18f) a week in. I went through a rough breakup a few months ago and decided I wanted to give dating a shot again. 

She’s a sweet girl, and we get along great, but we’ve been dating a couple weeks and I’m going to give it another couple weeks before I decide anything.

I just want to know if it’s normal to date someone for a month or so, and then decide that you just don’t see a future?

I’m young, but I’m very focused on the future and post college life, that’s just how I am. I don’t date people just because it works for rn, I want to see it work in the long term.

The girl I’m dating is great but I just don’t know if I’ll see it working between us in the long term or if we’re a great match beyond light dating. 

Am I bad person if we break up after a month? I didn’t mean to hurt her, I just wanted to try dating and see where it goes with her, and I am a more serious relationship person than most, and rn we mostly just hang out in her room or with other friends, and occasionally go out. We’ve only been officially dating for a while and I just don’t know if I see us working out in a more serious relationship. Am I the asshole for that? I honestly just want to find a great relationship that works for everyone, and idk if this one might be that.

I want to find a long term serious relationship with someone, I’ve been dating this girl a couple weeks in college and she’s great but I’m not sure if I see us as working in the long term as a more serious couple than what we do rn, which is just going on occasional dates and hanging out with friends on campus.

750,"I give a lot of advice on here, but sometimes it's good to get a different perspective.  My wife and I are coming up on 8 years of marriage.  Our first few years of marriage were difficult financially as she was still in college and could only work part time.  The next few years were nightmarish stress-wise, as we both got swept up in career and everything hit all at once.  Without going into detail, it was a *very trying time*, and no matter what we did, life seemed to have it in for us.  Even our pastor was shocked with some of the bizarre hardships that hit us.  We stayed strong together and got through it all somehow.  When the clouds started parting and we saw clearer days ahead, we decided it was time to start a family.

Fast forward to now.  No family.  After two years of trying, unsuccessfully, we consulted with our doctors.  After several thousands of dollars worth of testing, the results were...  *inconclusive*.  I am healthy as an ox, and she is healthy as a... female ox?  As fate would have it, many of our friends and acquaintances started doing baby announcements.  My wife's best friend, who knew some of what we were struggling with, called one night and said she was pregnant.  I watched my wife collapse on the floor crying for two hours.  She didn't want to get out of bed, she didn't want to do anything.  Any time we saw infants or toddlers in public, she would start crying.  Even our parents started making comments such as *""So when are we getting grandkids?""*  It was just a constant reminder that no matter what we do, life will never let us simply have it as easy as others do.  It didn't hit me as hard the first 2-3 years, but these days it is hurting.

We had two instances where we thought we were successful.  I had never seen my wife beam so much since our wedding day.  We went two weeks with inconclusive tests only to get a painful surprise.  I had spent an entire weekend clearing out a nice area where we could put up a big swingset.  We have a beautiful house, land, water, you name it- the perfect place to raise a child.  We're aiming to be debt/mortgage free by the time I am 40, with zero outside help.  Both sides of the family live within 15 minutes of us.  The foundation is there.  

We went back to the doctor back in December 2019 and started 3 rounds of a rather expensive ""solution"" that all failed.  We'd sit in the waiting room surrounded by pregnant couples who didn't look like they had two dimes to rub together, nor did they seem happy.  I go on Reddit and see story after story about accidental pregnancies, abortions, etc.  We go through a local store and see some inattentive parent with a herd of neglected children running around screaming and think *""God, we're right here, you can give us a child and we'll treat him/her right.  We'll raise them right.  We'll protect them, teach them, nurture them.  That's all we want.  Yet, you give this miracle to these degenerates that don't love or deserve them.  Why?""*

The hardest part in all of this is watching my wife break down each month.  She started showing signs of severe depression, which I am helping her out of.  She is now going to the gym and staying active, which is helping, but I know the pain is still there.

We did look into adoption, but decided that it was not for us for reasons I will not get into.  We also looked into grants so we could continue the ""solutions"" without incurring a ridiculous amount of debt, but the grants are specific to certain races and religions that we are not a part of (my my, it's ok when they do it, huh?).

Have any of you gone through this?  I'm curious about this from a male perspective, as I have nobody to talk to about it and haven't shared it with anyone.  My family doesn't even know, nor do I discuss it with them.

I either avoid social situations, or I overthink them for far too long both before and after it has happened. 

Moving on, my mental health has been at its worst over the last few weeks. I finally took a big step to reach out to my friends and family, and seek professional health. I also thought it was a good idea to try and self-care a bit more, see if it would help with positive thinking. 

now, the thing is, I have always been so scared of going to the hairdressers that I have always done my own hair in the house. (And no.... never got good results, but that was still more acceptable than facing the hairdresser). 

My hair 2 years ago was super long and healthy, and with all the damage I done to it, it's now shoulder length and weak. 

It's at the point that, I don't want to damage my hair anymore but I really want to get it sorted. 

So this is what I need, Reddit, how do I go about to book an appointment? What can I expect? What questions should I ask or expect to be asked? What is the process of getting the treatment? What kind of small talk should I do, if any? 

I know that this all sounds like really silly questions, but knowing what to expect helps me reducing anxiety, and hopefully, I can get my hair done professionally for the 1st time ever!

I’m tempted to go back and finish the program, but if there is a second wave I don’t know if I can mentally handle being on lockdown again, alone in a small apartment, wasting money on rent without being able to go to school.

759,"Hi all.

I recently suffered a fracture of my radial head (elbow)

I fell and landed straight on my palm which caused the injury. I’ve been seeing an ortho but I feel like she’s not taking my pain seriously.

Has anyone suffered a radial head fracture from landing on your palm? If so, did you experience a lot of pain in your wrist, forearm, and bicep as well? Her answers are just, “well it could be a hematoma in your forearm, it feels fleshy, and the pain could just be radiating.” Nothing definitive or, “this is normal with this fracture.” Feels very dismissive. 

She did an mri and extra xrays on my wrist and nothing additional is fractured there, but my concern is a ligament or muscle issue in my forearm and not my wrist. 

If anyone has experience this type of injury before I’d love to hear your experience.",09Sep2020,1
760,"So I found an open room in an apartment that perfectly fits my needs. It’s close to my boyfriend, close to my office (for whenever I return), and walking distance to many coffee shops and cafes. The apartment is bright, spacious, dog friendly, and in my budget so it’s the perfect fit. I had been looking for an apartment like this for so long I was about to enthusiastically say yes just when I toured it. 
The other girl living there is super friendly, clean, interested in many of the same things I am. We texted and chatted for hours and we agreed on many basic house rules and things we want in a housemate.

The only problem is she works at a preschool (very high end school in a wealthy neighborhood) and at a fairly nice restaurant as a waitress a few days out of the week. Where we live only only outdoor dining is an option. 
She let me know that she wears masks and face shields, washes her hands, gets tested on a monthly basis, has her temp taken everyday. She has at risk family members so she did mention she’s being very cautious for their sake as she will do a social distance visit with them every few weeks. She also has a boyfriend she sees on the weekends and she mentioned he works in construction and he occasionally travels (by car) for his job. 

I have asthma (my triggers are cold and exercise) and have been cautious but I do still see my boyfriend (he lives alone) and we do activities like hiking, bike rides, beach days and so on. My boyfriend and I both do our work from home. I’m currently living at home and my parents aren’t the most safe, they still see friends on the weekend (all outside but often unmasked), go to outdoor BBQs and have spent time a good amount of time with a friend that works as a driver for public transport. It’s been pointed out that living with this girl might be slightly safer than in my childhood home. I would see my mom often though even if I moved. 
I also know moving away from my parents home will be an extremely positive change for my mental health overall. Being here I feel depressed, lethargic, and sad quite often. 

Overall, Im not sure if her jobs should be something to be extremely concerned with. Some of my friends (who also have asthma) have mentioned she seems really proactive in staying safe and that their own roommates work in bars or go out everyday without doing anything like this girl is. On top of that my schedule and this girls schedule are so different it does seem like our interactions would be at a minimum. I’d be working in my room or at my boyfriends place quite a bit. 

Overall the advice I’ve received has been to go for it but take precautions like ensuring we have hand sanitizer and clean shared spaces (kitchen and bathroom) regularly. 

So Reddit, what are your thoughts? I feel like I’m balancing so many pros and cons but the pros are really outweighing the cons and I need someone to help give realistic and probably more science based advice.",09Sep2020,1

I've known my significant other for 20 years but have been dating her for 2 years officially, total 4 years unofficially.   


I want to propose to her but I have overwhelming feelings and thoughts that people will wonder and question why did he do it so fast. A lot of people got engaged in August and I feel like if I was to propose people would think I am 'stealing their thunder' and people would talk behind our back that we are doing it too fast (we know 5 people that got engaged in Aug that have been dating 5+ years).

I really want to propose to her because I love her and we have been talking about getting engaged, married and our future for such a long time now. We got in this relationship with the idea that we would be moving forward in our lives. 

To be fair, I am not stealing anyone's thunder because I decided I want to propose since August but ran into problems with the ring and my idea proposal idea is a fall setting.

My significant other is saying she is ready, my parents are telling me to get engaged and my best friend as well too. The issue is I am so concerned about what other people (friends and acquaintances) are going to say and think. 

Is something the matter with me? Often I get excited about something and invest a lot of my time into it and then it doesn't play out or it isn't right for me at that time (eg., wanting to purchase a house last year).

762,"My dad has been forcing joining the military (among other things) on me (17). I strongly want to be a clinical psychiatrist and ive wanted to do that for around a year now. I have a plan for college and what im gonna do. I've been looking into doing this for a long time and I think I'm almost certain that this is the career I want to choose. My father was in the military and he keeps trying to luck that onto me. I keep telling him no but he keeps insisting. 

Last night while my bofriend was over my dad got a text from a recruiter from the marines asking for my number. He gave him my number and when I got a text from him, I politely declined. My dad started arguing with me about which branch I should join instead and I kept telling him I dont want to do it. I eventually snapped and told him that I would only do it if I was desperate and nobody would accept me jnto college. He got so pissed i could almost see the smoke come out of his ears while he walked out of the room to go make a rum and coke. I sat there and my boyfriend told me that I was a little harsh which I agreed. I was shaking while i waited for him to come back inside so I could apologize. He walked in and i told him that i was sorry and that I didn't mean for it to come out like how it did. He cut me off mid sentence to say he wasn't upset. I could tell he was though. I walked outside to get waters out of the fridge for dinner and to see if i could get some space from him but he followed me outside. I grabbed the waters as fast as I could and took them in. 

As soon as i walked in the house I started crying because I know he'd never be proud of me because of what i want to do. My brother wants to go into the military to be a pilot but here I am wasting my fucking life. Im still a senior in high school and im already disappointing him. My boyfriend sat with me and rubbed my back and told me that i have to do what makes me happy not him. He doesn't want me to go into the military because he's scared i'll change. I dont want to go in anyways. Its not for me. 

Today about an hour ago, I went to get the vacuum so I could clean my room and my dad stopped me and started talking to me about how disrespectful I was and how if he didn't know me he'd beat my ass unconscious. I started to get scared because no one else was home. He went on and on about how I was dishonouring him and his friends and all those who have served. I told him that he wasn't listening to me because I dont want to go into the military and he got angrier and started yelling at me about how horrible of a father he is. 

I hate how I feel like I'll never make him proud no matter what hobbies I pick up what he's interested in. I can't ever say anything right and when I express my beliefs its always wrong. I dont feel like i deserve to be living in this house. I dont feel deserving of his love. I do NOT want to join the military even though i have no problems against those who are enlisted. How can i make him accept me? If i can't do that how can i cope with him not approving of what I have to do and with me being a disappointment to him?

764,"Hi.

I am studying for my PhD and still live at home with my parents because it’s much cheaper. I am almost 24. I like to drink but I will always do what I need to do in terms of work before I relax with a bottle of wine now and again.

I must admit, I’ve been drinking more since lockdown but I still get everything I need to done. My mom is the same. She is probably what many would describe as a functioning alcoholic. The problem is, once she starts drinking, it’s like she can’t stop. On the evenings when I drink, the story is always the same. My mom drinks all her alcohol and then wants mine.

I have caught her coming into my room many times when she thinks I am asleep, looking around my room to see if I have any alcohol. If I say I am going to the shop, when I come back she will come and ask if I bought any alcohol, and if so, can she have some. If my dad buys us both a bottle of wine, she will drink hers immediately and if I haven’t started to drink mine (which I usually don’t straight away), she will start drinking mine too. 

Today she took it to another level. I have been working all day and my dad bought us both a bottle of wine. She drank hers and went to bed. When I went to open mine, I noticed the seal was broken. I immediately thought she had touched it, but it looked full so I was worried it had been tampered with in the shop or something. I asked her and she said she had ‘checked the seal’ because that’s what she always does (not true). When I took a sip, I realised what she had done. She had drank some of it (probably about a third judging what it tastes like) and then filled it back up with water. This is literally within about 2 hours of my dad buying them.

I don’t know how to confront her about this. There are two main problems

1) I feel like she has a drinking problem.
2) I wish she would respect me enough to not take my stuff and then lie to me like I’m stupid. 

I love her but she is the kind of person who will lie through her teeth and probably go nuts it I even suggest she has a drinking problem. On one hand, I feel like I don’t have a right to say anything because she still goes to work everyday and still ‘functions’. On the other hand, I’m worried about her and I feel disrespected how she constantly takes my stuff and then lies to me. I don’t like how she rummages through my stuff thinking I’m asleep looking for alcohol. If I ever buy myself alcohol, I feel like I have to either hide it, or drink it as soon as I get it because if I don’t, she will take it.

What shall I do?",09Sep2020,1
765,"Me (21m) and my ex (21f) dated for the first two years of college. We were each others first loves, but we both were very young and immature. We fought, madeup, and were on/off but we had an truley amazing connection. We brokeup due to me not trusting her and constantly fighting. We stopped talking after I blocked her on everything because she wud send me upsetting/ argumentative rude texts instead of coming in person to talk. That breakup was 2 years ago and both of us were devastated. During our breakup she wud occasionally send me mean texts about how im a jerk, or her friends wud say how shes moving on. She told everyone i ghosted her even though I clearly explained that im blocking her because she was being mean and i dont trust her or want to date.

I recently saw her at school in april at a mutual friends party. We had a great time a caught up on everything. Shes been texting me all summer saying she still loves me, she missed me, wants to meetup, and needs closure. We’ve talked on the phone and its great when she is being kind and flirtatious. However, she has also been very argumentative trying to twist my words over text, and when I told her the things that bothered me when we brokeup she flipped out and became argumentative and rude. I told a mutual friend she was being mean and she flipped out and blocked me. She unblocked me and apologized. I assume shes argumentative because shes hurt, shes also pre law school so likes arguing.

Anyways, she insisted on meeting up. I said no, got drunk and said yes, only to say i need more time to process my feelings. She got pretty upset and was saying that im manipulative etc for saying yes then no. Which I understand it was a mistake. I told her i dont want to argue over text anymore because it makes me anxious and I gave her some closure about our old breakup, then said to not contact me again. She said she loves me and shell always be here for me. I feel very conflicted. Its been a month and I cant stop thinking about her. I miss talking to her and us when we were having good talks over the summer. Should I meet up with her? She is clearly very interested in me. Am i making a mistake by not meeting her. Any advice would be great. I still care very deeply about her. Ive been trying hookups but cant get her off my mind. I used to love this girl deeply.

Tldr: My first gf ex reached out and wants to meetup. I said no. She has been very flirty, says she still loves me and misses me. I still care about her but we have been very argumentative this summer and she even blocked/unblocked me. Am i making a mistake by not meeting her.",09Sep2020,1

I've been getting my teeth kicked in by life for about 12 months now. It's been fairly non-stop. I've tried my best to not give up or give in to my negative thoughts, but it's starting to really impact my motivation.

I lost a relationship of 3+ years at the same time my grandma was diagnosed with very bad cancer last Fall. My career path was de-railed by the pandemic. While I managed to finish my undergrad degree, graduate school is a giant question mark. No clue what I can do to get the research experience I need before applying to PhD's.

I've tried exercise, reading books, old hobbies that are fun, emailing professors I made relationships with, constantly checking job listing sites, getting a healthier diet, and a variety of other 'productive' things to not lose momentum. I've now run out of savings and haven't found a single job after months of searching. I probably have to take a retail job that pays minimum wage. Which means less time to work on my careers and more depression over yet another failure I've faced this year.

I tried explaining to my family I'm going through a rough patch but it feels like I'm talking to a wall.

771," 

I (M17) suffer from severe cystic acne. It all started 1.5 years ago, when i suddendly went from perfectly clear skin to a face full of puss-filled painful cysts in a matter of days. I decided to avoid accutane (vitamin A), and opted for alternatives.

Thankfully i had an amazing girlfriend at the time, who was extremely supportive, hence allowing me to perserve my confidence till my body responded to minocycline. Eventually the acne calmed down, leaving me with horrible scars all over my face, pink due to hyperpigmentation.

Fast forward to now, my acne has become resistant to pretty much all forms of available antibiotics, and my face is slowly becoming a disgusting hellhole of puss-filled cysts. It is so bad that there is not one place in my face left unaffected, the worst case my dermatologist had seen.

I had been considering my last option, accutane, and after going on a date and having a cyst literally pop, i reached my tipping point. I weighed my options, and after discussing with my doctor, she prescribed me with accutane.

Unfortunately, my parents have heard all sorts of horror stories about depression and stunted growth (although a causal relationship has not yet been proven), and will not let me take the drug and nothing will change their mind.

School will start soon, and I am honestly reaching my limit.

I already learned how to underhand serve and all the basic stuff beginenrs learn, receiving and finger passing. I might sound like one of those people that go around saying they know how to do everything but in reality can't but what im trying to say is that im learning really fast and i would really like to start training more harder and learn more and more, im really taking volleyball seriously.

780,"So I (18F) am in Bath, UK at the minute, and Bath very clearly has a homelessness problem. You can tell a lot of them are addicts, as they sort of act like it. Others just seem down on their luck.

I’ve not given any of them any money, simply because I just carry around a card these days, since using contactless payment these days is recommended. 

Anyway, I’m on my way home and a man approaches me, I’ll say he was in his mid twenties? He tells me his story of how he became homeless, I can’t remember every detail and I didn’t actually hear all of it because it was a loud street. I remember that he got kicked out, he has Aspergers and he can’t get a council house. Essentially, he tried but he can’t get help and he’s been classed as ‘intentionally homeless’ or something. He didn’t seem like an addict to me but he was holding a cigarette butt. He seemed pretty distressed about what happened to him. 

Anyway, he was £9.50 off getting a room at a hostel. I told him that I didn’t have any change on me, he said that was understandable. I could’ve left it at that, but I didn’t, so I asked if him there was a cash point nearby. I told him I’d take out £10 for him. 

On the way there, I asked him what hostel he was staying at, basically just to see if he was full of it or not. It didn’t seem like he was because he brought up a hostel that before coming here, I was looking to potentially stay at. Everything he said about it lined up. 

I took out £10, he thanked me, told me I had a lovely smile and that he hoped someone would do a good turn for me one day too. I told him to have a good night and we went our separate ways. 

I come from a wealthy family, so £10 isn’t a lot for me. I barely did any shopping today too so I technically had money to spare. Growing up my father told me I should never ever give to beggars, but the man doesn’t have a charitable bone in his body. He has no sympathy for people with less money. I’ve been raised to believe people that give to beggars are idiots.

I don’t know, I want another opinion because I feel conflicted about this. I basically did  something I’ve always been told not to do. I did it because it felt right, but now I’m just wondering if it was okay. I’m sure the opportunity will present itself again. Advice is appreciated.",09Sep2020,1

Okay I thought I was crazy my shirts have gone missing at first I thought it was my sister but she said she cant even fit my clothes, then my socks and 2 pairs of underwear went missing.

 I find my window open at night I usually keep it open so I started closing it. It's open in the mornings. I thought it could've been my mom but she said she didn't. I find things misplaced in my room I'm starting to seriously freak out. 

I dont have many social media just Twitter I use daily. Only 3 people fallow me and I know who they are. I swear I hear a camera going off sometimes when I go to get groceries. 

I got a new lock for my window and door today. Also got dark curtains and new clothes. I'm gonna put my phone up recording all night. My friends say it could be my ex from years ago. I went across the U.S to live with my family again. I seriously doubt its him. (We both agreed to fuck off)

I’ve been feeling like this was a mistake after a few months of it now I want him off. How could I nicely tell my uncle about this? I’m at a loss.

ONE  is disgustingly rich, romantic to the point of sending handwritten notes and flowers, owns his own buisness, but very aloof and doesn't text or call much but not cuz he's mean, just cuz he is so far like in the clouds. 35 and would probably propose and have babies soon. but he definitely does look like Sid from ice age with a wig, yes he has a 1970s feathered bob hair, no I don't live in America so this hair is cool where I live but he definatley does look like Sid his eyes are mad far apart. Also I think he's atheist which I don't like! Also maybe takes viagra, and gets very mad at his dog!

TWO is 27, he's so fucking young, he's about to be a lawyer but about to be is an investment because he isn't yet a fully formed man! who knows if he will make it! but he is kind, sweet, selfless and very sensitive! Physically more attractive than Sid the sloth, but still nothing major but I love how he is on the inside. Very comfortable with this one and he makes me laugh BUT I think he may be cheap!!! He sometimes talks about splitting the bill and in my country thats v offensive but maybe he's just literally poor?? Also may not want to have a family soon because he has no economic stability yet cuz he's finishing his second masters. I do love a lot how studied and cultured he is tho! He also believes in god which I do like!

787,"I work in a cafe and there are 3 people contracted to 40hrs (manager and two team leaders). The rest of us work part time and do 15-30hrs

Any time one of us slightly pisses off our manager we end up with 6hrs on the roster for the next week. It's so annoying. For instance I have been working 4 days a week and I've had 3 days off. He said something to me last week about me working this sunday and I asked if I could have the weekend off because I wanted to visit a friend for the weekend and it's my last chance to do so before college starts back. I said I had written it on the calendar, along with tuesday as I have a car thing - 3 days off, exactly what I always do - he made a joke about how its be better for me to stay here and I wouldnt have to waste my money travelling and I reminded him it was my last chance to go for a few months and I can still work friday, monday, wednesday thursday instead of my usual friday monday wednesday thursday. Fast forward to yesterday and the roster comes out and I am off friday saturday sunday monday Tuesday wednesday then I'm in 6 hours on Thursday. 6 hours in the whole week! That only pays half my rent! I found out today then he put another co worker (let's call him dave) in on saturday when he usually has saturdays off (which dave later admitted wasnt a big deal because it's a once off) so dave called the manager and complained saying he always asks for the weekend off because he usually works mon-fri. Dave told me they argued a little then dave came to his senses but I was struck by what he said next: ""ah looks like I'm gonna be getting 6 hours now next week""

It's not right and its fucking annoying, he does this with all of us who arent contracted 40hrs just because he can like some weird fucking punishment or a sick power play. I've said no to plans with friends before because I've been afraid to put down for the day off incase he then gives me 5 days off.

To clarify: I was still available to work the 4 days I usually work, he just chose to not schedule me on any of those days. I was not asking for extra time off I was asking for my day off to be a different day.

789,"I've lived the kind of life that makes you firmly believe that it will throw you a curve ball, when you least expect it. 
I've been blessed in so many ways.. I paint, I sing, I love with all my heart the people that choose or I have chosen to be in my life... 
I wonder, what makes me think I deserve more.
When I was fifteen, my doctor told me I would never have children... Because I hadn't started my period and my hormones were so out of wack, she started me on birth control that had me in a suicidal loop for years- until I realized... Life isn't supposed to be steeped in that kind of misery. 

So I started to live, at 21 I feel like my life started. I felt awake for one of the first times- in a new place, surrounded by new stories and new faces... And admittedly, I was a little on the run- the year of my first miscarriage. 

I keep thinking, I do this to myself. I don't handle my stress well because it all ends up being carried in my shoulders, and the people I love's stress ends up being carried, too.

My fiance tells me I'd be an amazing mother, and that's not something I have to worry about, but I've never been close to mine and it's hard for me to have a picture of what my own motherhood would look like.
He's stuck by my side through five years worth of happiness, tears, memories, and two more miscarriages. If you believe in guardian angels, I'm sure he's mine 💓

I know I'm still young, four years from thirty... But these are supposed to be the easiest years for me to have children, and I feel like I'm missing out on an amazing part of what life can be..
I can create so many beautiful things... But my art will never wake me up in the middle of the night and whisper, 
""Mama, can I have a glass of water?"" 
I can't even wash those little cotton gloves anymore... Because everytime they come out of the dryer they're so tiny and it reminds me all over again that I should have a five year old and I end up crying all afternoon.

Maybe my purpose isn't to create life... Is there any thoughts or advice out there... To make this easier on the heart strings? 

I don't know how to ask for help... But I think I need it right now.",09Sep2020,1
790,"Hi everyone! I think this is one of my very first posts, ever. And it's an important one for me. I need help figuring out what to change my last name too. Potentially all three of my names. I won't disclose my current last name, but my first and middle are Anna Maria (taken from my Mexican great grandmother, also super unoriginal I know).

To break it down, I am going through a divorce from my abusive ex and neither of us want me to keep his last name that I've had for 10 years now. I could, of course, go back to my surname, but my childhood was abusive and traumatic too. I have no interest in taking that piece of it back. 

I am finally taking full control of my life and shedding the trauma from the past. I just want to move on and start over on my own, strong and new. This has been extremely difficult but I'm working SO hard for my own happiness and freedom and changing my name will solidify that start! 

I have no clue where to start, so I need your help. What name or names should I go with and why? I also could use your opinion on how any of the names sound together.

792,"Hello, so for the last few years I have made some mistakes. I am 23 now, but when I was about 16 I made some changes to how I lived my life. When I was a kid (about 8) I had a crush on my neighbour. A girl across the street, but I never picked up the courage to talk to her.  I was a creepy kid who literally stared at her when she wasn’t looking and thought about her all the time. When I was 16, I tried to talk to her, but it backfired horribly. A few years later I started drinking. And sent her some pretty drunk texts, insulting her for reasons I cannot explain. I was dumb and the alcohol was new to me. Obviously a regretted it. For years I spent my life avoiding said girl, but a few days ago I couldn’t help it much longer and apologised to her. She accepted my apology with a friendly tone and we are now on good terms. THIS IS JUST ONE OF THE MANY EXAMPLES OF ME ENDING THINGS ON MY TERMS. 

When I was 16 my grades we bad in school and I was going to be removed from school for failing my exams, but I managed to convince the school that I’ll try harder and stop being lazy. I was the only person who managed to convince the people who worked at my school to keep me on. It all worked out well for me and everyone. 

There are many things I wish to do. I will not stop until all of my problems and worries are in clear air. Any rivalries, any plans mist be completed to my perfection otherwise, it’s not compete in my mind. I will not stop until everyone is happy. Is this a good trait to have?",09Sep2020,1

I have children that will leave with me. I’m devastated that my kids will have to change schools, especially my autistic kiddo because he’s in a great situation (FINALLY) and has good school support people. 


I do not have a wheelchair-accessible van. 


I do not have a job and physically I could not have one. I don’t qualify for disability because I didn’t work long enough. 


I have a cat that I can’t imagine giving away. I love her a lot and she really helps me feel better, like therapy. 


Lastly, I just love him and it’s not my choice to leave. He wants us to break up, he’s just letting me stay while I get a plan put together. He wants to break up because of my disability so I’m understanding but I’m also very hurt and sad. I thought we’d get old together and now I see that we will not. I’m trying to come to terms.

Out of respect for his privacy I still haven't listened to it, but I was concerned that he was suicidal and it might be his info to send someone to find him. 

A couple days ago he said some really odd things that were kind of incoherent? So I assumed he was sleep texting me and told him to let me know when he got up, but he has yet to say anything. Just before that he was mentioning that if he saw my husband he would send him my way, and I said ""I would like that"" because I assumed we were joking and I had been super depressed that morning.

I hope I'm not coming off as stupid and missing signs. I lost my husband in a freak car accident last month, and I'm only 21.

801,"There's 3 of us, sister brother and me. 

For my mum's birthday, we've all come together and planned a weekend in London to see Lion King at the Lyceum Theatre, and a really nice hotel and restaurant as well as a plane ticket and spending money to go and see my aunt. Over all, it comes to about £700, but split between us, it's all good. 

What has really urked me though, is that neither of them have thought of my dad who's birthday is exactly 6 months later. 

I make sure to see him atleast on a weekly basis- unless his on/off girlfriend is there to save people getting uncomfortable as we don't get on(a story for another time.) 

For his birthday last year, I got him a ticket to the Churchill War Rooms in London, as he's an avid history/politics geek. He loved it! We went into the politicians pub The Red Lion and had a lovely meal before going in- over all it was a lovely father daughter bonding day! 

I couldn't really do anything for him at Christmas due to having a terrible tummy bug that wiped me out on the week before the big day (my insane shopping week), so I took my two neices round to see him as he doesn't see them very often. He was alone...again, for Christmas so I always make sure to pop my head in for a couple of hours. 


Neither my brother or sister really put much thought into presents for him, let alone really talk to him and it makes me feel really guilty!

For 6 months my dad didn't get a single check at all or any type of money till he found a job six months later. Fast Foward to 2018 my father pass it wasn't easy at all. My uncle and my grandfather didn't help us out what so ever. They wanted us to leave America and go back to Turkey which happened sadly. We really didn't want to move back to Turkey, but they pressured the crap out of us and my good uncle took us in thank God. I've finished high school last year and moved to Turkey. I've studied Turkish and pass now I can apply to universities. This Monday,  I got accepted to a private school, and its one of the best schools in my field.

803,"Looking to talk to someone who has experience with this. Very personal topic but here goes nothing:

I was diagnosed today with PMDD. I’ve been on birth control essentially since I reached the age of mestruation. I also had excruciating pain, severe bleeding, and complications with migraine disorder. My doctor at the time threw birth control at me and increased the dosage every time I had a problem (which was regularly). Even though I don’t bleed, I was having panic attacks, making bad decisions, and essentially disconnecting from reality around the end of a birth control packs. I had terrible nightmares that bled into the time when I woke up, and frequently woke up forgetting where I was when I went to sleep, all around the same time each month. 

So I finally got a new doctor. I’m not surprised by the diagnosis itself. I just don’t want to go on antidepressants again. I tried them for OCD. I was unhappy. I wasn’t sad either, I was just nothing. And this affects me about four days a month currently (although we had to change my birth control for other health reasons so I’m not sure how bad things are about to get for me). I was wondering if anyone with experience with this could talk to me about what treatment looked like. I know everyone is different but I’m just really nervous about the whole trial and error process I’m about to go through. 

I am also being examined for endometriosis but we are not ready for any drastic diagnostic measures yet, so I would also appreciate any advice or insight on that as well.",09Sep2020,1

I have a sister and a brother both younger than me.
My sister unfortunately suffered a lot in the past .. she got raped 2 years ago and never told us about it until this year, she couldn’t handle the pain and wanted our help ... my mother couldn’t take the news ... and clashes happened but we ended up signing my sister to therapy.. she tried 2 therapist the first one wanted to shove god and believes in my sister’s mind and my sister didn’t have any of it and didn’t take the therapist seriously.. the second therapist was good to her at first, my sister how ever she took it as a challenge trying to read the therapist and lying to him to show that he can’t know her or understand her and that he can’t match her.. I talked to her about it but she didn’t seem to listen..
When she was seeing the therapist, we were going through a financial crisis and we are limited with money , but mom didn’t care she wanted my sister to be healed, my sister then decided that therapy didn’t help her and she didn’t want mom to waste her money on therapy ..
Months go by we tried to be careful around her and tried to make her feel comfortable and then she started to take advantage of it to do what she liked but no one blamed her ... but the thing is what it looks like make u question if she was lying or is she really hurting ... 
my mom started to believe that my sister is keeping some part of the truth about the unfortunate day and that my sister is fine because she is acting fine ...
Now my sister is in her senior year and in our country, the education is so hard people run away from the country when they reach the senior year, when I was a senior the percentage of people passing at my time was 25% of the whole country, it even took my 2 years and a half to graduate..and now it was my sister’s turn .
Mom provided everything for my sister so she could pass from teachers to books to letting her go out 3 times a week to freshen up.
My sister didn’t take the whole studying thing seriously and she failed, my mom was so shocked and betrayed by the failure and gave shit about it to my sister, my sister is an outgoing person who hate to stay at home and lives to be outside for the longest time possible, my mom took that all away and shut my sister in, refusing to talk to her about the situation or how my sister feels, mom says that she is sick of hearing feelings and sadness and she can’t take it anymore and it’s my sister responsibility to get her self out of this situation. 
My sister how ever doesn’t think that it’s her fault and that she is being grounded for no reason, she thought about running away and thinks there is no way to talk things out with mother, I had a long talk with her today about the whole situation and that she is a coward that she is trying to run away from her problems and not facing it ( it may sound horrible the way I said it here but it was a long conversation I can’t sum it up ) she looked convinced and she started to think about what I said, I felt like I really did something to her ... so I went to talk to mom I want them to stop fighting to know where each one of them is coming from I want them to understand both of their feelings but mom didn’t listen to me and start talking that she didn’t do anything wrong and it’s my sister’s fault and she can’t take talking about feelings no more and she didn’t allow me to speak anything and I lost my cool and raised my voice .... when she went out my sister tried to run away and I caught her mid action and I locked the doors and I was really pissed at her and I shouted at her .
She said she was going to our aunts house which is two hour drive from her and mind u it was night ... anyway I didn’t allow her to go and then she went to the kitchen and warned me if I didn’t let her go she will cut her self as she held a knife.. I was filled with rage big time I lunched at her and my little brother who is younger than my sister witnessed this shitty sights and helped me pinning my sister down ... I pushed my sister out of the kitchen and I was really pissed I didn’t know what to say how to fix this how to say the right words how to handle this .. all I could think of is how my mother refused to help my sister emotionally and I’m here and I dunno what to do I can’t talk to dad I’m afraid, he is out of the country and he recently got a job and I don’t want to bother him he has been unemployed for 7 years ... my head is spinning 
My brother cried his eyes out and hid all the knifes in the house and it got me more pissed ... how could she be so selfish.... so I went to her and told her what happened ...
She apologized to my brother and said it was a joke and she didn’t mean it and if she did she would’ve done it ... I felt her grip when I held her... she was serious but let go because she didn’t want to hurt me ... we talked things out and agreed not to talk about this to mom..
My sister says she is taired she can’t handle the pressure or mom and she wants to be away from mom at least for a couple of days ..... I dunno I dunno I can’t understand her or mom why can’t they handle each other why can’t the handle a little pressure why can’t they accept responsibility ...why do they keep running away from it ! Why not facing it why trying not to fix it! I tried to fix it! But I keep telling them that if they want it fixed it has to be from both of them! Not me .. but they see that they r the vicitem of the other ... and I can’t talk to anyone about this ... I need to know how to handle this.. what to say... I don’t want to lose my sister .. I want to help her ... I want mom to listen to me and not push me away .. please what is ur advice, it might sound as if I want to run away from the situation but it’s not the case I want to help to fix it and I’m sick of them not trying to fix it, but I’m always stuck in the middle of their clashes helpless... I dunno seriously what to do.",09Sep2020,1

I asked the facility if i could donate them but they aren’t accepting anything due to covid. I don’t have a sharps container and I wouldn’t want to throw them away bc of animals also It feels super wasteful. I know not everyone can afford to buy stuff like that but I have no idea where to give them away. And I wouldn’t want the needles falling into the wrong hands for obvious reasons :( help pls.

All I do is lay in my bed in the dark and cry. Does anyone have any advice for how to get over a healthy relationship?,09Sep2020,1
812,"We met at a rave saturday, both under drugs. We made out a lot and danced all night there. He took my number and asked to meet me again today at a coffee place at 4pm and we did. We chatted, got to know each other. He was super nice, i cant tell if he is shy or calm. He isnt funny tho like we just chatted about what we do in life, who we are, etc. typical boring first date conversation 😬.

He then told me he felt a connection that night. I told him im rly sorry but that i dont remember anything from that night. He said he knows and its fine. He also went ""sorry if im being weird but i just really like your vibe. You seem like a very happy person to be around and I hope im not asking too much."". I was kind of speechless and didnt know what to say. But i agreed to meet him again.

Thing is im sure it would be fun partying with him. Im not that attracted to him (maybe if he shaves his chin beard hahah). But idk i didnt feel the connection he did. Idk what to do....",09Sep2020,1
813,"This may be long, but it's been one hell of a ride. I (23F) started my very first full-time salary job last year in the role that I wanted. So I was thrilled, and I still feel so lucky to be one of the few to say that after graduating. 

Since then it's been a little toxic. I've had people blame me for not getting promotion because we didn't get along (I thought we got along - we never disagreed, I've always thought we were friends). I've had my manager tell me he had screenshots of a conversation of me telling lies about him, and wanted me to ""take accountability"". These conversations never happened, and the screenshots I later found out to be a lie. The entire meeting I told the truth but was constantly told to confess to something I did not do. 

My role is as an analyst, and since we are a small company I have started to help other teams. As I fill a big gap in them (I am really good with excel, product management, inventory, etc..) so I have been doing quite a few jobs in addition to my own. It's very taxing, but I love to help people so I have never complained. I was hoping that this would help me learn more and become more valuable in the company. 

I have not had any raise, incentive, etc since I started. I know I am underpaid for my role and area.

Today, the head of the company thanked a few individuals for going above and beyond. I was not one of them. I realized that me doing all their work (and the general teams) hasn't been a reflection on me but has been a boost to them as they no longer have to worry about these things. Whereas I don't get the recognition and it's only viewed as a ""favor"". One of my coworkers messaged me and said that I should be on that list, and quite a few people of acknowledged the benefit I have brought to other teams.

I suppose I am hitting a breaking point, because I am so happy to have a role in something I want to do into the future. And my manager, though our pass history isn't great, is one hell of a teacher. I just feel like I deserve more, but don't at the same time and should be thankful I have this job at all... but I do wonder, is it supposed to be this exhausting?",09Sep2020,1
814,"Hello, I (27F) recently got an awesome job with great money, moved into a 5 bedroom (rent) house with my bf (32M) and our two dogs. I’ve got nothing to really complain about other than my Bf works nights so I don’t get to see him most day other than weekends. We still talk and text. As I am new to the city, I have no friends yet. But that’s not something that would’ve ever bothered me - most of the time I prefer my alone time with my dogs. I keep busy, like to workout, cook, have one or two close people that I frequently talk to but recently I’m just not happy. 

With that being said - I’m not depressed. I’m lively with people at work, I like what I do. But when I go home or eat lunch or dinner or even just drive - I feel empty. Is this normal? Am I just adjusting to a new life? Do I feel entitled to happiness? Are MOST people truly “happy”?

I ask this because my bf works a lot more than me (10-12hours) and doesn’t really seem unhappy. He gets upset and frustrated but that’s just venting that we all do. He’s generally just a happy person. He has a couple more hobbies than I do but he hasn’t had the time to spend on those hobbies. Do I need hobbies? Most of time I am too tired after work to do anything except cook, spend time with my pet, workout and head to bed. Do I just need time to settle into a new routine without my bf? 

Thanks",09Sep2020,1
815,"Hi, in June 2019, I moved into a house for my senior year of college. My partner and two friends moved in with me, and the people who lived there the year before left a ton of stuff, including a cat that they previously said they would take or find a home for. Through handfuls of misunderstandings, she became more or less “our cat” (mine and my partner’s. Roommates liked her, but refused to take responsibility under the assumption we wanted her in the first place).

We made plans for a friend of ours to take her when we were graduating, but that fell through and we kept her this summer, under the agreement that our friend would take her as an esa when they moved back to campus this fall. After two weeks of having been moved in, the school somehow denied them approval for an esa and now we’re stuck with the cat again. That we never asked for.

Don’t get me wrong, I like the cat. She’s nice enough with people and not mean at all. But she throws up a decent amount, and she does not get along well with other cats, especially my cat. And my cat wants a friend really badly, but she just isn’t it. I’m honestly kind of resentful of her sometimes because she should never have been our responsibility.

We want to get our cat a friend, but with her still here that’s just not possible. I want her gone asap, but I also want to know she’s going to a good place, and not a stressful home for her.

Can anyone help me understand my options? Like are there forums where I can post about her?

TL;DR: need to find cat a new home asap, but want it to be a good one, not just an adoption facility.",09Sep2020,1
816,"Hello. In about late June I started to get in contact with a girl I hadn’t spoken to in over a year. I found out she moved, and decided to make video dates with her instead. We’ve been doing these video chats since then. I only text her once a week and quickly set up a day for the video date with her, then I get off the phone. 

During our calls, we have a great time with each other and it usually lasts 3-4 hours, it’s honestly amazing when I see her. Now, my only concern is that I don’t know when she’ll be coming back to my town to see me. I’ve brought it up quite a few times, but she tells me she’s not sure if she’s actually staying there or coming back (She lives with her mother). I don’t push the issue. I also can’t really see her until next year when I turn 18, since my parents don’t want me to “chase” her. So for now we can only see each other virtually through a screen.

I don’t want her to get bored or start losing interest. How can I keep her excited? Also she doesn’t text me first, but responds relatively quickly and sets dates easily. Any advice on how to handle this situation would be great.",09Sep2020,1
817,"There is a person I used to be friends with that is incredibly toxic. I stopped talking to her and removed myself completely in late 2013 or early 2014.

She still to this day constantly messages me trying to guilt me, trying to dissect why I am the way that I am (and is completely off). She is an extremely aggressive immature person who will not take no for an answer. I haven't responded until today where i said ""I clearly want nothing to do with you. Do not message me again and move on with your life."" where she responded by calling me a cunt, that I threw away a decent person, and that I'm a lonely bitch.

From my Snapchat chats to my search history. Now, I don't have much to hide since i'm only 13, it's just the usual things, aka wanting a sense of privacy, and not wanting my parents to watch over everything i'm doing on my phone. So i'm watching YouTube on my laptop at my grandmas and my sister tells me that my mom asked ""Who is (friends name)"". Obviously meaning she was on my phone looking around at my chats, and other stuff. I tell her who she is, and 5 minutes later I get a message about how my search history has things about doubting God and being an Atheist.

I have no clue how i'm supposed to talk about this because I am nowhere near ready to speak about it. I checked the screen time setting on my phone and it showed that they were on Snapchat for an hour and a half, safari and YouTube (looking at my search history) for 30 minutes, they were also looking at all my messages, the games I play, and every other possible thing on my phone.

Squirrel kept staring looking out the window for him. He just never came, it absolutely broke my heart. So I took her in and she’s now doing well. 

She and I survived a house fire together in January as well as the general emotional stress we have all been feeling. She has slowly became the centre of my universe. She reminds me of Dad, she helps me get through my emotional struggles. She’s my little sister and I love her more than anyone in the whole entire world. 

I’m in grade 12. Soon I’ll have to get a job or go to post secondary. None of my plans included her though. I would like to go tree planting- but I just don’t know if that’s something I can do now. I would like to go to collage far away, but I’d assume no collages would want her to come along with me.

I’m able to recognize I probably have an unhealthy attachment to her. I just don’t know where to even begin the process of living my own life again. 

How can I include her in my plans for the future? Should I talk to someone about my problems? Should I follow my dreams and go tree planting- even if she’s not there?

829,"So I (27M) am in a fantasy football league with a group of friends from high school. We had our fantasy draft yesterday and there is now big drama with the potential to destroy the league.

The issue started when one of our friends had the gall to decide that work was more important than our fantasy draft and did not attend. So we drafted and let him auto draft. Towards the end of the draft he let us know that work ran late and he would now be able to draft. So we collectively decided to re-draft. We kept the draft order the same. Happy ending right? Wrong.

In the new draft he selected the player who I had drafted in the third round of the previous draft. A few picks later I selected a player (Mahomes) that someone else had selected in the previous draft. 

Now I am being accused of the most serious of charges with the commissioner. They say I cheated because I knew the drafting strategy from the previous draft and selected the player that another team clearly wanted. They are attempting to vacate my third round pick and give away Mahomes.

I cannot overstate how high the stakes are here. My season is at stake. My friendships are at stake. Me having to send another 100 group text messages explaining myself is at stake. Please all powerful reddit provide some clarity here. What should we do?

P.S. I will be using this as evidence to make my case to the league. I am up against all kinds of shadow behind the scenes alliances who would love nothing more than to snatch victory away from me. So my case to keep Mahomes needs to be air tight. Thank you for your time.",09Sep2020,1

Last November I was rushed into hospital resus with severe pancreatitis... Stayed in hospital for a while. My bf at the time visited but none of my friends did. However I can kind of let it go because most of my friends are an hour away... But one friend in particular is only 20 mins away. 

Later in the year I was taken to hospital again with suspected internal bleeding. She lives 5 mins away from the hospital and gets free hospital parking as her dad is surgeon there. She didn’t visit but DID travel a total of 2 hours to see her other friend that day...

I kept trying to make excuses and write it off.... But then a month ago I got a lethal blood clot that went to my lung. Again... No visitors. Including her who was my only friend close by. She didn’t even text me about it. 

It was my birthday when i got the blood clot, she didn’t even see me to drop off my birthday card, she got her mum to (we’re in our 20’s). 

I’ve been so lonely. I’ve had to quit my job from illness, I am very lonely and can’t do much anymore bc of health limitations. All I want is to see friends and not be so bloody lonely all the time. 

I am so tired of feeling so confused as to why I’m seemingly not worth caring about. She’s my only local friend. I have only a couple other friends who live at least 1 hour away.

I’m SO alone, I have nobody so she is the closest of what I have as a friend. So I’m scared to cut it off. But her half being in my life is so painful. It’s agony to get so sick and not a soul except my mum (who I am so so thankful for and love a lot) care. 

Any advice on how to approach the decision of cutting it off? Would I be overreacting by cutting her off, beggars can’t be choosers right??

836,"     First off, I am a very calm and anti confrontational person. Everyone in our immediate friend group knows this and chooses me to make decisions often because I’m neutral or anti fighting on any topic.
**SO** . . .
     About two weeks ago we had a game night with some of us there including my one friend I brought that’s not apart of the group but I felt like inviting the once. It ended up turning into a deep conversation circle where we had a list of thought provoking questions and took turns asking each other and answering honestly. It was super fun and never went sideways.  
     During this, I was asked to admit something that bothers me about myself that others don’t know. I chose to admit that I am insecure about introducing my friends to each other because in the past my friends have became closer without me and cut me out- hence why me bringing my friend that night was different for me but I was trying to be less touchy. I also was asked to give each person at the table a piece of random advice (because I’m so “level headed”). For example I told one of my game night friends that she should stop talking about people behind their backs and tell them herself when there’s an issue, so there’s less on her shoulders all the time feeling like there’s tension or drama. Everyone took their advice well and we moved on.
     The NEXT DAY, I see that the friend I brought along and two of my game night friends are hanging out. I was thinking.... what the hell? I just told them that this is what I’m scared of. They went into town to pickup something and got icecream and everything. Ergo I immediately I texted my game night friend and was like why wasn’t I invited to this thing and why is my friend that y’all just met there? She told me that she didn’t come up with the plan, the other game night friend did and he wanted to get to know her, and it wasn’t her “place” to tell me. Even though I know that’s BS I texted the guy and told him what I felt, within 10 min it was all good cause he understood/apologized and agreed to at least try and include me in the future. The girl however decided to make it all about her. “why are you mad at me?” “why are you blaming me?” “it wasn’t me” over and over. I told her that I texted the guy and fixed it so it was fine and I wasn’t ever mad just a little irritated. 
     Come to find out she had called another girl in our group during the convo and added in the guy as a three way call, and ranted about what I said for two hours. Constant “I get how she feels, BUT why why why why blah blah”. I get it, BUT.. is an oxymoron. Plus she never actually told me herself all of what she said on the phone. I told her that same night that I knew she had ranted to people about my message (I don’t like sitting on things, it’s immature to let things go unspoken and brew so I just got it out there) and I thought it was a bit insane considering when I told her it was all good she said okay and ended it like everything was fine as well. I said she could either call me right then and let me know how she felt without yelling or she could get over it ASAP because my issue was resolved when she told me who was behind it and I fixed it on my own. She chose the latter and claimed she didn’t have any issues and didn’t know what I was talking about, even though her advice the day before was she needed to stop trash talking people and not tell them herself. but whatever, it’s done. 
     Now today (2 weeks later), she’s gone ghost from the game night group, doesn’t message me everyday anymore asking to do stuff and sub posts on her instagram spam account talking about “I’m just tired of this and I want my friends to be good again and I just love everyone and..” blah blah. I myself have gone back to normal completely. Anyone that wasn’t in the call she created also doesn’t even know anything happened. Therefor, she’s created this whole mess on her own and is continuing to instigate it and change how she acts. The next time I see her IRL I plan on telling her how martyr-ish this all is and how she was choosing to make my hurt feelings into her hurt feelings. But I’m not really sure anymore. 
     What would be the best approach? I hate drama and fighting and think this is all so stupid. If she had just said okay when I told her it was shitty she did the thing I just admitted was a sore spot for me then it would’ve been over but she’s blown it out of proportion and brought three people into it.",09Sep2020,1
837," 

I don’t know what to do. 

I decided to quit my stay-at-home job and go back to school in January. I was a web developer so I decided to go into IT and I enrolled in a program that gives me an associates degree in IT and walks me through a handful of CompTIA certificates. If you’re not familiar with tech, these certifications are basically just proof that you know what you’re doing and they give you an edge over those with just a degree. 

This college isn’t like normal colleges. Instead of going by semesters, we take course by course individually. Each course lasts a couple months. At the end of each course there are two exams. A Final for the associates degree and a “vendor exam” for the certification. Every time one course ends, another course begins immediately. There are no breaks. 

Anyways, before COVID, I was doing alright. I was in the first course for my first certification. I had passed the final and I attempted the first vendor exam. I had two free attempts and, from there, I would have to pay 200$ for each attempt after that. I did not pass the first vendor exam and exhausted my 2 free attempts. The day after my last attempt, the COVID stay at home order was issued in my state and everything fell apart. 

My classes where now online. I am not the kind of person who is successful in online courses. I know it sounds stupid but I am the kind of person who needs a whip at there back and an obligation to be on campus and a quiet place to work away from where ever I live. As far online classes go, I might as well not even be attending because they easily fall by the wayside. COVID exacerbated my tendency to procrastinate because it caused a world of problems for me. 

I was staying with my Dad’s family because I had broken up with the partner I had lived with for 3 years. At first, things where alright but when the stay at home order was issued, my Dad’s wife forced him to ask me to leave because she thought I would spread it to her and her children. My dad didn’t want to ask me to leave but he had no other choice because she’s a mentally unstable banshee and would probably never let him hear the end of it. So I was left to couch surf for 6 months. 

I stayed with my boyfriend for the first 3 months and I had to go back to working minimum wage to pay the bills because I couldn’t find new clients who needed web development . My services cheap but I can’t exactly get a decent “real” webbed job because of my lack of degree. Meanwhile, school fell by the wayside. 

By the time the next course had finished, I again passed the final but I did not even attempt the vendor exam. I bullshitted my way through the last course because all exams are online and I was so caught up with my real-world issues that I couldn’t find time to sit down and focus on my studies. I also procrastinated heavily because online courses don’t really command enough of my focus to get me to stay consistent. The fact that all my exams where now open-note, open-book and open-internet made it easy to bullshit my way through every unit test and final. 

I can’t bullshit the vendor exams though. CompTIA exams (and most other tech certification exams) require one to go into a testing center where there is a camera fixed on a designated work station made available to take the test. This is the only way one can take the vendor exam in order to get the certification because its a way for CompTIA to make sure you’re not cheating. 

I am supposed to have 2 certifications right now and my 3rd certification exam is coming up. I studied hard on my first certification but I was too apprehensive to pay for a third try and the next course was starting so I told myself I would come back to it. Mid way through the second course, life took a turn for the worse and the whole course went by the wayside. I didn’t study. I didn’t read the book. I only turned in the homework and took the unit and final exams. All of which I cheated on and used the internet to copy and paste answers. I didn’t take the vendor exam because I KNEW I couldn’t pass it. I didn’t know shit, I cheated. 

Now I’m working on certification 3 and the same thing is happening. I’m procrastinating, not reading or studying and cheating on my assignments and exams because its easy. Technically, I’m doing alright but I’m behind on my certifications. All this bullshit has snowballed so hard and I don’t know what to do. I’m 3/4ths of the way done with my 3rd certification course and I’ve gone and done the same exact thing. 

I have let everything spiral out of control so hard that I don’t know what to do anymore. I have so much reading and studying to do that I feel too overwhelmed to do any of it. Honestly, I’m so overwhelmed that I am considering quitting the program all together. I feel hopeless. I don’t have any organization or time management skills because I didn’t give a fuck about high school and I spent the subsequent 6 years afterwords working. I never learned how to study or succeed academically. Like I said, I am the type of person who NEEDS a whip at their back in order to be successful so my online courses are absolute bullshit.

What the fuck do I even do at this point??",09Sep2020,1

846,"I (24F) started a new job in June, and I'll start by recognizing how fortunate I am to have a job right now, period, especially one that allows me to work from home. I have been working remotely since I started, and even the interview process took place virtually because the pandemic had just hit when I applied so I've never met any of my coworkers in person.

My role requires a decent amount of collaboration across departments, so while my immediate two coworkers that are technically part of my team are pleasant enough, most of the people I've been trying to forge working relationships with are sometimes cold and unhelpful. Additionally, my position is a new one, so it's not like I replaced someone else that they knew but I'm just a new entity overall so I believe part of the issue isn't just about me, but comes from not having a precedent to compare to. My boss recognized that our company's onboarding process is lacking, and having to do it remotely has exacerbated that. The functions of the job itself are fine, but I feel like anytime I try to take initiative with a project or ask a question I get met with some unrefined version of ""that's not how it's done here."" Being a young woman in a somewhat junior position also does not help establish me as well as I'd like. Part of the reason my role was created was to counter inefficiencies (so hard to give context without going into detail lol), yet every time I try to point out ways of improving I hit roadblocks with my colleagues. I've expressed this to my boss, and typically he has responded with suggestions on different tactics to use, but finally the last time I shared my frustrations he  recognized how futile these efforts are because of the stubbornness of others. Beyond an unwillingness to meet in the middle, in many meetings my new coworkers don't even bother turning on their cameras so I'm just talking to a total stranger without ever seeing their face. I wouldn't mind this if I'd at least been able to meet them once beforehand, but I've never seen these people before. I live in the Northeast where people are notoriously curt and not the nicest, but I'm feeling that coldness much more now than I ever have in my whole life living here.

While my boss and the other woman on our team are ok, I still feel like I'm lacking a normal relationship with my coworkers (I mean, obviously, since we're in a pandemic after all). At first when I was hired, we had a mini trivia game on Fridays with a small group of us, but that has dwindled throughout the summer. It sounds lame but those 30 min on a Friday afternoon helped me connect to my coworkers in a way that's nearly impossible while working from home. 

I realize this post is very vague, but I'm wondering if anyone has advice on unpleasant coworkers and how to break down walls that WFH has created in terms of meeting and collaborating with colleagues. Any advice is much appreciated.",09Sep2020,1
847,"I'm young so maybe she just doesn't respect me bc of my age or automatically thinks I'm dumb bc of my age. She appeared to be like 35. I did some yard work for her and her husband. I did 2 hours last Thursday and again 2 hours today. I had to ask her if I could come back later and finish bc my parents came back too early to get me and I couldn't stay longer as I didn't have my phone with me and had no way to get a taxi back home. She said ok. This was like 3 hours ago. My parents dropped me off this morning and they met her. 

And 2 hours ago I txted her my cashapp info I said ""Hi. I'm sorry I had to leave so soon today but I finished raking and pulling weeds up. If you want to pay me half today that is alright and just pay me the rest if you still want me to plant for you as well."" 

I was supposed to get $85 for the whole job bc their yard is pretty big.

849,"To make an extremely long story/anxiety spiral (somewhat) short, I used to be a nursery school teacher (did undergrad in early childhood studies). I then went into the non-profit world because I wanted more mental stimulation and it seemed like it could be a good fit. I've been at it for a few years and, aside from the fact that the non-profits where I live are very toxic environments, it turns out I SUCK at this type of work (roles have been admin and fundraising). It's pretty demoralizing.

I'm not trying to be down on myself but it's important to be realistic and I'm just straight up NOT a business person/good at selling causes to stakeholders. I DO have very high emotional intelligence. Now I feel completely at a loss for what to do with my life. I don't want to be in the non-profit world anymore, and my current P/T role at a non-profit finishes at the end of the month. I also have a part-time data entry job at a for-profit company, which also ends soon. I like the idea of the latter job because I can work from home/work on my own and not have to deal with people for the most part and they treat me better at the for-profit job.

I feel like I should just accept my reality which is that I am good with kids and much more suited to teach, even if at times it's tiring or understimulating. OR do I try to work my way up at a for-profit organization like the one I'm at now, doing... I'm not sure what.... more data entry? I've explored so many career options and want to do something meaningful and that I'm good at but also worry that I will go back to teaching and completely regret it and feel bored. Maybe jobs get less ""boring"" once you are really good at them and have been at it for a while. I'm not sure if there is some middle ground between the two jobs that doesn't involve non-profits.

850,"Hey I’m 18M and will be moving to university in a few days. The thing is, once I get there, I plan on completely seperating myself from my parents who are abusive. Since I’m officially an adult now (from the UK) I can now be independent. However, I have just been feeling very confused and stressed out these past few days thinking about this. I feel like it’s a selfish decision because they’ve provided me with a lot of things to start university that I’m grateful for such as a brand new laptop and phone for uni, yet have been the biggest contributing factor in my depression and anxiety. 

Since I was 15, I would have meetings with school therapists that I would attend behind their back, cry myself to sleep a lot of nights, have panic attacks and anxiety and I’m just terrified of them now, especially my Dad. I realised at a very young age that I had no love for him, only fear/ hate. He’s a big man who is very aggressive and loud compared to me who’s very quiet and weak. My mum however, has been a mix of love and fear/hate too, especially these past few weeks. They are both also very strict. My Dad has walked out on us (me, my mum and siblings) many times these past years, especially due to abuse, yet my mum would always beg for him to come back which always confused me and angered me. A few weeks ago, he got arrested after a neighbour called the police because she could hear him beating my mum and my brother too. When this happened, I thought this would be a wake up call to my Mum to completely cut him off, me and my siblings spent countless days and nights crying and trying to convince her to separate him. And yet after all that, she still allowed him back in after he was released by the police. When she did this, I think that was when I lost the love for her. We all live under the same roof and things have been difficult for me. I try to avoid them as much as can and I can’t even look at them the same way. I’m just so tired of having to walk around egg shells 

Now my dilemma is whether I should cut them off completely or not?? I feel like I’m being selfish and ungrateful because I know they’ve done so much to raise me and provide for me, yet they’ve hurt me and fucked me over so many times and now that I’m an adult and going to university, I should take this opportunity to cut them off and finally be happy. This is one of the main reason I wanted to go to a university far away from home. 

We have this thing here in the UK called Student Finance where the government provides us with money to pay back later in life and they have given me 7k which should last me the year as I look for a part time job. My Dad even told me that once they send me my money, I should send all of it straight to him. This scares me because I know he’s already become controlling over my things again, even when he will be so far away. I really just want to be happy and have freedom and feel relaxed. I have no one else to to tell this to, any advice would be very kind thank you.",09Sep2020,1
851,"I don’t know if I like the path I’m on...

I am a junior at a fairly prestigious university. When I arrived at my university as a freshman I felt invincible, like I was about to embark on some journey that would create some amazing career for me. I started out as a pre-med student planning on majoring in biology. Throughout freshman and sophomore year I had all of these doubts about whether or not I was a good enough student to get in to med school. I had these fears that I would be back with my parents at home after I graduated with no job and rejection letters from med schools. I was and A and B student but somehow the pre-med culture and this idea that the biology degree meant nothing after I graduated made me switch to something safer. I am now an information science major only because I thought it was a safe option. However, I have no interest in having a career that is centered around computers. 

Its hard for me to get excited about software development and just about anything in the corporate world. Science and art have always been the most interesting subjects to me. I am now committed to this major and it’s probably too late for me too finish the medical school prerequisites or get a degree in a field I would enjoy more. 

I feel like I haven’t been true or honest with myself about what I enjoy and find interesting. I’m now at the point where I need to look for internships and work opportunities related to my major. It sucks looking at the internships (IT, data analysis...)  and not being excited or interested enough to apply to them.

I love learning about science more than just about anything and I feel that I have lost my opportunity to find a career in a science related field.",09Sep2020,1
852,"Throwaway account since I don’t wanna get fired. So I work at a small studio that does local commercials, videos, reality shows that need equipment, etc. Recently we did a shoot where a local celebrity was winning an award and it was live streamed on a national scale. The client called us in to set up the shoot and stream his thank you on television for the network. 

Well, come to find out, my boss recorded the whole thing. Nobody asked us to do that. He did it in secret. My coworker tells me he does this a lot. He’ll be running video village and will secretly record the footage second hand through the monitor and keep it. I’m assuming he does this for future clients so he can have something to show, or potentially for a reel to distribute, though I don’t imagine he’d do that because he might get caught. 

He came in today and asked me to dump the footage onto a hard drive. He acted all shifty like he knows what he’s doing is wrong, but doesn’t think I realize that.

854,"I have alot I want everyone to know so I'll basically write my life story.

First let me start by saying that I was very shy and timid throughout the majority of my life. My mom says that I didn't even speak until I was 6 or 7. I was weak and introverted (this will be important later).

I don't remember most of the time I spent living with my biological parents but remember it was pretty ok. I just went to preschool and spent time with my sisters. I don't think anything worth mentioning happened.

I was around 4 or 5 I think when my biological parents divorced for some stupid reason apparently my dad rented out his car to guys who used it to break into a house, but that's just what I was told. After that he went to jail for 2 years. After those 2 years me and my sisters would visit him every other weekend.

 I don't remember how long it was after that but eventually me, my mom, and sisters moved in to my soon to be stepdad's mom's house and stayed there for a few months I think (I don't remember much of that either). Then they got married and we moved to a house in another suburban neighborhood.

I think I was in 2nd grade at the time. I was difficult at first but I made friends at school and with my neighbors, which was a kid about my age, and one a bit younger, then later another family would move into a house down the street and I would become friends with a guy that was my age, if not younger. I don't remember how old everyone was exactly but we all went to school together to after school we would usually hang out like ride bikes, play video games, jump on our trampolines, pretend we were to people in the video games we played, among other things. Life was actually pretty good at this point compared to living with both my biological parents. Only my stepdad was a bit mom. I always heard them arguing and my mom says he hit her. After I graduated 5th grade they divorced and me, my mom, and sisters moved into an apartment where we stayed for like 1-1.5 years. 

I spent 6th grade at a school in a low income neighborhood. It was terrible. There were fights everyday, and unbearable people almost everywhere. In home ec we learn how to take care of babies. IN SIXTH GRADE. People started talking to me and we would become acquaintances. Other people just bullied me. Outside of school all I did was play video games. I had no life, went to a terrible school and did literally nothing. All I knew was school and friends. I never had any hobbies. My mom noticed and started talking me to therapists and psychiatrists. I got diagnosed with depression. Then anxiety because of my fear of school and the future. I didn't tell anybody anything though. My mom always spoke for me. After that I had to start taking antidepressants and anti anxiety pills.

After 6th grade we all moved into another guys house in a suburban neighborhood. He and my mom later got married an we would be my second stepdad. I started going to a different school. It was better, but still not good. I would make friends later though. I was still going to doctors and not speaking for myself. My mom got me diagnosed with several things like ADHD, ADD, Aspergers, Borderline Personality Disorder, and maybe other stuff. The cycles repeated for years until I started doing school online because I didn't want to waste time at school. Me and my mom just told my pediatrician to tell the school that I have BPD and a teacher would come over twice a week. It was literally special needs. That was in 10th grade. I'm in 11th grade right now.

I now 16 and after spending time on the internet, reacting to society, and being changed by environmental factors I am finally developing some beliefs, interests, and a personality. I haven't taken my medication in like half a year. My mom doesn't know that though. She has always forced me to do drugs instead of fixing my life. I'm really starting to hate her. She says she's helping me but she's just being abusive.

Anyway I have a couple years until I move out and cut ties with everybody but I keep thinking about what I should do. I have some options.

Option 1: I tell my mom I hate her and don't want to see her again. After cutting ties my family might hate me but is it better than them being worried?

Option 2: I leave without saying anything. I'm not sure how I'm going to take all my stuff with me. Worse case scenario is I'm reported missing.

Any other options?",09Sep2020,1

How do I get into the habit of being more productive?

Hi guys...

I’ve wrote a post similar to this before trying to get some insight.. and I feel completely trapped and just so down right horrible with myself.

I want to start off by saying I am NOT looking for sympathy in any sort of way, I don’t want a pat on the back for changing because I know what I have done in the past is very wrong and I don’t deserve any praise out of it... obviously. 

Let me start by saying I am 21 yrs old.. female who is white. When I was in my teens.. and quite honestly until last year I was completely immature &amp; my friends and I would use racial slurs a lot of the time towards one another because we were completely dumb and also down right ignorant. I distanced myself from that friend group and stopped using that type of language. Months ago I started dating a girl who is of color and it’s been the best relationship I’ve been in yet! The only problem I have is that she doesn’t associate herself around people who use that word... obviously. But I feel as though I really need to confess. I have confessed and told her I used to use that word, and she was like well every white person has been through that phase...
but I’m scared she thinks I was 16 and not 19. I’m scared if she knew the truth she wouldn’t want to be with me. 

I suffer from OCD badly so my intrusive thoughts on it are terrible. Does anyone have any insight? Do I tell her the EXACT truth even though I already told her in some sort of way? Or do I just let it go... thanks for any advice.",09Sep2020,1

I (18F) am going into my freshman year of college as a D1 track and field walk on. I usually love running, it’s my passion. Although, lately I have been absolutely hating it. I enjoyed high school running and simply just running on my own because I didn’t have any pressure on me or being paranoid of losing my spot. 

I also have been very depressed lately. This year my dad passed away and that sent me into a deep hole that I feel like I will never be able to get out of. Also, the virus just put the cherry on top of an awful year and I haven’t been the same since.

866,"For most of my childhood I’ve had trouble making friends because I was pretty shy and quiet. Idk why either, which probably lead to some of my current issues now in life. However, from what I can remember I made a very good friend when I was kindergarten. I know back then friendships aren’t as meaningful but I seemed to be friends with them all the way until 8th grade, which kinda broke me because they were my only really good friend. They ended up leaving the school so I basically didn’t have anyone. In addition to being lonely I think I had low self esteem issues starting in 7th grade which didn’t help the cause. After them leaving, I stayed another year (freshman in highschool) then left for online school cuz it didn’t matter to me at that point since I was in a depressed mentality. However, during that time during online school I was able to work a little bit on myself and motivated myself to exercise and be interested in a healthier lifestyle. This helped me to come back to physical school in my senior year because I wanted to play soccer. While this wasn’t a really good mentality, I decided my goal was to only play soccer and not really engage on the social aspect side of it, which worked fine but psychologically not really. During one of my last few soccer games, surprisingly, the friend came to cheer us on. However, I couldn’t really handle seeing/talking to them cuz all I could think of how they basically left me, even though it wasn’t their fault. And so after the game I basically left cuz I was too much of a wimp to even speak to them.

870,"So I've been working, well was working, at this place for about 3 months. Throughout the time I worked there, the owner of the store constantly nagged at her employees and nothing that we did was ever enough for her.

I got a text not too long ago that said, ""I just want to inform you that your services will no longer be needed at blah blah blah ... owner"" .

893,"My mother died in March 2020. This is in Ireland so the body stays in the home, in the coffin, for three days and nights before the burial.

It is customary that the body is never left alone and so people must volunteer to sit up all night in the room where the deceased is. One of the nights me my brother (favourite brother) my two best friends one of whom is also my cousin and my GF who flew home from France to be with me decided that we would stay up. We were just chatting away and it came to be about 3am and my GF wanted to go to bed so I walked her up to my room as I had to give her a phone charger after which I came back down to the wake room to rejoin my brother and two friends.

Last week I was speaking to one of these friends and he mentioned that my brother ""got me a good one"", it's what an American would call roasted me. I said when and what? He seemed to think the following was an innocuous story and just a silly joke as he told it so casually. He told me that when me and my GF went to my room that the floorboards were creaking in the silence of the night and my brother said ""wow if that's the noise they make walking around imagine them going at it (having sex)"". And they all had a laugh at this. Now I'm a pretty heavy set guy and my GF was at the time but is healthy weight now so I assume the joke was a fat joke.

So he told me this and I was like what... I couldn't believe it. Like, first of all if its just a harmless joke why was it said behind our backs, obviously that would have been superawkward and offensive to both of us, couple that with the fact that my favourite brother and my two best friends are laughing their assets of at me while my mother is downstairs in a coffin. Honestly I'm just in shock and I'm so angry I just feel like never speaking to any of them ever again.

My friend brought this up again a few days after and I said yeah I don't wanna hear that I'm really not happy with that. The casual way in which he told it mad it seem like not a big deal so I didn't react badly in the moment when he told me but now I'm fucking fuming tbh.

902,"Hi

So this is actually my [23/f] first ever post on Reddit, apologies if I do something wrong. I’m desperate to move forward with my life but I can’t take the next step I know I need to heal.

I sit crying while I write this because I’m so desperate for help, but I can’t push myself to take that next step. So I guess I’ve turned to reddit for help and for the anonymity.

I don’t really know what to say other than I grew up with an emotionally abusive father and also got out of an emotionally abusive relationship a year ago. I feel like a shell of my former self and it’s heartbreaking. I used to be a hopeless romantic, a glass half full, perpetually optimistic bubbly girl who had everything to give to everyone. My friends used to call me a sunshine, but it’s completely shifted. I’m completely disconnected and numb. I have panic attacks regularly and have occasionally resorted to hurting myself a little as a way to calm myself down from them (I don’t understand it either, but it works), can’t handle any form of confrontation or yelling, I have a totally warped view of what a parent/partner should be like, I have gaps in my memory, I have total breakdowns if I so much as slightly upset anyone because I’ve learnt upsetting someone else results in either being kicked out or screamed at for hours (aka the worst thing imaginable for someone as terrified of confrontation as I am now).

I’m out of the relationship and will be out of the house with my dad in in a few months (corona depending). It’s taken a little while, but I see now how much these have affected me and know I need to do something to fix myself. In addition to this, I’ve noticed my brother taking on some of my dad’s tendencies and recognised I’m similar in one or two ways, but I straight up refuse to become him.

I’ve considered online therapy for a while. Though I live in the U.K., I don’t have the time to wait on waiting lists as I’m leaving the country soon, so I’d have to go private (which I don’t mind). Online would be best because of corona and also I don’t drive.

I’ve found a therapist I think looks good. Not too expensive, qualified, experienced, seems approachable. But I just can’t take that next step and book an initial consultation. One of the side effects of what happened to me is I’m constantly second guessing myself. I’m convinced she’ll turn around and tell me it’s not that bad and I just need to get over it, or I’m doing the wrong thing. I feel like I need this, but I also feel like I’m wasting her time. I’m also not good with new situations, so the thought of the unknown also isn’t really appealing.

If anyone has any advice on how to get over this fear and actually take that next step, please drop it below. Or even just drop testimonials if you’ve also had therapy. I don’t know. I’m just desperate to get better.",09Sep2020,1

I was basically really lonely because of quarantine, and I found an online chatroom where I could basically sex text people from my phone using my browser's guest mode. This is it: [https://onlinefreechat.com/c/sexchat/](https://onlinefreechat.com/c/sexchat/)

At first it was okay. I got a bunch of messages right away just because I was a girl, and that attention felt good after so long in isolation. But around my second chat, I gave away my location (only the continent) and this guy began to specify my country, and some of my physical features that were VERY particular (skintone, eyecolor, etc... I have certain physical features that are rare among the country I live in and its racial demographics.) 

This was really weird because: 

1) my country is literally one of the least... *remarkable* ones, so it was so weird that he knew this  
2) I've NEVER shared photos and videos online connecting to things I've revealed on this chatroom, AND this was only my second chat on the forum, meaning I hadn't given anything signficant away yet

Basically I kind of freaked out, gave a fake location, and then stopped responding. At this point, the only answers I can think of for this interaction is: 

1) someone who recognized my texting style that I know personally just happened to stumble across me and decided to see if it was me from irl  
2) someone tracked my location or something

I'm more worried about the latter... and this brings me to the major question of whether someone can find my IP address, hack me, etc from this chatroom... the privacy policy and other disclaimers state only the company can get this data, but what do you guys think? 

Am I overreacting? If I'm not, is it more likely that it's someone I know irl? Is that website safe to use again?",09Sep2020,1

914,"Hi - I just moved to AZ this past March living with my parents from CA. My parents are not happy here so when the lease is up next year, they're going to move to TX. I'm not sure if I should follow and find my own place there or stay in AZ in my own place. 

I'm 27 years old so it's a goal of mine by January to have moved into my own apartment. The only reasons I'd stay in AZ is because I just registered my car and got an AZ license already and I've also gone through a painstakingly long journey of changing my insurance license from CA to AZ.

Reasons I'd move to TX would be just having family next door or even a couple hours away from me for safety and health emergency reasons. I also have a cat that I wouldn't trust with a stranger online when I go on vacations. 

I'm on the fence because my CA job actually allowed me to work from home in AZ and I'm scared to ask for the same courtesy from them again to move to TX as if they'd say no. Even though everyone is practically working from home now and I feel that I've proved my capabilities to work from home without distraction. I also feel like I'm not an adult if I keep following ""mommy and daddy"" everywhere.

920,"  My (M24ish) coworker will not stop texting me and trying to trick me into going on a date or hanging out with him. I’m 19F and i’ve told him multiple times over the past 2 years that I don’t like him that way and that I am IN NO WAY INTERESTED IN HIM! After the last time he told me he likes me and all that shit I explained to him that I only saw him as a friend, even though at that point I didn’t want him as a friend and he really started creeping me out because I noticed him just staring at me at work. 
  
  After that he left me alone for a while. But the problem is an old coworker who already quit from our work place gave him my phone number a while before he started obsessing over me. The other week at work, after going months ignoring him, I was forced to speak to him because a problem occurred and we needed to fix it. Now I guess he thought that meant I like him?? So he’s texting me again and it’s everyday around the same time. 

 I’ve already been ignoring the texts after I realized he wasn’t trying to be friendly he just wanted to manipulate me into dating him, I just wanted to know if there’s anything else I should do to try to get him to stop. 

Unfortunately I have to do some shifts with him and I’m already dreading next week because I have an 8hr with him so I dont think there’s a way to completely stop him from speaking me, which sucks because that’s the only thing I can see working. He’s very pushy over texts an stuff but is quiet and likes to stare when we do actually work together. All around he makes me uncomfortable. 

I don’t want to quit my job because I’ve been there for 3 years, just got a raise, and I’m finally comfortable with all of my coworkers, besides him of course. I really just hate this situation because I’ve made it clear to him that I’m not interested but he keeps at it and I’m very frustrated and don’t need another reason not to want to go into work.

925,"I'm currently a junior nursing student in college living in an apartment with 3 roommates where we each have our own rooms and bathrooms. I lived with 2 of these roommates last year in my sorority house where we all shared one room. When we first began living together we had no issues at all and were very close friends but after winter break last year, one of my roommates came back and seemed constantly irritated with everything I did. That's when I noticed things were starting to change with her.

About a month in to spring semester, she woke up to my alarm one morning and seemed extremely distressed. She told me that the alarm had caused her physical pain. I was confused because I had been using the same alarm all year but apologized for the trouble. For some background: I am a heavy sleeper but I was very cautious about letting my alarm ring over and over or for long periods of time considering we all had to share a single room last year. I thought that the situation had resolved itself when she stopped saying anything about the alarm but out of nowhere one morning she printed out an article and left it on my desk. The article insinuated that those who use loud alarms might have depression (?). The situation progressed when she told me that the alarm was causing her physical pain so bad that she was now seeing a doctor and receiving medication. She wanted me to turn my alarm clock volume down but I knew that that would risk me missing class or other important meetings. I tried to explain this but she just started sobbing and saying that I didn't care about her mental health. I couldn't take the crying anymore so I just pretended to turn it down and then she seemed satisfied with that.

Now to the situation that started in our new apartment this year (don't ask why I chose to live with her again. I'm dumb). Her 21st birthday was a few weeks ago and she wanted to have a small get together within the rules of social distancing. Her invite included my sorority little who she was also friends with. My little had been attending large gatherings which rightfully worried my roommate so she came to me sobbing and begging me to uninvite her. I told her that I didn't feel it was my place and I wanted to stay out of their argument but was fine with whatever decision she made. I don't know exactly what their conversation looked like because I refused to read her texts when she showed them to me but I know it ended with my roommate telling my sorority little she was never allowed in our apartment ever again until she had her personal permission. This made me angry because it's not her place to ban her from the whole apartment forever however, I continued to let them handle it on their own because I wanted to stay out of it and didn't necessarily agree with my sorority little's actions either.

Two weeks ago my sorority little tested positive for COVID and has been quaranting out of town. My roommate overheard me talking to her on the phone about having her over in the near future when she is healthy and back in town. This caused her to call her dad panicked about my little being at our apartment even though she will have already recovered from COVID. She had her dad CALL MY MOM to discuss this and how it was causing my roommate to lose sleep and not be able to eat. She also had her dad communicate that she wouldn't feel comfortable with my little in our apartment until she tested negative twice even though the CDC does not recommend restesting. Her reasoning for having her dad call my mom was that ""we had unresolved issues from last year"". What makes me most angry is that she couldn't just come speak to me like an adult. We are 21 and 20 - far too old for this in my opinion. My mom was also annoyed with me because it was in the middle of her work day.

927,"I'm in the U.S. and need to sell my house and I'm debating between 3 situations that can come next: either buy a condo, rent an apartment, or put all my stuff in a storage unit and drive multiple states away to my brother's house.

&amp;#x200B;

I was only living in this state because my mom and my grandmother were here but then they both died. I'm not fond of my current location but I start a new job at a local company next week that I'm very excited about. The new job is currently remote and the company is unsure if it will stay that way.

&amp;#x200B;

I won't specify the state, but here it is generally cheaper to buy than to rent. However, there's not much keeping me here now and I'm worried that if I buy a place I may have to sell it sooner than traditionally recommended. On the other hand, rent seems like a huge waste of money but allows more flexibility.

&amp;#x200B;

If my new job extends remote work, I have a third option to put all my furniture in storage and live at my brother's house. He lives in a big city with much more opportunity (both career and relationship-wise). I could live there for a while and if it works out (better job, new friends, my own place to live) then I can come back to the storage unit and get my stuff and properly relocate. I'm not particularly fond of his location either but it is better than where I am now.

&amp;#x200B;

I know a lot of this hinges on my new job allowing remote work long term. I suppose a 4th option could be to sell the house and live at my brother's house until I'm possibly called back to the office and then I can find an apartment here. 

&amp;#x200B;

Normally I'd ask my mom or my grandma for advice but they're gone and I don't have anyone else to ask. My brother has been trying to convince me to move to his city for a few years so his advice is biased. I'm just looking for an outside perspective I guess. Thanks",09Sep2020,1

Now lets say hypothetically I made a fake gmail of my principal and emailed the teachers of my school saying: ""A few students complained to me about homework and I want to adress this with you. I know we all have our family's to care about during these uncertain times and I have brainstormed a way we can stay spend time with our families. I reviewed the grades and saw them struggling giving them more homework will worsen that.

While all of this was happening i had to do an optional exam wich i failed and that also got me bumped down and with this failure my parents kinda lost a little faith in . The only ones who had faith me in the first place. I also feel extremly useless because the only things i do when i'm at home is play videogames and nothing productive.

932,"My Girlfriend and I have been together for almost two years now. Everything has been nearly perfect up until about a month ago. We had, of course, occasionally argued but never for more than 2 days and it always resolved amicably. But about a month ago we started arguing more. Admittedly I had began treating her in a much meaner way, and it reached a boiling point last week. 

The details are unimportant but I said things that I supremely regret, and at the time I thought she was acting unfairly, but she was justified in her actions to be angry with me. Over the next couple of days I only made it worse by probing her on what was wrong and arguing when she wanted to share how she felt.

We’ve been deeply in love and she recently told me she’s considering ending the relationship but she doesn’t know. I don’t know what to do.

I’ve apologized profusely but she says she can’t trust me anymore to treat her right. I know I can go back to being the person I was before but I just don’t know how to prove it to her. I can’t stand to be without her and I don’t even wish for things to go back to “normal”. I want her and my lives intertwined even tighter than before.

I do feel sad somewhat, however the two of us weren’t ever close. He was emotionally abusive and manipulative, I feel numb right now. I’m not destroyed or anything but I do think about it a lot.   


  A lot of family from both sides have been reaching out to support us. I was talking to my mom about him last night, just how we felt, what to do, and other heavy things. My mom said my Grnadma and aunt suggested she should tell my teachers what I’m going through so they could know and I could have more support.   


   I feel silly posting here about this, compared to the actual situation, but I just need some outside advice right now. I’m not sure wether to tell my teachers yet really. Living with my dad made me a master at hiding my emotions, and he told me very angrily and sternly not to tell anyone about what goes on at home. Basically scared me into not telling anyone. I feel like this is a factor to why I have trouble opening up to people.

Another thing (which makes me feel silly about being worried about this) is that I’m afraid my teachers won’t care or think I’m a baby. My teachers are strict (not unhealthily strict but they expect a lot from us) and I’m afraid if my mom tells them they‘d see me as a sensetive baby, to put it that way.

Currently my fiance and I live in Texas and life is good.  It's her second year going full time with her photography business she started and she is killin' it.  I work for a Civil Engineering firm and make a good salary and love the company I work for.  Only downside is that the room for growth with the company isn't that great.  Recently, I've been sending my resume around looking for different opportunities to grow professionally.  I've sent some around the city we live in, as well as a few to openings in other states out of curiosity.  I didn't expect to take any of the out of state offers seriously unless they seemed like an obviously great opportunity.  I got a response from a company in Montana and the process has become very serious.  In short, the company opened a new branch in a different location in MT and the Senior PM there is looking for people to hire.  He's currently the only one at that branch.  I'd be the first person they would hire.  I've been in talks with them for a while now, have done an interview and a technical interview, and they loved me.  They offered me a contract for a little less than I'm currently making.  Sounds like a not so great deal, until I did a personal interview with the senior PM.  He was in Texas recently, because his daughter goes to Baylor, so I drove there to meet with him.  He told me that he plans to retire in 10 years.  He's and older gentleman, and the timeline for him retiring seems right so I believe him.  I asked him what the companies outlook for me would be with them and he said I would be his right hand man, and he would help train me to run the office once he retires.  I've confirmed this fact with the CEO that this would be their intention.  So basically, my salary would triple in 10 years.  I'm in my late 20s so this sounds like a no brainer right?  I have to make my decision by early next week and I have this huge feeling of guilt on my shoulders.  Asking my fiance to uproot her business, and move somewhere that she has no clients seems crazy to me since my salary would essentially be the same as it is now.  Together, right now, we make a healthy six figures.  That wouldn't be the case anymore until I start to manage that branch, \~ 10 years from now, to which we'd be making more than we probably would be in Texas.  I know she could start up her business there, but I feel really guilty in asking her to do that because she's worked so hard to get to where shes at.  She also still has 9 weddings booked for this year and early next spring so she wouldn't move up there with me until Spring 2021.  Basically this situation has me in a bind, I wanna grow professionally and this seems like a good opportunity to do it.  We have talked about it and started discussing the pros and cons.  I just want to do whats best for our financial goals and its looking like this could be a great option.

My dad treats me the hardest of the 3 siblings and hurts me physically and mentally and uses the excuse of “being the oldest” as the cause. My siblings are put on a pedestal and never get in trouble or yelled at for the same things that I do!

I'm not usually afraid of mirrors in daylight or if someones with me.

but I'm terrified of them when alone, the reason for this is because I have encounters of ghosts in the mirrors out of the corner of my eyes all the time and not just in mirrors, I have encounters with ghosts everywhere.

952,"For most of my childhood and teen years, I was extremely anti-social and pretty reclusive. I started opening up a little bit in my senior year and made a couple friends but even then I was still pretty shy and kept to myself for the most part. I’m 21 now and I’m a way different person. I want to live and experience all the fun and dumb shit that teens do, but the few friends I do have all seem to be growing up and moving past that stage of their life. My best friend, who used to invite me to stuff that I’d rarely take up, is a mom now and doesn’t have as much free time as she used to. My other close friend used to like going out and having fun too but he’s busy with nursing school now and is generally just not really into that life anymore. 21 is obviously still very young but I’m well out of my high school years and I can’t help but mull over how I wasted what could’ve been great years. Time seems to be going by faster and faster and I just feel like before I know it I’ll be 25 and then 30 and so on. Anyone else dealt with similar feelings?",09Sep2020,1
953,"Short version: my (now ex) best friend of 4-5 years confided in me that she slept with a mutual friend's husband recently while the wife was in bed not feeling well because she was very very pregnant. Should I tell the wife?


Long version: my best friend (I will call her Trina), has always been close to our other friends, a married couple with kids. (I will call them Will and Sarah). Will has made passing comments to Trina that made Sarah uncomfortable. Comments about her being allowed to come over whenever she wants, even if Sarah isn't home. Over the years, Trina and Will have always been closer than Sarah and Trina. But Trina is an ""auntie"" figure to Will and Sarah's kids, so Sarah got past it, and Trina continued to stay close to the family. Recently, Trina got a job out of state and moved. She was dating a guy at the time, and they planned to move there together. Before she moved, she visited Sarah and Will and their kids for a sort of ""goodbye day"" where they did fun things with the kids and spent time together. Sarah was very pregnant at this time, and wasn't feeling well. So after their other kids went to bed, she also went to bed. Leaving Trina and Will alone. They decided to get drunk together, and ended up sleeping together.... Several times that night. Trina moved, and shortly after broke up with her boyfriend. (Probably because she felt bad cheating?). But they never told Sarah what happened. It's been a few months now, and Trina has come back home for visits, and every time she comes back she visits Will, Sarah, and the kids. Sarah usually posts something nice on Facebook about how ""Trina is such a good auntie to the kids!"" Or something, and it bothers me. I hate that Will and Trina are okay with sneaking around and not telling Sarah about what they did. Especially when Sarah has been so welcoming to Trina. I confronted Trina about it, and she told me she had no intention of ever telling Sarah because she doesn't want to ruin their family. But refuses to distance herself either. She didn't seem to feel guilty about it and said that ""Will has always wanted to sleep with me. It was going to happen eventually."". This made me sick, and I told Trina I could no longer have her in my life. Fast forward a few weeks, and Sarah had her baby. Trina came back home to visit them, meet the baby, bring gifts, ect. And again, Sarah made comments on facebook about how amazing she is and how lucky they are to have her around. This is upsetting to me, and I want reddit's advice. Have you ever been in a situation like this? What did you do?  Should I tell Sarah? I'm not close to Sarah but I still care about her. I feel dirty knowing their secret, and I can't decide if I should do anything about it or not. I know I'm not involved and it's not my business, but me knowing this, and being around Sarah and Will, makes me feel like I am involved. Because I'm keeping this secret from Sarah now, too. 

Side notes: we are all in our mid/early 20's, Will and Sarah DO NOT have an open relationship, all of their children are under the age of 7, and Will works with my husband on the weekends.",09Sep2020,1

However I don't know how I will be able to juggle all these things.

University is a priority, I am going to put that ahead of anything else no matter what as my education will stay with me for the rest of my life. However, I am slowly getting more worried for what's to come as I'm about to be busy 7 days a week, every week. 

My job is also a priority, albeit not as important as my education. I need this job more to provide for my family rather than for myself so I cannot really lose out on any job opportunities or working hours.

 My relationship is also really important to me. I feel it's unfair to not put it ahead of the other two but I'm trying to be wise and thinking long term. I need to survive and finish education. At the same time, I don't want to dissapoint my partner. I don't want to deprive her of a relationship or intimacy. It is an important aspect of my social life that I feel like makes me sane as I have things to talk about to someone and keeps me hopeful.

So I am trying to juggle all three of these, and I would like to take all the advice I can get. How do I manage my time? What things should I keep in mind? Advice that would help me get through what's to come? Is 7 days a week every week for months on end a bit much? Etc.",09Sep2020,1

Eg: There's this girl with the ability to switch body's. So what she does she goes and switches body with her mother's. Then the girl in her mother's body goes and fucks her boyfriend (mom). The mom was in her 40 or 50s but she was so damn hot. After seeing such video's I can't think straight. I go into my own deep fantasy in which I fuck a lot of people and it takes quite a while for me to snap out of it.

962,"I've been dealing with this as long as COVID essentially, but it's becoming a bigger problem as time looms and I'm really struggling to make a decision. I'll begin with a bit of backstory.

So I used to train and work on merchant ships, like container ships and oil tankers, as an engineer. I left as I had failed all but one exam of the previous term, meaning I would have to resit all of them while also doing the new subject exams and write my dissertation. To add to all of this, I was severely depressed and suicidal, with the news that my mother was in a psychiatric hospital for bipolar and my grandfather had been diagnosed with cancer. This was within a week of each other. So after 3 weeks of thinking, and with the school's advice, I decided to leave that life behind and take what qualifications I had already achieved with me. 

I then found a low skill job at minimum wage, which I started as lockdown started (I'm from the UK) and got told that I was temporarily laid off as I missed the cutoff for furlough (government pays 80% of wage to staff). Filed for unemployment and started looking for another job. Did a couple of agency type jobs here and there a day at a time, terrible jobs, and poorly paid might I add. After about a month of not going into work, I get a call from my boss who says due to budget cuts they will no longer be able to employ me. So this makes me feel even worse, depression starts to kick in again and the suicidal thoughts creep back. 

After about 3 months of job hunting, a family member comes across an NHS engineering apprenticeship, as I've already got engineering qualifications it takes them some serious negotiating to get me to apply, I eventually do get an interview and a job offer. I take it, bearing in mind that I nearly didn't attend the interview as I didn't initially want it. Job starts, I realise that the job itself is not what was advertised and very minimal work is done, mostly sitting around and I absolutely despise it. 

Now here comes the dilemma, I have realised that the only way to do the job I want is to go back to working on ships as I loved the work. To do that, I either have a possible opportunity through a friend or to apply to the only company that will employ someone who has already done the course I did due to government funding, or, stick with this terrible job for 4 years and get my old life back where I was happy but due to what I did outside of work and try and pursue other dreams. It should be said that working on ships is very rewarding financially as well. I'm at the position where I need to figure out what to do as I don't want to regret my life choices, no more than I already am. Help!!!

TLDR: Don't know what decision is the best for my life, go back to old job that I loved and redo 3+ years of training or continue life with a job I hate and try and hobby my way out of hating life.

&amp;#x200B;

Note: My depression stemmed from my family being in a different country (3000+ miles 4800+ Km), me being very young when I left home (16), being a childish idiot making people hate me, not intentionally, and a VERY poor diet (I went from 70Kg (147lbs) to 125Kg (275lbs) in 3 years (I'm 5'10"" or 178cm) and the added joys of failing exams and ill family members",09Sep2020,1
963,"So my neighbors do not like having their dog  inside so they leave her outside 24/7. This is regardless of the weather too. We have had several tornado warnings, bad storms, and very cold winters and they always leave her outside. They also never give her any sort of attention, aside from the occasional pet. Because of this, she will sit in her kennel and bark for hours straight throughout the day and the night. Her bark is booming and you can hear it all throughout the house. We got in contact with them and they put a shock collar on her, but she just continued to bark and her neck is now raw and bleeding everywhere. They never bother to calm her down unless we specifically ask them, which has been happening less and less because my grandmother is very passive and does not want to cause any trouble with our neighbors. It is so frustrating because as a kid I cannot do anything about this. Whenever I consult my parents about it, they just get angry with me and tell me to stop bitching. I can’t focus on my work anymore and I’ve been losing sleep every night. Last night she barked until 5 in the morning.  As a student, I cannot have this consistently happening. I want this dog to stop suffering and I want to get some sleep. It has gotten to a point where I can’t even get a full night’s rest anymore because she won’t stop barking.

964,"About a year ago or so i started losing interest in everything. Hanging out with my friends , playing music, listening to music, reading, EVERYTHING was getting more and more boring. I started worrying all the time and this awful feeling of almost fear that something bad was going to happen to me was following me everywhere. I stopped talking to my friends and they did not take that very well. Everyone i knew started hating on me and as much as i wanted to say something my mouth was always staying shut. It's like trying to scream but not being able to. And so everyone i knew left me, accept for my girlfriend who stood by my side and still does. Around February of this year i started feeling really sad all the time. I started worrying whether i was depressed or not. Then the pandemic started and we all got locked up. My country forbid going out for some periods of time during the day and sometimes even days. I was miserable all the time and the school wasn't giving me any peace. When the summer break started i was so hyped because i thought that i would finally be able to relax,but to no avail. I wasn't able to relax, not even once, every time i found some time to lay down i always started worrying about everything and anything. Just when i started going out with my girlfriend more and feeling kind of better a group of my former friends ran into me and my girlfriend and started yelling at us and making fun of us and taking pictures of us. This resulted in me not wanting to leave my house that often anymore. I started finding comfort in my house and the fact that no one can do me no harm here. This leads us to the present day. I was looking forward to being able to go back to school again because i felt like i would finally become myself again. This has not proven to be true. I was really hoping that i would become myself again and be happy and cheerful,but i am just the same as a year ago. So i finally sat down and wrote this paragraph.

965,"So me and my friend hooked up for the first time a few days ago. We were both pretty drunk. They drove me home then asked if they could sleep in my bed with me. We talked for like an hour then they asked if I wanted to make out. Things started getting pretty handsy and they were the one initiating taking off clothes etc. Based on their body language, it seemed pretty obvious where things were headed. 

So once we get to the point where we're naked and grinding genitals without penetration, I ask if I should grab a condom. They were like, ""we need to use a condom?"" and I was like, ""Uhh... YEAH?"" so I go to grab it and they told me they were sleepy. I say that we don't have to do anything, and they were like ""but I don't wanna leave you high and dry"" and I'm like ""dude that's not even what's going on here."" 

So we continue making out, things are still steamy and the genital grinding was still happening. I wasn't comfortable fucking without a condom, and that seemed to be what they wanted, so I mentioned the condom again. They said they were sleepy again and I was like, ""That's fine. Here's the condom, do what you want with it."" We started making out again, they put it on, and we fucked. 

In retrospect I feel like I was being way too pushy, but also I feel like they DID want to fuck, just not with a condom. I said some things that make me cringe because of how pushy they sounded, but in the moment it was just dirty talk and I was trying to be hot.

975,"Hey everyone,

So I'm going to start this with some upfront information, this is about me and I am seeing a psychologist to work through the issues that have caused the disruptions in my life. I just want peoples unbiased honest opinions. 

When I was 9 years old I became type one diabetic which kind of made me feel a little segregated from my peers back, there was a  birthday party incident that went badly.  I am 39 now so this was a while ago.  The following year we moved to a urban region and I went to a small school close by. 

The relationship with my family was as such. My mom and my two other siblings were what I considered all my life as close, I was the middle child... My eldest brother went to high school out of town so we only saw him on weekend, my little brother went to the same school as I did. My dad was what my mom explained as ""not that kind of father""... I honestly can not remember a time where I heard him say I love you, or I am proud of you, apparently he would say it to other people behind our backs but this is all hearsay I never saw or heard it. He was around when he did not work, but we never got any emotional support from him, all of that came from my mom. To be honest I don't remember him playing sports with us either, he did drive us to places for activities, this was most of the time under the instruction of my mom.

Anyway at about 12  some kid in class decided to call me fat and tease me daily on it, it wasn't just me it was my only friend as well, but it seemed to only effect m.  It was always done in an open environment, like the school bus and no teacher ever intervened, everyone just laughed. So as predicted I became anorexic, my mom only realized way late and so at this time is when what I call the 4 years of hell started. Which is where I want the opinions.

I cant remember the progression or the start of everything in the beginning I know the disorder weighed on my mind as a child and I started having outbursts. What I do remember was the shame and guilt and I have flashbacks  of those experiences. You see I remember on many occasions my mom grabbing me by the shoulders, sometimes shaking me, and saying that her and my dad are arguing and I am the cause of it, making there lives unbearable.  Some times she would say look at what I was doing to my brother I am ruining his life. 

Then from my dad side he would grab me and shake me and say look at what I am doing to my mother, also on a few occasions how embarrassed I made him. We were beaten as kids when we were misbehaving, but never by him, however he beat me if I remember correctly maybe three times because of ""episodes"". Even this made me feel ashamed I got more and more aggressive. Till they decided to send me to a retired psychiatrist who put me on medication that made it even worse at the time, I am not convinced it was the medication anymore though.

I remember the guilt, well as a child I didn't know it was guilt the feeling actually came back to me during a family altercation where this became clear, I remembered it because when I was 13, I believe, I actually went to get my dads gun out the safe and my mom walked in on me. And that same feeling that took me to the safe intensified right after... I remember feeling look at what I am doing. The were lots of other occasions, one specific one that stands out very very vividly was when my mom pointed a steak knife at me and told me she would stab me. You see she was never violent, but I felt really responsible in pushing her to that extreme point. I can say that these occasions fluctuated sometimes three times a week sometimes less it became a pattern. 

Anyway I'm going to stop there because this is where I want the opinion, you see I have issues with feeling emotions besides anger and shame and guilt, those are very clear, scarily at times and uncontrollable. 

My mom says she was doing it for me to make me better, she was saying theses things to make me realize what I was doing. But logic tells me that me stopping was more of a benefit for them. She does not seem to think that what her and my dad did was that terrible that it could effect my adult life, and it was all for me. And that the anorexia was the cause, but at its worst it wasn't about the eating disorder anymore it was about my behavior. So I'm not sure...

What is your consensus would you agree with her?

Is there something I am missing or incapable of seeing?

Am I also to blame for how I turned out?",09Sep2020,1
976,"I asked this already but didn't got any answers and this is a really important matter to me.

Basically I hate going to school, specially my school. My classmates dislike me, it's a small school so I'm very bored from it, no events happens except for ""praising week"" (a whole week to sing to gospel music and listen to speeches), very traditional teaching method and, to be honest, not on my level.

I'm currently in 9th grade and next year I will enter High School so I wanted to take the opportunity and move to a better school. Happens that every school besides my current is at least an hour by bus from my home. In specific, the one my mom is more likely to let me go to is 2-3 hours from my home. As if taking 4-6 hours of bus wasn't enough, I do have some medical conditions that makes me feel exhausted and dizzy from even short periods of traveling and going out, specially if it's hot (and I live in a tropical country).

It's been making me anxious for 2 years now. What should I do?",09Sep2020,1
977,"I honestly don't even know whats wrong or where to start. I'm a Junior in HS, and I'm homeschooled so my GPA is kind of difficult to determine, but I believe I have about 4.0 currently. The problem is that I am not vibing right now. I feel like for my whole life I've had something wrong, since I was 11 I've felt particularly depressed (16 now). I started having suicidal thoughts when I was about 12-13, and had them on and off since then. There's no clear pattern to when I feel down, but it's very unlinked to events. I can feel terrible while on a luxurious vacation, and good (admittedly sad, but the healthy kind) when my dog died. I started therapy in January 2020, but stopped because of Corona. I think my parents completely did not take my suicidal thoughts seriously, as I only went once every 1-2 months (2 sessions total in my entire life), and they would constantly talk about how expensive it was right in front of me, and from my perspective it was a deliberate guilt-trip, so I probably won't be going back. Don't get me wrong, if we were struggling to get by then I'd totally be sympathetic and understanding, but we live on an estate worth over a million dollars. It wasn't a matter of cost, it was a matter of priority. 

Anyways, back to the present. I worked a fast food job for about a year and a half, and stopped because of Corona. I haven't gone back because my mom is immunocompromised, but I made the realization that I never want to work at a place like that again. It seems like way too much effort to sustain a life that I don't enjoy anyway. The only career I could ever see myself pursuing is music, doing live gigs and lessons, but I only started 2 years ago and honestly, I just don't feel like I'm capable of doing it. I usually sing and play guitar for at least 2 hours a day, but it doesn't seem like I'm making any progress. 

Long story short, I sleep and watch youtube all day instead of doing anything to ensure my future, because my current plan is to kill myself as soon as my parents stop supporting me financially. Yes, I'm aware that makes me lazy and a free-loader and a bum and a general piece of shit, but that is how I feel. I genuinely don't know what the solution to anything is, and I think the main reason I'm posting is because apparently writing down your thoughts is good, and I probably want some attention or something.

978,"Work expenses: Since COVID shelter-in-place started, I have been working from home. My hours were cut in half on team 1 and I took a second part-time job at the same organization on a different team (team 2). I wasn't approved for a WFH setup for team 1. Everyone with the same job as me on team 2 was approved for a WFH setup, but for some reason I was denied. So, I've been using my personal computer for work. I requested a WFH setup for team 2 multiple times and was denied every time.

My personal computer was working fine before I started WFH. Once I started WFH, it started freezing up and eventually crashed. I requested partial reimbursement, but was denied and told I should just be grateful I got to keep my job. I've taken my complaint to HR. Am I screwed here?

Schedule: Job 1 can be completed in a continuous block of hours. Job 2 requires me to split my hours between the morning (starting at 9) and evening (I work with kids and can't meet with them until they're out of school). Both jobs are within the same company. Job 1 managers want me back in the office for the full 8 hours (4 for job 1, 4 for job 2) every day and job 2 managers have tried to advocate for me doing 12 hours WFH so I can meet with students in the evening. Job 1 managers don't care. An 8 hour day in the office can't be accomplished unless I go to the office at 9am and leave at 8pm with a three hour break in the middle. Job 1 managers have not suggested a schedule that would allow me to execute all my responsibilities within an 8 hour work day. The office is closed, nobody will be in the office besides me, and no business will be conducted. Am I screwed *here*, too?",09Sep2020,1

I've never had a girlfriend and it makes me think there's something wrong with me and that I'm not good enough everytime I fall in love they never feel the same way. I wish I didn't have to put up with this pain but I can't do anything to stop it because I have so many responsibilities. I have to look after a family member who has disabilities and can't look after themselves and I'm very close to some of my family. I feel like I'm not supposed to experience happiness and that I'm supposed to be the happiness that others need.

I've been hurting so much but I can't end it because people rely on me I just want the pain to stop I've literally cried myself to sleep every night it hurts so much. I feel like I won't be able to reach my goals. I've always wanted to start a family and give my kids the childhood I never really had but there's no one out there for me so I never can.

So I just pushed him away locked myself in my room away from him and the world.

Really I just don’t know what to do I’m lost I have no plans for my life and interacting with people just freaks me out so much I’m afraid it won’t get any better. What’s worse is I’m at the point where I need a father the most but I haven’t seen mine or spoke to him in 3 years even if I could I wouldn’t want to speak to him anyways. Even though I’m better of without him I can’t help but to be jealous of other kids hanging out with there fathers and I know I’ll never have that. I just don’t know what to do where should I go when I have questions about life? Should I try to reconnect with my dad even though he put us through hell with all the manipulation and cheating on my mom?

I’m sure there are other women who game, who are like me and just enjoy playing games and being part of communities but I just haven’t come across them yet. 

I’ll join a group and there will be like one girl and she’ll either completely ignore my existence. Or just get really mean and annoyed that I’m there. 

I’ve literally joined a gaming group, spoke in voice and the girl admin said “oh you’re a girl, I don’t like you” and removed me from the group.

Or when I was in voice in another one and I made a pun joke and a guy laughed and the girl messaged me saying I’m so desperate for attention from guys and how pathetic it was.

And just now, I was in a game with a guy friend and this girl joined and we where all talking and it was fine and then my friend had to jump off for a second and instantly she was just silent with me, and tried to keep the convo going but she ignored me. 

My friend came back 5 minutes later and head the back end of my question and he answered it and that’s when she started talking again. 


It just sucks. When I see there is another girl in a group I’m instantly wary, and each time I do my best and it’s just always the same thing. Is the issue me?

The mom was in her 40 or 50s but she was so damn hot. After seeing such video's I can't think straight. I go into my own deep fantasy in which I fuck a lot of people and it takes quite a while for me to snap out of it.

Last month I got my school exam results and got the best possible. 

Now my dad, who went there is pressuring me to reapply. He’s gotten my old school involved too. They’re saying how good an opportunity it is, how I have a really good shot etc. 

Thing is, I don’t know if I can face it. I would have to do an exam, submit work and go for an interview all while starting uni elsewhere. 

M current uni is good and a good degree from there will set me up nicely. The other uni would look better as a name but idk if it’s that important. 

I’m scared at the idea. Nervous of the effort I’d have to go through. I want to focus on my current uni. I am also scared of leaving friends I will make there. 

But I feel I may regret it if I don’t try, and if I got it it would be a better university. 

Mainly it’s my dad pressuring me to go. I’m terrified of it and the thought of not applying and not facing the effort made me feel better, but I’m worried I’ll regret it.

992,Hello everyone I am a 21yr m who literally cannot stop buying CBD I just love the way it makes me super calm and relaxed. I come to you guys today to help me break my addiction. I have been spending around $100 u.s dollars a week on it and every time I buy more I tell my self “okay after this is it no more” but every time I run out I instantly buy more without a thought about it :/ I’m financially stable enough to continue doing so but I’d much rather be spending my money on other things. And I think this is where my troubles begin because I know I have the money to do it so when I run low I just instantly go buy more. It also really helps me go to sleep. I have had trouble falling asleep my whole life and the CBD really helps with that.

Sorry if there’s any mistakes in this post I am quite upset.. probably worth mentioning I have had counselling too.

Anyway my mother turned a blind eye to it. My mother went on to have 2 children with him, they are incredibly spoiled. I can’t get over the jealously. Especially later in my life they were doing drugs and I took over trying to play mother.

Ill start off with my mental state, I've never been diagnosed as to have depression or any kind of illness but that's cause I've never opened up about it, (till now), i been feeling what i can only describe as hollow and empty for some time now starting when i was around 12, and the feeling just seems to get stronger. The thought of killing myself doesn't really faze me and almost seems like that offing myself is what just something that will happen sooner or later. hell i got a rope in my amazon cart on stand-by.  


Now onto my moving out at 16 thing.

edit: all the exes of my mom weren't bad people or anything it was just not a healthy relationship.

Past: My parents have been divorced for as long as i can remember and nowadays i rarely get to see my dad (the cooler parent). i think the source of my mental health problems is my mom, she isn't a bad or anything but she makes bad decisions relationship-wise. when i was about 7ish she got moved in with a guy who was in the army, he was a little threatening and strict but was pretty cool, we moved into a generic middle class neighbourhood, the kind you see in sitcoms. this house was very far from where i was living so there was no family or friends coming into it. all was pretty smooth for a bit, after 2ish years they started getting into fights and drinking a lot, which led to me isolating myself and getting yelled at for no reason. they broke up and we move back to the area i grew up. a year later she meets a guy who is closer but still far enough i need to part with my original friends. we move into a lower class city area, and things are good for a bit again. however the same thing happens, the isolation the drinking, everything. its like a repeat of what happened just a different guy and a different area, they break up and now im starting high school. we move close to where i grew up so i can go to high school with old friends again.

Present: shes in a new relationship now with the same kinda guy, kinda scary but seems chill. they are now talking about finding a house and all that crosses my mind is, ""wait ive seen this before"", honestly im sick of it and am thinking of moving out. what im hoping is that moving out and experiencing the thing called, ""adult life"", will give me a different perspective of the world and maybe even make me delete that rope i was talking about. how i plan move out is either ill ask some close friends or family members and probably rent one of their rooms.

Random people and employees will ask my child if they live in a house or an apartment, where it's located, how many rooms and bathrooms it has, if we're renting or purchased it, etc. (Not in a stalker way, but in a trying to figure out how much money we have.)

I always make sure I enter all of my tips . There were atleast 3 nights where I went home with $80 in credit card tips, and I never go home with less than $40. We also get anywhere from 10-25 tables per shift , depending on the day of the week. Most of them are charged on a credit card. When I noticed my check was probably short , by like $200,  I asked the manager to see the credit card receipts from the prior week. He avoided me all night and acted very weird . Finally he gave them to me to review,  and I noticed there were missing charges . They were leaving entire tickets out of my report . The most obvious was on Friday night it said I only had 7 checks pay with a card. It was probably more like 20 checks, Especially since a lot of tables split their bills. Also all of my credit card totals for each day did not exceed $50 on this report.I know I made more than $70 on 3 of the 6 nights I worked.  A coworker also came in because her check was short the same day. Oddly,  many servers seemed overpaid.  I worked 40 hours and only took home $200 in tips. 2 other servers worked 25 and 30 hours and made over $100 more than me. My manager is blowing it off and saying we have to put our own tips in the system (duh) and they have nothing to do with that . She also reminded me that we tip out  0.16% of our credit card tips to the busser and hosts. Still with all this and taxes considered,  it doesnt add up. I cant prove the exact amount they took so I'm not sure what to do. I also am hesitant to assertively demand money because I can tell them how much . I just know its atleast $200 gone. If anyone works in food management or has experience with something similar I would appreciate any advice.",09Sep2020,1
1017,"Hello!  I need some help in regards to job interviews.  For all of my adult life I have had long hair and a long beard to help cover up the fact that I am ugly as sin.  I’ve also worked jobs that didn’t mind the state of my hair and beard length.  I’ve always looked the part for the job mostly at big box stores selling TVs and audio, as well as installing TVs, audio, and car electronics.  After my time was done there, I became a manager at a vapor store, so again I didn’t really have to clean up my mug and head.  As I get older and the vape industry is being squeezed dry by the government, I feel like it’s time for a nice 9 to 5.  I’m married with two dogs and I value a good weekend. 

I’m afraid that while I do enjoy a long flowing mane and beard, it will hurt me in the interview process.  My fear also is that if I do clean up, and not get the job, it would have been for nothing.  I don’t mind cleaning up if a job asks me to, but I would like to keep something that’s part of me if I don’t get the job.  

TL;DR:  have long hair and beard, don’t know if I should cut before interview.  Scared to cut for fear if I don’t get job, I also lose hair.

1020,To start this off I'm seventeen male  and my close friend is 18 female.(Sorry for terrible grammar) I met her when I was around 6 or so my brother who is 19 but back then was 8 or 9. Back then  she would always talk to my brother about school and random stuff. They were best friends. Recently like 2 years ago her family came over we chit chatted for a long time and I could tell my brother was jealous. She gave me her snapchat which I was genuinely surprised about anyways her family came a few times over but recently around a month ago her family came over and I was on the ground with a pillow next to the wall and a blanket due to the fact that I was just cold. And she went to the floor as well and warmed up with the blanket as well. She chatted with me and she opened up more to me then my brother. She randomly like 15 minutes later started to play with my hair and then she held my arm and fell asleep right there on the ground. I dated a few girls before that I liked but for some reason I felt something different with her. And idk what it is. I can't stop thinking about her and I've never felt this with any other girl. Idk I just felt genuinely happy with her. Idk maybe I'm dumb or something but what is this feeling? (Sorry if it's long),09Sep2020,1

He recently messaged me apologizing for not speaking to me and that he was going through stuff. He asked how I was doing. He also asked me to call him. I replied and let him know how I was doing and told him he could me whenever. I was kinda bored on Monday and gave him and he didn’t answer. He replied a Tuesday night and stated the following,”Sorry I was kinda busy yesterday what did you need?”. I felt like he disrespected me. I don’t “need” anything from him.

- ELI5 (explain like I’m 5) What exactly is OCD? From what my girlfriend has told me I know about obsessions and compulsions, and from some google searches I’ve read about a bit more but I’d like explanations about what exactly it makes people feel, and how it affects them. 

- How do I help her when she’s having a “flare up.”? My girlfriend told me every once in a while she’ll have a bad flare up where she doesn’t want people touching her because it’s not even, she doesn’t like to walk on things because it needs to be even, etc. 

- How do I help her just in every day life? What are some things I can do/say to make her feel better?

1031,"I'm gonna be a senior in high school next week. I was texting one of my friends, and he told me that some of my other ""friends"" (lets just call them group A for short) were making fun of me behind my back.

One of the members from A gave me this nickname ""boscar"" and called me that behind my back. It was mostly an inside joke between all the members in A. That same member even made a video on his Youtube channel, which was basically a diss track about me. It was a Roxanne Parody, and it described this ""cringe kid"" named boscar. Like it explicitly said ""if you know you know, if you don't, then boscar this cringe kid"". He didn't actively put my name on there, but I'm pretty confident it was about me. Every single line of that described me in some way, and it was all things I remembered saying/doing around him. Some of the lines talked about my hobbies, and rest talked about stupid stuff I said/did around him.

Everyone does stupid things, but this asshole actually kept track of every little thing I said/did in front of him and made a song about it. Worse enough, he was someone who I regularly joked with and actually liked.

I confronted him about it, and we had a long talk about it. He kept insisting that the boscar thing was for someone else (lets call him B). I talked to his other friends, and they said the same thing. However, I felt that every line was just talking about me in some way, I know this because every line related to me, and was something I said/done. I didn't take his BS, and after enough arguing, I managed to get him to take down the video on his channel.

There was also a second video he put on there, and it was called ""Vibe"". It had a pic of me, and it said stuff like ""why you stalkin why you creepin"" or some shit like that. I checked out my crush's Insta in public one time (which was one of the stupid stuff I did), and apparently people are dumb enough to think its stalking.

Both videos were made in December 2019, but I found out about them May 2020. I confronted him about it and forced him to take down both videos. I even reached out to B himself, and he said that the boscar nickname was never about him, that he doesn't know anything about it, that he doesn't know who the nickname is for, and he only knows people from A, but isn't actually friends with them.

I confronted A about it, and they all blocked me after I told them and showed them the ss of B saying it wasn't him. And I was told they think I'm annoying and they hate me for getting justifiably angry at them for something stupid they did.

I talked with a therapist about this, and he said this isn't the last time I'm gonna get pissed with a hater/bully/jerk, and he said that stuff like this doesn't end after high school, and we planned on working with ways to not get so heated over shit like this.

It contradicted my expectations, because I always thought that people would grow up after high school, and this would be the last time I would have to deal with peer drama.

So Reddit, what do I do?

And who is right, me or my therapist?

And how do I handle future situations? Do I grow a thicker skin and ignore it or do I confront them?",09Sep2020,1
1032,"this has been going on for a very long time and I’m not sure if I’m crazy any more. 

I am a 20M college student. I have two younger brothers - one of whom (18) has turned my life into a living nightmare.

Since 2018, he’s been picking the biggest fights with me over the littlest things and making my life unlivable whenever I’m around him. Sure, you might think this is typical sibling awfulness, but my parents side with him on most things.

He began giving my parents a hard time in his senior year of high school, during which he one day decided he wanted to be a professional esports player and stop attending school. 

My parents, being the Asian parents who prioritize appearances as they are, did his homework for all of his senior year so he could get a passing grade, and forced me to write certain portions of his college applications so they could apply for him to get into college. He proceeded to not attend graduation to get his diploma, in spite of all their efforts. That’s the kind of child he is. 

For the next two years, he proceeded to be an awful person to myself and everyone in the family - he went to a therapist for a short time and during this he told her my parents had abused all three of us children - which I can firsthand say is not true. He treats my mother as a slave and my father as garbage, and they continue to lavish him with attention as they always have. I don’t understand any of it. 

Nowadays, he spends his time in his room, gaming when my parents think he’s in class, and belittles and insults me every time I have the misfortune to run into him around the house. It’s made me mad enough that I broke something recently, which I’ve never done before in my life. There’s just something so awful about even looking at him that makes me want to die. I can’t even put it into words. 

I don’t know what to do. I’ve tried ignoring him, but as I am no saint, my patience is wearing thin and I don’t know how much more of this I. Can take. Given the current situation with the coronavirus I don’t know how feasible moving out is, and I only have a small amount of money saved from a summer research position. I don’t know how long I can afford to live on my own. 

I’m at my wits’ end; my parents have been acting as though I’m the one in the wrong for getting angry and I’m not sure if I’m right for feeling this way.",09Sep2020,1

1034,"We’ve been dating for just over a month.

He had a crush on me for almost two years, and we finally got together after months of FaceTiming daily, texting constantly, playing games together, etc. 

We’re long distance, so there’s that issue, but it wasn’t ever a real problem. I visited him, he asked me out, we are now dating. Woo.

Here’s my issue: he struggles to communicate emotionally. We’ve been friends for years and have (had?) a decent system going, and I was always pretty decent at reading his moods. But late last year he disappeared. Radio silence. Hardly answered my texts, never called, got ticked when I asked him about it. I later found out he had some really horrible stuff going on in his personal life and his coping mechanism was to self isolate. He came around after about a month and everything was ok and he promised he’d never do that again without at least giving me warning.

He went back to daily calls and texts, constantly being a clingy romantic. But about a week or two after I got home from the last time I visited him, he’s doing it again, and I can’t for the life of me figure out if he’s lost feelings, if he’s angry, depressed, if I did something, whatever. 

He hasn’t called me or texted first in over two weeks. Every call or conversation I initiate is brief and cold. He says he loves me, he wants me to come visit again in a week, etc, but I’m so thrown off. Last time he did this some fucked up shit was going on at work and he isolated from our entire friend group. But this time around it’s only me. He plays video games with all our friends daily and sounds happy and fine. He goes out with his guys at home every few days. He called me once out of this entire thing and it was because I asked, and it was the only time he sounded happy or interested in talking on the phone. But he was drunk, so I don’t know if that had something to do with it.

I’m fine with giving him space. I know he’s very introverted and needs some time alone when he’s upset. But this is getting out of hand, and every conversation I try to have with him about it he seems angry (at himself mostly) and gets extremely upset and shuts down even more. He says “fine I’ll call you every other day”, like it’s a chore and he’d rather not, and when I told him it sounds like he doesn’t even want to he just got frustrated again.

I don’t know what to do. He is genuinely so sweet and loving 90% of the time, and I fell for this guy well over a year ago and have been waiting so long for the opportunity to be with him. We have awesome chemistry, and that’s why we’ve been friends for so long. 

I refuse to give up this soon, but I don’t know how to facilitate a conversation with him about this in a productive way or help him understand why the hell im upset, because clearly he doesn’t see as much of an issue here as I do. If he’s dealing with some things emotionally I don’t want to be a burden or make things worse or make it “all about me”, so I’m trying to approach this as an “us” thing- we both have needs, how can we meet them equally? But I don’t have any fucking idea how to do anything like that at all.
Or if there’s any point to trying at this rate.

I’m visiting him in about 2 weeks, so I’ve got two weeks to figure out if I want to discuss this with him in person, and how to go about it. I’m just clueless.",09Sep2020,1

My dad who was just looking out for me gave me the option of trying it. 

Me being tired of restaurant work (made like $20k last year working much less than I do now), decided to drop nursing school , drop my friends, family, and home with beautiful green mountains to move to the desert for this job. Brought my GF out here away from her home and family because I thought we would have a better life financially. 

Long story short I fucking hate it so much. I’m making LESS money than I was serving and bartending and working around 15 more hours a week too. Inventory is so short and business is so slow it’s a constant battle of standing outside for 8hrs hoping to god you get someone. 

I’ll stand outside freezing or sweating for hours, go inside to plug in my phone, and next thing I know someone pulls up and the same dude that has been sitting in the warm building that just made $1000 off a sale runs out, nabs them up, and starts bragging about it. He’ll straight up steal customers from people. Every coworker has a problem with him but nothing gets done about it. 

I make maybe $750 every two weeks. I can’t even afford rent. My dad has had to help me out. He keeps saying it will get better but this month has been worse than last month. My fiance has hospital bills to pay with her income. I wanted to send her back to school but I don’t have the money for that. I couldn’t even buy her a birthday present. I cut back on spending as well. 

Even if I get a $1,000 sale and don’t sell anything else, if it isn’t higher than $9/hr average, I make $9 an hour on my check and the sale was pointless. 

A good third of the employees there are in my situation, and the veterans get internet leads and plenty of repeat and referral customers. So they don’t give a fuck. 

My dad is in town right now. I’m going over tonight. I really want to voice my disappointment and frustration but I don’t want him to be upset. I don’t kno what to do. 

I can’t even afford maintenance on my car. 

Any advice?",09Sep2020,1
1038,"I was friends with this girl for 3 years (freshman year of college to junior year). This summer she ripped me apart in a group chat for complaining about my student loans, but spending my work money on clothes. I was so embarrassed and hurt that I didn't talk to her for two weeks and waited for her to reach out and apologize. When I finally reached out she wrote me 3 messages, approximately 5-10 paragraphs each on why I was a horrible friend and had been during our relationship. I suffer from severe depression and I was completely blindsided. I faced the issue by going out (amidst a pandemic), getting drunk and then getting extremely close to committing suicide. To be honest, I cried everyday for a month. 

Now that I am back at school, I decided to have a birthday party. I followed all of the guidelines for my state and even spoke to a professor for advice before hand. I only invited so many people and it was held outside during the day. Come to find out, her friends have taken photos of our party and submit them to my university. The university reached out to my friends and I that they are doing an investigation. 

Today, one of my roommates received an airdrop of more photos from the party from a phone named after one of her friends (who lives 20 minutes away).

I took the opportunity. A few months later, he came back, and it was pretty awkward seeing him again. Every time I saw him I felt like he was looking at me almost like... I was weird. I felt judged. Which was strange because I always felt like he kind of had a crush on me. But when I saw him it was just so awkward. 

I got fired from the shop, and found a new place to work. It’s been great. But recently (after two years of not speaking) he asked me if I’d like to work at his new shop. It’s a great opportunity, I’d make more money, have my own schedule, etc. 

But I just feel like it’s odd that he’d ask me, given that it didn’t work out at the shop he hooked me up with an apprenticeship at.

1048,"Hi all,

My (24f) now ex-boyfriend (23m) relapsed for the first time on coke and didn’t tell me about it. Did it three times, and dumped me out of no where. There were no signs of a breakup or relapse. It was all very sudden. He didn’t tell me about the relapse, I figured it out and asked him.

He dumped me about 10ish days ago, and after the breakup I found out I was having a miscarriage, which he said he wanted to be there for me when I went to the doctor. But he went camping and blocked me on everything instead. I ended up having to go to the hospital, I’m okay. He feels really really bad, he’s definitely got that avoidance attachment style going on. 

He just wants to move on, and I mean I don’t WANT to but I know I HAVE to. I don’t know if he’s pushing me away because of the relapse and he hates himself, or really just wants to be alone right now, which I agree a relationship would be too much for him. Maybe he thinks by getting rid of me it means moving on completely? I don’t know. But he hurt me so very deeply. 

Here’s the thing, he made me promise not to tell any of his friends or family about his relapse. He’s pretty confident in himself that he’s never going to touch it again, but if I’m honest he’s never had any kind of professional help.. and statistically, he’s probably going to go down a slippery slope. If he’s pushing me away, the one person in his life he has ever been this vulnerable around (we definitely have a soul-type of connection. I know I’m young but I’ve been through a lot, and am very in tune with my intuition), he could start pushing everyone away. Addiction is an absolute demon. FYI, I have never done any type of drug. Only ever tried smoking pot, and I don’t enjoy it. I stick to my wine. 

I don’t know if I should tell anyone. I know the obvious answer is to tell his mom, but I don’t want to break his trust. I know him and I aren’t going to be in each other’s lives right now, but I do hope for a friendship at least one day. Coke is so dangerous, and I want to tell a friend or his mom but I’m afraid he’ll just tell them I’m a crazy ex. I feel like his friends could pull it off without them telling him I told them anything, but his mom definitely wouldn’t be able to keep me out of it if she were to confront him. 

My mom said she could tell his mom, but my ex has made it VERY (rudely and appallingly) clear that he does NOT want my help or need my help. And that I am to “never speak about this to (him) again”. Him and I had a very healthy relationship, I have never heard this side of him before. I feel like he’s probably doing more coke, or having intense cravings. We said our goodbyes (he wanted an update on the miscarriage) on Monday, but I have this gut feeling to just not tell anyone about his relapse. I feel like it’ll work itself out, maybe he’ll miss the attention he was getting from me and tell someone in his life about it? I can’t rely on anyone in his life to figure it out themselves, he literally did it in his room quick while his friends were over and none of them noticed. They are all pretty straight-edge. 

I know I am obviously not over him, and yes I do want to help him. But I know he said he does not want that. Was this a cry for help? I know addicts won’t get help til they want it. I honestly am just confused. I don’t want to use this as an excuse to get back into his life, I want him to heal and get better however is best for him. But I also don’t want to overstep my boundaries. 

So, do I get my mom to tell his mom, as if I’m not apart of it? Do I tell a friend of his in confidence? I feel like if I tell someone it should come from me? Do I listen to my gut and stay quiet for now?

Thanks.",09Sep2020,1
1049,"Hi everyone! So there are a few people I have met that I can think about when I ask myself this question. But I’m not sure, there is always someone who is nice... almost too nice and I can’t really put my finger on it but they seem to come off as ingenuine to me, it’s kind of a gut feeling, but everyone else believes this person is nice. I wonder sometimes if I’m projecting something on to them from myself? Maybe they are nice and I’m just untrusting for some reason? I also worry that when I try to be nice to others that it might come off as insincere just like I have perceived people in the past? What do y’all think? Am I wrong to trust my gut feeling? How can you tell if someone isn’t genuinely kind/nice?",09Sep2020,1
1050,"Hey all, I've gotten myself into a conflict today that I would like some advice and perspective on. 

I'm going to try to keep it short/concise but may fail. I was on my friend's discord server, giving them an update on the status of things where I live because I am amidst a lot of the Northern California fires right now. Friend's friend, who I have never spoken to and do not know, started chiming in about how California should have never been allowed to be lived in because so much of the land requires fire to reproduce. I concede that yes, a lot of California is chaparral biomes that needs heat from fire to help distribute seeds, but the entire state isn't made of that. He continues to go on about how we'd be better off letting the state burn. I mention that one of the biggest fires in my area was caused by a lightning strike in dry brush. He decides to be an edge lord and contend that ""we should stop fucking with Zeus then."" Every comment he's making about the fires is punctuated with an ""lol."" I know people who have been displaced by these fires, I know people who have had their animals die in the fires. I interpreted that he was being really cavalier about something that is very serious and very close to home to me, and told him I don't appreciate how cavalier he's being. I then told him to fuck himself and I quit the discord server. 

I know my response was rash and made out of anger.  However, neither one of us has reached out to the other at this point, and I'm still incredibly angry that he would make such offhanded remarks about something so serious and near to my heart. But, I also don't know this kid, so I also don't really care if I never speak with him again. I don't have any desire to befriend someone who'd joke at the expense of victims just because he knows someone I know. 

The friend who runs the discord server is absolutely flipping out and has been blowing up my phone all day, defending his friend and saying his friend was taking it seriously and not making jokes at all. But nothing that is said will convince me otherwise. I personally think that the mutual friend should stay out of it, but I'm wondering if that's asking for too much. I told him I'm sorry I put him into an awkward place, but I genuinely do not want him to feel like he needs to defend either one of us to the other, or that he has to take sides. But I am also getting an earful about how his friend just doesn't understand and doesn't know what it's like to be living through this. To me, that doesn't excuse his comments. 

I don't really know what advice I'm seeking, other than how do I move forward? I kept telling my friend that he needs to give me space to cool down and collect myself before I even consider reaching out to the other guy to apologize for being rude, but he continues to send me texts telling me I'm wrong to be upset by the comments. The more he gets into it, the more it makes me want to dig my heels in and not go back to their discord server. 

I acknowledge I started it, but now they're just getting under my skin and it's making me more stubborn. What the heck should I do, Reddit?",09Sep2020,1
1051,"I'll get right to it. I used to live with my parents who barely supported me. They provided food and shelter but never taught me how to drive so I was unable to go anywhere unless It was by bus (on top of not knowing how to handle insurance and stuff... They taught me nothing basically). At the time,I worked a job I really loved. It was the best job I ever had. I eventually moved out because I couldn't handle my family anymore (lots of drama and pointing fingers....) I moved in with my boyfriend but had to quit my job as a result. I am now much happier with my home life,I have support,currently learning how to drive and got stuff I needed that parents never helped me get (like social security card). But. I don't like my job. I miss my old job terribly. I often cry because of how much I miss it. It was my dream job. I am seriously considering moving back with my parents to get the job back, but I also feel I will miss the physical support my boyfriend has offered me for the past year. I'm completely torn.

1053,"TW: rape, abuse. Throwaway as this is quite personal. 

I won't go into too much detail as this is confusing and painful. But basically my sister and I have been quite distant due to differing religious views. A few years ago I had a flashback of being sexually assaulted by a family member. It was a brief memory, nothing solid enough to convince myself it actually happened. It's something that's haunted me ever since, not knowing how to know if it actually happened or if it was a nightmare or my imagination sparked by other unrelated trauma growing up. 

Recently my sister and I have gotten closer and I've found out our views don't differ as much as they used to. She revealed to me (after I shared the above with her) that she has similar memories. Not in as much detail, she doesn't remember anything actually happening but has a gnawing feeling in the back of her mind that something bad happened when she was young. 

I don't know what to do. I've gone to therapy myself and they haven't had any useful suggestions for how to deal with these memories or any way to know if they're real or not. Now finding out my sister has a similar bad feeling I need to help her in some way. I'll obviously be there and love her but my previous religion is known for regular sexual abuse. Even if we don't entirely remember it happening it's still messing with our heads.

I've considered hypnosis but am also aware that it may not bring back real memories and could leave me with more questions than answers. Even if I did remember something I wouldn't feel confident that it wasn't my mind making it up. Anyone have any advice or been through anything remotely similar?",09Sep2020,1
1054,"CW: Molestation, physical abuse, and suicide. 
.
.
.
.
.
Getting straight to the point, my dad was recently under investigation for child molestation. This was his third time accused of the same crime, and 2nd time actually being investigated for it. All of the cases are similar to each other. All children that he was currently living with, and each potential victim about 3 years old. I saw p
""Potential victim"" because there's never been enough evidence to actually charge him with any crime, as conducting an investigation is hard to do when your victim is a very young toddler. 
Now that the information about the current situation is cleared up, here's the advice part.
I was one of the children that he was accused of having sexually abused. 
I don't remember the event at all, as I was only 3 years old. So if anything did happen, I was either too young, or I blocked it out as a defense mechanism. 
My whole life, I knew in the back of my head that he could have done this to me, but no one had any way of knowing for sure. There was a custody thing when it happened, and judge told my mom that if she tried to get the courts to take away all of his custody and visiting rights because of my accusations against him, he could be found innocent and actually end up being granted partial custody. So the only thing my mom could do was to give up on the investigation and let him have supervised visits. This went on until I was 15, at which point the visits were unsupervised. This whole time, I was aware that I didn't whether or not I could trust him. Nonetheless, I leaned towards the option of ""I'm going to assume that he probably didn't do it, and ignore it forever."" 
Well that couldn't happen when I found out that he'd been accused a third time. 
Since then, he's lost everything. His wife, his house, his relationship with me (I'm his only child), and his ranch. He obviously could have even gone to jail, but didn't.
So now I'm in a place where I don't know what to believe, and I kind of want to seek out more information on the investigation. 
I'm wondering if it's a good idea to go digging in this case, since it could mean that my accusations against him when I was 3 were true. The only way I would be speaking to my dad anytime soon Is if I thought the investigation sounded bogus. But I also wonder if I should just let it be and move forward with my life. Never getting closure, but leaving it be in my past. 
Wondering if some stranger out there has ab opinion or some wisdom to share...also just felt nice to type it all out.",09Sep2020,1

1056,"So my cousin has gotten into some deep depression the past few months. I understand he’s in a very dark place mentally right now. I’ve been trying to take care of him and be supportive. The usually. Hes tried to kill himself once before (he was also super drunk) and he tried to do it again recently. And he was drunk again. He doesn’t want help, and I don’t know what to do. But last night once he was taken to the hospital, I had a new emotion which really shocked me. I wasn’t sad, I wasn’t shocked from what just happened ; but I was mad. I’m mad at the fact that he’s tried to do this again, at the fact that the whole family has to keep putting up with this shit. The fact that he doesn’t want to get help. He’s always talking about killing himself and what not, but he hasn’t done it yet. That’s how I know he doesn’t really want to die. I understand that he’s not himself, so I havnt visited him yet (he’s sober by now) 
I’m not sure what I should do. The family’s tried to baby him for a while now; but that clearly hasn’t helped. And we also can’t give him space because he hurts himself.
I’m not sure what to do. Would it be wrong to show him what I feel?",09Sep2020,1

I’m always on my phone and i’ve done things i’m not proud of with strange men. The point being i feel disgusting afterwards. I also post provocatively on social media for attention and when i don’t get as much as i like i become depressed it’s like a high. I currently have all my friends blocked because they refused to call for a few days since they were busy. I’ve heard all the advice but i think it’s easier said than done to start loving yourself. I am aware this is not gonna end up well and i acknowledge i have problem. I have made multiple accounts on reddit on the past where i post pictures of myself for validation. I regret it afterwards.

I have NEVER been disproved on my huntches. Always proved right. The truth comes out in subtle ways. I've met pathological liars, who aren't scared or ashamed even if they're caught, and I still know. Other people know based on evidence and how well they know a person. I get a specific feeling, in my head it's just the lying feeling and there are different types of it. Embarassed lying, lying to protect someones feelings, selfish lying, sometimes they lie to hurt others or even just to create a fake persona when theyre around others. People test me to see what I believe, I go along with it, then they show me their true colors. I'd probably be an excellent judge, investigator, therapist etc. It just doesn't make me happy to know these things. Not saying I never want to know, just not all the time. I guess I'm stuck with it

1059,"19M and 18 F. So like many, I just started college last month. It’s hit me like a fucking truck. The content is easier than my high school courses but I’m easily spending anywhere from 6-12 hours every day either working at my job or doing schoolwork. All of this of course lead to lots of stress and a pinch of depression in realization that I will never get to relax again for several months and will constantly be worrying about what’s due next. And getting assignments done. 

This heightened stress level with me as well as my gf led her to believe we should take a week or so staying at home, getting stuff done, and “rebalancing.” So we’re not as stressed and negative when we’re around each other. That all makes sense. 

So I have very few friends. She also emphasized that I need to find “other outlets for my stress” so she’s not constantly hearing my rants. I’ve always felt like if I’ve got something going on, she should be the one I talk to about it. And vice versa. On the other hand, she feels like talking about minor problems and ranting is a burden she’d be putting on me, so she reserves that for her friends. But I feel she should be the one I can talk to about stuff. She told me that my life is currently so stressful, just hearing about it stresses her out. But to me, it kinda makes me feel like I should hide my feelings more so she doesn’t get overwhelmed.

So we just started this period we’re spending “rebalancing.” She calls it a break but emphasized that it’s not a break she just doesn’t have a better word for it. This still gives me chills because imo, most couples that take a “break” don’t stay together long after. I have personal experience in that field. It makes me feel bad that the thing she thinks is best for our relationship is time spent apart. It makes me think “what good relationship benefits from time apart?” 

So there’s that. And recently today she hung out with a guy friend she’s hung out with before. But I’m sitting here thinking “aren’t we supposed to be staying in and being productive to relieve stress.” her going out makes me feel like feel like I’m the problem when she said I wasn’t. I don’t understand why her and I can’t hang out if we’re both free. If she just goes out with friends it makes me feel like she didn’t want to “get on schedule and rebalance herself with school” instead that she just wanted time away from me. Which of course is not a good feeling. I feel like if we have time for friends we have time for each other. The whole point of the thing was because we didn’t have time for each other for a second. 

I don’t know how to deal with this. Please help.",09Sep2020,1
1060,"Ok so there’s no way I can write out all the bullshit my family has put me through. But my mom killed herself over it so trust me when I say it’s a bunch of shit and these people are toxic. 

My family has made me miserable, made drama where there was none, gaslight the fuck out of me and put me down for fun. The problem is they don’t know they’re doing it. They’re completely oblivious and think they’re in the right and I’m the one who sucks. Which makes it hard to be firm with them because they are only trying to help (while massively fucking shit up instead). The live hours away from me across the state so they main source of contact is calling/social media. I got pregnant in January and since then it’s been awful, they expect me to constantly check in with them like I’m a child. They give me outdated unsolicited advice. And they use my son against me saying I need to do this or that and I’ll never be a good parent if I don’t. It bugged me a lot but they’re family and they genuinely mean well. They just suck and they don’t know it. 

As a side note, they escaped a really bad fire a few years ago that demolished their town, and I believe it was the catalyst for their ramped up shitty behavior. I offered as much support as I could and they used it as a way to get people to give them more attention and time than normal. They never dealt with any trauma it caused them and they let it fester into really unhealthy obsessions (obsessing over others and all the things wrong in their life (that they caused almost 99% themselves)) 

Well this summer I took a break from the world (social media/my phone) due to stress of my husbands job and the protests/sad current events affecting my pregnancy and they completely lost it saying I did it all because of them. They threw an insane fit and made a crazy amount of drama so I decided I was done with them. 

I ignored their calls and wrote them letters saying I was no longer available by phone or social media to them. Snail mail is ok and should be used for updates and light subjects. No drama or I’d cut the snail mail also. I planned to updated them on major life accomplishments/holidays. I sent them a thank you note also for something they had gifted me (strings attached) and they wrote “return to sender” and didn’t even open it. I took that as they don’t want to hear from me. I still planned to stay true to my word and update every so often.

It’s been a few months and it feels so good. They haven’t sent anything and I can only imagine they’re just angry, which I will take over sad any day. The guilt would get to me. I genuinely couldn’t care less what happens to them. I do feel guilty but I know they’re toxic and I stood up for myself and my mom would have been proud. 

Fast forward to now. My due date is a month away, and the fires on the west coast are insane. From a friend I heard their town is under a possible evacuation warning as there’s a fire near them. I still don’t follow the news so I’m only now catching on. 

Do I call them? I’m afraid to open myself back up to them but I’m also afraid if he a shitty family member if I didn’t check in. I’m just so afraid they’ll guilt me into letting them back in and them start using me again. But I know they don’t mean to so I’d seem heartless if I didn’t. The last fire was really hard on me and they made my life hell. I’m hesitant for that to happen again on top of everything else in my life. 

I have my own fire related things to worry about. I’m showing early signs of labor and my husband is a first responder and has been put on emergency alert making him essentially mobile to all the fires with no days off on top of 12-17 hour shifts. There’s fires in every direction from me and the smoke is awful. My husband might miss my early labor, and I might have to evacuate with a newborn and my dog all alone without any help. Although me evacuating is extremely unlikely I’m in a good spot even if the other fires are kinda close. 

I don’t have the energy for their bullshit but it seems completely wrong to not reach out when they could lose everything all over again.

1063,"I have had the same core group of friends since high school. Unfortunately, having moved back home due to covid, I have been spending a lot more time with them lately than I have in the past couple years. It has proven to be very detrimental to my mental health.

I have one friend who is literally a pathological liar. She twists scenarios in her head to fit her own narrative when she sees fit. She is an expert at gaslighting. She has a huge problem with admitting she's ever wrong. Not to mention, she never listens when I talk, and she's just outright rude all the time. This friend in particular has been giving me anxiety, especially after a recent event in which I tried to calmly, kindly voice my concern about her being so mean. I told her that it makes me anxious to be in such a negative environment where me and my friends are constant victims of her outbursts. I got an explosive, angry, hurtful response in return in which she gaslighted me plenty and told me I'm a mean, insensitive person. She also said, ""if you know I'm going through something right now, it shouldn't bother you if I'm being mean."" Wtf? That is not how a friend should respond if a friend voices genuine concern about the way you're treating them.

I have another friend who is genuinely so insecure, self conscious, and scared of everything that it's hard to be around her. I have been her friend for over 10 years and have grown somewhat used to it, but she just creates such a tense, uncomfortable energy that is just not enjoyable to be around. (Trust me, I understand anxiety - I am diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder. Anyone with severe anxiety would admit that it can be a burden to the people around them if they don't manage it properly.) She also tends to get snappy and mean, and throws shade at me on social media, even though I'm supposed to be her best friend. I know for a fact that she lowkey has it out for me. She has always been jealous of me and has talked about me a great deal to my other friends.

The last friend I will rant about in this post is very similar to the first friend I mentioned, but less of a liar and more of a mean-spirited manipulator. I get very shady vibes from her most of the time and can sense that she doesn't fully support all of my endeavors in life. She isn't the happiest person, and I know that's the root of her rudeness, but it's still no excuse.

I only have one other close friend, plus my partner. My close friend isn't even the greatest; he is very easily manipulated by all of the aforementioned friends and will often take their side over mine. I question his loyalty sometimes.

Bottom line: what do you do when your *only* *friends* suck? I am a grown adult who can make my own decisions, and I know that. But if I start distancing myself, these friends aren't the type to just let it happen. They will question me, start shit with me, and be mean to me. I can't even imagine the lies and exaggerations they will tell about me to other people in their life. I can just picture an ever-growing angry mob of people who hate me.",09Sep2020,1
