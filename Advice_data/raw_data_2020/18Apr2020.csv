3,"i've had a couple uti's in the past so the symptoms are familiar to me, and recently i've felt a slight burning feeling when i pee and sometimes have to pee frequently with only a bit coming out. it's not every single time i pee, there have been like a few times i've peed and it didn't burn but then the next time it did, so i'm pretty sure i'm at the early stages of a uti, but the issue is that i can't go to a doctor to get antibiotics because i'm worried if i go to a doctor i'll end up with covid-19, and my mom would not stop giving me s\*\*t for having to go, so i'm begging anyone who knows how i can treat this uti at home so i don't have to go to a doctor, please tell me what i can do besides drinking a lot of water",18Apr2020,2
4,"The other night I did something I never thought I’d do and I came out to two people, my older brother and a friend. I really wish I didn’t, I don’t feel comfortable being gay and I feel embarrassed. I don’t even think it’s anybody’s business now that I think of it. Why do I have to “come out?” Now I can’t stop thinking about what they think of me which is irrational because they are supportive but I’ve been really upset and it’s on my mind because I still want to one day maybe have a family and all that and what if I can one day make it work with a woman? I feel like I “came out” for nothing and I don’t want anybody else knowing, it feels like such a burden I don’t want to be judged I wish I could secretly be gay and have nobody know ever. I told them not to say anything so I hope they don’t go around telling people. How do I get this off my mind?",18Apr2020,6
5,"hello, i got into an argument with my father recently, and he’s kicking me out. i moved in with my parents in new jersey during quarantine, and now everything has gone sour. he’s giving me until the morning and then i need to be out of the house. i have no other family around me, and the closest person is my boyfriend and he lives in south carolina. i don’t know if he is going to be fined or stopped from coming into the state. we have both been quarantined for two weeks, so i’m not entirely sure if he can just come get me and leave the state and it’ll all be okay. does anyone know what i can do? should he just come get me? sorry for not making sense, i’m pretty upset. is it worth him getting fined or will he be fined at all?",18Apr2020,1
6,"I have been losing weight to be in a healthy weight range for 8 months now and I just feel like my dad is trying to sabotage me. 

I have issues with eating when I'm board it's just something to do so I would rather there not be foods in the house that I eat when I'm board (chocolate and sugary food) so I ask him to not buy it explaining that I do eat when I'm boared and he knows this. He still buys it though today we went shopping and I bought a 6 pack of lucozade (to try and wean my self off it pathetic I know) and he came back with 3 large bottles. Now facing the current climate I would not want this, I wouldn't even want this if we wornt facing covid 19.

Also since my country started enforcing stricter rules on going out hes started sort of panic buying. What I mean by this is jes buying enough for a month every weekly shop but only in foods. So if I eat 3 pizzas a month he has a bitch fit until I pick up 6 and then when we dont have room or I dont eat them he has another bitch fit. Idk how many noodles he has bought in the last 2 months all I know is we've never had a low number. I eat them because I like them and they're quite low syns but the number we have had has never went down like if they're is 20 in the kitchen they're is always 20 when I eat 1 pack he buys another 3. I just think this is really weird.

 Or if I ask him to stop buying chocolate he will go out and buy 3 bars and stash them in his room then leave them out one day. And before anyone says well what if he wants it, we dont eat the same foods he dosnt like any sugary foods or drinks. 

Also I was talking to my older brother (not his son) and his gf about my weight loss and he came in listening to the conversation and said ""I hope you doing this in a healthy way"" hes never mentiond my weight loss before this point but my family and I have theorized it's just to save face.

9,"Throwaway account cause I have family members as friends on my main one, and I don't want this to explode. My dad is generally a good father, but as a husband I can totally understand he's a piece of shit. As I said, he's cheated on my mom twice, why she's stuck around I do not know. He's never laid a finger on either of us, but when confronting him about all his shady stuff he'll get extremely violent, break things, threaten us and leave the house for a few days. Just now while we were watching a movie I caught a glimpse of his phone screen. There was a picture of tits and a message sent by him saying something along the lines of ""wanting her head between his legs"". It was extremely uncomfortable to read but most importantly, I felt sick that he would do such a thing being 50 years old and married. If it was porn or something else I get it, but this is a person he has on his personal phone, messaging through whatsapp. I'm really debating rn whether or not it's worth it to bring it up. If I do, hell will most certainly break loose. Idk what to do



Update: I said fuck it and talked to him. He reacted and took it very well. It turns out it was a group chat he has with some friends that sometimes send nudes they find online and they all make lusty comments. He was ashamed that I found out but showed me the chat himself, and I can confirm it was indeed the picture and message I saw. He apologised multiple times about what he has done before and what he has caused us, but apparently things are okay for now. Thanks everyone who gave your advice",18Apr2020,2

I spoke to a therapist often, and I was being told to think things through before making such a big decision. It has been a few years, and I have become very serious about it, and have been telling my therapist that transitioning is something that I want.

My aunt is one of the few family members that never lies to me or puts me down in any way. I came out to her as being trans, and she openly accepted it, and told me she would support me in any way she can.

My mother on the other hand, she always made me wear boyish clothes, and do boyish things. She once caught me wearing my big sister's clothes as a kid and hit me across the back for it.

25,"Sorry for any formatting issues, I’m on mobile! 

Tl;dr: I am bridesmaid for my friend alongside 2 others. They’re wanting the hen weekend to be on this particular Spanish island. I was attacked  on holiday there age 18. AITA for asking them if they would consider changing destination or not attending? 

I’ve been asked to be bridesmaid for one of my
Oldest friends which is amazing!! I absolutely adore my friend and am SO excited for all things wedding! 

Until I spoke with another bridesmaid earlier today who revealed that she and the other bridesmaid are intending to plan the hen weekend on a particular Spanish island. 

I went on holiday to this island age 18 on my first girls holiday... all was going well until an argument with my friends left me alone... I went to a bar on my own to calm down and to be a bit of an asshole and ‘teach them a lesson by going missing for a while’... that mistake would cause me a great deal of emotional pain for, well, it feels like the rest of my life. 
What he did was awful and I don’t think I’ll ever be truly ‘over it’ 

Anyway, I have dealt with it best I can and I think I will go if it absolutely HAS to be this particular island.... but would I be wrong to ask if there’s any way it could be a different island? 

I’m close with one of the other bridesmaids and I know the bride would be mortified if she knew the distress this has caused me today. I’ve cried so many times, it’s stirred up a lot so I wouldn’t want to ruin her weekend if I did go and it was too painful.... but then it’s her wedding, it’s her weekend and I love her so much I want to be there with her to celebrate her special time!. 

Please be kind if you think I am wrong, it’s just brought up a lot of emotions. Thank you!",18Apr2020,0
27,"Hi, I know I posted on here but I just wanted to know how to find a cat if it possibly has wandered into the woods? My family friend’s lost cat has been out for 2 weeks now, he is 3 years old, was a previously wild cat before he was found and neutered then adopted. He is chipped and had a collar if it is still on him. 

We’ve been checking around the area and we think we may have possibly heard him in the woods, but were unable to get in as it is a very swampy area with too many plants and trees in the way for us to get in and check. What is the likelihood of a cat going into the woods? They also live near an elementary school that is in front of the woods and we’ve been checking around. 

We brought some tuna out and had nothing show up, but we don’t know if it was because he couldn’t smell it or not. We’ve had his toys and litter along with some shirts outside the apartment to maybe help him find his way back.

29,"My parents have had a rocky marriage for about 8 years. I have recently been informed of the potential of a divorce and am struggling with how I should feel about the situation. For context, I’m 21 years old, still living at home, and have an 18 year old brother.

Aforementioned, 8 years ago my parents were on the brink of divorce because my mother had been recklessly spending money, was extremely verbally abusive to me and my father, and was cheating on my dad. After all of that blew over, I was under the impression that my dad had forgiven her and the two of them were going to continue working on their marriage.

My mother has Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and the two of us have had a horrific relationship with each other up until the last 2.5 years. She has drastically changed her behavior and I have also been working towards maintaining a healthy relationship with her because I see her trying. In terms of her relationship with my dad, she has also changed, now acting like the wife he thought he would have when they got married. My dad on the other hand is much more prone to yelling, getting angry with her, and having apathy towards her in general. I can’t blame him, it’s just tough to witness them break each other down.

My dad informed me that the reason he didn’t file for divorce back then was because he never would have won custody and didn’t want his children alone with a psychotic mother. Apparently, she continued cheating with the same man years after, only stopping about 4-5 years ago. When my dad found out about the cheating once again, he told my mother that was the last straw. He has completely fallen out of love with her and told me that he has only stayed in this marriage to financially afford college for both me and my brother. After we both graduate, he is filing for divorce. He has also made his intentions very clear with my mother, but she is living in a fantasy and refuses to face the reality that their marriage has been over for a long time. Now she cries and doesn’t understand why my dad acts so cold towards her and doesn’t understand why he won’t change his behavior.

For all of this time, all of these years, he has maintained the image of father and husband, acting like everything is normal. I understand why he is doing this and has done this, but I really don’t know what to make of it for myself. Now that I know this information, how am I supposed to act like nothing is wrong? How am I also supposed to pretend that there isn’t a gigantic elephant in the room?

I have finally come to terms with most of the terrible things my mother did to me in childhood in order to forge this relationship with her, but now that it is all brought to the surface again, I feel hurt and confused. She always says that everything she does is to keep her family together, she said it to me recently, but how could she mean that? My dad gave her a second chance and she impulsively spit in his face. I recognize that she is a changed person, and is actively much much better, but that doesn’t change what happened. And yet, I feel bad for her. It is very sad to see her so broken by this when she has made an effort to change. The marriage should have ended before we got to this point.

***How do I maintain the charade of a stable family while knowing all of this?***

He hasn't given me reason to be distrustful or to be concerned about him doing something wrong, but i can't shake the feeling.

38,"Okay so I'm a 17 year old girl so this does at first sound like some petty teenage argument but hear me out:

So at the start of this year I had three main best friends who I did everything with. We threw parties regularly together, told each other basically everything (I assume), went shopping together etc. I knew deep down it wasn't going to work out as we all had different life paths we wanted to go through. However I was waiting until University for this. 

Then, I had an argument with one of them in Mid-February and havent really spoken to her since, other than trying to be friendly with her since. By this I mean whenever I saw her in college on her own I'd offer to keep her company, or even just say hi in corridors (despite being ignored most of the time). Obviously I'm not perfect, the reason for our initial argument was a self indulgent one on my part and I'll be the first to admit that. In my defence however, this particular friend had a new boyfriend and she was completely ignoring us for him, which irritated me a bit because, well, who likes to be ignored?

Now I know its obviously just my word saying this, however I wouldnt come on advice blog and lie. I try my hardest after this fiasco to compliment and big up these two other friends, because now I understand where it went wrong with the other one. I understood that now I need to try and empathise more and be less blunt about my feelings as some other people may be sensitive about them. I feel as though I grew as a person from this. 

Now, in the last 48 hours both of these other two friends, completely out of the blue decided to end the friendship, even though prior to this we were having fun.  By this I mean laughing, joking, sending memes; the casual teenage things. The first one, the one I was closest to, did this the day after my birthday. The worst part was I was arguing with my dad at the time, though this did make me apologise to him. The weird part was she mentioned the other friend, and my ""appalling treatment of them"", even though I hadn't spoken to her in months. She promptly blocked me, leaving me confused and honestly quite hurt. Not sad though, I didn't like her enough to mourn her loss, it's simply hurtful that someone could blame me for their mental health problems even though they were nothing to do with me.

This second friend just tonight ended it, apparently what friend #1 said made sense, and that everyone in her life told me she shouldn't be friends with me. 

I do have other friends of course, but these ones in particular I was closest to, and now I just feel a bit lost. Fortunately we're in quarantine so it doesnt affect me too much yet, I just worry about how I'll be affected after this quarantine is over.

I don't know, what to do it all just feels strange. It may sound conspiratorial of me, but I feel as though the initial friend who left had something to do with it. Especially since they both had conversations with her where she said ""I miss you"".

Please give me advice on what i should do next, it's really impacted my self esteem and just makes me feel like not ever want to open up. If these people can't accept me for who I am then who will (friend wise)

So, this means I'm probably gonna close myself off to people now because honestly it really is scary to think that no one wants to be my friend because of who I am?

And I wonder how people are so easily fake? Just lying to my face for a prolonged period of time so casually?",18Apr2020,1

Im obviously not gonna tell them all since its too much but they all happened at a young age, and ive been to therapy since i was 7. I always get comments on how I sometimes act like a child, or childish or maybe talk like a child and i feel like i grew up too fast. Shit, i havent even finished school yet and i feel like im OLD! Also, I thought in 5th grade that i was gonna be like dead by now, so i stopped caring about my school work, so im not too sure about my future like at all, and now i feel a little trapped, almost like i have to do it now. I just dont wanna end up like my father.
Im in psychotherapy, have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety and im also on medication!
Ive felt such bad boredom like for many years now, its like i wake up and just feel so bored, but its not like I really wanna do anything, i just feel anxious but in a bored way? Does that make sense? I also have bad mood swings and I sometimes get really irritated over something stupid and for example scratch or bite myself really hard or break something, usually my phone or something in my room. Now i know these are normal emotions but ive had these feelings inside me for too many years and i havent talked to anyone about it, because it feels so fucking extreme and its hard to explain. Now im not looking for a “diagnosis”, obviously, but whats the matter with me? I feel like im so fake and not real. And I obviously use drugs, if that explains anything?  im just confused please help.",18Apr2020,2

47,"I (23M) recently convinced my boyfriend (24M) of adopting a cat we had been seeing in videos posted by the local shelter.  The cat seemed very sweet, I'd always wanted a cat, and we are both working from home so I thought why not.  I kinda pressured my boyfriend because he wasn't really sure about taking on the responsibility, but he finally gave in and we adopted the cat.

Now, it's been a week and I'm miserable.  I have an anxiety disorder and I'm not handling the disruption to my daily routine very well.  The cat requires a lot of attention and cries often and wakes us up early.  Logically, I knew to expect this prior to getting the cat.  However, realistically, I didn't anticipate my reaction to the disruption.  Now I'm struggling emotionally with little mini panic attacks while my boyfriend is happily bonding with the cat.

48,"Throwaway time! So, I’m 17 years old and in my final year of high school. For background, my parents are Indonesian and Singaporean immigrants to Portugal, where I was born, and they are really devout Muslims. However, ever since I was young, I wasn’t into religion (not an atheist tho). My parents don’t seem to get that and force me into practicing something I just don’t believe in. 

A week ago, I gathered my courage and told them that I was not Muslim. Parents didn’t take that lightly and berated me. Told me that I should be shameful and that “I’m going to hell” and accused me of being gay, which I’m not. Eventually after hours of fighting, I was kicked out the house and told to never come back because I’m going to be disowned.

More background, my parents wanted me to eventually marry one of my mom’s friend’s daughter back in Singapore right after I graduate whether I liked it or not, but I didn’t want to leave my entire life for a woman I never met before.  Whenever I mentioned that I should meet that person before deciding to marry or that I’m way too young to get married, I’d always get the typical “no, you’re old enough. What are you? A kid?” Or “you want to meet? do you know premarital sex is a sin?”

I’m writing this at my friend’s house. He was accepting enough to have me practically living with him and his mom. I literally have nothing on me. No money, no clothes. I only have a phone (parents didn’t let me get at least money to live off of). So I’m particularly lost. Don’t know what to do with his situation. I tried of thinking of a reconciliation with my parents but my older brother and sister told me our parents are now telling my younger brother that I’m a bad influence ( never did anything wrong honestly) and he should never talk to me because “I’m the devil”, so I thought of ignoring them.

So should I try to reconcile with parents although they are practically brainwashing a child or should I just live with my friend (he’s okay with that) and seek an offer his girlfriend is offering me after high school in America. Video editing work, not the shit you’re thinking about lol. Shit’s definitely hard especially with that’s going on with the world these days.

53,"When it comes to my life I’m a stressed anxiety induced person who fears mostly anything that exists. I can’t live with uncertainty it’s not a possibility if I can control it I’ll control it.

A couple of examples would be me constantly checking the locks on my door in a ritual fashion turning the locked knob a certain amount of times to put my mind at ease, or for my phone I check if it’s plugged in multiple times or if the alarm is on multiple times or if the fridge is closed multiple times or if the water is turned off multiple times, you get the picture. Even though I know it’s off or working or whatever I need to check multiple times because what if I miss my alarm? What if the door was left open and someone breaks in? What if my phone doesn’t charge?

It works the same with people, when I meet new people or need to talk to people I become very anxious. Once I met a guy on Yolo and everything went too fast, he send “tease pics” and moved fast and I had panic attacks every night and blocked him and called it manipulation after I told him I was anxious and he kept saying it was alright.

With non-romantic relations I can’t even talk to people, what if they hate me? What if I come off as desperate, annoying, stupid? What happens if we stop talking after a few days? How do I keep the interest of this person? And most of the time it’s “how can I find friends” since I’d never walk up to someone and randomly begin talking.

I feel stressed often so to release stress I do what any man does... I sin, but to minimize uncertainty I’ve began praying when I sin to create certainty and it’s built a dependence on praying, and whenever I sin I rely on it to be my certainty creating stress which leads me to jerking and it’s endless cycle.

What’s a better way to cope with uncertainty and stop the constant checking of appliances, or lack of social skills? It’s become so bad that I can’t cook because I’ll think I would have left the stove on. It’s become too stressful, and I can’t deal with it on my own so I’ve asked for advice on what steps to take to improve myself and become a “normal teen” because I feel anything but normal.",18Apr2020,1
54,"So, starting a few weeks ago, I got a new friend. Aaaaand have quickly come to find he's an absolute energy vampire. Not intentionally, which is why I feel bad for feeling so exhausted toward talking to him, but I can't help but feel drained every time we talk for more than a couple minutes.

He speaks openly about how he doesn't like himself and how he refuses to take care of himself, and being me, I get very concerned and I try to get him to take care of himself, but it never works, but if I don't try to get him to take care of himself or only give him an obvious response;

(I.e, when he says a certain artist's music makes him think of his ex and how he doesn't like it, I suggest he doesn't listen to the artist) 

He calls me a bully and gets upset.

I feel bad because he doesn't mean to, and the one time I did bring up an issue with him he thought I hated him, and I don't want to hurt him simply by setting my boundaries.

I don't know, I just feel like a bad friend. Of course I haven't said anything to him or eluded to how drained he makes me feel, but still, I feel like a bad friend even thinking these things. What do I do???",18Apr2020,2

I'll add some info about me first. I am 17 and male. I am a high-school senior. I have a good and together family. I have a few close friends and I don't have a girlfriend. I have a history of some minor depression and anxiety but, I don't think this is a part of that. I go to a therapist every month and I have told her about this.

I have just felt so empty in the last few months.

It just seems that every time I finally get to my goals, I just end up feeling worse. I always hope that it will be different, but my sense of euphoria after finally fulfilling my goals has completely gone away.

59,"I was having a discussion with my dad about how I saw a post on reddit claiming that the word ""cracker"" was a slur against white people, and I don't believe it is (this particular post was comparing it to the N-word and crazy shit like that). 

My dad said ""Well it is a slur."" and I was like, ""It's not, there is no history of slavery, abuse, dehumanization, brutalization, and disgusting murder behind the word cracker like there is with the N-word"" to which he replied ""Well there's different degrees of slurs, like a 99.5 degree fever is still a fever, just like a 101 fever is still a fever."" And I said that the word ""slur,"" while defined as any word that's derogatory, has certain connotations that need to be taken into account when using it to describe other words, such as the F-slur or the N-word. He still was arguing with me that ""calling it a slur doesn't compare it to the N-word"" so I tried using the John Mulaney bit where ""we're saying the word cracker, and we won't even say what the N-word is."" And then he said the actual N-word, and goes, ""Yeah, I've heard that argument before."" 

I've never heard him say the N-word ever and even though he's conservative and I'm a leftist, he definitely respects and advocates for women's rights/gay rights (mostly because I constantly talk about it to him, because I think it's his responsibility as a cishet white rich man). It really upset me. I left the room to go to my room saying ""You're not allowed to say it."" And he said something like ""I'm \*allowed\* to say whatever I want.""

64,"So, I'm writing you all today because of a predicament that's been plaguing my mind these past couple months. If anybody could offer any sort of advice, I would greatly appreciate it.

I just want to start off by saying that my mental health has always been a priority for me. I struggled with it a few years back, and I learned that I have to take care of my mind at times, and that's okay. Well, lately I've kinda fallen into a hole, as have many people during this time I'm assuming.

So I am 18 years old and have worked at this Canadian fast food place for over a year now. It was great at the start, decent hours and decent management. I managed to save enough to buy myself a car, which now I pay about $250/month on insurance for (relevant later). Well, everything changed when my manager got promoted and in stepped my two new managers, who I'll call Anne and Patt for identification sake. Patt is alright, though she gets incredibly verbally aggressive towards the staff if anybody makes any sort of mistake. But I deal with it. Anne is with whom I have my quarrels.

Anne has screamed at me for pointless matters (dropping a pen, asking to switch positions with a coworker who was willing, etc), to the point where she has made me cry. If you knew me, you'd know that making me cry is definitely a hard thing to do.

I absolutely hate working there. My shifts are absurdly busy because we are understaffed and people are rushing out to eat more than ever (crazy. I know.). I've been pushed to my limits with Anne, and before all this coronavirus stuff, I heavily considered quitting. 

I want to quit. I have to quit for my own sanity, but I can't because of my parents as well as my car payments and university in the fall. I can't get another job, because everything is shut down and if I started work at a grocery store I feel like that would be worse.

I've worked here longer than almost everyone else (even my managers) and yet I'm treated like garbage just because of my age. I'm always kind, I smile and am polite, yet still they're awful to me. Everyone tells me to not let it bother me, but I'd be lying to say that it doesn't.

Is this just how teenage jobs work? Am I overreacting? Should I just suck it up and work until everything opens back up again? Please. Those looking in with an unbiased perspective, what should I do?",18Apr2020,2

I have her number saved and a week later she popped up under “people you may know” on insta so I followed her and she followed me back right away.

I’ve told them it’s just going to make me more overweight but they don’t listen.

Then the other day me and my mum picked a diet plan together and then after a week of making progress she gave up and started buying unhealthy foods again which made me lose my motivation again. I honestly felt I was going somewhere with my self confidence and I’m not now.

Then she says we are going on a diet again and then goes and buys packs of chocolate again. And about exercise, I hate going on walks by myself. I feel like I’m going to be ugly forever and not be able to become healthier. I’m honestly starting to worry about having health problems in the future.

71,"TL;DR: reconnected with a friend. they told me that I was part of their reason for wanting to commit suicide and then told me we shouldn't talk anymore. wondering if I should reach back out.

When I was in high school, I was friends with this person. For reasons I won't go into, we lost contact with each other. Fast forward some years, we reconnected and it was great. At first, that is. I noticed that the dynamic of the conversations would change. Any time we would talk about memories of the past, it turned into an argument or became awkward. I just felt like something was bothering them, like they held something against me.

Well, I brought it up one day and it basically turned into a giant argument. They got so upset with me and basically told me that years ago, they were depressed and suicidal and a big part of it was because we lost touch. I had no idea about any of that...the depression, the suicidal thoughts - any of it. I wanted to talk more about it since it was clearly such a serious thing. But they didn't want to talk about it and basically told me that we shouldn't talk anymore.

That was some time ago and I've always gone back and forth on reaching out to them again. It completely caught me off guard. I had no idea they ever felt that way. It honestly made me feel so terrible, especially since I'm already a sensitive person. It made me feel like I completely let them down. It upset me at the time that they didn't even want to hear me out after I sat there and listened to them. But after I thought about it, it was probably just a tough thing to talk about and they shut down.

I just wonder if reaching back out after letting time pass would be okay. Would they welcome it? Or would it be met with animosity? I don't know.  I honestly just want to make things right with them, but I don't know if they would even want that.",18Apr2020,1

I’ve been praising it and telling her that it’s great and she would have a lot of fun. I asked her to promise be to check it out and she never did. This happens a lot. I’ll recommend something and she’ll say she would check it out, promises that she would, but never does. I recommend these things because I want her to be happy, to enjoy some things that bring me so much happiness, to share my happiness.

She also does this thing where whenever we hang out with a certain group of people I feel lonely, she’ll talk to them about anything and everything and they’ll all walk together down the street. And I’ll be behind them, trailing along or being the fourth person, all three of them close-knit. Like whenever I talk they’ll acknowledge it and then go right back to talking like I never spoke. I just feel like they don’t care, and I’m a nuisance and they wish I weren’t here so they could talk to the people they actually want to.

This also happens with another person. Once I was sitting near that person and she sat next to her, with me right there, and didn’t talk to me, didn’t even look at me.

89,"I'm (20m) a very short guy (165cm/5'5"") and it makes me depressed. Most of my guy friends are ~180cm/5'11"". When I was younger, some girls used to be proud comparing their height to mine and realized they're taller than me, and/or feeling sorry for me. 

In my early teens (14-15) mom and sis would always tell me I'd probably grow a few centimeters over the summer(s) and stuff, but it never happened. I've been the same height since then.

I'm just really sad about this fact and can't really cope with it. Any advice?",18Apr2020,1

Since I work at a nursing home I have an essential job so I'm working and making maybe 250 a week. How do I deal with this complete unfairness. I know I sound ungrateful but it's just blowing my mind that I'm working 5 days a week and making loads less than her while she sits at home all day. I know life isn't fair but this is just ridiculous. How would you deal with this. Get over it? But howww?",18Apr2020,1

I am 13 and a girl.

While writing this right now he is texting me.

This friend used to be my best friend in 2018, but we fought last year and stopped being friends.

Recently (late 2019/ present) we started talking through text message, at first it was kinda fun to talk to him, well, until he got mad at the littlest things, and blocked me.

The second time we talked for a while, but I noticed that he wasn't respecting my boundaries that much, he was texting me at 3:00AM expecting me to answer (Btw, I was sleeping because I was going to start school in the morning), and when I didn't answer, he would get all dramatic.

We aways talked for hours (and I aways felt annoyed). There was one time we talked for 4 HOURS when I was supposed to be SLEEPING, and all this time I was feeling annoyed and forced to talk

Everytime I got ANY notification I got MAD because of him

I stopped talking to him that much, and he blocked me because of this, and then we didn't talk for some months

Some other months ago we started talking again, but he was:

1-texting me all the time
2-getting dramatic if I didn't
+3-only talking about HIS interests, ONLY his insterests, when I tried to talk about mine, he would try to make the conversation about him again


Same thing happened, didn't talk too much, and got blocked


Nowadays we are talking again, and he still only talk about his interests and his hobbies, text me all the time and getting dramatic, but now I feel forced to compliment his work (he does some computer generated music, it's good, but he thinks is the Bach of this generation, he is ""not like the other boys"")

I feel like an animal crossing character, aways being forced to compliment and be nice with him, and if I don't, he gets all dramatic, I honestly don't feel like myself when I am around him, I feel like a robot who is forced to talk, compliment and laugh at his memes.
I also feel like a compliment machine, everytime he makes a new song, I HAVE to say something about it

I feel like telling the truth is quite risky, because he is DEFINETLY going to get mad, and I don't want him mad.

I still get a little annoyed when I recieve a notification from Whatzapp.

I just, don't want to talk to him anymore, for me, the friendship is over, it's forced, it's not fun anymore.

How can I tell him that without him getting mad or without starting a discussion? Or, is there any other thing I can do?

I hope I explained this situation well, if you have any questions or anything, feel free to ask :)

EDIT: everyone on the comment section helped a lot, I will not block him now because I am still scared about him getting mad, but I think I need to talk to someone

EDIT 2: I feel like deleting this post, I don't know if the friend uses reddit",18Apr2020,2

97,"There’s this guy I was friends with a year and a half ago. I won’t go into detail, but basically me and his girlfriend (who was also my friend at the time) got into a fight over something I had no control over, and she essentially ended our friendship. She told him to stop talking to me for her “mental health.” He obliged as long as she was around, but she was next to him pretty much all the time, so he and I almost never talked. It really bothered me, because he could have had both of us in his life, but he chose to have her over me because she asked him to. The whole situation was very complex and emotional for me, and both the things she said and the way he responded still bother me to this day. 

I recently got Instagram, and the guy followed me the next day. A big part of me wants to reach out, but I know he’s still with his girlfriend. I worry that he’ll just stop talking to me all over again, or that we won’t be able to have the deep conversations we did back then. I really don’t know what to do.

With the Coronavirus going around, she's been feeling worse and since we have to self isolate, I can't see her in person to help her. What can I do over text? People who suffer from depression and anxiety, would you get annoyed if one of your friends were to check up on you over text ever couple of days or so?

So I have diabetes and with that comes my high blood pressure which I take medications for both. I’ve read that they make me a high risk for more severe complications and even death if I catch the coronavirus. Since I work in a popular fast food change we haven’t had a hard hit in sales so they aren’t laying people off. I know that I am privilege in that sense but the stress of knowing that my chances are so much higher is messing with my physical and mental health. I asked what I am able to do and they told me that because I’m basically asking to be laid off and my hours aren’t getting deducted that they will say I have quit which really doesn’t help when I need the financial support to live. I don’t want to loose my job but I’m also concerned for my life.

101,"Okay so this sounds really stupid and petty but pretty much every time my girlfriend posts something on her snapchat/instagram story I just can’t help but feel anxious and uneasy. It really doesn’t matter what she posts I’ll have this feeling 9 out of 10 times. I’m not worried that she’s cheating on me or anything. I think I’m insecure about something but i can’t point out exactly what. It might be that for some reason my mind gets ‘jealous’ that she’s not focusing all her time on me, which is obviously ridiculous I realise that. I know for a fact that the problem is with me but I’m not sure how to overcome this. I’ve talked to her about it, but all she said is that i should tell her when it happens and she’ll delete the story. Obviously that won’t work because then she might as well just not post but I can’t and don’t want to ask her that. Besides, that won’t fix the problem because it’s me and not her. 

Any thoughts or advice would be appreciated. I should also add that we can’t physically see each other atm because of the whole covid thing, but it’s been happening ever since we got together. Thank you!",18Apr2020,1
102,"I've been friends with this person since we were in massage school together, and in school our styles were pretty similar - both of us did a lot of deep tissue and trigger point therapy. Due to life circumstances (me going away to college, her moving out of state to be with a partner) we spent several years not interacting in person. However, as of the past year or so we've bumped into each other again and had the chance to work together a bit, including having her give me a treatment several months back.

Since then, it's clear our styles have changed a lot. She does a lot of aggressive cross-fiber frictioning - something that has a risk of making the body seize up and actually causing muscles to become more tense (whether it relaxes or agitates a muscle can be kind of situational.) I've moved further and further away from cross-fiber, usually finding ways to hold static pressure until a muscle releases. I prefer this as it's easier to assess changes in the tissue, as well as the risk of kickback pain being very low.

What makes me a bit cautious as to how to tell her is that being a massage therapist ties closer into her identity than it does for me. She really wants to be a healer, so she might take it more personally to hear that she's possibly been making peoples' issues worse. She has readily admitted that she thinks I'm the better therapist (which is slightly awkward for me, since I don't even practice all that much) so I think she would trust my judgment if I brought this up to her, but I don't want it to sound like I'm just shooting down her style of practice.",18Apr2020,1
103,"I’m a postgraduate student living near my university in a nice building. I wanted a place where it would be quiet so I can focus on my dissertation but a bit upscale with a gym, etc. Upscale=expensive, so because it’s just me and this is temporary I live in a suite type situation. 

There’s 3 micro studios, a central kitchen in the middle  and a bathroom for two studios to share. I have a master suite with my own bathroom. I only have one suite mate at the moment, and she’s in a post doctorate program in a different program. We aren’t friends and we aren’t close. We say hello when we cross paths, but that’s it. It’s all very civil. 

Here’s the issue: she stinks like a sewer. She usually smells a little when she’s going to work everyday, but she hasn’t left the apartment building for weeks, not even to go for a walk. She sleeps all day, gets up around 2 and starts to go into the kitchen. Her hair is coated in grease, she is always wearing the same tee shirt and skirt and only comes out of little her room to heat up her frozen meals. Her bathroom is across from me, so I hear when the water is running and such and she has not bathed since before the quarantine. 

I’ve become afraid to cook or eat in the kitchen because even if she leaves the room her smell lingers for several minutes. I can hardly even eat anymore. It’s not even BO- it’s like....rotting. She also wears her long, dirty hair down and in her face, so there’s long strands of hair all over the kitchen and getting tracked into my studio. It makes me gag. 

I’m not sure what to do at this point. I know she may be very depressed, lazy or just oblivious, but we aren’t close enough for me to be able to ask her if she’s mentally ok. I have a lot going on in my life and I can’t help her if she’s depressed. She doesn’t have much in the way of social skills, and it’s hard to talk to her because it’s like speaking to a 10 year old. She has a temper, so if I bring it up to her she’ll get very very heated. Should I speak to management? Ugh.",18Apr2020,1

105,"Basically, I (25M) was raised to be extremely conservative, but over the years I've grown into somewhat more liberal beliefs/attitudes.  I feel like I'm too Christian for my liberal friends and vice versa and I feel like I have nowhere to belong.  I have conservative beliefs about a lot of societal issues (pro life, traditional marriage, gun rights) but I also don't want to put myself in a little bubble in the process.  For example, I'm 100% willing to admit that I'm not totally straight, I just choose not to pursue romantic relationships period for a number of reasons.  However, especially in America, that doesn't fly and I feel like I'm either too conservative for my liberal friends and vice versa.  I just miss the days of spending the night with friends, playing video games, and not arguing about gun laws and abortion.  I keep seeing stuff on Facebook from my more openly pro life friends and its reminded me that yes, I am devoutly pro life but I'm scared to fully own up to all of my conservative beliefs for fear of losing the friends that I have things in common with and ending up with the people who agree with my sociopolitical beliefs but who come across as sticks in the mud to me sometimes.  Like I believe in traditional Christian things but I'm also the guy with a room littered with pop figures, comics, art books, video games, Persona memorabilia (one Google search should show why that's ironic) and virtually zero materials having to do with Christianity other than Bibles and books from grade school (had the same room for almost 15 years so lots of old stuff in general).  I'm not asking what side to pick on all this.

106,"I, (19M), cannot show emotion to save my life, and most of the time don't feel any. I don't know what to do. Even when I do something I like or experience something that used to full me with so much excitement, I don't feel happiness. I don't even feel remorse for bad things that happen in life. Whenever I help someone with something that is upsetting them, I honestly feel jealous that they can even feel sad. Like, hanging out with my friends, which I know should bring me joy, does not. I don't hate them, they're great friends, but it's really awkward when we do stuff together and I try to ask happy, but I know I'm making the situation awkward. This whole situation is really uncomfortable and I'm petrified that one of them will see this and think it's me. I can't show emotion to any of them because I'm afraid they'd unfriend me, sending me into a whole spiral of depression. I am not depressed, I am a very mello person, but I just don't know how to show happiness or sadness, and it makes me seem like a cold heartless shit. It has also really hurt my in relationships as I can't express how I really feel towards someone, which makes this whole situation a lot worse.

Age old discussion, but I’ve noticed that for a while, I’ll finish the shift and go home and all I really want is to go home and curl up with someone under the covers with, or snuggle on the sofa with. Just be goofy and silly with, or to hold in my arms. It sucks, because it hurts. I’m 22, and have been single since I was 16, I’m not George Clooney in terms of looks, but I don’t look like a dogs arse either. My life is good, I have a stable job, I have a moderate social life and such; but, it just hits me right in the feelings when I get home, shower and just sorta reflect that I’m really by myself. I understand I don’t need a relationship to be happy, and for the most part I’d agree. I just feel alone at times and wish I had someone to share myself with. It’s just frustrating and draining, because it’s like “I’m a good person, and do my best to be a decent human being. I don’t ask for much, but I see so and so with someone and colleague 1,2,3 with someone. Why not me? Is something wrong with me?”

It’s just a shitty feeling, and regrettably I’m making this post after a few drinks, but nonetheless it just eats away at me. It’s a shit feeling, but I can manage it. Just sorta need some advice from you guys here. Am I chatting utter shit or is what I’m saying not uncommon in single guys?

He is also unable to speak yet, making it harder to communicate with him and most of the time we (my family and I) don't know the triggers to his sudden tantrums and self-harming behaviours. 

We do take measures such as keeping the house clean and tidy, making sure that sound is minimal so that he would not get sensory overload, giving him a space to play with his toys and making sure that his routines are consistent and on time. The only issue is that his sudden tantrums are getting out of hand now during the lockdown period and we don't know what to do. Is waiting all we can do until the COVID-19 period ends? 

I need advice on how to get my brother to stop hurting himself. I know that sending him to therapy is the best option, but therapy sessions don't happen every day and I want to do my part to help too.

110,"One year ago me and my best friend of 3 years lost touch. I went to college and she stayed in my hometown so it was hard to find time to be together. I was going through a LOT at the time and was struggling to adapt to college life, so I often worried I wasn't there for her. Communication was hard and eventually I felt like the connection between us was being lost and we weren't on the same page anymore. There was nothing dramatic, no big fight or resentment but I feel in some way we were connected by negativity and our problems in life.
 I'm a very different person now, and I've finally managed to become confident and happy, but I often think about her, specially now with covid-19. I suppose she has changed a lot too and I worry that all this time apart has made our friendship unfixable.

We can go outside for walks or take a drive, but we haven’t ordered takeout or really gone out since this all began. My sister lives nearby and has been coming to the house every so often, but suggested I come and hang out since we were both busy when she would come home.

I went and actually had a lot of fun. It took my mind off a lot of stressful things, and we ended up getting takeout. I’ll be honest, we weren’t as smart as we could have been. Like we didn’t wipe stuff down and probably shouldn’t have gotten anything at all, but we did. I have the suspicion my sister has been doing this throughout quarantine while also coming over to our house.

I told the truth to my parents and they freaked out. My mom talked to me when I got home and was calmer.

It’s more than I usually make at my job so I am definitely not complaining, especially as I’m home with my kids and not exposing anyone to anything. One of the stipulations is that we have to apply for jobs, but here’s my problem: I was interviewed and offered a job making 50c less an hour than my normal job. If I take it, I lose the $600 a week bonus and will effectively be making less to be out working and being exposed to illness. If I don’t take it, though, I’m afraid the unemployment office will kick me off for refusing a job. When we do get back to work, which is going to be August since it’s at an educational facility, I’m going to need a second job to make ends meet.

116,"So I'm kind of in a pickle. I'm single and I have no friends, and therefore no social life and nobody to talk to. I find myself not eating much and just focused on pouring all of my mustered energy into my job and exercise- which seems great on the surface, but it's still an empty life.   


I grew up in a rough house, with an abusive father and an alcoholic mother. Neither is capable of caring for a home... with a house that probably qualifies as some form of hoarding and often has a crusty carpet covered in dog shit and piss. I have to wear shoes outside my room to avoid stepping in something. I didn't have many friends growing up and I hardly ever got invited over to anyone's house. There was 1 real friend I had most of my life that lived across the street from me.   


I had my first girlfriend when I was 18 and nearing the end of high school. It felt like time stopped when I met her. I don't know how to explain the feelings I have for her, especially the thing where I look in her eyes and my insides feel all melty and I just can't seem to talk right. She left me by text a day shy of 8 months... after my dad drove her away by treating her like utter garbage, texting her and being up her ass yelling at her and insulting her almost 24/7. He would not leave her alone and stay out of things, despite the things she did to upset him in first place also hurting me too. Even when she was gone though, I knew she was the love of my life. I can't shake the feeling. Then she lead me on for about 6 or 7 months and then told me to never talk to her again all of a sudden. All the while, right after we broke up I discovered my dad was secretly cheating on my mom with other dudes... except he dressed up like a female hooker while doing so. The shit I saw from that burned an irreversible crater in my brain. Also my one and only real friend abandoned me at the time I needed him most, with how messed up I was getting due to everything happening at this time.   


I had another girlfriend for 2 and a half years after her, but that girl eventually grew disinterested, lost all attraction, and left me over a text at 1am while I was held up at work. This one left me about 4 months ago because she didn't like my job (mostly due to long hours, weird days off, and inherent danger). I'm 22 (M) now, and I'm finding myself saving up all my money to move out and get out of this house, leaving it and all its bullshit behind. Part of me wants to be out to get this feeling of relief, but the rest of me knows my life would be just as empty- if not more empty than ever. The only social contact I get with other people is the occasional small talk at work, but none of my coworkers actually want to be friends and hangout.   


I like my job and all, but I don't want to just continue to barely eat, barely sleep, wake up for a lift in my basement home gym, then go work, then repeat the process daily. It's just... without anyone to share a life with, what's point? What's the motivation to keep going, build a nice physique, get a nice place of my own, get nice clothes, all that... just to have nobody to share it all with? What kinda life is that, just endlessly toiling away, earning, building, creating... but legacy and nobody to share it with. What sucks most is that I'm an extrovert that feels forced to live like I'm anti-social. I want to have a close nit friends circle, but I don't have that. I want to have a pretty girl that's wife material, but I don't have that. And with the way my daily life goes with this job and all, it's impossible to make friends or meet girls I might like. I feel like I'm gonna be stuck this way forever.

So A found out via another friend at work that for the last 2 months of their relationship B was talking to his ex girlfriend.

(The friend that told her was not lying and knew details of his whereabouts that confirmed the story. ) A just got a new job in another city 4 hours away so he figured he can juggle two girls as long as they were living in two different cities. 

Anyway long story short this caused a big fight between them and A packed her bags and left him. To move on she blocked him from all social media. Anyway B has moved on. Got back together with his ex-gf even though he is still trying to get ahold of A through mutual friends. So now that A is feeling good about herself and looking all kinds of good she is thinking of unblocking him on insta so she can show him that she is doing great without him. It’s petty I know but should she do it? Is this a closure thing? Is this even a good idea or should she just move on?",18Apr2020,0
119,"I'm an avid feminist, and I'm very interested in politics. However, I'm 16, and a lot of people (especially those on the internet) use my age as a reason for why I can't be right in a political debate. When talking about climate change, free healthcare, canceling student loan debt, democratic socialism, abortion rights, or pretty much anything else, many people say I just don't get it and I'll become conservative once I get older and see how the ""real world works"" (as if I'm in a fake world now?? ok??). I get that I'm young and therefore have less experience in the world to work with, but that doesn't make my opinion any less valid than a 98 year old.

121,"So I(F21) used to be SUPER close friends with this guy (M23) when I was a freshman in college. We eventually became FWB and then he caught feelings and it got awkward so we broke that and our friendship off for a while. He got a gf and we would talk occasionally but nothing like we used to. They just had a really nasty breakup and he started talking to me again just to catch up and see how I was doing. He told me he was horribly lonely and that it was nice talking to me and he would love to try and be friends with me again. I talked to him almost daily for 2 weeks. I told him he should try to be positive and if he was lonely, that he should talk to people on tinder! And he took my advice. A few weeks after he and his gf of 2 years broke up, he got together with a girl he met off of tinder. (F18) He told me he didn’t want to hide our past from her because she knows me, and I told him I understood. We replayed how we met and what went down to each other because both of our memories were kind of foggy. We reminded each other of what all we did, how we met, how close of friends we were, etc. The only thing I told him not to do was be TOO detailed with her about our past. Then he proceeds to tell me: “actually I already told her before I asked you if it was okay. I just don’t want to hide any aspects of my life from her because I really do love her. I’ve shown her screenshots of our conversation.” 
Are you kidding me? That’s PRIVATE and PERSONAL information that I didn’t particularly want her to know!! He was going to tell her anyways, but I figured he would just say “We were good friends who were FWB. Then we fell off” but I ended up being the one- technically- who told her about our entire past just through describing it to him. I told him he needs to be truthful with me too which led him to say: “oh well too bad idk what else to say” so I said “okay”. He then wrote me a paragraph telling me he needs to stop talking to me. A week after he said he wanted to be friends again. So I never responded to him since that interaction.

122,"I’m currently doing homework and the topics introduced to us in school are things that I often find extremely interesting. It’s for that reason that I start doing extra research into them and I love every moment of it.

My problem stems from the fact that I don’t want to be that kid that acts like they’re smarter than everyone. I would hate it if I was like that. However, at the same time, I want to discuss the topics I research so that I may gain a deeper understanding of what I’m learning. However, whenever I try to bring what I’ve been researching up to my friends or family, I’m often met with them saying that I’m just making things too complicated for myself. They often say that I’m being presumptuous with what I’m doing and I get scared by the fact that they may be right. 

As an example, when asked when x was a political event, I dove into what exactly constitutes a political event. When I tried to talk with my brother about it, I was met with, “An event is something that happens, stop overcomplicating things. Debating over something so simple is useless because it’s already an extremely easy topic.” 

Am I really just over complicating things? Does it come off as presumptuous or pretentious when I want to discuss slightly complicated topics with my friends? If yes, how should I change that?

127,"Long story short, there's a consensus in my industry that working for this client is like selling your soul to the devil. The name's big and can get you anywhere you want to go in 2 years, the pay is insane, like 6 figures/33% increase in my salary, and I'd get a title promotion. There's no legal issue with me working for them i.e. competition clause. The position's high demand like 12h/day with some weekend work, during the interview I requested some things to client which were ignored, Client is trying to hire through shady means i.e. third party, and for the last 3 months client has been constantly gaslighting me and my team. Both client and my boss are aware that client is trying to poach me, it's been openly communicated. I need to tread carefully because I don't want to burn bridges or make my time with client more difficult as we're still working with them for a few more months.

My current company is like no other, really. They treat me like a person of value, they state that I owe nothing to them and should go if it makes sense for me. It's the first company in a long time that's treated me like a human being with weekends off, working like 9-4 finishing work early when there's no point in working, and creative freedom. I've only been with them a short amount of time so I'm not comfortable asking for a pay or title bump but I want to be there.

So how do I communicate to the big bad wolf that I'm happy, even though they know it's less pay and a smaller name and I don't get promoted? I've had a prelim interview where they asked if i was interested and they said they've only reached out to me because they're seriously interested and I said I wanted to hear more but no offer in writing.

Our complex has a porch theft problem, so his grandmother won't leave packages at the door. If he wants an income, he must come to the house and retrieve those packages.

As every day passes, the more I want to move out, even though I'm nowhere near ready.

This is because I can't stand being around them sometimes.  They both came from abusive, low income households, and while they have gotten better, some of their shit bleeds over into the present.  My mom has become extremely successful, becoming a business owner in a prestigious field, and dad stays at home.  He takes care of the property (20 acres and lots of animals), and he homeschooled me until middle school.  I am certainly appreciative of what they have provided me with, but I don't think they realize it isn't all great.  One of the less that great bits is my parents' fighting.  My parents have had some pretty awful fights, which have gotten more frequent over the years.  They can have extremely poor communication, which just makes the situation worse (sometimes that's what starts the fight in the first place).  Anyway, they don't bring into their arguments directly, but mom will rant to me after the fact and tell me everything that dad supposedly said to her.  While I don't think my dad hasn't said some awful shit, she makes him out to be downright evil.  I'm writing this now because it happened again about 30 minutes ago.  They fought a bit, dad left, and then mom came to me to tell me what he supposedly said.  I'm so fucking tired of this.  I want to tell her I'm not her fucking therapist (she has one), and she's kept saying the same shit for years.  Oh he doesn't love me anymore, oh he hates me, oh blah blah.  If that was true, why tf haven't they divorced yet?? (they've been married for almost 30 years)  But if I do tell her off, then I'll be the bad guy because I'm not letting her speak.  She doesn't have a lot of support (really dad and I are the only people she's close to), but in times like this, I'm the only one left.

I can tell he's been having a rough time recently, but he's adamant in his refusal to talk about it, which is just making me increasingly worried.

I feel kind of helpless at this point. He's clearly struggling, and all I can do is send him words of encouragement or text him a funny video and pray that he doesn't think about suicide again. I don't want to lose him, he's the best friend I've ever had, and he's had my back through everything. The least I can do is return the favor.

138,"Hey Reddit, this is my first time using this and I'm in a bit of a predicament and I'd kindly appreciate any and all advice I can get on this issue. I'm 19 (M) and I think I'm in love with my roommate 21 (M). 

So here's a bit of history, we dated about 2 years ago, long before we started living together but the relationship only lasted a month as we mutually decided we were better off as just friends than being boyfriends. We were both part of the same group of friends and we ended up being roommates. 

A few months ago, we got into a large fight with my two other roommates because they were being pretty unfair with the living conditions and they were really irresponsible so me and my current roommate moved out and got a 2 bedroom apartment for the two of us. 

We're a lot happier than we used to be but recently I've really been struggling with my emotions as I've lost my entire friend group except for my roommate. He's done so many nice things for me and if I'm being honest I really wouldn't even be alive right now if it wasn't for him. The only thing is, I'm pretty sure he doesn't feel the same way, I'm pretty sure he never did actually. 

This stems from the fact that he sorta has a history of leading guys on so he usually has guys falling for him and he feeds into it (sometimes) but ultimately never takes it anywhere. This is pretty much the only thing holding me back from telling him how I feel and also the fact that he's my ex too. He's changed a lot in the past 2 years but I'm genuinely afraid that I'll tell him and he'll say he feels the same but in reality he's only being nice to me because it might be convenient for him? I know I'm probably making him sound a lot worse than he actually is but this is mostly just me overthinking as I have a bad habit of doing so. 

I feel stupid I guess? Like what makes me so different from any other guy he's talked to that he'd magically be willing to try for me. I've had a lot of nights where I've had mental breakdowns and panic attacks and he'll comfort me and let me cry until I'm done and he does everything he can to cheer me up. He's always reassuring me that my interests are cool and that I'm a great friend and sometimes we'll tease at each other like normal friends do. 

I think I ultimately want him to be happy. But I think a part of me wishes that he could be happy with me, but that's selfish and I shouldn't do anything. I feel trapped. Anyone mind helping me out here? Please and thanks!",18Apr2020,1

144,"TL;DR: My grandfather’s wife has resorted to selling his sentimental belongings to better her financial situation from raising two grandchildren. Her financial burden is being transferred to the family and we don’t want to have to buy back our loved one’s possessions. 

(Long post sorry)

I (22) guess I’ll start by saying 2020 has been a shit year. My grandfather (84) passed away in January after years of health problems. It was hard to watch him pass but it was for the better as he didn’t have to suffer anymore. It was very difficult for my mom (56) and then not two months later my grandmother (mom’s mom; 85) passed away unexpectedly too. This whole time has been difficult, with lots of paperwork’s and things to handle. 

Where I need advice is with my grandfather. After he passed, his wife (not my biological grandmother) arranged the whole funeral on her own without consideration from any family, and within a week of his passing had already gotten rid of his clothes and all the items in his office, including paintings my mom had given to him long ago. 

My grandfather’s wife has also been put into deep financial issues for two reasons: 1.) she is raising her 2 grandchildren because her daughter was a heroin addict and she wanted to give them a better life. This completely drained their retirement and all other funds. 2.) my grandfathers extensive medical bills. 

Because of her financial situation, she has been trying to sell anything she can to make money. She will sell inexpensive items even though she is short around $2000 a month, and these items are often very sentimental. All of the family has tried talking to her but she remains that my grandfather’s will said all belongings are hers and she can sell anything she needs to. She has gone so far as to try and sell my grandfathers steel guitar and amp, his guns that were to be left to his children (a conversation she was a part of), and his prized pair of longhorns. The only good thing is she asks us before she sells them if we would like to buy them instead. Of course we have, and so far my family is over 10k deep into buying his possessions from her.

Some other interesting points:

-she wanted to donate a set of original large print FJ Haynes pictures to the Yellowstone Park Foundation, something my grandfather explicitly said should be loaned to the FJ Haynes exhibit at Old Faithful rather than the YPF

-she will text my mom and uncle saying she is selling xxxxxx and if they want it they need to buy it now because someone has already offered $x for it

-she is very forgetful and raising two pre-teen children with mental health issues has taken a toll on her mental and physical health

-she lives 1/2 mile from us, so we could easily go  through his possessions and take what we found to be sentimental

I want to note that none of the family is trying to hurt her; we all respect her position of financial burden and have offered to help pay bills for her. She always declines. I feel like at this point she is transferring her financial burden onto the family and not considering the things that are sentimental to any of us. She will not listen to us and we don’t know what to do. Does anyone have any suggestions on what to tell her or and legal actions we can take? She is family and we all love her but this has turned into a real problem for all of us. Thank you in advance for any advice.",18Apr2020,1

But it would be nice to feel acknowledged once and yes they can be good friends too sometimes as well but also they can just act like I don’t even exist and it’s kinda a bummer but I can’t really find new friends they all I have and I can’t find another good friend group, I mean yeah I have multiple friends but not like these guys that I’m talking about it’s just kinda sad, and if I say like why didn’t u guys inv they will probably call me a bitch, but I mean hey what can u do I guess",18Apr2020,1

156,"Me and my girlfriend like the same college. I have always liked this college because it is a really good school. It has around 10,000 kids and me and her are really interested in going there. She has already claimed it as her school and she’s not looking anywhere else. She has expressed concern with me attending the same school as her. I understand where she is coming from but I really like the school. We had a rocky patch about two months ago but now we’re all good. I know that I would have attended this school whether I went out with her or not but now that we like the same school I’m worried about attending it. What if we break up and we have to see eat other around school? I’m just worried about it and I don’t know if I should attend the school now because she is attending it now! Also, she has a 4.1 GPA cumulative and is involved in EVERYTHING at school. I’m talking DECA, STUCO,Cross Country, Soccer,Volleyball,FCCLA and a church group. I have a 3.5 GPA cumulative and I am just in Mock Trial, DECA,Cross Country and I run a medium sized E-bay resale service selling Amazon returns.

159,"Since little I lie about a lot of things. I think until my 14-15 I was a total pathological liar. I was saying gigantic lies everytime. Time passed I’m now 18 and I still lie a bit. Generally I say something like: I have a friend who does that, I don’t say that because I do the thing but only to have something to say. But sometime it’s just emphasizing reality for stupid and non interesting things. I think it’s because I’m depressive (got diagnosed a while ago but because of my parents never took a single medication) and itsnot really for attention because my lies generally don’t put me in the spotlight, but more like I need to be constantly in touch with people. Anyone can help for stopping that? I start work in August and want a fresh start for my adulthood.

I recognize that I have traits that do not help the situation, such as I usually persist with trying to resolve things rather than give him the space when he’s overwhelmed.  Im going to try and fix my behavior but he hardly admits to his so my question is:

161,"       Okay, so this is probably irrelevant, but I want to give all the details so I can get the best advice. So I’m close with friends with this guy, his name is John. One day he texted me about this friend he has: (Let’s call her Katherine.), and how I should meet her because her life hasn’t been the best, and he thinks I would be able to help. (He thinks I’m good with people’s emotions, which I personally disagree with.) Flash forward about 3 months later, and me and Katherine are best friends. John forgets Katherine’s birthday. (She remembered his). And, because Katherine goes through a lot, that also means I help her a lot with anxiety and panic attacks. (Which is what friends are supposed to do) And, John is absent through all of these. 

       Just Today, when I was helping Katherine, she kept saying she wanted and needed John. (Katherine has an old Samsung and when she tries to text us iPhone users, she can’t see the messages. So we use discord. John also has discord) While I’m helping her, I spam him with discord messages, discord calls, text messages, and standard calls. And nothing until about two hours after I had helped Kat. He texted “what”. I told him passive aggressively that it ended already. He said ok. I then text “She kept asking for you, John.” And the text didn’t deliver. And it also didn’t say “not delivered”. It was just stuck there. That sometimes happens when someone’s phone is powered down. My theory is that’s what happened. Before this, I asked him (kindly) about why he’s so busy (especially when everyone’s inside and we’re still in school so it’s not like we’ve got jobs.) 

       He said, “I don’t know where my life is going. I’m going down a path. And it may end up with me not talking to any of my friends ever again.” My immediate thought was suicide. But, then I thought about it more. I thought about once we were in class and he was talking about his father’s worrisome medical condition, and he said something like it was genetic and he already may have and it could quietly grow into what his father has. But, I’m not entirely sure, if that’s the reason for his absence. Because sometimes he randomly comes back and acts like he’s been there all day and cracking jokes. Not saying anything about the girlfriend that’s kinda being neglected, or how suspicious he looks. 
       
       I don’t know if he’s suicidal, (I hope not, I don’t wanna lose another friend to that.) has a fatal condition, self evaluating or what. But it’s causing him to neglect Katherine. And I don’t want to confront him about it, because I can’t go “Hey YOU’RE her girlfriend, not ME.”, when he could literally be dying. I’m so sorry if this is confusing or too much. But I’m just conflicted. I really don’t know what to do.",18Apr2020,1
162,"I’ve been planning on running for office for quite some time, I’m just feeling like it’s time to get a little more specific. I want to run in apx. 10 yrs, I just want to play the long game when it comes to a PAC, slow fund raising, assembling a small team, timing a run, etc. Background: I’m a 27 yr old Air Force lieutenant with a degree in international relations and a graduate degree in public policy from a top school.

163,"So about a year ago I started messaging people on reddit. Looking at subs such as r/MakeNewFriendsHere and chatting to the people who seemed like they really just needed someone to talk to. It was never about me or my entertainment i just wanted to make a positive impact on peoples lives even if it wasn’t a huge one. I feel like helped all of these people in some way helping them with issues and just giving them someone to talk to when they felt alone. Most people I talked to as myself but others I couldn’t because I doubt adults would accept a pm and advice from someone reasonably young so I went in as someone else, only lies like age or gender just to get through to people. People respond better to others going through the same situation as them so they don’t feel so alone and can accept help and friendship better if they feel something more in common straight away.

I felt like I made a positive impact on the (roughly 12) people I spoke to and after a few weeks they left and that was my aim the whole time. I help them and let them know they are important, loved and that they have things to live for. I didn’t really form much of a strong bond with anyone but enough of one for them to trust my advice and love. They all left on their own and some texted me back a few months later thanking me which made it worth it even though I do feel awful still about lying to some of them about myself. 

One person I spoke to though did not go away. They haven’t got many friends and seem to really enjoy talking to “me”. Only issue, I wasn’t actually me when I spoke to them. They have improved with self esteem hugely and I think they genuinely want to keep on living now. I have fully achieved my aims with them but they haven’t ever drifted on and left me. 

I feel really guilty for lying to them every day I still feel really guilty for the (3) other people I lied to but this one has gone on almost a year. It’s getting to the point where they want me to call them or send selfies etc since they do that kind of thing a lot but I keep making excuses for obvious reasons. I don’t know what to do. Do I leave them and just hope they don’t think I ghosted them? Fake a death(pretty extreme)? Tell them the truth but I don’t know if everything I told them will go doen the drain if I do? I don’t know what to do I was just trying to improve people’s lives and for the most part it worked just this part is tricky.

I know it is very wrong to lie to people about who I am but I only did it with good intentions. I am in no way trying to justify lying to people even if it is to help them but that was the only way I could see myself helping some people. I just don’t know what to do now I’ve landed in this situation.",18Apr2020,1
165,"So my dad was drinking liquor and he was pretty tilted. My cat, is a black domestic house cat that has a little bit of a temper. My cat had broken a glass by knocking off the counter. My dad was mad because it was one of his wine glasses, so he grabbed the cat and THREW her into the laundry room (where we keep to food bowl and little box). 

The cat started hissing at him and it made him more pissed. He Smacked the cat across her face and it made he crawl back up against the wall. She started growling and hissing at my dad more, and he punched the cat right across he face. I was watching this and i wasn't sure what to do because my dad was drunk and beating the cat. She kept growling and hissing, and eventually bit him, and put a gash in his hand. He then grabbed the cat back the neck, and threw her out the front door saying ""shes gone"".

 She scrambled into a ditch behind my house really quickly. I was so upset because thats my cat, and i grabbed a flashlight and ran out into the ditch to get her. She ran into the woods, but long story short i was able to coax the cat into allowing me to pick her up and bring her back to my house. I gave her a bath,and brought her into my room where she is currently sleeping and recovering. 

My dad is still pissed at me for getting the cat and said ""we'll see what happens. If she doesn't learn shes not the top, then she's gonna have to go"". I love my cat,and i don't want her to go, or for my dad to hit her again, but my dad was also drunk, and i don't completely blame him.

167,"I had a lovely outdoor cat, I started neglecting her and let her die by only going  outside once or twice, I used to gave no water as I thought it wouldn't be a problem since she was a outside cat, She always meowed at the windowsill and I felt pity for her and guilty so I would give some bread or a biscuit, even when we usually had catfood in the fridge, one day we went on a trip and when we came back she had died later that day and I didn't get to spend her last moments with me even though she loved me so much and I didn't even cry, I tried to feel sad but I felt empty and normal, Even though I was letting her dead body.

But when I realized it was  my fault, my head was filled with thoughts of what will my friends think of me, me a a animal abuser. Nope I'm not a criminal, I didn't do it on purpose, does someone like me deserve happiness?, it was just intense regret for possibly ruining my character.

168,"I am (F18) struggling a lot mentally and when I muster the courage I will get professional help. However in the meantime, being like this has caused me to isolate from most people and thus this deep rooted loneliness seems to be getting bigger and bigger. I know there are people around me but I feel so distant because I seem incapable of reaching out to people. 

I was doing okay when I had my best friend to talk to when things would get hard - it didn’t fix anything but I felt relief for having someone there for me, who could at least understand me. It’s not that she’s not there but I feel like I’m starting to get this attachment towards her, where I await her replies and feel like she’s the only person I wanna talk to because it doesn’t feel exhausting nor do I ever have to think about what to say. However, I hate feeling this attachment and I miss the days I didn’t ever wait for a person to reply to me and so I feel like distancing myself. 

Recently, I’ve realised she doesn’t seem to understand me as much as I felt (not that it is hers or anyone’s responsibility) - none of my friends seem to get that I can’t help the way I am. I cant get out of bed most days no matter how much I try, I can’t get myself to do anything I enjoy, or even the basic necessities sometimes. Everything feels so meaningless to me, and I really do feel like I’m alone in this because it feels like I’m just being lazy and incompetent rather than admitting there’s something wrong with me. But reading through some mental health threads I’ve realised that there are people out there who feel like me. 

I don’t know what I’m trying to ask for really. I guess how to gain the courage to get help, and stop the unhealthy attachment on a singular person? It’s not that I don’t want help, I’m just scared of the possibility of being beyond help.",18Apr2020,1
169,"I know the title is vague and sounds like a r/Askreddit question but hear me out (also excuse the bad grammar or spelling i wrote this late at night) Basically I dislike my mother, she emotionally blackmails me continuously to do things for her and she is over controlling.  Thankfully i live between two houses but i hate living at hers. It's depressing, boring and I always feel like I'm on guard because any minute she could come into my room and start emotionally attacking me with insults and complaints. Not only is it her but also her husband, he's an emotionally and (partially physical when i was younger) abusive piece of sh**. Sometimes they both work together to attack me and its been like that for 6 years. It's really hard to justify my hatred with reasons to other people because this goes back a long time, back to when I was younger. Anyway, even though for a long time I've been trying to somewhat like her, I'm beginning to dislike her even more than ever before. Her emotional blackmail is getting weaker on me by the second.

I used to think that what she did was normal, that every kid got similar treatment and that I was just being somewhat spoilt. I mean after all, ALL kids love their mum, it's basically a sin not to and I've seen memes about ""when your mum insults you and your interests"" and i thought ""ah okay so it's pretty much normal, it's just a mum thing maybe.. "". But now, I realised that in reality it's not normal. Some people do have shitty relationships with their parents but don't talk about it and it is somewhat possible to leave her and it is not a sin to dislike your mother. I've tried leaving before but her emotional blackmail always gets the better of me. I'm sick of it. It's like i can slowly see the lies behind everything. And i need to know from the people who have left their parents in the past, who can relate to my struggles, what happens once you leave? How does it feel to leave? Is it worth it?

175,"My roommate constantly sings and I’m really annoyed by it. It’s not that she’s terrible but she’s not good either—but because she sings 24/7 it especially irks me. She also sings really slowly in the same tone and the same key so it’s like the first five notes of a warm up exercise over and over. 

We watch at least an episode of a show or a movie together every day and she always sings whenever there’s a song, whether she actually knows it or not. If I play music, she sings along to it. If she doesn’t know the song, she just echoes after it. Or she just sings random notes most of the time. 

I’ve also jokingly-not-really-but-sort-of-angrily “complained” a handful times, sometimes with friends, in front of her that she sings 24/7 and I’m annoyed. I’ve also mentioned that I always need to wear earbuds all the time bc of her being noisy/singing. She gets defensive but idk if it was mean of me to say that. 

The situation got better for me bc we used to live in one room together in a college dorm, but we got relocated into 2 rooms that are connected by a bathroom (bc of quarantine; I’m staying in the dorms bc of family reasons). We still hang out together most of the day though. 

I’m honestly so annoyed by this but idk how to handle this. I don’t want to outright say, “hey, stop singing, it’s annoying,” because it sounds harsh and I don’t want to hurt her feelings. How do I tell her in a nicer manner?

176,"To start, my brother (M16) and I (F16) are a tad bit overweight. It's not much to worry about, as it has not caused any major health issues to us, but with the current global situation and the worry that we might pack on a few more pounds in the future, it's been advised by our pediatricians that we lose a little weight. We've been dieting and exercising for the past couple of years now and my brother is back to a healthy weight, and I have not. It's fine though. Even though I haven't lost as much and as quickly as he did I am getting there at my own pace.

&amp;#x200B;

We are quarantined from school now, and my father has taken it upon himself to start a new diet and a new exercise regimen for me. My brother is still forced to go outside, but he can play some light basketball. We do this after my dad comes back from work, which is around 5 PM. Today, he came home a little early (around 2:30 PM) and asked that we go outside. I asked him politely if we can just wait until our normal time of 5, but he went batshit crazy and took all of our food from the kitchen (mostly eggs, milk, oatmeal, lettuce, and chicken, and it wasn't a lot, to begin with) and took it to his work (which for context is a kitchen) and told us that if we would like to continue eating, we would have to walk to his work for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. This is a mile from where we live, and the only food left in our kitchen is water, coffee grains, tea bags, and brown sugar. 

&amp;#x200B;

I asked how this would work since I do go to school online and thought it was a bit ridiculous to have to walk 20 minutes back and forth, eat at the kitchen, then come back whenever we are hungry. I did the math and if it took us 30 minutes to prepare and eat our meals we would be doing this for 210 minutes every day. This is time I think would be better spent doing school, or having time for myself, but my dad insists that I can't possibly need this much time to do school every day. I much prefer our previous arrangement, where I would still exercise every day but it would be for 45 minutes and more intense. I think this new method wouldn't work at all since we've tried walking and it's done nothing for me in the past, while the other method was just starting to work.

&amp;#x200B;

Even when we do walk to the kitchen, there are still restrictions as to what and how much we can eat. My brother and I were thinking that we could fill up on foods so that we didn't have to walk to and from the kitchen as much, but my father stopped my brother from eating too much (it was only half a box of those little raisin containers). 

&amp;#x200B;

because no, i don’t want to look like i’m a clone of my mum. she’s 40 years old. she’s had her shot at being a teenager and doing teenager things, and i don’t want to be reminded that when i’m still in school that i look like i could be 40 years old. 

on top of that, i have a stepfather that has emotionally abused me in the past. my mum knows exactly what’s happened, yet in the presence of him will be nice to him or even put me down to make herself look better.

184,"I’ve (35F) been dating my fiancé (37M) for just over a year. About 3 months before we met he broke up with his ex (40ishF) of 3 years (on and off).  

They dated for 3 years. She kept breaking it off and going back to her ex. Back and forth. Back and forth. One time, he was dating this girl and still talking to the ex. The ex showed up at his house and literally chased the other girl out. 

After they broke up the last time she went back to her ex and they moved to GA (we live in NC)  

They talk now and then and he’s never hid it from me. Over Christmas the ex’s daughter was in a parade and asked if my fiancé would come see her. He asked if I was ok with it. I said yes. He went. Well, the ex was there and asked him if he wanted to go to a party with her and her parents.  I was not invited. 

Then recently, she texts him out of the blue to tell him she’s going to NY to help at the hospitals.  I was kinda annoyed. (Why would my fiancé care? What was the point of that?) 

I feel like she is slowly trying to worm her way back in and trying to stay relevant. 

He’s offered to stop talking to her but I don’t want to be ‘that’ girl.   I told him I just feel like she still has feelings and she’s unhappy with the choice she made.  He agreed that she is miserable and that she probably is regretting it but ‘too bad for her. I found my girl’. 

I trust him completely but I can’t help but be annoyed. I’m wondering if I should just go ahead and ask him to cut ties or if I’m being overly sensitive.

My disability accommodations on file say that I can get a deadline extension for 1-2 days but it is the professor’s discretion (and some gave me more before) and does not apply to tests. I got an email that I can try to make the classes pass/fail by talking to someone because of the current circumstances and maybe something about easier to appeal grades (tho not sure because I cannot find it now), but doing so does not “generally” make it satisfy major requirements and prerequisite requirements but “exceptions can be made”. One of my classes requires a C- for the major and is only offered in spring and 2nd half of summer. The other class required a C- for both my majors and a C- prerequisite for another class required for both majors and only offered in autumn. Furthermore, that class too is also a prerequisite for another class required for both majors and only offered in spring, and they are both required for yet another class only in fall (meaning fall of next year). I already waited to take the 1st mentioned class after dropping in summer for financial reasons, and for the 2nd aforementioned class I am already a year behind in the course sequence due to failing the prerequisite before this prerequisite that I am in now.

191,"For context, I’m a college student living at home since my school is not too far away and have been stuck due to COVID. 

My sister (16F) and I (22F) used to be super close and despite the age gap, we were closer then with our middle sister. Then last summer, she started avoiding me for weeks until I found out that seeing me do summer coursework so much and work at the same time was making her feel bad about herself. She felt insecure as my mom has always told her she needs to be like her older sisters who are academically “better” - my mom’s words not mine. 

Then come fall, she starts flat out ignoring me and leaving the room as soon as I come in. This goes on for weeks and any of my attempts to get an answer is met with being ignored. Finally, the week before Christmas, my mom tells me my sister has changed her viewpoint of me 100% after seeing kids at her high school misbehave and she thinks I’m abusing our parents. And her examples of abuse are all the times that I’ve stood up and talked to my parents about issues that I believe in. For context, my mom is an n-mom* and is emotionally abusive, racist, homophobic, Trump-loving, and I have been to therapy since 2015 because of her. And she’s gotten my dad on her side more and more. (Side note: Both therapists I’ve been too and everybody around me have agreed she is what she is. Please look up what a narcissistic mother is if you don’t know since I can’t post the link here). 

Regardless, we start talking again bc I think we’ve reconciled. This only lasts a couple days before I leave for study abroad in early January. As soon as I come back, she is mad again and completely ignores me and still is. I find out later she really didn’t want to reconcile, she did it only bc my mom wanted us to for Christmas. 

I’ve talked to my therapist about it and she’s equally as puzzled. She thinks that perhaps my sister’s view of what happens in our dysfunctional family is warped and every time I speak up against my n-mom, my sister who silently agrees with her views it as an insult or attack too. My middle sister completely knows my mom is an n-mom and had her moment in middle school too where she used to think I was a horrible daughter for standing up, because she thought our mom was always right. In high school, she apologized and said she realized why I had to, otherwise she would be controlling everything. 


I’ve been avoiding her and giving her space, but still acting normal day to day. For the first few weeks, I was deeply affected and cried a lot. It made me feel worthless. Now, I’ve learned to focus on my own coursework and work and just ignore her. All my attempts to reconcile wouldn’t work and my mom also blames me 100% for everything and also said that any issues that arise in the family, I make worse. I’ve become the scapegoat. 

Just today, my middle sister told me my little sister said she wanted to end everything because she “can’t go on like this”. I don’t know why she’d say that. 


I don’t know what to do anymore and my parents aren’t good parents either. Neither are really concerned about my sisters threats. They just want us to solve it among ourselves without involving them. My dad told each of us separately to “ignore” the other and the others issues. 



TL;DR: My youngest sister started hating me for how I stood up to our narcissistic mom and has been actively ignoring me as we live in the same household. She is getting more frustrated and recently told my parents she wants to end it. My parents don’t really care either and want us to resolve it among ourselves. What should I do?",18Apr2020,1

He is now at 22 lbs and is having problems breathing/snoring. I feel so guilty. I’ve always just left a bowl of food out for him to eat whenever, but I’ve tried putting him on a diet for the past week.

He is an indoor/outdoor cat and has his own little cat door so he comes and goes whenever he likes, so it’s not that it’s a lack of exercise. 

Tonight however, my neighbor had texted me saying my cat ate THE ENTIRE BOWL of dry food she had on her porch for strays. He promptly came inside and threw up FOUR TIMES.

I (20M) was talking to my younger brother (freshman in high school) when I saw his vape pen on the shelf next to his bed, clearly out while he wasn't expecting people in his room. I don't mind so much the legality (because let's face it, 90% of kids end up breaking the law at some point), but I was deeply disappointed in his choices and ended up confiscating it. I don't want to nark on him and tell my parents about it, cause that's a shitty thing to do, but I am really hurt that he'd do something like that to himself. He's so young and I would hate for his brain to become accustomed to addiction at such a young age. My plan right now is to keep the vape until I can toss it without my parents noticing. Then I feel like I should sit down with him when my parents are at work and have a talk about it.

Is that the best thing to do? If not, what should I do?

EDIT: I realize it may be important to say that nicotine addiction runs in my family. My mother quit cigarettes when she was pregnant and now ""secretly"" vapes, my father quit when I was very young.

200,"I am reaching the age of 18 very shortly and i'm beginning to ask myself that question but i cannot yet decide... I want to hear your guys opinions in order to make up mine. I have posted a TL;DR in the end if you don't wanna read into this big text


Ever since age 16 i started hating my parents for the restrictions and expectations they've put on me. I am a gay boy in a homophobic family. I've always dreamed of the day where i am finally free, where i can go to parties with new friends, wear dresses and makeup because i feel more comfortable and pretty with them (i am a crossdresser, not trans) and i fantasize of having a loving boyfriend. My family of course is agaisnt this. But each member has a different level of homophobia

My father is the most homophobic, he prays that i will be changed and i cannot contradict him in any way without being completely submissive and apologetic, describing everything as politely and as apologetic as possible. He's still a loving father who wants to see his children grow into important men and help us in any way he can.
My mother already stated she dislikes this part of me, but she understands that i am born with it, all she asks is that i keep it to myself because well, she's homophobic but also because i live in Brazil, one of the most dangerous places for lgbtq people, so she cares for me, in her own way, she cried a lot when i showed to be too rebellious and opposed agaisnt her beliefs, saying i'd never give up who i am for her religion, she's a fragile woman who prays for everything to be better, but she's still my mother nonetheless and she has sacrificed so much for me already.
My two brothers are the most accepting, the middle one used to hit me and try to force me into God's path but eventually he learned to accept who i am and grew closer to me, he still would be heavily disgusted by the crossdressing thing though... Meanwhile, my eldest brother is the most accepting, he doesn't care who i am or what i do as long as i'm not doing anything vile or wrong that can harm someone.

My parents put a slight pressure on me to help the family financially because i'll be the only child going through college. My eldest brother is married and lives with his wife. We are financially ok, but we could be better. We live in a rented house and both my parents do not have so much stable jobs, mom's a independent seamstress, dad's an uber driver (rented car) and my middle bro is one of those guys that keep calling you in order to pay your water bill (forgot the name of the profession). We can live, life's not so hard but it could be easier if i stood, not to mention they kinda deserve it after spending 18 years spending more than 10.000 bucks on me on clothes, food, etc.

I am a very different person from your average teen, personality-wise. I have tried making friends at school, but i screwed up a lot of times for not knowing how to socialize, also for the fact that i didn't match with anyone there. Eventually i learned that the only age you can make true lasting friendships is at either childhood or adulthood, otherwise everyone just wants to take advantage of you and they will never truly be walking with you in life, they'll just get what they want and leave. I was even weirder as a kid, so i have absolutely 0 childhood friends, that's why i wasn't good at socializing. my only hope now is to make friends at college through the skills i developed, but i highly doubt the scenario will be any different.

I am not ready for adulthood. I barely learned how to take the bus on my own, i do not know basic geography of my own city, i do not know how to cook or how to be independent fully, i only have the ideas and the concepts but in practice, everything changes. My main source of information would be the internet.

I don't want to leave behind the only people who truly loved, cared and helped me, even if they despised part of me, so did i despise parts of them. Even though we fought a lot, we still loved each other somewhat in the end, they never used me like my ""friends"" did back in school. I am thinking of staying and hiding who i am as mother asked until my parents live their lives, which i hope last a lot. But everyone dies somewhen, maybe i can just keep loving part of them as they did for me until they are old enough not to be an obstacle for my freedom. But i am still uncertain. What would you do if you were in my shoes?

I believe a relationship should be based on values. I believe in the traditional no sex until marriage.

I also do not want any a relationship to just be to ""mess around"", I want substance to it. For example if I don't see a chance of marriage and growing old together, I don't want it.

209,"Let's get a few things out of the way. I am self diagnosed as autistic and I am secretly a furry, only my best friend knows. I bring up autism because I have like a social disorder or something. Basically I am very uncomfortable around people I don't know very well and often times social interaction is basically painful for me. I can't look people in the eyes, I have trouble paying attention and expressing my feelings, I'm nervous and awkward. The whole shabang. Anyway, I have a few school friends and talk to them online sometimes because I am stuck in quarantine. And recently I have started to draw furries and stuff and I really want to share it with people. I also just hate having to hide it.

Anywho. As you know, it is much easier to tell someone something in a text. At least it is for me because of the whole hate human interaction thing. And it has gotten me thinking, ""It would be really easy to just tell my friends i am a furry online and then I don't need to hide it"" And this is why I am stressed. I want to tell them but I also don't want to have to deal with an awkward discussion about it next time I see them. This leads to another problem, my dad hates furries. I mean mostly he hates like gays and blacks and Mexicans and so on. Someone you don't want to, you know, be a furry around. And not to mention my entire family would find out and a lot of awkward discussions would ensue. And remember, I don't like that. 

So yeah, that is my main problem. I want to just tell everyone and get it off my chest but I don't think I can. I'm just not strong enough. I think the only way I would tell them would be if I move out, I'm 16 and probably can't wait that long, or if I could somehow just tell them in a text. No interaction=good. But yeah, what do you guys think?

Edit: I just wanted to add this. I am similar to my dad and I tend to follow in his footsteps. ""My dad hates blacks and gays so I guess I do too"" is kind of how I was. I know better now but when my dad goes on racist rants I just ignore him. I really never argue with my dad about this stuff and because of this, him knowing I was a furry would probably be a very big shock. I have always liked animated movies like zootopia and what not but so does everyone else. I really don't thing they have caught on at all, cause I'm just that good, and that is why it would be so surprising to my family.",18Apr2020,2
211,"Long story short, I met my boyfriend in Spain 2019, it was a really romantic encounter because he was coming from Germany, and I, the United States. He said immediately on the first day he had the most heart warming connection with me he’d never had felt before, and also told me he’s never had a girlfriend and it’s sort of common for people in his tiny village. He told me I’m exactly his type, the whole package, etc. 

He makes me feel very special and has visited me multiple times and I have done so too, he talks about me endlessly and is very interested in every point of my life and also worried about me. I don’t think I could have found a better man, but that also worries me. I’m going to Spain for University and so the distance won’t be so awful, (we make the best of it) but this upcoming summer I’m worried. 
I know I will be faithful and everything but since I’m 18 and haven’t had my party years, or just flirting with random boys at the club, especially where I’m going is sort of a party city and the night life is amazing. I’m worried I might have temptation and I feel super guilty because he’s 24 and more mature and knows that he wants me. I tell him he’s everything I’ve ever wanted too, and I’m not lying, but I’m so scared that I will look back at my youth and question why I hadn’t danced with some boy or denied every chance I had to have fun.

Since they were in the same classes there was nothing I could really do about it except start an argument with him/ talk to him about it, this really took a toll on our relationship. We ended up breaking up, he and I had no contact and we would just pass by each other at school every once in a while. During our break up a lot of people didn't like him, and his personal property was being destroyed and he didn't have many friends

After hs, in uni, I found out he made out and was hanging out with his ex GF while he and I were broken up and he didn't tell me even though I asked. I was devastated.

Up until a little over six months ago, it was just me, Mom, my step dad, and my fourteen year old half sister (whom we'll call ""Carly"" for privacy reasons). Over the summer, I had the chance to meet one of Carly's MANY boyfriends. He was a sweet boy, only a year older, but definitely a trouble maker. He had lied to my mom about his age, was happy to make messes and not clean, etc. When him and Carly broke up, I thought it'd be the last I saw of him like every other boyfriend she's had; she's in middle school after all.

Nope.

While in college, my mom tells me she's adopting ""Tyler"" (once again, fake for privacy reasons/15/M) because his mother threw him out and his entire family rejected him. Knowing he wasn't the worst kid in the world, I didn't really care. At this point, I'm glad he's found a home here.

He likes our step dad a lot, Mom has found a way to get him to listen, and they can often get through to him. When I get onto him when I'm in charge, though, he thinks it's alright to yell at me, call me names, etc. I'm just not sure how to get him to realize I'm an adult as well, one that he still has to listen to and treat with at least some sort of respect when other adults aren't present.

Mom and I have spoken about this a few times, but tonight is definitely the breaking point so I'm hoping she can help tomorrow finally, but I'm just not sure if he'll listen at this point.

229,"I don’t wanna go into too much detail about my job... But someone with a similar job as me at my work, redid a part of my work “on accident”, potentially so he could take credit for the action.

He seems like a cool dude on the outside, and initially doesn’t seem the type. so it could have been an accident... but it’s more likely that it was done intentionally based on the nature of the situation and how the work is done.

At the end of the day our jobs are not dictated by this single action, but it was frustrating to see after I had already put in the work and claimed the action for myself.

I’ve ran a few different solutions in my head for this issue:

1. Undo the work he did and replace my work.

2. Mention this to my manager.

3. Not do anything.

1. If I undo the work, and re-do mine. It will probably fly under the radar. If anyone was gonna see it and care, it’d probably be him. He might check and notice that I made it a point to undo his work and re-do mine.  It would probably be left that way. Part of me feels like this will show that if you bite, I’ll bite back. but it also shows that his actions got under my skin, and I’m not ready to make that apparent to anyone but myself (and r/Advice). I’d like not to show that. So, while it will be written in paper that I was the one that had done the work, it will ultimately show that I cared that much to do it in the first place, to either him or my managers. I don’t know if I actually care about it that much to put in that much effort and risk the coworker-to-coworker relationship. But if he was willing to risk that by doing what he did, why shouldn’t I?

2. If I mention it to my manager, it could come off that I am the type of worker that will bring up issues that don’t really need to be brought up. Having your name on this small peice of work could be considered an accolade at some point, but this single action can happen pretty often. It’s equally likely that no one will look at it. No one REALLY necessarily cares who did the work on this specific action, just that it got done. There are times when our jobs CAN overlap, and this is one of those times. It also isn’t necessarily the thing that people in my industry make a thing out of. But they could. And if it IS EVER going to be considered an accolade, since I was the one that originally did the work, my name should be on it... but at the expense of bringing on unneeded drama to the workplace? Not sure...

3. If I leave it be this time, it will bother me. But now I am definitely more equipped to be mindful that this guy is the type to undo my work so he can get credit. Leaving it be now really makes him look like a loser if anyone pieced it together and saw what he did. It DOES bother me, but there will be other opportunities like this in the future and now that I know what type of person he is, I can be a little proactive about making sure it doesn’t happen again. I also skip out on potentially being labeled as “the guy that brings unneeded drama to the workplace,” or the guy that makes big deals out of small situations.

I’m leaning towards number 3. It’s less work, less effort. But I will have to deal with the fact that it has gotten under my skin. I’ll probably be over it and forget about it after the weekend, but it’s still under my skin, and his name will remain on that work.

I know this is a little vague, but I did my best. If I went into more detail it’d probably make more sense, but that’s all I’m really willing to share.

At the end of the day, it’s just a job and I don’t get paid enough to deal with anything more than the 8 hours of work that I’m expected to do.

What would you do? And have you ever been in a similar situation? Will I hate myself for not choosing any other option than 3?",18Apr2020,2

They’re relationship is completely toxic and he can’t see it.  For example, the last time they fought it was because my brother wouldn’t say she was the most beautiful girl he’d ever seen and she said “If you ever do that shit again, I’m dumping you”.  
On top of this, he doesn’t have a group of friends that he goes to for support, and only vents his problems to her.  Both of my parents have tried to tell him that the way he’s being treated isn’t right, but he was so offended by this that he’s shut both of them off almost completely.

Honestly, I (19M) feel like my biggest hangup is that I haven’t ever felt a connection to something I can’t interact with. Like people talk about knowing god but I really see knowing something as having person interaction, like knowing a person or knowing of them because I’ve studied them. And I see all the amazing good it does for people, and I really want to be part of that. There’s no doubt in my mind that I’d raise my kids religious. But I feel like, I’m general, I’m a decently good person without having had a relationship with god. But I definitely have a bit of my families flexible sense of morality in me, so I know I’m not all good, and maybe He can play a part in helping that. And I’m kinda worried that with my lack of feelings towards God has me working to find the motivation to actively seek him out. And if I did really want to get started, I kinda don’t know where to start. Finding God as a college student in my family, it would be a hard road.

I previously had applied to have my loans consolidated, and they were. That plus the covid situation ended up causing me to be out of student loan default for the first time since my early 20's, I'm 29 now. 

I'm not even employed right now, and I failed out of college last time because depression and substance abuse got the better of me. So, community college it is. 

Off the bat I figured I'd go for software development, that's what I planned to do originally anyway. Looking more closely my local community college only offers up to an associate degree, and from what I read that may not be worth the time and money? 

Do I go for it anyway? If I didnt, what are basic degrees a lot of community colleges offer that lead to well paying jobs?

I don't know what to do. I can't fuck this up again.

I enjoyed it for first few years and passed all exams easily but then came the internship. In absence of proper guidance, I did my internship from a very below average firm. Then I gave my finals and couldn't crack it. I kept giving attempts but kept on failing, until I decided to quit the course. 
I tried new courses but couldn't get good college and so finally joined my family business. Soon after, I got a marriage proposal and decided to go on with it.

237,"Hello before I dive into my post. I'd like to say say that I am 26 years old living on my own under assistant living. My father is currently living in Florida. I love my father dearly and he is not a bad person, just very controlling. I want to break away from my father but with distance still have my father.

So to start, my mother divorced my father for his overbearing controlling behavior. for 2 years my mother banished me and maintained a relationship with my brother and left me to live with my father.  Out of complete lack of faith in anything I can do, my father sent me to live under assistance. I took the choice to not live with him. I did not want to live with him because they were so many rules and standards. I was caught confused to when I was told I was doing great I always fucked up two-three days later. I couldn't stay up late nor get up to get a snack at night, I would be yelled at.  I moved into assistance with those with behavioral health issues at a lower level of care and 3 years later my father moved to Florida and under this assistance, I have moved into an apartment of my own, own a dog and see my boyfriend. I go to college for fashion design. I mean I should feel have proven myself, but unfortunately, I do not.
  I do not handle stress well, but I truly feel with all this government assistance, all these rules in my housing, no say in how I want to handle my mental health, lack of help with my assistance, constantly told I am mental and that why I feel this way, told I should not do this, I should not do what I feel is best for me, Limited income, can be productive and get a job because of benefits. I mean I did not want this...

My father signed me for all this benefit and I can not tell if he wanted me to have an easy life (which I am sorry that does not exist) or to be under his control. I have no food, I have very little money and I have help. but I rely on others. I do not want to do that, I want my independence.

So again I am 26 years old, living under assistance, where my decisions are never mine. My father who lived in Florida will call my assistance to that eventually come to be when .. instead of telling how to handle my priorities help me get my food stamps back.

let me simplify it. How do I break from someone who controlling my decisions?

Hi! This is gonna be long so bare with me.

We've been friends for over 2 years. I met him my freshman year of college (I'm currently a junior) and it was clear he was interested in me from the beginning. Long story short, we talked for awhile, eventually kissed (thats the furthest we've gone) and I eventually asked him what his intentions were. He said he didn't want a relationship at the time and we left off on good terms and stayed as good friends. Sophomore year came along and we still stayed as friends and he would ask to hang out here and there but we never did anything physical or anything.

Summer entering this school year, things changed completely. We began to talk a lot through Snap, he would tag me on things on Facebook. Immediately when classes started in August, he asked me to hang out which then became a consistent thing throughout the year. From August to March, he did a lot of things for me such as: asked to hangout a lot more often, always pay for my coffee several times, always try to hold my hand when we hung out, bought me wine, cooked for me (even bought me a steak because I specifically asked for one), asked to hang out in the city and Facetime over winter break. We were at two parties together this year and he stayed by my side the whole time which was unusual because the past two years he would be hooking up with other girls. At one of those parties, I was dancing close with another guy and I knew he got jealous but just didn't say anything. Anyways, he also remembered my birthday and bought me a bottle of wine after I jokingly asked for one. At my party, I got really drunk and was apparently flirting with his friends and one of his friends the next day told me he looked stressed when I did that.

Fast forward to March, our school required all of us to leave because of COVID19. The day before we all left, he asked to hangout with me because he said ""this might be the last time I see your face."" We get coffee, he pays and holds my hand. Eventually, we go back to my room and we talk for a bit. Eventually, he asks if I wanted him to kiss me and I say no. He asks why and I say I'm not good at this physical stuff (By physical I mean like kissing/making out - i have no experience) and he ensures me its fine. I say I'm only comfortable with just the cheek and he just kisses me on the cheek and kind of just makes out with my neck. We then cuddle for 2 hours. Later that same night, I go to the bar with friends and I get a text from him saying he's coming too. I dance with my guy friends and then later, I see him hooking up (making out) with another girl. I then got kind of pissed so I find another guy where I eventually sit on his lap and I knew he saw it.

I like him but I'm still confused on whether he wanted a relationship or not but I’m leaning more that he did want one and just started to realize this now.

I know I should’ve asked what his intentions were but I feel like he should be the one making it clear if his intentions from freshman year changed — not me. I'm not sure if I should reach out because I don't know if he still has feelings for me or if he even thinks about everything that has happened. We’ve barely talked since all of this happened (it’s been around a month)

Should I reach out or just move on and wait for someone who’s more mature and has better communication skills? I’m tired of the immature games and not knowing. I’m well aware that I need some growing up to do too and need to work on communicating better

tl;dr: I don’t know this guy wanted to just hookup or wanted an actual relationship. Should I reach out or just move on",18Apr2020,1

I'm a really secretive and private person. As a kid in school I mainly hung out with teachers and just did my work and minded my own business. Middle school and high school I was a loner because I got bullied or  had anxiety and since I was timid, any friend I made eventually kinda just abandoned me. In college, I was just anxious. I made friends there, and they would tell me how cool and nice I was, but secretly thought they pitied me and I never really let loose. I was always the funny but closed-off friend. Now as an ""adult"" (early-mid 20s, F ), people express that they like me, but I am just a really closed off person. They assure me it's okay, but I am slowly starting to have a problem with it. I feel like I've just lost more than I've gained being this way.

 All of my social media stuff is private, I often look through my old posts and make them private, only keep posts that are popular with my friends /followers, I hide all info about me, and am extremely hesitant to add old friends that want to reconnect again, so I don't. I recenly added an old college friend because she wanted to reconnect and I was hesistant but did it. ...I texted her awhile back and was left on read. It didn't really sit well with me because we were talking about depression and how I mentioned I've been kind of depressed because of this pandemic. Its like I am afraid of people knowing stuff about me. Even just stupid facts like the kind of music I like or whatever.. it just makes me uncomfortable. Im just afraid that somehow, if I ever became well-known, people will just talk about me. All my secrets potentially known out there. 

There are people out there that just don't care that people know of their personal life! They always post things showing their kitchens, houses, bedrooms, bare faces, emotional breakdowns, creations- everything. And they don't care! I kinda wanna be like that. Just not care what people know about me, and just own it. But it's shameful for me. My mental health, my job, my current life in general... just kinda makes me wanna hide everything. But it really isn't a big deal. Something about people getting to know me and not caring and just going off to the world with knowledge about me makes me uneasy.. i just always feel like they could turn on me to make me look bad.
Any tips on how to just get over this?

He told me once that he would have been interested in me but I was dating someone at the time (I'm not anymore). Now I've realized I really like him, but I fear it's too late. He came out a month ago and told me he was bi and recently broke up w/ his bf. I wanna tell him I like him but I'm scared he doesn't like girls anymore or just me (I'm really not his type), or that it'll make our friendship awkward. He's the best friend I've ever had in my life and I don't want to lose him over something stupid. Plus, he knows that I'm crushing on someone and since I suck at lying I'm scared he's gonna figure it out soon. What do I do?",18Apr2020,1
257,"Im not really sure if this is just a me thing or if everyone is deeply insecure??? But it seems that  my friends all have some sort of acceptance and satisfaction with how they look and who they are and I literally cant look in the mirror without hating everything i see and im not sure how to fix this. Ive tried the BS method of thinking positive things to myself but it doesnt really work. I literally hate myself to the point where I dont want to go outside and see people??? I prefer to stay home. I mean I have confident spurts where Ill put on makeup, a nice outfit and do my hair and feel good but that only lasts so long and after a few hours out Ill start to hate myself again. Its like I dont even want to be seen or see myself. And the weird part is that there isnt anything inherently wrong with me, like im average weight, i have an okay body, normal lips/eyes, but not nose my nose is gross i hate my nose.  Hopefully one day Ill get a nose job *sigh*. But its like when i see my own face im just disgusted and I often think about how much Id prefer to be in someone else’s body and have someone elses face. I solemnly believe that before you can have any kind of happiness or love anyone you must love yourself, but I just cant. Im kinda young for reddit and Im still a student and perhaps all this self loathing has helped me in some way with my grades, because the more I stay home, the better they are. But i want it to stop.

So a while back me and my friend were abandoned by our old friend group. I have a weird feeling that she’s still friends with them and I’m secretly alone and subject to some awful prank. My friend does prank me and others a lot and she joked that she was behind it but then assured me that she definitely wasn’t because that day she cried a lot and had to leave the school because of them. Is she pranking me or am I just paranoid. If she is what should I do to confront her and tell her how I feel? 

Thanks

He’s been really bad before..(He has said that because pride month is also his birthday month, his birthday is far more important. He has told me to not date anyone until he’s ready yet he dates girls constantly. He went off on me because I blocked him once after he told me not too. He constantly asks me to sleep on call with him no matter how many times I say no. He’s admitted to dating a 12 year old, fully knowing her age and she knew his age, etc. etc.)

I have no way to get tested now until i get back into my parents state to find out if i have it (and i know it can affect infertility, which I’m terrified of). I just don’t want my parents to find out really while I’m home that i got an STD from sleeping with someone while I’m home, I’m already stressed with losing my job and place to live as it is, now i might not even have my physical health?!

264,"hi. a bit more details: i am 19, an only child. my parents have been married for 30+ years. my dad has cheated on my mom multiple times years ago, starting from before i was born and the LAST affair (that we were aware of) was back when i was around 5. while cheating, he was also emotionally and physically abusive to my mom and I. they never separated, my mom said that he apologized, she loved him, and even through the worst of it all she would never consider separating “for my sake.”
around two months ago, i noticed that my dad has been frequently messaging a strangely named contact in his phone. i caught a glimpse of the profile picture and something in me clicked. i knew the full name of the last woman he had an affair with (that we were aware of), so i stalked her social media and took a few screenshots. 
two days ago, i got another look on his phone (he always had his phone locked and barely ever out of his reach — until i finally got to figure out his password). i CONFIRMED that the contact was indeed that woman he had an affair with around 15 years ago. with a different contact name, with her contact tagged as a frequently messaged one (i saw them chat through whatsapp and u kno how it tells u which contacts are frequently messaged), with nearly all messages from her starred by him. ok i’ll admit that the messages were nothing indecent, but seriously, the thought of him merely being in contact, especially in friendly terms, with a woman who nearly destroyed our family and caused all of us permanent trauma.... fucking pisses me off. today, i got another look on his phone and i found out that the messages from TWO DAYS AGO were gone, so it seems that he regularly deletes the messages.
my mom has no idea. i havent told anyone. i really want nothing more than to just confront him and ask why he’s still in contact with that bitch. i havent got the chance to, however, bcs this virus got all three of us stuck at home and i cant let my mom know about this. it would crush her.
anyone, please just.... tell me. what were your experiences? what are your advices? im deeply disappointed in him... bcs these past several years he has been such a good dad to me and i guess i just have my hopes up for us to just spend the rest of our time as a family being a... a good, loving, functional one.",18Apr2020,1

267,"I’ve been at community college for the last 2 years. 

To make a long story short, I’ve been taking care of my siblings since I was about 16. Absentee parents, rough childhood, you get it. I didn’t do well in high school because i was working too much and I knew i wasn’t going to go to a UC or state school because i didn’t have the money. 

Community College comes around and I work my ass off. I initially had planned to transfer after 1 year but it ended up being too intensive working 2 jobs. I have internships under my belt, a 4.0 GPA, volunteer work, all while working full time. I wrote a heart wrenching personal essay that made my professor cry, thought it was set. My dream school (UC Berkeley) decisions finally came out today. I was so excited because I knew I was a shoe in and I knew plenty of people with much worse grades and less extracurriculars who had gotten in. Not that they don’t deserve to get in of course, I believe they totally did, but then I thought, well then of course I will too! Everyone’s happy right? 

The pessimist as always after always being let down, I always acted like I wouldn’t get in so that 1) If I didn’t get in, I would be less disappointed, and 2) If I DID get in, I would be that much more excited. 

Well...

I got waitlisted. While this sounds promising, it’s pretty much just a nice “no.” About 9% of thousands of waitlisted students receive admission, to this college alone. So, not great. That’s assuming people who WERE accepted give up their spot, which is unlikely af. 

I live paycheck to paycheck, so if I get into anywhere else I will have to take that offer, as I will need to move, find a new job, and set up before the semester starts. The results for waitlists don’t come out until the end of June, only giving me ONE week to move and find a new job before I have to confirm my acceptance. That’s not realistic, and that’s assuming I get off the waitlist in the first place. 

I’m totally torn. I couldn’t have gotten better grades, I couldn’t have done more work, I couldn’t have done anything better than I did and it still wasn’t good enough. My best friend, who has a GPA of around 3.4 from a rich family (doesn’t work, no internships, etc) got in, and while I’m SO proud of her, i’m just SO confused. I’m heartbroken. I had to fight so hard to get here, and I was just ready for some good news after being laid of due to COVID-19 (I’m a server). I have walked through hell and back and come out stronger than ever, despite everything i faced I did well in school and started to build the life I always wanted to have. I thought, my work ethic coupled with my outstanding academic achievements would get me where I deserved to be. 

I’m torn. I’m unbelievably shaken because it feels like I have just failed. Why wasn’t I good enough? I’ve applied to other schools (who I’ve yet to hear back from) so, it’s not the END of the world. But my dream is truly shattered. I feel so down that I couldn’t accomplish what I set out to. I can’t believe to understand why? WHY? Why not me? Why?!?!! 

How do I get over this feeling of failure. Any recommendations would be helpful. Why does this hurt so bad?",18Apr2020,1
268,"Once upon a time in October, I met this really cute girl and we struck it up as friends. We're on the same cheer team (I am a man btw), but because it was early in the year and I didn't want things to be weird within the team, I didn't really pursue it romantically. We talked, texted, and snapped, but nothing flirtatious. However, as time went on I kinda started crushing on her BUT there was also this other girl who I was interested in at the time, so I was in a pickle. I ended up pursuing the other girl because a) she showed mutual interest and b) I was really good friends with the cheer girl and didn't want to mess things up between us. Well, long story short that romance was short-lived and crashed and burned around January. So, coming back from Winter Break I was still talking to my cheer friend pretty much every day, and, sure enough, I was like ""dam you're so pretty and make me laugh and I think I like you, but not strictly platonically."" But I kept that to myself, and have continued to keep that to myself to this day. HOWEVER, I don't know if I should tell her how I feel or not. Given the circumstances with COVID shutting down our school and us being on opposite sides of the country, it seems like a really inopportune time to tell her I have a fat crush on her. If I tell her and the feelings are mutual, then we won't see each other for 4 months and I will be big sad. But, if I tell her and she sees me as a friend, then we won't see each other for 4 months and I will be big happy because things will have time to cool down/return to normal(after being big sad).

The only problem is we don’t have a dog. And from what we can tell there isn’t a dog nearby doing any of those things either. 

Normally we would try to resolve conflicts with neighbors by going to talk to them but it doesn’t seem advisable with the stay at home order, plus it isn’t clear that they will be able to have a rational conversation.

They have posted constant complaints about us on Nextdoor and on our neighborhood Facebook page, which has led to a few seemingly related minor acts of vandalism.  I did make the mistake of responding to a post earlier in the month  that we didn’t have a dog and a fellow neighbor responded that “I obviously did and that they have seen it pooping in their yard, and have seen in my house- a big white dog that looks untrained and unfriendly”.

&amp;#x200B;

Hello all I am a 20 year old who currently is going full time to a community school (No loans) and will get my associates in science in about a semester or two max. After that I am planning on attending an online school (WGU) (roughly 6k a year which is no problem) to get my bachelors in Information Technology mostly security/networking.

My dilemma is currently in this, I work as a full time technician which I love (great co-workers) who repairs computers and troubleshooting on a wide variety of computers/routers/mesh systems/software installations and some remote logins as well. The pay for this job is okay \~18/hr which is not the greatest but not the worst. While going to WGU in a semester or two I will most likely take it as a part time as I work 40 hours and I see it getting a little more difficult in terms of classes to manage work/school. This job that I currently have is great plus the experience was awesome but after \~2 years here I've learned everything I could and no longer feel like there is much for me here to learn. I want to ask for advice in these three routes

A. Should I continue to work in this job to have 4-5 years of constant experience in the same workplace that I no longer feel is giving me any experience and finish school and try to get a job in actual IT when I am done with school and all that experience

&amp;#x200B;

B. Quit my job and finish school as quick as possible with the limited experience and try to get a job after college (I believe this route is probably the worst in my scenario as I would have loans then and if I continue work I will have no loans)  

&amp;#x200B;

C. Quit my job and try to find a job in actual helpdesk IT so I can try to build my experience even more while going to school part time. 

&amp;#x200B;

I believe as I am writing this my dilemma is in the fact that I don't believe I will be able to get a job after graduating and with the job I currently have which is semi-IT and that I should quit and try to get my foot in the door right now and keep going to school and then try to move up in the IT world. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am really sorry if my grammar is bad. I can't find the right sentences for some reason and how to explain myself in this situation.

Thank you all, if you have better forums that could help out you are more than welcome to recommend them.

not liking them for no reason other then looks and they arent allowed over now. Ive wasted my entire life not having fun and ive discussed my plans with a couple close friends through out my life on how im going to kill myself at some point maybe at age 16-20 because my life is terrible. I get beat by my dad, i hate my entire family and everybody seems to dislike me. Ive smoked weed and done xanax but Ive always got my sister listening to my conversations through my door and i get caught all the time with everything and they now want to send me away. i feel like i have no freedom and havent had fun once in my life and just want to do drugs but even that is hard because i cant hide anything as they search my room and pat me down randomly and listen through my door to hear what i say on calls with friends to use it against me. Ive been upfront and told them i dislike them and hate everybody and how they give me no privacy and never let me have fun or even choose my friends but at the end they tell me ""why do you need privacy"" its only like this with me not my sister. Im always on the same topic about this with friends. They always bring up ""he cant do anything"" ""his dad is always doing this and that"" because they have seen me get beat and bullied by my own dad and at this point im considering when i enter highschool to get a job and leave or something.

277,"Before:

The last thing I remember is running around my block down town New York. Im a middle aged man (mid 20’s) going in my routine nightly run around the block I’ve always done. A group of people who were fully dressed in black with black masks on came out of this super shady SUV that was sitting at the corner I usually turn at. They hit me with something as I was rounding it which knocked me out cold with one swing. The next thing I’m conscious enough for is I’m in the back of a trunk tied up with something over why head obscuring my vision. I was also hated so screaming wouldn’t have done me any good. I moved my leg slightly and someone, who I’m assuming was next to me, hit me again in the head. 

I’m in what I believe is a concrete or cement box now. I’m writing this on a Dell 2014 Laptop they’ve given me to write down my results after these “tests”, or games they call them. I only have access to NotePad and Internet Explorer everything else seems to be deleted or blocked off by a firewall. Whoever set up the firewall for the apps did a poor job at blocking all ways around websites so I made myself a backdoor to reddit to post and update people as I’m put through these simulations and tests. Every day I’m forced through a new series of these. It’s currently day I think 2? Second time I’ve slept anyways. What I guess is around 9am I’m awaken by what some people would call a classic school bell. Then the door opens that’s got nothing but blackness on the other side of it. A radio that’s plugged into the top right of the room speaks to me telling me to exit the room or “bad things” will happen. I’ve complied and followed to exit the room. 

The room layout:

This consists of a wooden desk with a laptop and a charger cord that goes into the wall through a small little hole at the south end of the room. The door is the north end. The door is made of some metal, I’m assuming iron. It’s very thick (about 3-4inches) and has bars on the inside that lock and unlock the door. There is no handle or opening on the other side of the door either.

There is a small mattress with a blanket in the west side of the room and a sink on the East side. With the radio at the top right of the room with a small red light attached to it which I’m assuming is a camera as well. 

The “games”:

The first day they had me walk down a hallway which was only a few feet long, but they had multiple doors on each side. (I didn’t keep track of the amount on each side, but the second day I counted and it seems to have 10 doors on each wall). I walked down until about the ninth door which was open with a green light emanating from it. I entered it which closed the door immediately. A girl, around her mid 30’s was tied up in a chair behind this glass. (Which I later find out, or what I assume to be is one way glass). There was nothing in the room except this glass wall so I stood and watched. Someone came in with a full biohazard suit and slowly cut parts of this girls fingers off. It was the worst experience I’ve ever witnessed. The glass then goes black after a few seconds of agonizing screams until it’s silent. The door opens and I’m told to go back to my room. I obey. 

Back at the room:

After I’m back at the room I’m instructed to write down what I remember from the scene I just watched. Which I did. Then saved it to my desktop. It then disappears before my eyes. Then the computer shuts down. 

It’s what I believe to be is around 4am in the morning and I managed to kickstart this computer again and find a way around the firewall set in place. I will update soon, but I need to wrap this up before I’m caught with having found a way around this. 

I need help to figure out how to escape this place. I’m not sure how long we drove for nor do I know about what’s in the other rooms.",18Apr2020,1

All went smooth until september, for some various reasons the college had to suspend its classes for some time, it lasted until January, in all that time non of them talked to me, but I didn't concerned at all 'cause that's was a difficult time for all of us.

The first day after all that thing I went to them and they kinda refused me, so I ended up being lonely for a few day (my other 2 friends were in their world so...), that instance cause me to started having suicidal thoughts, so I immediately searched for help (luckily the college had a therapist), with her I realised alto of thinks that I did wrong, so I went to one of them and talk it out, and kinda ""repair"" the relationship so, I waited a little bit to talk to the other one... that took me 3 months.

Long story short, today I talked to him and tried to clear the things, but he wasn't that happy about it. Then he pointed out some of the things that I did (some told him, so now  I've some rage too), then I tried to apologize and accept my fault, but he said, and I quote ""I don't tend to do that things (forgive ppl)"".

284,"So a few months ago my neighbor shot my dog who had escaped our yard and was roaming around the neighborhood, the dog was a really sweet one and every one knew it and it actually escaped quite often yet she shot it anyways. At the same time she also aimed a gun at my brother and my other neighbor. She is the literal definition of a hag! A couple months later she called the cops on us for a hole that our dogs supposedly made in the fence even though all of the wood chippings were in our yard and the hole was clearly not big enough for our dog to fit through, I believe this hag made the hole ourself to spite us because we always time letting our dogs outside to when she is outside so they bark at her. We ended up having to pay quite a bit for that ticket and for the repair of the fence.

288,"To start off, I am 22 (f). 

I currently live with my parents, and am studying full time at uni. I have no job. No friends or life. By all means, my parents are good people. I do love them deep down, I know all that they have done for me. They've looked after me my whole life, to the point I rely on them. Lately, I realised I am really getting out of control with my habits. My university has closed, so I've been at home for more than a month now, and due dates for assignments were pushed back. I don't feel like doing anything, eating, talking, doing chores. I spend almost all of my day bingeing online team based games in my living room and hogging the tv. My mother, who has to work from home now is with me 24/7. I want to be alone all the time especially when playing games. I also tend to sleep really late, probably because I'm addicted to playing games I'm not even good at and don't even enjoy. So yesterday, I finished all my assignments and was feeling so bored and empty that I decided to play games all night. My dad, who loves lounging near the tv was there the whole time, to my unfortunate annoyance. Finally, it's 2am and he prepares to go off to bed. He tells me to get off, and I go full blown jerk on him because I don't want to, and he distracted me the entire time. It escalates to him exploding and telling me on my mother, and she ends up barging into my room and trying to force me to sleep, so I explode on her too. I say some terrible things because of my extreme anger, and even feel compelled to hurt in the moment - this then leads to her confiscating my phone. So it leaves me, feeling defeated, regretfully angry and ashamed of myself. Fast forward to now, it's the next evening and I haven't gone out to face my parents. What have I become? I don't feel like a good person anymore, and I haven't for a long time honestly. I know it's because I'm unsatisfied with my life but I really don't think that's an excuse. I don't want to live like  this anymore, but I'm afraid to try anything new at the same time. I feel so stuck, honestly. I'm sick of having no freedom, but I hate myself for thinking like this. Why can't I be like those ""perfect"" children of my mum's friends that she always compares me to? I just want people to offer me advice or just talk, because I feel so alone. My parents are disappointed in me too, I think they secretly wish I would disappear. I'd totally understand that and I kind of want to.",18Apr2020,1
289,"Being alone during this COVID-19 lockdown has given me a lot of time to think.

I'm 23, from the UK. I went to university for three years and graduated in 2017. Since graduating I've excelled in my career and worked for two huge companies and achieving a salary that I honestly didn't know that I'd ever reach in life. You could say that things have gone well. 

But the fact is, I've almost not been at university for as long as I was ever there and that fact scares me because I have not achieved anything that makes me as proud as getting my university grades. I was excited for my future every day at university, looking forward to what was next to come while being surrounded by people that felt the same.

I'm not anywhere near as happy as I was when I was a student and I feel like I've achieved the main thing that people look for when graduating, the big career with great money.

I think I went away for three years to university and now I've come home and lived with my parents again I feel like I've just become a massive man-baby (had literally saved to move out before all this lockdown was enforced). 

I'll never have that thriving social circle again that I had at uni and I know people will say you can make friends again and still go out and have fun. Yes this is true, but surely not as good as I had it at university. Every time we went out there would be a group of 10 of us all up for a good time and I just don't have them connections any more.

I have considered going back and doing a master's but in my field a master's is definately not needed and I think people would judge me for just blowing all that money on an unnecessary 10month booze up. I just feel like when I was at university I massively took the freedom for granted, I want to go back and do another year and this time really appreciate it, but would I just be setting myself up to feel the same way after that year? Or would I feel more fulfilled?

290,"Should I be more lax about how other people can care for my kitten?

Hey guys! I recently adopted a kitten named Princess. She’s four months old and I adore her. The issue is, my family tends to think that my rules are too strict when it comes to her care. 

I only have a few rules when it comes to her care, but I’m very strict about them: 

1. She is not to be allowed into the garage under any circumstances. There are two adult cats that belong to other members of the household, and one of them has tried to attack her multiple times already. 

2. She is not allowed to eat any food besides what I give her. I bought her a specific brand of cat food when I adopted her because her previous family told me that she has an upset stomach when given any other food, but the owner of the other cats thinks that their food is more nutritious and have repeatedly put bowls of the other food out for her against my wishes. 

3. She is not to be allowed outside for two reasons. A) Because of what is going on in the world currently I haven’t been able to get her to a vet, so she is not spayed, vaccinated, or on medicine for fleas or ear mites that I fear she may have, and B) because I do not have a vest for her yet and there are known holes in our fence where the other animals have left our yard several times.

My family cooks most of the time but we have gotten takeout twice since the shutdown started. Before the shutdown, we went pretty regularly to a small sushi place that loves our family and our business. They are very friendly to us because we are regular customers, we even gave them a Christmas gift. Anyways, since their restaurant was actually more expensive than other sushi restaurants, the reason we picked them over the others is because they are a small, quaint, nice little business. I saw an “open for takeout” sign when passing by and thought it might be a good idea to help them out and give them some business. The only problem is that....it’s sushi. It’s not cooked.

When I can finally coax him to come in a bit he does so with his head lowered, ears back, and tail wagging while looking down. Then he comes to me for a couple seconds and leaves fast after I pet him. The rare occasions I can get him to sit for more than a few seconds he starts trembling and tries to get out.

I'm not angry that she does it I'm just concerned from her well being. She doesn't have a good relationship with her mother and deeply hates being at home. I feel like she does this as a coping mechanism as a sort of escape. She probably feels that by being another person she doesn't have the problems anymore.

299,"When I was younger I had sleep paralysis multiple times a night.I still get it every now and then. It came with auditory, physical and visual hallucinations which sometimes lingered even after I’m fully awake and walking around. I learned how to control it and turn it into lucid dreaming which I can still rarely do. Here’s where the issue comes in. I think that my past sleeping conditions have manifested into a form of sleep walking in a sense. I often wake up late and don’t remember turning off my alarm and always assumed that I had woken up and forgotten that I turned it off before falling back asleep which is common for a lot of people. But recently something new happened that is making me question if that’s the case and why i think it might be sleep walking. My father called me the other day to ask to visit him, but I had been sleeping at the time. At one point I woke up and saw I was holding my phone and was 2 minutes into a conversation. I was confused and pretended that I lost service for a second and then asked him to re explain what he said. I’ve tried putting alarms across the room. I’ve tried setting multiple alarms in different areas. Nothing works and it’s causing me problems in life. The phone thing has now happened a couple times where I wake up and become completely lucid in the middle of a phone call meaning that it’s not the common scenario (where you wake up, do something, fall back asleep and forget that you did that thing once you fully wake up later)  

The reason I believe it’s sleep walking related (other then the phone thing) is because sleep walking has a lot to do with the “dreaming” part of the brain just like the sleep paralysis and hallucinations that I had hundreds of times as a kid. I believe the 2 are closely related and might explain why I’ve began to sleep walk.

Can anyone who knows a thing or 2 about sleep help explain what’s going on? And does anybody know how I might be able to find a way to wake up in the mornings. 

This is very stressful because I hate being late for work. I also drive my girlfriend to her work which starts even earlier than mine and I’d hate to be the reason she’s late. Please please help",18Apr2020,1

So back in October, a classmate of mine slid into my DM’s. I didn’t know him that well, and we had never really talked, but we knew who each other were. We started talking and it was friendly at first with a little flirting here and there, but nothing major. Soon, I fell pretty quickly for him and I confessed my feelings and he told me he felt the same way. We talked for a while but we weren’t dating, and he made that clear. After about a week of talking, he friendzoned me and started going out with someone else, but that didn’t last long. We were friendly with each other and went back and forth for the next few months. This last time I was being really cautious because I knew he was likely going to end things in about a week or so. We got the closest we had ever been and even said “I love you” but then he was acting sorta strange. Usually when he acted this way I knew he wanted to end things so I confronted him about it. He told me he still liked me and wanted to keep talking, then essentially he ignored me for five days. I got very angry with him and yelled at him, saying I was done with whatever this is and he told me he was too. This was almost a month ago. I’m not sure if I still have feelings for him, but I do know I care about him.

304,"
I (29f) got a new boyfriend last month before this whole quarantine began. I’ve been single for 5 years and have been working on myself. I’ve dated here and there and didn’t really have much luck. Without gushing because I’m sure you all get the point, My new boyfriend and I get along really well, good chemistry and compatibility. Etc. he’s great. 

My best friend/roommate (m27) has been weirdly negative about it. For background, he had a whirlwind romance back in September and he knocked the girl (21f) up. She had lots of red flags that he openly acknowledged to his friend group but ignored.  Before knowing about the red flags,I honestly was happy that he had found someone because he was kind of an incel for a while. I was very supportive of him as well as after the break up. Since the break up he has become very negative and quickly turned back into the incel personality. 

So I started seeing Dillon before the quarantine stuff went down and when we finally became official I was so excited. Dillon is a professional and award winning photojournalist. I’m also into the arts myself and I think it’s so cool that he *made* it. 

When I was telling the roommate what he did he just rolls his eyes and said “did you know that in other countries, people don’t care about your occupation? Like if they saw you geeking out over it they would think something is wrong with you?” I said “is this your way of telling me that you don’t care?” And he responded “yeah basically” then went on to tell me that he would probably cheat on me if he ever had to go on an assignment and to just keep that in mind. 
I told him I thought he would like to know that because he’s into art too and he said “photography isn’t art” I responded with “and drawing naked anime girls is?” 

The other day, He was laughing about some video regarding some new gen z slang “simp” and then started calling Dillon a simp. I didn’t understand what it meant and he was like “well you’re old so I don’t expect you to”. He knew I was getting anxious about my 30th birthday coming up. 

I’ve been keeping a distance but it’s been hard since we now both work from home now. Since then, the remarks are kind of directed at me in some instances. When I stand up for myself, it becomes an argument to him. He tries to “outsmart” me on stuff and when I prove him wrong he gets all huffy and puffy.  He never cleans up after himself or his cats, and has been EXTRA lazy since Dillon came around. I clean the apartment because he is supposed to come over the next day. I will leave to go to work, and when I come home from my overnight shift the place is a MESS. I’ve confronted him about it and he just shrugs his shoulders and closes his door. 

How do I get him to fuck off without getting evicted?

Initially it was all good we had fun and I genuinely thought he was a stand up guy. Now I am not so sure. When I told him I loved him, he smiled and didn't say anything. I didn't expect him to. After that he just started ignoring me and texting me in mono syllables. He knew I had serious abandonment issues and when I get ignored I spiral. Bad. I would always make plans to meet up. I managed to make time between my research, classes, my thesis defense prep, and my job. He knew I was terrified because my therapist wanted me to meet a psychiatrist to figure my diagnosis. I ended up getting drunk and high every night. Alone. One day I ended up cutting myself. I have never self-harmed. No matter how bad life got. That day I realized the effect his behavior was having on me so I texted him and asked him to meet me. I was going to break up with him. Instead he broke up with me via a text with an half-assed apology for hurting me. Then he ghosted me without returning my stuff back. That pushed me over the edge and I had a psychotic breakdown. My bipolar tendencies came jumping out. I hit mania and didn't sleep or eat for an entire month without realizing it. Eventually I managed to pick myself up, graduated my masters with 3.9 GPA and got admitted to a doctoral program. I am still picking up the pieces of my life. I am in a much better place than last year. But this guy texted me on Monday exactly a year after we had started dating. He apologized to me. I had 10 panic attacks that day. 1 in the middle of the street. The next day I told him I was busy. He didn't reply for the next 2 days. I figured he was just bored because of the quarantine and wanted break up sex but he realized I wasn't interested. He texted me again today asking me how I was doing. Initially, I wanted to give him a dose of his own medicine so I didn't reply to him. I still haven't. But me doing exactly what he did to me, it's messing with my head. I don't know if I should text him and meet him somewhere in public and tell him exactly what he put me through or should I just continue to ignore him. The worst thing about our break up was he had mental health issues too, so I never in my wildest dreams thought he would do this without giving a shit about what it would do to me. In the past few days I realized that he never listened or cared about anything I had told him. I want him to know what he did and get my closure but if I reply to him, I am terrified that after I tell him that and to get out of my life for good, I'll spiral again.

However, when I deactivated my other account (personal) because it wasn't in use, they confronted me about it the next day and asked why I blocked them in a passive aggressive way, and implied that they were talking about it and mocking me for it. That confrontation overall made me scared to block people or remove them.. even if i block them, they could still find me on other accounts possibly?

311,"My stepdad over the summer ""persuaded"" my mom into getting a German Shorthaired Pointer puppy. These guys are super athletic, hunting dogs with a bunch of energy. Anyway, at  around this time, my stepdad and I were working full time, so the only person who could take care of this puppy was my mom who just had knee surgery - so basically she couldn't really take care of him for a month and a half or so. My stepdad and I work kinda seasonal-ish, so when summer ended, he told his employer that he was on ""vacation"" (which basically means that he was at home this entire time and wanted to watch the place fall apart), my mom had to go back to work full time for 3 months in the fall (she needed to have another surgery) and I went back to school full time, and to maybe add in here, the drive is about a half hour to 45 mins drive away from my house.

Anyway, when fall comes around and I'm in school again, my stepdad didn't train him well other than the commands to do it. You know, the sit, stay, come, and down. He's doesn't really listen and my stepdad got him to a point where if his dog whines, my stepdad will either yell at him to be quiet or go to his attention. My parents bought this 150$ shock collar and never used it on him because my stepdad felt too guilty to consider it.

Winter comes around, my stepdad is still not working and my mom goes in for another surgery. He still doesn't do shit to train this dog. I come home and my stepdad's dog is jumping on me with the muddy paws my stepdad didn't bother to clean up. I tell the dog ""no jump"" but he still jumps on me. He jumps on everyone, not sure if it's because he is less than a year old or because we just aren't training him. Also to note, my stepdad thinks that obedience school is a joke so we never took him to obedience school either.

Now my stepdad is a truck driver and he's left my mom and I to take care of him. My mom is working full time again, and my stepdad's dog has been going crazy with the whining and the barking every single time I'm in lecture, doing exams and quizzes and homework. I tanked my  grades because all I could hear is just barking and whining. I also have my finals next week and I can barely even feel myself write anymore. I kennel him up as late as I can stay up and he screams from his kennel until someone gets him out. My mom and I don't trust him because he chews up our shoes and my mom's orthopedic feet things idk.

We don't take him out on the recommended walks everyday, we don't really play with him as intense as he should be playing, we are basically not the right type of owners for this dog and honestly I feel guilty about how we treat him.  I asked my mom about why we have this dog and she says ""it's your stepdad's dog, we were ""prepared"" to take this on"". And it set me off. We weren't ""prepared"" he just got mad at her for not wanting a puppy and just finally agreed after he begged for so long.

I love dogs, I really do. It's just that this entire time my stepdad had the time to train him properly and just didn't, and my mom couldn't care less about a dog and how it's trained, as long as it doesn't jump up on her . Now that he's gone for several weeks at a time and that I'm trying to maintain my usual study/class/sleep schedule it's been so difficult to keep up with because there's a puppy literally barking at me to get me to give him attention. It's a super selfish thing to say, but honestly I'm tired and I need some advice to keep up with his dog and train him properly when the semester is over. Should I utilize this shock collar? How do I even start training as he is almost a year old and we've had him for nearly a year? How do I crate train him when he is traumatized by being in his crate? Please I literally need help I'm so frustrated and stressed. 

tldr my stepdad irresponsibly bought a puppy not understanding that no one else but him could take care of said puppy, became a truck driver and now puppy knowing only basic commands is barking his way into my academic life and i'm aggressively sobbing because it's not the puppy's fault that he's like that, its all of our faults and i want to change him",18Apr2020,1

315," So there is this girl right. I’ve known her for some time, now it’s almost 2 years. Anyways December 2019 we actually started talking to each other. She is a popular girl with a gorgeus body. I am a normie. We started talking because my friend told me that if I got a nude from a girl he’d pay me 5$ (it’s not much, but it’s something). So I texted the girl, told her about the situation and turns out my friend has been asking her a lot for nudes lol. In short, she ended up sending me nudes, and we started talking more.  Everything was fine for 2-3 months, I didn’t like her, I just admired her as a person. Her personality was great, she was kind and caring and always laughed at every stupid thing, but she could also be dead serious and talk about more «dark» things. Her body was also stunning and actually when I asked for nudes she just sent me without it being a problem.  Anyways. It’s now April and she haven’t opened my snap for 3 weeks. It feels like she just lost interest in me. She is like the popular girl who is drowned in snaps. I miss talking to her, laughing with her, smiling with her, but I don’t think she miss me the same way. What should I do?

I’m also seeing her a lot in others private stories, and that makes me think about her even more. I do not like her, even though it might look like it, I just miss her as a friend who would support me trough everything.

I used to party when I was younger but I can’t do it anymore, a little of it has to do with the fact, my wife gets verbally abusive when she drinks and I hate how drunk she gets, she’s insults me when we are alone. The next day she’s back to normal and we are back to our normal lives. She knows she’s mean when she’s drunk but always blames it on me. I don’t know what to do anymore, I have developed anxiety when she mentions she wants to go out, cause it is always a shit show. She likes to do coke sometimes and I hate it but she will sneak off and do it. Not often but a few times a year. Am I being unreasonable with my requests to leave peoples homes at a reasonable hour? Or Am I being controlling and “ruining her night”? If this something you can relate with, please tell me how you deal and what you do instead?

I’m almost 100% certain he likes me. I’m wondering if I should wait for him to say something or if I should mention it. People are saying that it won’t hurt to say something, but it might make it awkward if he doesn’t feel the same. I also don’t want to put pressure on him if he isn’t ready for anything yet. I don’t know what to do. Would it really hurt to tell him I like him? How do I approach the conversation? Should I do it over text or in person? Should I just wait? So many questions!

So I go online and vent about all that to my friend and he laughs and says that if he were in charge he would leave the gays alone, but he would have the trans people shot, and he was serious and he is known to use the n-word on a regular basis (he's a white guy) so this is confirmed bigotry and I don't feel comfortable playing with him, but currently he is my only regular social connection.

My mom loves where we live now and realized that during this separation that she was much happier without him (there were other factors too; she didn’t make a sudden shallow decision). But my dad has been trying to list our house on the market and have us come look at houses where he lives to come move there. 

I’m 19 and I thought this would never happen to me. I thought my parents loved each other even though they disagreed at times and they’ve been married for 22 years.

333,"So Im kinda lost and hurt at my current situation. I’m about 6 weeks pregnant from the guy I was with. Me and him had an on and off relationship that first started as friends with benefits but slowly progressed to more.  Our friendship and relationship consisted of drinking as our way of having fun. and tbh most of our fights were from when he would be a drunk mess ,and starts arguing ,sometimes it would be me starting the argument ,sometimes it would be him so not saying it’s always him. But anyways no matter what we would always go back to each other (not saying it’s a good thing ) our relationship started off good he was sweet and would take me out to eat and we would spend time during the day and then spend the night together and watching movies and cuddling but it slowly started to go down hill then quickly went from bad to worse after that. But for some stupid reason we would always go right back to each other like rubber bands when pulled away. That was always the case, but we would talk about trying to fix things. Well like a month before I got pregnant he started nutting in me saying he wanted to start a family with me, but once I got pregnant n I took a pregncy test infront of him things started changing. he just stopped all efforts with me and doesn’t even bother keep in touch anymore like how we used to. Before he would tell me he misses me and to come and sleepover but now he doesn’t ever tell me to spend time together and the last time I did  was about a week ago he told me i had to go home because he was going to go to the store to get something to eat, I know it probably doesn’t sound like a big deal but usually he would have told me”let’s go get something to eat” but instead it was I’m going to get some food so your going to have to go back home. And that was the last time I saw him.  And our spending time together went from us having one on one time or watching movies together ,to me being there but him being on his phone on Netflix by himself the whole time. He doesn’t care much about kicking it or spending nights together anymore. We still text every now and then but it’s just short quick ending conversations. He told me he doesn’t care much about me and all he wants is his kid once it’s born and even said he was going to take it away from me because he wants it all to himself and that he’s working and I’m not so it will be an easy fight In court. I already have a daughter with someone else so I’m kind of stressing over another one and hurt at the same time that he’s not by my side while I’m going through morning sickness and not willing to be a family and raise it together. I’m just lost as to why he would even put me through that and purposely get me pregnant In the first place?? I don’t know if he’s probably in shock or something and is just using this time to think it through or if he really just a dick I just been hoping he will turn around and change. I’m not sure what to do I know abortion isn’t something good and he’s told me not to abort it but I have a barely-going-to-be two year old daughter and having another one with someone that isn’t even going to bother to be together seems like something that isn’t going to end up good.. I don’t have a job and was barely going to start going to college to get a career started in the medical field and I know another baby would set me back.. please no rude opinions I know I’m at fault for not being on birth control and not leaving him as soon as I saw things going bad but the thing about me is I always learn things the hard way and once it’s too late.. I’m 21 btw and he’s 23.. 

And another thing my first baby daddy has recently started trying to win my love back and treat me good he’s been doing everything that my ex hasn’t been doing ..taking me out to eat buying a clothes,etc been doing everything to try make me happy but I know if he would know that I’m pregnant by some other guy which by the way he actually hates him then I know he wouldn’t want to be with me and never look back. 

But yea I just been feeling alone during this whole process I would just try to ignore it and forget I’m pregnant but I get all day morning sickness that stops me from doing my daily activity normally and I can’t even tell anybody like friends or family(mom dad,etc) about my situation because they will all just be disappointed or mad so I just try to play off me feeling sick/trying not to show it but it’s getting harder to do..",18Apr2020,1

I'm twenty-three and possibly a failure. I left school at sixteen as I never really succeeded at anything, I found the work boring and I just wasn't interested nor did I put in the effort as I was more into developing my social skill set. I did work various roles in retail and hospitality but I decided to go to TAFE* (I'm from Australia, I will explain below) and I got my certificates in things to do in the community such as aged care and mental health as I was interested in becoming a youth worker but I then decided I wanted to go to University(college) and become a teacher so I did a course and Volia! Now I'm probably dropping out of that as well for various reasons and I'm still in my first year and semester. 

I have my heart set on writing but I don't know if it's a passing fancy or something I am really into. I feel really sure of it, much more than I did about going to uni. I dont feel nervous about it. I know that I am going to need something full-time job wise while I write as it won't be paying the bills for a very long time (unless I'm weirdly lucky). 

I don't know what to do anymore. I feel like I'm letting everyone down as everyone in my family was so excited that I was going to university and now I'm possibly throwing it away. I'm sure people are in the same boat but I feel like if I don't get my shit together soon then I'm going to be missing out on a lot of things and I don't want to waste my life going back and forth. Any advice? Thank you for reading and responding. 

* Tafe is a government-run system that provides education after high school in vocational areas, like beauty, design, accounting, business, recruitment, IT, and many more. While university teaches a broad range of theories, TAFE focuses on specific skills for a particular workplace. For example, a Certificate IV in Aged Care teaches all the skills needed to work in aged care – either at a client’s home or an aged care facility. TAFE is usually taught at TAFE Institutes around Australia.",18Apr2020,1

346,"I'm 26 years old and have never had friends and my family has bullied me my entire life. I have a hard time opening up to people and give off an emotionless robot vibe. Because I was always bullied about my emotion I'm only emotional by myself. I'm even emotionless with my therapist. Though not for their lack of trying. Which sucks because I'm actually really emotional. Seriously, it's not like I don't want to. it's that I can't. Breathing underwater is more practical than expressing myself. Sorry for the bad writing. English is my first and only language.

I'm scared of dying alone.

No girl who has ever looked at me has looked even remotely interested. I've heard gay men are pretty forward, but again, no one has ever seemed interested in me. Does this mean I look Lovecraftian? I don't believe so. But, I'm definitely not a looker.

I was going to ask a cashier out but then this pandemic started and I haven't seen her since. She was the person I've ever seen whose smile looked genuine and not painfully forced. She was even kinda cute. Even if I had asked her out, where would we go? Everywhere is closed.

I'm not good at anything.

I got bullied out of school at 14 and I don't know how I'm supposed to improve my life when I'm scared to express my emotions. With or without a pandemic.

Everything I've tried I've been awful at. Gaming, writing, programming, building, drawing, painting, etc. I'm not good at anything. Combining them all together, I've spent almost an entire year on these. About 8,500 hours.

What the fuck am I supposed to with my life? I have nothing and no one and I don't know how to be emotional or good at something.",18Apr2020,1
347,I am getting really sick of my partner taking a ridiculous amount of time on the toilet. Everyday he is in there for a minimum of an hour and a half. He is most often about 3-4 hours. We have a 5 month old baby so this means that while he is in there I cant do anything. I have to take sole responsibility for our daughter and try do things which I cant because she has just become mobile so I cant take my eyes off her. So I end up stuck so I cant make food or pour myself a drink or clean and it's hard. And even more so when he does it just before dinner time. We try to establish a routine of 6PM dinner 6.30pm shower 7PM stories and 7.30pm bedtome for our baby but I cant make dinner or shower her or get anything done when he is in the bathroom from 5 till 9!? I get really angry about this but he gets really upset and says it genuinely takes him that long. Which I believe because it's been going on a long long time but I've asked him to see a doctor or do something to help it and he ignores the doctor's advice. He doesn't drink water ever all he drinks is coke like spending $20 a week on it and that's all he drinks. He tried drinking flavoured water for about a month a while ago and it helped but he gave up said he hates water.

349,"I (F18) have had some mental health struggles the last few years. Most of which stem from my anxiety. I have slowly started coming to the conclusion I might be interested in seeking help. I saw a video of a girl talk about how she started anti-anxiety meds and how she progressively started doing small things like public speaking (something I could never bring myself to do). After I saw this I was intrigued by the idea of improvements. But my anxiety is telling me not to go to therapy because everything will go wrong or it’s going to be useless. I mean I have quite a bit more fucked up mental issues than just the anxiety- that’s just the one that effects me constantly or triggers other issues I go through. 

I am just so so tired of always feeling like somethings wrong with me compared to other people because of the way I feel things. (Questions below)

Yesterday my brother called me about how excited he is because our parents are turning my old room into his new exercise room. I’m not really comfortable with anything about that, but I know I’m just being overly sensitive and silly either way. But even if I’m being overly sensitive, it still hurts whenever he brings it up. I asked him to talk about something else but it’s the only thing he’s talked about yesterday and today. I don’t know what to do anymore really. I want someone to talk to through all this- but I don’t want to hear about how great it is for me to be gone because now my brother gets my old room in to exercise.

351,"This will be very long. 

My boyfriend and I have a long distance relationship which is almost at the two year mark. We’ve tried to meet up and stay together monthly, and in our anniversary month (it was last summer) the friend was calling his phone while we we’re still up late at night. At that point though I had never heard anything about her. I had never heard her name before because being long distance we didn’t really know each other’s friends, just like their names from mentioning hanging out with them. I can’t exactly remember how he told me that she was a friend and that she often called him to comfort her when she was upset about her family or boyfriend. 

I was a takenback and suspicious, I admit, as I knew about his male friend group but had never heard about this female friend. He took the call in the other room and talked and play against each other on a game. Some other stuff happened like he explained that he was staying with me and said abruptly ended their call and wouldn’t pick it back up until I literally took my boyfriend’s phone and was texting her pretending to be him to convince her to get back on the phone. I did this because my boyfriend had told me that he was worried that she would “do something stupid because a situation she was going through. I had also had to deal with that situation before so I knew how it felt to be alone. Eventually she picked back up, and I fell asleep while they were still on the call. She tried calling again for the next two night we were together but he didn’t pick up those calls. 

A month later and I was still suspicious. I don’t have the best self esteem so I was thinking perhaps I was not good enough. I asked my boyfriend questions how they knew each other etc and he gas lighted me. Initially when I asked how often she rang him in the middle of the night he said that her calling that night was the first time that she rang. 

However, a few months later I broke down because it made no sense and he admitted to lying and that she’s been calling him since before he met me and some nights while we were in our ldr. He even got angry at me for questioning the things he had originally told me (which turned out not to be the truth). It caused a lot of pain for me to be lied to when it was completely unnecessary to lie. And because of that one lie and my awful feelings about myself I got extremely suspicious about everything. 

Another month later, we met up again. I snooped on his phone. It was an extremely scumbag thing to do. I found that their entire text conversation had been deleted from his phone. On Instagram, the messages he’d had from other girls were all gone too. It fucked with my head. I learned then and there why they say don’t go looking for things you don’t want to find. My suspicions grew again. 

Flash forward months and months to now. He has apologised many, many times. For the lying, for not telling me about his friend in the first place. He’s said many times too that he does love me, otherwise he would not have wasted my time or let us waste our money to pay to rent places to see one another. I love him a lot too. My self esteem got knocked a bit more when this happened, and I constantly have my doubts about the reasons he wants to be with me. We have talked things out numerous times. However, when I’m feel very bad about how I look, it’s what I think about. I’ve tried being more positive about myself, complimenting myself, but everyone has those days where you just like a garbage truck. I’ve tried reasoning that he really would not be with me if he didn’t actually want to be with me given the distant between us. But none of it has worked because I can’t move on from the initial lies. 


What advice is there on how can I move forward so I stop inserting my doubts and self esteem issues into our relationship? Thanks in advance, and sorry for the very long read.",18Apr2020,1
352,"I graduated college in Dec 2019 also I hateee confrontation. In my college, I mostly hung out with these two girls M and A. Now in the beginning of our ""friendship"", M and A were fine. But A decided she was going to make my life hell. She is one of those girls who is honest and speaks her mind usually to say degrading things and covers it up as ""I'm usually an asshole but I'm just being honest. No one else is brave enough to be like me.""  A and M were obsessed with being fair, A is like reallyy fair and I was the only tan one. I suspect A didn't like me beacause of my skin color too. I tolerated her. I knew M from childhood but she was closer to A. The both of them loveeeddd to talk about themselves and how they're pretty and all the boys love them. 

I got into a relationship near the end of college, it was/is my first relationship. At first, both of them supported it but then began to talk about how he's probably going to dump me or cheat on me. He proposed to me. Then they would talk about how I'm throwing my life away for a guy. I would try to tell them that he's a nice guy but they didn't want to hear that so I stopped telling them anything about my life.  Then M got engaged and all they would talk about is M's future hubby being amazing and super rich.
I kept distant to them. A still found days to belittle me ""Your outfit is hideous.""
""You have terrible fashion sense."" ""You're so whipped."" ""You're cute, not pretty. I would rather be called beautiful or pretty than cute.""

I wanted to call her a bitch and tell her that she's not exactly an angel or even that pretty but I knew A lovesss drama. M and A would talk about how much they hate drama but they literally have been in the most drama situations in that college. I focused my self in studies and didn't hang out with them near the end. I didn't even say bye to them. I just wanted to graduate. They were being extra bitchy near the end anyways.

Now I have all of this pent up anger and hatred in me. I didn't expect this to happen. I muted A on all social media and recently unmuted M. I wanted them to called out for the bitches they were and I wish harm and unhappiness on them. It feels stupid to me but they really did try to ruin my self confidence, especially A. I want them to hurt. But college is over now and I probs won't see A ever again. But I don't know how to get rid of this anger and hurt. I want everyone to see the terrible people they were.

I'm not really sure how and where to start. Basically one of my (internet) friends is talking less to me. I'm not sure how and why this happened. 

I've already asked him if we're still cool, and he said yes. 
I can't help but think that something might be wrong however. Does he wants to stop this friendship? 

Compared to my other friends, i don't talk a lot. They usually keep me in the conversation. I message them of course if there's something that i like to talk about or if i've seen something funny. It's the same for this friend. I thought about trying to be more talkative, thinking that he grew tired of constantly talking to me and wanting me to be more talkative, but this was never an issue in the past 2 years (atleast from my point of view).

Yeah, the title pretty much sums it up, but for a bit of a backstory; I (f25) was close friends with this girl (f27) for about 5 years. She has an addiction problem, and for the last year has been treating me pretty poorly, to the point where my therapist told me it was better for my mental health to cut her out.

I pretty much cut her out 6 months ago, but still kept a door open if she ever needed help, but she took advantage of that, borrowing money and stuff.

A few days ago she messaged me wanted to pay me back, I told her 'okay, good', but she then started harassing me with texts again calling me all sort of names. This is a normal thing, she's pretty much been harassing me for 6 months and I finally had enough and sent her a message back telling her Im done with this, Im blocking her, she can keep the money and that I dont want any more contact with her.

She. Lost. It. Publically shared my fb profile with long texts calling me all sort of names, got quite a few of her junkie friends to message me, contacted my friends and family telling all sorts of lies. And it wasnt just close friends and family, it was everyone from people I went to high school with 10 years ago to my moms aunt.

She publically shared so much, even my phone number. I've gotten so many messages the last 24 hours or people telling me all the shit she's sending them about me. Im literally in tears. I have so much anxiety and I really dont know what to do. 

I tried blocking her everywhere but she keeps making new accounts, my friends keep reporting her posts but Facebook dosnt take them down, she keeps having her friends message me and my friends threatening to release even more info that she already has.

Has anyone had to deal with this before? I dont wanna give in and unblock her, but at the same time, it dosnt seem to stop. Any tips on what to do? Will she eventually give up?",18Apr2020,1
358,"I am in my senior year and i’ve had this teacher for my junior and senior year (again), my chemistry teacher that is. He is absolutely uninterested in teaching the class, hardly teaches properly and I struggle with the subject already and on top of this he is a horrible human being. I was struggling a lot with my mental health last year and failed a few classes but was trying to keep up with my assignments, notes and tests.

I was certainly improving very slowly, but I was, and it was a win for me! From dragging myself out of a very dark place to attending classes and looking ahead meanwhile my boyfriend in my class also helped me a lot academically and emotionally.

It gets very disturbing though when he started throwing comments about me in class when I used to be absent about how I was a horrible student, I was not capable of doing anything, how I was bad at everything from co-curricular to academics and suggesting students of my class to not talk to me.

I was shocked when my friends told me about this and it went up like wildfire in school, why would a teacher hate me so much? It was very hard to keep going with so much burden and this only made it worse. 

Quick look at my personality: I have been a top scorer in languages with a 4.0 GPA, I have won a regional level band competition and a best instrumentalist, excelling a lot in my co-curricular, i’ve been the nice kid in all my classes throughout MY LIFETIME! I’ve never had to deal with such a pig for a teacher (or ever call a teacher as a pig) but this takes a toll on me.

He is sexist about multiple things too and in a class of 13 students there are just 3 girls, one too weird socially and isolated and the other having a hearing disability and the 3rd one is me. 

I feel frustrated because I feel this burden of excelling somehow because I need to earn a good college but this teacher is making it really hard for me, ignorance is not possible because this teacher is also taking online classes Mon-Sun every morning! It is exhausting to keep up with this kind of toxicity everyday and if we miss classes he straight up calls my parents asking why am I missing classes.

I don’t exactly know what to do but I need an insight as to how do I study and not give him this much energy because he’s like a leech and drains me out as a person, and also he’s a horrible teacher so the overall grades of our class is very poor and the ones in the bottom half like me only find it a lot more harder to reach in the other half because of this teacher who makes us unmotivated and negative about our future every time we fail. The entire class hates him but as kids nobody knows what exactly should be done, my parents hate him too but they’ve asked me to suck it up and study on my own but having such an environment is VERY DRAINING.

Not only are they working for me and my family they are living with me (my family are living in campers on site so it’s just us). Work ends. Everyone payed. A week or so later i pull up and go to my room (the basement which has a door to the outside) my kitten is gone/ I had had her 3-5 months. I freak. I figure she had ran away but she was an inside cat. I didn’t know what to do and I was so upset: I come to find out from a mutual friend that one of my best friends E and his new girl from the job L and another of my friends and best friend to L, ER  had stole my kitten from my house when I wasn’t home.


Stealing a cat from a friend is messed up.
Me and E had been good friends for years.

After about 2 years I tried (honest to god tried ) to make amends. I tried us meeting up to drink and get real more than once through mutual friends, tried to just hang out through mutual friends, none of it worked. He didn’t want to. Hell: even the last time I saw him his Gf at the time (the one from the job, not the current one) couldn’t help but talk about how “it’s a Shame there cat died having birth to kittens etc etc etc they were taking about my kitten that’s how it died I made amends with Ec and she told me about it before they did that “scene” infront of me and friends.


That brings us to current day. E is engaged. To a girl I was actually cool with and have no beef. I’m ordained. We havnt talked in 4 years and even though I saw him about 9 months ago through a mutual friend he didn’t even look at me. I find out today through my best friend who he visited that he wants me to be the preacher at his wedding. Idk what to do. My best friend says he wants to meet up and talk (which I have tried MANY times over the last couple years, I don’t like having people) but Idk what to do. Honest to god I don’t. Iv reached out.

362,"Art has been the only thing I was ever good for my whole life, and I've always been a lot better at it than most other kids. I was that weird kid that nobody talked to who would always be drawing something, and my ADHD brain made damn sure everything they taught in school was mind-numbingly uninteresting to me, even though I had the brains for it.

Rationally I knew I was talented and skilled enough, but indecisive, depressed and insecure as I was, I didn't have enough faith in myself when it came time to apply for art school. I rationalized it by telling myself it was so that I wouldn't have too hard a time finding a job, yet still I struggle to forgive myself, to the point that I've avoided doing art for the past 2 years altogether, as it reminded me of what could have been, and because any art I do now won't go towards anything anymore.

Now I'm a 20-year-old in a mediocre university, 2 years into an econ program while trying to transfer into business with shit grades. But what's even the point? I'm only trying to get into business because I wanted to do something that wasn't econ, and business happened to require the fewest extra courses.   I don't even know why I'm doing all this, my parents, I guess.

I'm in way too deep to pull out and do something else, too much time and money spent. I have nothing else going for me: dead end part-time job, no close friends (I wonder why), et cetera. Everything about me is excruciatingly mediocre, except art, which of course I had to throw away like garbage, go figure. I don't see myself ever really getting over this, and my current situation feels suffocating. I guess I can only stick with business, and hope I finally go through with something for once.

364,"TLDR; I never wanted to be in a relationship with someone who smokes cigarettes. Fiance staring to smoke them. Should I suck it up and deal with it or think about leaving? 

My (27F) fiance (32M) has recently started smoking cigarettes more often. When he was younger, he smoked them daily but quit after his daughter was born. He recently started smoking every time he drinks (which is too often, but that's another issue). It is getting to the point now where he's smoking even when he's not drinking. 

To me, smoking is a deal-breaker. I've always told myself I would never be with someone who smokes cigarettes.
He knows I feel this way, I've made it known since the beginning of our relationship. He keeps hiding it from me and then being confused when I find out and get mad. 

I myself am really confused because I feel like I'm betraying myself by lowering my standards of not being with someone who smokes. I've already let go of quite a few expectations I have for myself and my life with him. I love him very much and he's great most other ways. Caring, helpful, loyal, funny. 

I've invested 6 years and built a home with him. I am planning on giving the rest of my life to him. I don't want to just leave, but I can't keep lowering my standards for him. When I talk to him about it, he gets defensive. I know there are much, much worse things he could be hiding from me...so I guess I should be grateful?

She does certain things such as digging for earwax with her fingers at the dinner table, constantly picking her nose, and the worst is she is always fiddling and touching her feet/toes. She will do all of this and then not wash her hands before touching food or something of that kind. 

She was raised by someone who didn’t practice any of the hygiene basics and even at that she left home really young so didn’t even have the chance to learn, so I understand why she does this.

There was one night where he had his arm around me and I was like 😐 not because I didn’t like him but because I just didn’t know how to take it and he said “damn you’re not gay for me?” Like WHAT does that mean!! 😭 I am gay for all men!! 😭 I kind of want to send him a message and be like “did you ever actually like me or was that just something you did when you were drunk” but I don’t want to come out of nowhere with this craziness if it wasn’t what I thought I was.

372,"Hello. I'm a 27 year old male from Norway. I work as a caretaker at a group home for mentally challenged individuals, and my job requires that I'm resilient, chill and alert. I enjoy my work and I haven't gotten any complaints from my colleagues or the residents, but the job can be stressful and draining (Getting a new job is out of the question). 

I struggle with anxiety, depression and anxiety-induced insomnia, and I tend to self-medicate with caffeine, nicotine and gaming, which obviously is making things worse (FYI: I've been seeking help and I have my first appointment with a therapist next week).  


Anywho, I'm perfectly aware that I should take better care of myself, and that it's my responsibility to do so. My life would certainly improve if I went cold turkey on nicotine, and if I improved my sleep quality. I've tried to get my act together numerous times, but I always get overwhelmed and give up. It feels like I'm going in and out of rehab, so to speak.

I am currently attending college for a degree in computer science. Once this outbreak started school got closed down and everyone has switched to online courses. My problem is this;
As the quarantine period started my internet access went out and the earliest I can get someone to look at it is next month. School will be finished by then and my grades already weren't super great going into this, so there is a good chance that if I cant get this sorted I could fail my courses. I have only a desktop computer, no laptop.
My question is;
What would be my best option for getting my desktop PC connected to public internet so I can attend my online courses? Libraries are closed temporarily where I live so I couldn't use a library computer.",18Apr2020,1

376,"Sorry for the long post and its rambling nature in advance. Im extremely heartbroken right now.

21, University student. Shit recently hit the fan with my parents. 
As long as I could remember they would always fight, but would make up and carry on as normal. I think it was just a front for me and my brother, 9.
 My father lacks empathy at times and has a rather nasty temper on him, but he would never hurt this family. My mother deals with this through alcohol, she never hurt anyone while drunk, she is the best person ever.
My father stayed over at a friends house (female) to organize some stuff for us during this lockdown (since her house was closer to the warehouse) and my mother took it very hard and now believes that my dad cheated on her with this woman, merely because he came back empty handed. He said he didn't, and he came back with nothing due to his contact bailing out at the last minute. Also, my dad is attached to his phone, always on it, except when he was at her house, which makes her think that he speaks to her all the time. He stayed there for two nights to apparently wait for his contact.
Right now my mom is heartbroken and refuses to have an actual conversation with my dad, and the things they say to eachother hurts really bad. Both of their love tanks are dry, they are both hurt.
I spoke to my father yesterday, he still loves my mom, but he says when he makes sure she is well off (getting her phd) he might/or not divorce her. He called it his 5 year plan, again, it is a maybe. He also said my uncle asked him to marry my mother to get her out of the gutter, which honestly destroyed me.They refuse to go to counseling too.

This is where I ask for advice; I struggled with depression and last year I decided I won't fall into that pit again. However, this whole situation is taking a toll on me. I cant speak to my therapist nor leave due to lockdown. I cried so hard last night that I now have bruises under my eyes, I can't eat either and would rather stay in bed the whole day. I feel so sorry for my brother as well.
What can I do in this situation? I'm so lost, so sad. I just need some advice on how I can cope with this. I always thought a day like this would happen, but I really don't know how to handle this. I love my family, and this breaks me.",18Apr2020,1
379,"Not sure what I'm looking for other than a handhold/words of encouragement.   


I posted a couple of days ago about my recent struggles to get on with my partner who is overseas (since jan) working in a demanding role. Since getting engaged just over a month ago we have been in frequent conflict and I was pushing some hot buttons- mainly because I doubted his commitment to me and whether he was willing to put in more effort. Some of you responded with some really perceptive comments and noted that we weren't compatible/that the r'ship had run its course.   


The expectation from him was that I would drop my job (which I love) /friends/lifestyle etc to join him in the US late summer. I've been worried about doing this given I enjoy my lifestyle and felt like he wasn't willing to compromise on small things, like the layout of the apartment which he obviously chose. I also didn't get any reassurance from him about how he would support me in finding works etc out there. I very much felt like it it would be me making all the sacrifices.   


Looking back I can think of other areas where he wasn't willing to compromise or listen.  


He (divorced only last year) had been trying to manage down my expectations of a wedding. He wasn't keen on having any family and friends there and wanted a quickie do in the states where he's based. Every conversation I've brought up recently has been shot down and he acted like it would be a huge compromise for him to get married in the UK- where our families live. He even cited struggling to get time off, which I knew was a dishonest coverup for something deeper.  


Fast forward to last night and he sent me a long message after a couple of days silence, pretty callously telling me that whilst he loves me, in his heart of hearts he doesn't think it's going to last. This was in response to me saying that I was just looking for reassurance from him that he'd be willing to put my needs first. Apparently not!   


He said that the past few days of arguing have highlighted our differences, he's not prepared to leave his job/new city and the breakdown of his first marriage was horrific and he doesn't want to go through that again. He knows I'd be unhappy and it's a recipe for failure.   


This is all totally understandable but this has been sent over a WhatsApp message. After being with me for 2 years and getting engaged just over a month ago. I'm blindsided. No follow up. 

I'm shocked that he would go to the trouble of getting engaged (he said it was because he missed me like crazy and just wanted me out there and ignored his reservations) only to drop me 6 weeks later after a total change of heart. At no point in this process has he offered to compromise or make changes to his behaviour so I know this is the right thing in the long run but I just feel so wretched. It's made all the worse by lockdown but at least I'm with my lovely M&amp;D.  


I wonder if anyone has any advice as to how I move forward positively under these weird times? Despite my misgivings, I genuinely thought he and I could get over this initial bump of moving abroad and that he would be my person for life based on how caring, dependable and loving he had been overall. In the last few days it's totally switched. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just feel utterly betrayed by the way he has handled getting engaged and the fact he has ended our 2 year r'ship over a WhatsApp.   


Thanks for listening!",18Apr2020,1

I respect her choice BUT there is a part of me that will die without them in some kind of symbolic artwork in my universe. I am not who I am without both of them. I have been mostly avoiding this consequence but it is keeping my parents worried and my heart broken. We are not one without each other.

Now, I had known his older brother for a couple years and we had previously admitted to each other that we “used to” like each other and left it at that. Well, fast forward to now, the older brother and I started talking again and he asked me if I’d like to go on a date with him. I said yes because I genuinely am interested in him, but he doesn’t know that I was intimate with his brother. I know if I go out with him I’ll have to tell him about that relationship, but I anticipate that he won’t want to talk to me after that. Should I even try or should I tell him and wait for his reaction? Is it morally okay to date him or even like him? Just to be clear I never dated the younger brother nor did we like each other romantically, it’s just easier to call him an ex. Thank you for reading.

So since she has free time now she wants to catch up with us and stuff.

Yet she insists on hitting a high rank without having the ability to play on par with the players of that rank. It's not good for her, I've seen her throw her phone around and crack it from sheer rage.

389," There might be a lot of deep and detailed backstory needed here, but I will try to make things short but relevant and clear.  


Here we go, and I apologize for any type of error made (formatting, spelling, etc). DISCLAIMER: This might be a long read.  


My dad died in September 2019, almost a month after I just turned 16. By that time, we were renting an apartment for him and I only (mother is out of the picture). But since he died, I had to move out and go back to the house where him and I used to live immediately, which was my grandmother's house. Obviously, I was so broken then (and still I still am), but I obviously had to attend to a lot of things after his death, and one of them was the financing and inheritance part.  


Long story short, I got a bank account under my name and my grandmother's name, so it's a joint account. The money in that bank account was from my dad, for me (emphasis on this), and the only reason why my grandmother's name is under it is because I am still a minor and can't have it under my name only.  


Fast forward December 19, 2019, she tells me she withdrew 491 dollars from the joint account that we have. It's relevant to know that she withdrew this alone, as I couldn't accompany her due to school hours. Later that day, I tried to look for the account's passbook, only to realize she hid it. After moments of searching, I finally found it. I opened it and discovers she actually withdrew 589 dollars, and not 491 dollars. That's a 98 dollar difference, and she might have kept it for herself. About 3-4 days after she withdrew ""491 dollars"", she suddenly wanted to go to her casino which she hasn't done in quite a long time prior to this.  At this point, I already begin to doubt her credibility, and her as a family member.  


On January 29, 2020, she tells me she withdrew 589 dollars from the joint account that we have. Again, I couldn't accompany her due to school hours. The day after, I tried to look for the account's passbook, and she hid it in another place. It took me about 4 days to figure out where she hid it, and I discovered she actually withdrew 1160 dollars. Take note that within the four days of me trying to figure out where she hid the passbook, I asked her a couple of times she kept saying ""589 dollars"", there was even one time where she said ""About 491 dollars"". That's a 668 dollar difference, and I'm just wondering where that went. At that point, I was convinced that this is not a mistake made by memory loss - she is conscious on what she is doing.  


On February 10, 2020, she withdrew 437 dollars, and she told me the real amount this time, which I found very odd. Anyway, after her very first case of stealing from me, I started to change my treatment towards her. I no longer make irrelevant comments, no longer tell her stories of what, but I still do the chores so she can't say anything. It even kind of ""worsened"" or get even more when I found out about the January 29 thing. She has noticed this, and wonders what happened to me, and why I changed so abruptly.  


\*It's also relevant to know that she never initiated to show me the passbook herself after she withdrew, which I think she should've done since that's technically my money (My dad's money, actually). I also never asked her to show me the passbook after the withdrawals, because I knew an argument will arise, which I am not ready for.  


I know you guys can only do so much, but I'd still like to hear someone's insight on my situation. I must say that there is a lot more things happening in this house right now that are very crazy in different levels, but somehow they are all related.

A few months ago before all of this COVID-19 stuff started I got a new job at Lowe’s making more money than I ever would have thought to be making at my age(18), I’m also male, but I work 40+ hours and still haven’t graduated high school and plan on going to college, I’m saving for a downpayment on a rental property to get some extra income. My day to day “routine/things I do” is I wake up an hour before work and get ready and head to work. Once I get off work it’s probably around 10-11pm and I stay up till 4-5am playing video games and watching YouTube, that feels like it goes by in an hour. It’s all I have to do, I feel like I should be doing something more but work takes up all of my time in my day to do anything. What could I do that is productive with my life in the middle of the night. I don’t have enough self discipline to wake up earlier but I could try that. I just feel stuck all the time. I feel like I need to keep moving forward, gaining something, learning something, but all I got to do is save money, sleep, eat, play games. All I can think about is that I’m going to spend the rest of my life in a loop of not having anywhere near as much time in my day as I want. I also have a loving and happy relationship of 2 and half years(I’m not to worried about that part of my life though), I feel like the responses I’m going to get if I get any is going to be something of the sorts of “just tough through it man” or “that’s just how life is” but it can’t be this fucking boring.

397,"Hi reddit. We have a friend, male in his early-mid 30s who has been an active member in our friend group (8 of us altogether) for some time. Before the lockdown, we’d all see each other once a week or fortnight and we would also all regularly chat in our Facebook group chat.

During the pandemic, he lost his job but he told us that he ended up getting work with a previous employer so as far as we know, he’s still under employment, we just don’t know where. We assume he would be working from home as a software developer.

We noticed that lately he hadn’t been posting in our group chat, and the last time messenger says he “saw” our messages was on April 9th. We also have a Facebook group that he’s active in that we’re all members of, and the last time we could see a comment from him was also on the 9th.

One of us messaged him privately a few days ago and he hadn’t replied. She called him as well but the phone will ring until it reaches voicemail. Another of us rang him yesterday and got the same result. I also tried ringing him today with the same result. Sent him a text message with no reply. I can’t tell if he’s seen it.

It’s hard to go to his place right now because 1) we have a semi-lockdown in our city and 2) he lives in an apartment, we know the address but not which unit number he’s in.

We’re not sure what to do. He could be just busy with work and avoiding social media, or maybe he’s ghosting us for some reason that we don’t know of (he hasn’t blocked us or anything we can still see his profile).

A lot of the conversations I've over text were usually pretty short-lived and lackluster and its kinda been bothering me for a while. 

I think the main problem is that I'm not really that close to anyone? I don't even know anymore, I just kinda feel like someone who's there, y'know? I guess because of that I don't really feel motivation to actively build or keep up any of my friendships and I kinda feel bad.

406,"Background info: My sibling (19m, we’ll call him A) and I (21f) have been living alone for almost five years now. Rent has been difficult, but I’m in a place now where I can cover rent comfortably.

My sibling had some money coming in from the government as a sort of allowance, going up to $1300 a month. Just to be clear, I’m a retail worker and I make a little over $1000 pm, provided I work some extra hours. Our monthly rent is $1000, ideally to be split between the both of us.

For a few months after I got my job, A had his allowance coming in. However, he always seemed to run out of money before rent was due and I’d have to cover it for him. This went on  for four months until he turned 19 and was no longer entitled to his money. Naturally, I and the rest of our family encouraged him to get a part-time job so I didn’t have to cover him anymore. A is a high-school student, so the most he can get is a part-time job. My own job is part-time, though, so he would at least be able to provide for himself.

Still, I gave him the benefit of the doubt and continued paying his rent.

Fast forward to the current situation. We’re in lockdown, and I’m considered an essential worker, so I’m going into work and exposing myself to hundreds of people who could possibly be incubators everyday. As for him, school is cancelled and he has all the time in the world to do what he wants.

He chooses to go travelling. He’s in a long-distance relationship, and because his partner is alone, A decided he’d take it upon himself to go to his partner’s country until the lockdown was over.

Well, lockdown’s been extended for three weeks. Apparently, he has intentions to stay there until the lockdown is over, even though at this point, it’s unclear exactly how long it’ll last. That means I’m paying €500 for what amounts to a storage unit at the time of writing.

I’ve texted him asking when he’s coming back. First, he cited an article disallowing evictions during the crisis, and he also said he wasn’t sure we should be paying rent in the first place. (I shot that down and cited the article he had literally just sent me. We still have to pay rent, A, we just can’t be charged more.) Second, he said the only places looking to hire are essential businesses - which I don’t personally see the problem with, seeing as I’m essential, too. Shot that down as well. Finally, he said he’d come back and look for a job - and then he didn’t respond to any of my messages after that. It’s been a week.

That pissed me off. I told him that if he wasn’t going to reply, I’d assume he was staying there and I’d move to a place that’s actually worth my money. As for his stuff, I was considering leaving it with a relative who doesn’t know the whole truth about what’s going on, so she’d find out and he’d have to confront her to get his stuff. I told him I was tired of covering for him without receiving a word of thanks or even a semblance of financial help.

Lucky for him, though, the places that I was looking at got taken up pretty quickly. I guess that’s to be expected for cheap rent around here. I texted him and told him that, and I also told him exactly how much I’d covered for him and how that amount could have covered my uni fees, which I’m now going to have to rely on the government for if I do end up going this year.

He’s seen my messages. Still no response.

I’m so tired... Lately, all I want to do is sleep. I give, and I give, and I give, and I get nothing in return for it. I didn’t ask to become a parent. I didn’t volunteer to take care of this person who is perfectly capable of providing for himself.

Our parents aren’t around so we only have each other. He says that a lot, as well. Still, he hasn’t spoken to me since I said I would speak to our landlord about moving out. I don’t think he realises exactly how much I’ve sacrificed for him, even though I’ve said it to him countless times. I set aside my college fund so he could study for his final exams in peace. I’m putting my health on the line for him. I’m putting my life on the line for him.

I need advice, Reddit. Please. I don’t know what else I can do. I’m at the end of my rope. I feel absolutely drained, and taken advantage of, and just... Tired. If I can’t find a solution soon, I’m scared I’ll drop into a really dark place eventually and that I’ll do whatever I can to get out of it.

Please. I need help.

408,"I didn't know whether this would be considered under r/relationship_advice, but here we go.

For the past few days, I had been reflecting on myself. Me and my best friend, of 4 years, had went through an exchange, that concluded with me and her not contacting each other for a while; and I distanced myself from her and our friend-group, disregarding the texts they would send until they eventually stopped coming, and on her private Snapchat story—I would watch with envy since she would post about doing fun things with our friend-group, like playing Minecraft or facetiming at late times. I despised the fact that they didn't include me with their activities, but I what despised more was I hated hating on them—which undoubtedly just made me hate myself. I told myself that, inevitably, this was the outcome if you stopped communicating with them and that the effort is futile if I confronted my feelings and had been upfront. I'm a coward, aren't I?

After our conversation, before I stopped talking to her, I told her an apology about how I was such a horrible friend and that I was going to change before she would relocate to Cali. In response, she said that she appreciated the apology but stated that I never changed; and that was the end of our conversation. This was when I had the revelation that I've made that exact same apology, numerous times beforehand—typically after a heated quarrel between me and her to diffuse the tension. I had been constantly promising that I would become an improved person. But like she said, I stayed the same and never fulfilled the promise. It was finally transparent that I kept on apologizing, just to make myself feel better and that the feeling of being guilty would dissipate. I kept assuring myself that I was going to transfigure into this revamped individual after I would tell her the repetitive apology, when in reality after looking back on how I treated her just these past months during our freshman year of High-School, I had stayed the same. Mind you, I did attempt to change so I could stop hurting her and others, but yet I didn't. I was still the pathetic, two-faced scum that would nitpick her trivial mistakes and would repeatedly appeal to a person, just to then proceed with berating them, behind their back. I was still that hypocritical b\*tch that would degrade her and call her insulting names because I allowed my riled emotions to take control over my hasty mouth; and lie about things that I could have just been straightforward about. I consistently put up a facade to conceal my genuine feelings that I regret my treatment towards her and I never wanted this to turn out this way, yet here I am, still treating her like sh\*t. I was unfortunately aware on what I was doing against her, and maybe other people, but I just kept reminding myself that I could just apologize, mention that I would change and everything would be rectified—overlooking the repercussions it had on the relationship and how wounding the impact of my words was. I even had the audacity to blame her and complain to my other friends about how she was being such an unpleasant and toxic person, if she ever retaliated and did what I did to her in return... blinded by the fact that it was evident that I was really the one to blame and initiated this strain in our relationship.

I want to put a stop to this constant cycle and *actually* change my image and perspective of myself this time, but I am terrified at the fact that I will just revert into my old ways and continue to leave immeasurable and irreparable scars to our friendship, that I cherish more than anything in this world, and relationships with other individuals I treasure. As sappy as it is, I want to meet up with her after this entire pandemic and quarantine concludes, hug her tightly and display that this time, I have transformed into the authentic and sincere friend that she deserves before she departs—but I feel that I have abused the capability of apologizing and have been constantly deceiving and ""artificial"", that I don't even see the possibility of the scenario occurring. Plus, I continuously have these lingering thoughts that changing would be a vain attempt and texting her now would be a hindrance, since she's more content with her new friends, who are undoubtedly preferable than me. I just need some advice, even guidance, on what should I do.",18Apr2020,1

416,"Bf and were together for 5 yrs then broke up in January.  Long story short, my ex bf's dad was a hoarder. He died of stage 4 cancer a year ago. It was a very difficult time for my ex bf especially with  his toxic narcissistic mother. In any case, because of the tremendous pain his father was experiencing in his final months, there is a shit ton of oxycodone and hydrocodone stashed throughout his house, which my ex now lives in alone as his mother kicked him out (she was very toxic and manipulative). I am worried about my ex  because his life is so chaotic recently and he has just been drinking and getting high with weed and some of the dad's leftover painkillers the last I saw him (especially in quarantine). We are not on speaking terms currently. However, I have a large amount of painkillers in my possession that I found after packing my things when I left. I do not want these in my possession because I do not want to get involved with opiates or have that access so easily at my disposal in such a large amount. My dad is a recovered addict and I myself have substance abuse tendencies which I do not want to escalate in any way as it affected my father so terribly. 

&amp;#x200B;

But I don't want to give them to my ex boyfriend because his substance use is even more severe and I don't want to encourage it by giving him even more of an excessive amount of painkillers to pick from. This was partly why I did not want to be with him anymore. He knows I have them as I mentioned it off-handedly once implying I had to return them. He said he wanted them back that one time. The problem is, I don't want these in his possession but I don't want them in mine either. Am I being too controlling? I could give them back to him and clear my hands of it but I don't want to encourage this in his life. I care about him. 

If I throw them out and he demands it back I feel like that seems entitled since it is not mine to begin with. I don't know what to do with them. I am only asking for advice with regard to what I should do with all these painkillers. Thank you.",18Apr2020,1

A strange man in a mask standing outside of my door, a women with black eyes and an elongated body, and demonic figures watching me just out of my view haunt my mind. 
I sleep with the lights on, always. I get an overwhelming feeling that there is something evil lurking in the room, and that by allowing my room to fill with darkness I feel as though I've now somehow given it more power. I hide under my blanket like a child, even when I am overheating and feel as though I can't breath.
I have to hide dolls and stuffed animals. Anything with eyes that isn't alive scares me. 
I am afraid of loud noises, like thunder. I am afraid to pray to my own God, as I fear that my prayers will be heard by the wrong entity and I dont want to envite anything nasty into my life.
I don't even know what im actually afraid will happen. I dont really beleive in these creatures. I guess on some deep down level I must, for them to scare me so badly. Thinking logically about how unlikely it is that a stuffed animal is possessed or that there's someone outside of my window right now does not help to comfort me in any way. I dont hear voices, but scary thoughts pop into my head, like ""theres something evil in the room"". And that thought will just keep popping up. But If I imagine a demonic figure hiding out near my bed, what would it actually do to me that is so scary? What am I so afraid of? 
I also get frequent nightmares that are mostly just people being where they aren't supposed to be, such as a man walking past my bedside, a demon who is just iut if sight trying to get me to agree to let him live in my brain, or dolls moving or making faces at me are common. They tend to take place wherever I fell asleep and tend to be mostly very realistic in that my room is usually very real looking and everything will follow a coherent plot, where as regular dreams for me tend to jump from one environment to the next and tend to be very random and cartoonie.

Some background - 
I’m 18F and live at home with my parents, my brother and my dog. My parents never got along and only got married because I was conceived by accident. Whenever they are in each other’s presence, they constantly fight and argue, which causes me significant mental stress. It’s important to note that my dad is an absolutely horrendous person. 

When I was a child, he used to physically abuse me severely and frequently, sometimes smashing my head into plates of food and once even almost blinding me with a corner of a pizza when he shoved it into my eye. Needless to say, this abuse has given me great mental torment and anguish. He also abuses my mom emotionally, and usually comes to me to tell me she is worthless and things of the sort. Not a day goes by without a fighting match in this house. He also hates animals, even going as far to abuse and hit my dog sometimes when nobody is present and he is alone with her and telling me he wants to shoot her for the fun of it. He is just an all around horrible person, and everybody feels stressed and uneasy in his presence. 

Before the COVID issue I used to go to work and visit my friends and my boyfriend so I never spent significant amount of times in the same house as him, however now I am stuck at home and he is an essential worker but he comes home at around 5pm and until he goes to sleep it is mental agony for me. 

It’s not easy for me to move out either because I am in Europe and it’s rare for people to move out before they’re married or 30. If I move out, I can forget attending to uni or going to any college in the future and would basically have to work retail and only being able to afford a studio apartment as rent is vey high. 

Lately I’ve been having very violent and graphic thoughts about what I want to do to my dad like fantasizing about sticking a knife in his heart while he’s asleep and the like.

I’m also having very prominent thoughts about suicide.

435,"Hi, first of all, context.
We live in a lockdown area, where we have very few options when it comes to going on walks, but we have two quiet large dogs.
My brother in law (we’ll call him F ) handles the dogs very well and is the one who usually walks them on his own. He is a super sweet guy, but he is an overweight heavy lifter, so you don’t really want to mess with him. 
Even though he is super strong, super good at sports and practices all the time, he has been struggling I lose weight for many years without success.
So yesterday F went to walk the dogs and crossed paths with an old lady who got rude about him having the dogs off leash (he was keeping them at his legs so legal, safe and respectful). He didn’t care to answer at the time and went his way.

Now F went for a walk again this morning, and saw the same lady ! He called at the dogs to come by his side under his umbrella, and kept them there all the time the lady approched, crossed them spewing her venom and went away.
AND THEN when he was loading the dogs in the car to leave, she came back out of nowhere to insult him. She called him horrible names, said he was a fat pig ready to explode, that he was ugly and disgusting, that he should be working (yeah we’re all trying to work but lockdown). 
F’s only reply was that between someone walking dogs and someone over 70 outside in this time, she was the one in the wrong.
He came back home really upset and I don’t know how to confort him right now.
But I’m plotting revenge, and that’s where I need your advice.

I’m planning on going with him tomorrow, and if we indeed see the same lady again, what shall we do ?
-shriek in a high pitch every time she opens her mouth until she’s out of the way
-(pretend to) call the police if she starts again to tell them there’s a confused old lady wandering in a dangerous area, it’s near a high way and other people could be less forgiving than us
-get in her face and breathe really hard.

I’d like to precise that I’m not really wanting to « punish » her but rather protect ourselves while getting her out of the way, and possibly give her a hint that making that is not ok and might be dangerous for her.
I wish there was a way to discuss with crazy people but I guess peace for never an option.

In short : old lady insults my BIL and I’m thirsty for revenge",18Apr2020,1
436,"Hello all. Kind of a big one here.

I am a 27 year old who has hit a little bit of a rough spot when it comes to working.

First off, I am currently working as an RF Drive Test Engineer through a contractor that works ATT towers.

My job currently consists of driving around at night collecting data from Att towers. By this, I have a laptop, 6 phones, and a scanner. In short, I collect cell data to make sure sites are operating right by performing a drive route given to me and my phones place phone calls to themselves and download and upload things.
I have been doing this job for around 5 years now.

That said, there hasn't really been any work since before Christmas. When work was supposed to be picking up, Covid 19 struck and every ATT project that was gonna happen, got put on the back burner in the area I work.

I've been really stressing about money as I think from the span of December 23rd to now, I think I've maybe made about 3 grand. Now when work is going good, I could make upwards of 2100 bucks a week (1099 position). With the coronavirus leaving everything unsure, I don't know when work will become normal again. Right now, it seems like it could be June but again, nobody knows for sure.

My other job option is working as a utility locator. My brother and best friend currently work as one and they both love their job. The job is always hiring and they can guarantee me to be hired almost right away. Now both jobs have what I love to do and that is to drive around. The only huge downside is that when one could pay me 2100 a week, the other, with hard work, I think I'll basically pull in maybe around 800 to start.

The pros of my current job is that it's something I'm very good at, pay is good, it's for the most part independent, I get to drive around and jam to music, and I get to pick whichever days I want to work.

The cons of my current job, obviously right now, no stable work is happening, I have to use my own vehicle which of course wears and tears it, I don't even find out work till the day of in which I could have to drive 5 minutes away or 6 hours away, and management for the most part, don't really value you too much when there is communication with them.

My coworker thinks we should keep holding out for this job which my brother, friend, and girlfriend all think I should go to the utility locating.

My biggest concern is that I'm not gonna be good at it and the pay is the lowest I've had made in over 3 years. My concern with my current work is at this point, who even knows when it's gonna start back up?

I guess I'm just looking for some advice at which one I should go for. I just am not somebody who likes to not be working and I'm also not a fan of job jumping as I like to just stick with things for however long I can.",18Apr2020,1

438,"I am an international student in Canada and I live in a student female residence. I had gone home for the summer so before getting back I needed to find a place to stay. So I started looking up for places on kijiji and found this place, the price was good and well in my budget. I decided to contact the landlady. She sent me some pictures and I was quite happy about it. She asked for the security deposit and I gave it, so my room was secure. When I got to the place, the room was nothing like the pictures but I had no other place to go so I decided to stay and it was close to the university so I mostly just came home to sleep. The washrooms in this place are communal and there are several ladies living here who are not students. Some of them are really unhygienic. Now because of the coronavirus, we are stuck in the house and I decided to move out. Several people who moved out before me told me that she doesn’t return the security deposit. When I read the google reviews of the place, about 10 people had posted the same thing that she tricks international students because they don’t know the laws well. I don’t work, so I am on a tight budget. And I can’t just let that go. The room is in exactly as the way I got it. There is no damage to anything. So I am moving out in about 10 days and I need advice so that she cannot trick me into anything. I have given her a month notice. Can you please tell me what steps I should take so that I am not in the wrong in any way and what should I avoid doing so that she cannot use it later against me.",18Apr2020,1

440,"Asking for a friend.

I had a Reddit alt that I used to post about all this cringe asking how to get this girl I was chatting to like me etc. 

It also had loads of personal mental health stuff which I had a massive prolonged panic attack about from september to January involving posts across multiple subs essentially asking to diagnose me with horrible disorders. I don’t know why that phase happened, I’m in the midst of puberty and I think I was just really stressed and it makes me hurt internally looking at all the dumb stuff I posted so hopefully I’ve matured a bit.

Anyway, my friends use Reddit and I got really paranoid at the end of December that they found the account because someone literally used the word ‘empathy’ once and deleted all the posts and comments because I thought they found it. It was only after I realized my account name would super obvious to get if you knew me and I littered loads of personal interests on the posts that I had a panicked and removed it all.

I still have no proof of them finding it, nor have I asked any of them about this. 

Although our group is a bit cold I’d like to think some of the ones with more compassion would say something:P

I’ve calmed down a lot since then and am actually the most unusually confident I have been ever which is odd, but this is still a niggle in the back of my mind.

So basically my question is; if you found a friends account with this sortve stuff on would you ignore it to let them figure it out themself or confront them?",18Apr2020,1

442,"Hello, 

I would like to preface this with i am 20F and i have never had a pet before. I have been looking forward to adopting a cat but was waiting for the right apartment. Everything fell into place last month and i adopted a very sweet cat. 

I was very excited to having a pet and the main thing i wanted was emotional support/ a furry friend for cuddles. Too bad the cat i got hates them :( i have been spending the last month trying to bond with her and see if i could get her to come out of her shell. But nothing seems to work. She spent a week hiding under my bed to the point i had to block off access with boxes. I have given her a large closet but she by wants to hide under the couch or bed out of sight. 

I am really unhappy honestly. Now i question if it’s the cat or if i was expecting to much from her. I feel awful for saying this but i want a new cat. My anxiety has been through the roof trying to comfort her but my last straw was today when i had a terrible breakdown and she just kept hissing :/ 

Would i be the worlds shittiest person if i took her back to the shelter and tried to get a new cat? Should i keep trying with this one? Should i just not have a cat???? I’m so stressed i don’t want to be a bad pet owner :/",18Apr2020,1
443,"So i’ve been doing factory work for a health supplement company for 16 months, and i was hoping you guys could help me decide whether to leave or not, because i’m showing signs of depression.

Pros: contracted 40 hours, usually same start and finish times, get weekends off, paid 1 hour lunch every day. I use the products we produce and get 50% discount. It is a rapidly growing business and has plans to expand soon. It is an ethical company that plants trees for every purchase. I have received 2 pay rises since working there. 

Cons: the people i work with. I’m very much someone who gets on with my work, gives it 100% and goes home happy. But i dislike most of my colleagues - my manager is never present yet he makes irrational decisions, such as promoting someone to my Team Leader when he has just been working there for 3 months (i had worked there for a year at the time), which i believe is because of his age, because this guys work ethic is poor, this Team leader later turned out to be a bully who blames me for HIS mistakes in front of my manager, always turns up 10mins late back from lunch yet blames others if they are 2 mins late and bullies the other team leader on my shift even more (it got physical). He is also a major kiss ass to my manager even coming in on his day off to take him out to lunch.

My manager has also called me a ‘fucking retard’ and saying that ‘i don’t give a shit’ yet denies ever saying it. He knows for a fact i’m one of the hardest workers there (based on the numbers i can hit), and i rarely make any mistakes. 

Finally the job is very repetitive and i feel like a robot. Sometimes can be relaxing other times i feel like im wasting my time.

I could go on and on about people at my job, to put it simply there’s 1 person i get along with. It is difficult because there’s a lot of benefits to working there, and i would enjoy it as a whole if it weren’t for the people. I keep trying new techniques to block said people from my mind and telling myself that i need to adapt to difficult people in life. But it is so tiring.

448,"Had something really creepy happen to my girlfriend yesterday, looking for advice.

First thing in the morning, she got a text from a strange number saying something like “saw your pic, had to say hi. I love your hair.” She asked who they were and they said “we don’t know each other.” So far just some random weirdo right?

But then the part that really concerns me: they sent her a photo of herself that was never posted online, and only exists in her camera roll. Nothing compromising, just a photo we took a year or two back at a cool store. Still very disconcerting. She asked how they got her number and they said “I know about hacks and tricks.” That’s when she told me about it and I recommended she stop responding.

My girlfriend has generalized anxiety disorder and one of her biggest fears revolves around stalkers, so she has been very freaked out. Didn’t sleep much last night.

She is an iPhone user, and 2FA is turned on for iCloud so I’m not sure how that could’ve been compromised. Of course she’s gone through and changed all passwords as well. We’ve also filed a police report.

Is this something anyone has experience with? Any insight or advice would be greatly appreciated.",18Apr2020,1
449,"My partner lied to me and I’m trying to get over it

Monday morning me and my partner got into a very stupid argument to which he has admitted to being wrong about. After said argument (prior to apologizing for argument) we had coffee and he spitefully ignored me on his phone. Chatting with an old penpal he used to be sexual with that I have never questioned. I was just upset that I was being ignored. I expressed after all of this that it made me feel lonely and I was feeling a little home sick (I’m staying with him and his family during this quarantine) and he took it personal because of our morning and got upset with me more so we took space for the day, I hung around the house and sat outside and journaled and cried a little mostly. It’s just been a hard month for everyone and I expressed to him that although he upset me In The morning, I was just overwhelmed about everything and feeling homesick and missing my family. I just needed him to be there as a friend in that moment and he made it about him and making me feel bad for getting upset in the morning. (It was an argument about me cancelling our plans to do yoga cause we stayed up late and woke up late and he made remarks like “so you’re just not gonna work out” and then spitefully made it hard to plan the rest of our day because he was being bitter. He has admitted he shouldn’t have gotten made or reacted the way he did) 

fast forward to the point of this.. he spent all Monday and Tuesday continuing to be cold to me because I was upset. At some point early Tuesday we started talking about him ignoring me while he chatted with his pen pal and I was telli nug him how it upset me cause we had planned to only hang for coffee that day and he spent it on his phone and he blew up about how he wasn’t talking to her and it wasn’t a big deal that he was on his phone. I continued to say i didn’t care who it was but that I came second to his phone.  I told him I was homesick and just a little sad. I told him I was upset at how he treated me but that I was more just overwhelmed with feeling homesick. He continued to be distant to me and additionally starting acting weird about his phone all day Tuesday which made me feel weird about who he was taking to since I knew he lied about it being the pen pal but didn’t know why. It started to on top of feeling homesick, I started to feel weird about the possibility of him confiding an old sexual partner who I don’t know and have never questioned until he lied about it being her. All said and done he has apologized for everything. Acknowledged how I felt and really has made an effort to make right. But I can’t unfeel what I feel about him playing victim to a ex-sext buddy in another country while I was right here asking for him to be a friend to me. He told her he didn’t know why I was upset and that’s it’s annoying. She consoled him. Said that girls get strange over strange thing sometimes but not her. She expressed how this isn’t the first time he’s said this about me. This is all what he showed me after I expressed feeling insecure about something I never questioned. 


I guess my question is how do I let it go? How would you feel if your partner was playing victim to someone they used to virtually fuck? And the. Lied to you about it. He came clean when I bluntly said I didn’t believe him because of how he was acting on his phone. 

I’ve never in my life been cheated on that I know of. Have never been insecure about other women and have even encouraged being open with other women sexually since were both into it. But him lying about something I didn’t need him to lie about makes me feel so unsettled. I probably left details out. Maybe I am just a whiny fucking baby so please if someone simply thinks I should stfu and move on that kinda Input is helpful too.

451,"So in order for people to understand my situation I need to explain the whole story but I will keep it as basic as I can so bare with me. And thank you in advance 

So 3 years ago I met someone I’m going to call Larry. We are in and out of contact. Last year I struggled with my self esteem and other issues so Larry and I slept together 3 times. I kept this a secret from people due to his criminal record that my family and friends know about. If they knew I had slept with him they will think very low of me (and that’s an understatement) 

The last time I slept with him was a couple of days before my BF and I got together (we were planning on getting together for a while) 
So Larry showed his dark side. He started telling me I should cheat on my BF or leave him so I could continue to sleep with Larry a long with other horrible things. I became upset and was in shock so deleted all messages Larry had sent me and blocked him on my social media. 
My BF asked me if I had slept with Larry and I panicked and said no.
Larry has been texting me even though I have told him I wasn’t interested and ignoring him. And I’m still deleting his messages because I’m worried about people seeing the messages

So basically I’m really worried that he will leak our messages and send them to my family, friends and my BF on social media. When we were still friends I found out he tried to convince an acquaintance, he got turned down and reacted badly to it. When I asked him about it he went to the acquaintance and went ape shit and told this person I was the one who this person spoke to about it. So I feel like he is capable of sharing the messages

I am a Senior of Biology slowly selling off stuff—sanitized, of course— and my college home lease ends at the end of May. I live with a Senior of Environmental Science so there will be someone to help me.

454,"Hello, let's get into the story.

So, I'm a college student, living in an Asian country. My country also has the tradition of the Chinese New Year money. Since I'm turning 22, I don't want the money that I didn't work for, so I told my family that I'll donate the money. I've raised almost $500, and I want to give this money to saving wild animals or marine lives. 

Initially I want to donate to an organisation in my country, but now I change my mind. The reason is because the organisation is kind of an extension of the governmental department. (Sorry if this doesn't make sense, English is not my first language.) And obviously there are a lot of scandals and corruptions happening in my government. The organisation is well known in my country, but every time something relevant happens (like if they need to save a marine animal or if a wild fire is going on, for example), pictures of the officers always come up on the internet, showing that they are working in a very bad condition, lacking sufficient food, water, and supplies. Moreover, they don't even get minimum wage. The organisation clearly states on its website that the money will go to the officer if they are injured, or to their family if they die. I think that's also necessary, but that money shouldn't come from donation. In my opinion, they should receive sufficient facilities and be provided with insurance, issued by the government, paid by my tax??? I think like this. I don't know if it's right or wrong... 

All in all, I think this is not transparent, and therefore, I think I'm not ready to donate to this organisation. 

The question is, which organisation should I then be donating to? Should I donate to WWF? What kind of impression or experience are you having with WWF?",18Apr2020,1

459,"I (29F) live with a housemate who’s also the owner of the house  (38F) and her daughter (9F).
My housemate is a nice woman, we get along really well and I know she cares about her daughter a lot but... anytime she’s in a bad mood she SCREAMS at the poor child like crazy. 

She goes absolutely insane, screams on top of the lungs, this kind of throaty scream that makes even me shiver. For silliest of things, sometimes (very often lately with all of us being at home) she just snaps and can turn from a loving happy mom into a screaming beast in seconds if her daughter does something slightly wrong. 

This happens on average 2 or 3 times a day now and I probably see it now because I’m home all the time. She doesn’t care I’m there. If I’m around I try to give her looks as in “woman, you ok?” And I know she sees it sometimes but she does the same thing again later. She never screams at me  (I dare her to try, it won’t go well) and I usually comfort the girl after when we are alone but as someone who was shouted at my whole childhood I feel for the girl. 

She never insults the daughter, it’s more of a “what did I ask you to do?” or “what have you done?” “Do xyz, how many times did I ask you to do it?” Etc. I know this girl can be stubborn and difficult sometimes and I have no children of my own so maybe it’s easy for me to say but I think the housemate is loosing her shit for no reason. 

I don’t see any point in calling anywhere because a) nothing is going to change because after all she’s just screaming b) it would be obvious it was me that reported her and I have absolutely nowhere to go.

But if I approached her about it in a way “hey, I get that you loose your cool sometimes and things can be frustrating but hearing you act like this makes me uncomfortable” would that be ok? Honestly, I’m a little afraid to speak up because she can kick me out anytime, as a tenant living with the landlord I have very little rights. 

To be fair, I’ve been on calls before where my boyfriend or friends could hear her scream and I was so embarrassed, we laughed it off and said that she’s gone crazy again but it’s not a laughing matter. Also, I wouldn’t like to get the girl mixed into it because I’m sure me accusing housemate of abuse would stir a lot of shit. 

I’m sitting in my room and have no will of leaving it because I heard her go again at her daughter for not coming downstairs quick enough when she called her...

462,"Went to the obgyn for the first prenatal visit. I had already tested positive with a home pregnancy test. 
They confirmed the results at the office and also proceeded with blood tests. This is my 2nd pregnancy

My issue:
1) There was no physical exam done (no pelvic exam, no Pap smear, nothing)
2) Only one question about my 1st pregnancy and delivery
3) was told to continue my prenatal vitamins but once my current ones are done, they wanted me to continue with the ones they recommend. They didn’t even ask which one I’m using now and if I have any issues. I looked at their prenatal vitamins and they are full of synthetic ingredients and artificial colors. My prenatal are a whole food quality vitamin with no artificial crap.
4) this is supposed to be one of the best obgyns in the area (great reviews, many awards, etc). So why do I feel so disappointed?
5). The doctor was nice and seemed kind but I felt she really didn’t do much considering this was the very first visit.

Fast forward a month or two, my sister had been living with myself and my parents for the past year or so, and had demonstrated the attitude and selfishness of a badly behaved elementary school student, hurting my parents as well as myself to extreme emotional levels (me and all my siblings were homeschooled for a large part of our lives, extremely close as a result). We continued to love and support her in positive things and tried to help her. Throughout this time she started seeing a man again that both she herself admitted to disliking, and admitted he really was quite a horrible person. After a long period of hope that she would recover, and pain seeing her dive down, she made her decision to leave our entire family permanently and run away with him, never to talk to us again.

Before my sister I had been able to grieve, to process the pain I felt from my first love, but after she left and I first heard of it, I broke down in a way I never have before. After (regrettably) losing my mind and wailing in pain heh, I haven’t been able to feel much of anything. My body feels like it is rejecting all positive emotion and I get outbursts where the pain leaks and I panic and can’t control my breathing. Other times I sit and struggle to think of anything but disappearing forever. I have tried on a few occasions to put myself into a coma, and failed, clearly. But I don’t know how to go on like this. Even my thoughts and judgement on matters is extremely impaired, I’ve struggled to comprehend complex emotions and scenarios, and I lack much of the will to do many things I used to be so driven to do.

I don’t even understand what to ask for at this point anymore. I know I should look to the light and know it’s not forever, but every day it’s getting harder to find that light. If you guys have any advice, please help me.",18Apr2020,1
465,"# Ignore the title and please help me with the following instead (I have Aspergers, so struggle with interpretation)

How much would you care about someone to arrange to meet with them (travelling 40 minutes on the subway to get there) and spend six hours with them - firstly having lunch with them and then visiting a museum with them?

Do you think that the person who did this and met with me is a friend?

I have Aspergers, so struggle to interpret things socially, and often struggle to make close friends. I often feel that many people 'hate me' (due to bullying that I faced at school) and that 'I have no friends'.

Indeed, when I was feeling a bit down and previously said 'I have no friends to talk to anymore' to this person, they replied to me:

‘Kate you can always talk to me :) and I don’t know of anyone who hates you you’re such a lovely person. I think you just need to gain perspective on the situation you feel you’re in. Are you at home at the moment? Might be best to get some sleep and think about it tomorrow’

We had a fall out kinda in October, but got worse in November-March (still drama happening still). She betrayed me, her ""group"" harass/stalk me. They even sent me a death threat message and ik she knew and even that didn't stop her from seeing so much red flags from those bad negative people. Me as her ""best friend"" she didn't believe me that I had a feeling (someone confirmed it too) of our ""friend"" was talking bad about me and she said ""she's not like that"".

(She don't even know the group for 2 years either) we are both seniors, the stuff she's pulling is childish/freshman year. She likes kpop and I hated it, I'm a metalhead, I hate them bc they were bullying me so and I hate mainstream things. She knew I didn't really care about them and I really don't mind her talking about them, I actually listen and try to understand them bc ik she loves them. So I started searching for my own people and found a girl who is just like me. We connected so fast, she's my new best friend, taking it slow and we are like twins, metalhead and everything. I already had a bad feeling of my former best friend but I denied it, I didn't want to believe it. Turns out it was true with whatever bad feeling I had about her.

468,"I'll try to keep this short, I need advice on this situation that makes me super anxious. English isn't my first language, I apologise for my mediocre writing skills. 

I'm 24, and I've been working for 2.5 years as a project manager at a digital agency in Switzerland. I work part time (60%) while I'm also doing a bachelor degree in Economics and I've completed 3 years out 4. 

Up until September 2019 everything was going great at work. Shit hit the fan when I accepted to manage too many projects at the same time and I couldn't handle all the extra work. A couple projects went over budget and we missed deadlines. Mainly because of one particular project for a very demanding client who mandated us to develop a kind of software that we had never done before. My boss had an agreement with this client and the budget was split 50/50 (we took 50% of the development costs) because the software had the potential to be sold to many other companies and our client was supposed to get us in touch with potential customers.

For context, at this time we were all kind of overworked and the planning was extremely full, making it really hard to find time for unexpected work for the developers. Without going too much into details, the project went way over budget but we delivered the software in time for the main deadline (1st of January). However, the following couple months were extremely stressful because the software had numerous bugs and the client was extremely demanding and went back and forth many time on his decisions, causing us a lot of extra work and frustration. Because I'm the manager of this project, I took it very personally and thought that all these problems were mainly the result of my bad organisation. At the same time, I also had to go to class and study for my exams that took place in February. In order to study for my exams, I took 3 weeks off at the end of January and start of February. This was one of the worst period of my life. Even though I was officially off from work, I had to keep working remotely in order to manage the project while also studying for my exams. The stakes were high because I'm going away in September for an exchange year in Canada and failing juste one exam would have meant that I couldn't go. This exchange year has been my dream since I started my bachelor studies, 3 years ago.

OK this is starting to get a little bit long I' ll try to summarize what happened next.

We ended up finishing this fucking project and the client is finally happy but we went waaay over budget (3x). Because of the quarantine, I didn't get the chance to go meet all these potential customers that our client was supposed to introduce us to. 
I passed all my exams with great grades (yay) and as a result, I'm leaving for Canada in September 2020. I gave my resignation a few weeks ago and I'll leave my company on June 1st. 

Here comes the fuck up. 

As I've said previously, I felt very responsible for this shitshow of a project and I stopped timesheeting my work, in order to minimize the impact on the budget and to try and contain it. In other words, I worked for free.
Because I'm leaving in a few weeks I had a videocall with my HR yesterday and he looked at my timesheet reports since the start of the year. He noticed that overall I had 80 hours of work that weren't accounted for (empty timesheet). When you work at 60%, that amounts to almost 4 weeks of work.

He told me that this is a very serious issue and he needs to have a word with my boss and they'll get back to me Monday.

I need to point out that despite going 3 times over budget, we wouldn't get any extra money from our client because the budget was predefined and agreed on.

Now the issue is that II have no proof that I did indeed work these 80 hours but simply never timesheeted them. To the eyes of my boss this looks like I haven't worked for 80 hours despite getting paid for it. In the end, they will choose to believe me or not.

I don't know what to do, how to prepare myself for the meeting taking place on Monday. I feel like because of a few bad decisions, I fucked up 2.5 years of excellent relations with my company.

Any advice is welcome, I hope my text makes sense.

My parents are very strict ""family first"" Hispanics, and I've had enough of them trying to tell me what to do, I've been with my husband since I was 18, currently 24.

I’ve been thinking about a bunch of embarrassing things I did specifically sixth grade.

When I was a sixth grader I was really weird and did some really obnoxious things. I pissed off some eighth graders that knew my brother by being annoying, rude  and thinking I was the shit basically on the bus. The rest of middle school was awkward as well but not nearly as bad as sixth grade. When I got to high school you would expect people to move on from who you were 3 years ago but nope. There were a lot of kids I annoyed but there were 2 in particular who would go around talking bad about me saying I was freak based off what I was like in sixth grade. My freshman year was miserable because of people like them. One of them dropped it after he was confronted by an older girl I knew but the other one was ruthless. He made a bunch of people think bad of me, laughed at me whenever I walked by, gave me weird looks and made one of his friends feel bad for liking me. They graduated my sophomore year but I guess since I’ve been home and I’ve just been in my head and thinking about all the weird shit I did in sixth grade. I’m a senior now and I’m a different person someone I’m actually proud to be! I’ve just been feeling awful about myself and I’m still viewing myself as that weird person from sixth grade. I’m also paranoid that people who knew me back then including my peers are still viewing me that way which I realize is crazy because my peers have seen me grow up.

489,"So, when I was a freshman in college I lived in a coed dorm and this group of ladies lived across the hall from us. They were all sweet as can be and they came over every night and hung out with us guys and it was honestly my favorite experience in college so far. There is the one out of those 4 girls that I could not take my eye off of though. She’s a southern girl, nicer than my own grandmother, as pretty as a sunrise, and smarter than anyone I’ve come across so far and that’s for damn sure. We became really good friends and I had this idea that she’s way out of my league without a doubt so I stuck with the friend mantra and put myself in a bit of a box. I love her family as much as they love me but I haven’t seen any of them in a while. And, well, fast forward 5 years and here we are. I think about her at least twice a day and when I ever get asked about “hey man, you ever think you’ll get married?”
she’s the one my mind jumps to. I don’t want to be creepy though and I never confessed any of the feelings or even showed any sign of them because I just had this belief that there was no chance. I’m a bold person and I have no problem sticking my neck out because “high risk, high reward” but this girl makes me vulnerable. She broke down the walls the moment we first made eye contact and I cannot shake her. I’d venture as far as to say that I’m genuinely in love and infatuated with this woman.

Anyways, I asked her if she’d go to dinner with me when I go back to visit to “catch up” and she said “of course!” Problem is, I want to tell her how I feel but it’s been so long that I don’t wanna push something like that. Another problem is that I’ve moved and now live three states away from her. It’s not terribly far and I’m willing to make the travel but only for her. I just don’t want to put pressure on her.

So, should I stick with my “we’re just really good friends” mantra or should I stick my neck out and risk it for the biscuit? She’s not the kind of girl to cut you off no matter what you do to her but she can be very stern and she sticks to her guns which I honestly admire the most about her, but I really don’t wanna burn that bridge since it’s been such a long time.

492,"Hi fellow redditors,

my wife and me  (31,30) were supposed to go on our honeymoon in New Zealand 2 weeks ago. The plan was to eventually start having children. We have been together for more than a decade, have traveled alot during this time and New Zealand is the long-awaited destination of our dreams. Also, we are both sure of our wish and feel 'ready' to have a child.

Now due to the travel restrictions we find ourselves in a situation where we are not sure if we should:

1. just start making babies now - regardless of when or how we are able to travel to new zealand again

2. wait several months and enjoy our honeymoon in togetherness and go on from there

3. wait a few months, watch the news and see if anything changes on intercontinental flights and then try to decide based on a possibly new starting position

4. start making babies and travel to New Zealand with a baby with the risk of having to cancel, and the possibilty of being overwhelmed by traveling with a newlyborn.

Now, it is clear to us, that this is mostly a question of priorities. But for now, we are looking for arguments for and against each of these decisions, alternatives, and most of all experiences.

Were you in the same position? How did you decide? If not, how would you decide?

493,"I’m an 19f, I moved out from my moms house a year ago with my boyfriend. I was working a part time job which usually gave me like 25 hours a week, but like 37 max during busy season. We weren’t always great on money but we always had enough to get by. 

I decided to get a second job, which promised me a max of 20 hours a week. It was exactly what I wanted, basically full time hours between the two jobs. 

Only the coronavirus thing happened and my hours at one job remained the same and the other job has been giving me 30. My boyfriend is unemployed because of coronavirus, but his unemployment hasn’t gone through. It comes out to be around 55 hours a week. My paychecks through all this are still only around $550 into my bank account after taxes. 

I asked for less hours at my second job, because it’s cashiering at one of the only grocery stores in town and it is busy and horrible. I absolutely hate it there. I like my first job. I’m respected, I’m cool with my managers there, I’m relied on and even though I don’t particularly enjoy the work, it’s easy enough. Plus I like that I know what I’m doing, and everyone knows that I know what I’m doing. 

My cashiering job basically outright ignored my request to work 4 days a week instead of 5, and instead gave me MORE hours, up around 35. I went and talked to someone and refused to work it and told them I needed one of those days gone, since I work two jobs and do not want to work 60 hours total. They obliged. But it still means I’m working like 55 hr weeks. I haven’t again asked to work less hours because I don’t know if I should.

Most the time I feel fine. Quite zombie-ish, and spaced out, but okay. Granted when my manager at my first job asked me if I was okay I broke down crying. They let me sit in there office and talked to me for like 40 minutes and told me they would do whatever I needed them to do, whether it be less hours or a break every now and then (even if it’s more than the 15 min we usually get). They also don’t care if I’m running a few minutes late or if I sit on the job (for the most part sitting isn’t an issue, and I don’t have a problem standing and working if necessary). 


I feel fine. But empty, but okay. I have moments where I break down and lose it completely, like before a shift at my cashiering job. Back when I worked half as much I used to bake and embroidery and clean (I love cleaning and homemaking things), I used to work on selling my art and stuff. It’s all gone now. Even when I have days off though, I don’t want to do any of it. I used to struggle with having time off, then I learned to enjoy it, now I struggle with it again and it’s really upsetting, because time off now just means existential crisis. 

I started doing instacart on the side. I can work 10 hours and get almost $200 right into my bank account. I bring home, altogether, like between $600-$700 a week, which is far more than anyone in my family ever brought home at a time. It feels good to have a little bit extra money, so I can spend a little more here and there and not feel guilty.

I’m in pain every single day. My legs! I have always had leg pain, specifically in my knee and hip. But standing for sometimes 11 hours a day is the worst pain I’ve ever felt. Cashiering is also hard on my back and upper body muscles, my shoulders and collar ache, my back aches, my legs ache. My body feels so tense, I’ve resorted to trying to stretch, and I’m kind of upset by how much less flexible I am now than I was like a year ago. 

TL;DR: I’m working 50-65 hours a week and bring home between $600-$700 and I LOVE the money.

Whenever I set a schedule or to do list for the day I feel like I'm forcing myself to do all these activities and follow it and do the same boring things day after day, so sometimes I think other people have said ""go with the flow"" more, but then, like get up and do what you kinda feel like? IE tired rest more, energized work and play more, etc etc - but whenever I do this I might spend the whole day working or the whole day playing, or the whole day resting, and I end up neglecting so many other important life areas that I set on my schedule or to do list.

This is kinda long, but here it goes. Last year, I (17F) was talking to this guy (17M). He was pretty cool, seemed like fun. And to be honest, I’ve been thinking about him lately and have been missing him.

We left off on a bad note, though. He liked me, and I wasn’t too sure of my feelings. Well, my ex came into the picture, and I still had feelings for my ex, so I chose him over my friend. My friend didn’t like this, and felt betrayed, so he called me some names, and blocked me. He felt like I lead him on. I shouldn’t of did that, and I regret that.

So, what I’m wondering is, should I reach out? And if So, what would be the best way to go about it? I don’t know if I want to date him, but I totally want to be friends with him. He has me blocked on Instagram and Snapchat, but not on Facebook (his Facebook may be inactive though).",18Apr2020,1
502,"A little bit of background first. I work in New York City, the epicenter of the US coronavirus pandemic. Fortunately, my company was proactive in social distancing and had us all start working from home early on, March 13th. Eventually, we're going to have to head back into work, sometime after May 15th, the date where NY governor Cuomo extended out the stay at home order to. Yes, we don't know what's going to happen in a month, and I understand companies may take their cue from the government and do rolling returns to the office, still enforce teleworking to some degree, etc. My company is being smart about this and considering several options such as splitting the employees up into squads, i.e. an A group that comes in Monday and Wednesday, and a B group that only comes in Tuesday and Thursday. So net net, at work at least, we will still enforce social distancing to some degree.

&amp;#x200B;

But there's no getting around I'm still going back into the belly of the beast. I'm 30+ years old, fairly healthy, live in Jersey City, NJ with my 2 parents who are 70+. We are following orders and staying at home and have only gone out to larger public areas, i.e. grocery shopping, once in the past couple weeks. Other times it's at the local Korean market or small places and we always wear a mask. When I start going back to work, even if it's only twice a week, I'm on public transportation, the PATH train, walking around NYC, and sharing office space with colleagues. The amount of people I will have contact with on these days increases dramatically. I will wear gloves and masks, and continue to be vigilant about washing my hands, but we all know this virus, it's very easy to spread. And I don't want to contract this and take it home to my elderly parents. I'm the one and only person in this household that my parents have regular contact with that can actually bring the virus into the house. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was planning to move out eventually and get an apartment with my friend this year, before COVID-19 happened, but was waiting for some major things in my life to settle first, like my job and getting a better sense of my expected finances. I can afford an apartment now, my income is pretty good. But am I crazy to want to start looking for a place now, to move out by late May / early June so that when I get back to the point of going back to work, being in NYC and being around more people, I'm not that person contracting the virus and bringing it into my house with my parents? I don't want to look back months later when the very worst could happen (they get sick or worst, god forbid) and realize I could have done something, I could have stayed away from them and minimized my contact.

So, I first saw him getting a bj from the maid.
I went to his room in the afternoon to ask him something. I opened the door slightly as it was ajar. I saw the maid on her knees and my cousin was standing up leaned against the wardrobe. (The wardrobe was just left of the entrance.) I instantly knew what was happening and just stood outside the room where I was and asked him what i wanted to ask. The maid hid herself in the corner thinking that i didn't see her.

Some minutes later, he came to my room and requested me to not tell anyone, I said ""about what?"" doing the best ""I have no idea what you're talking about"" acting bit. He didn't buy it. So, I finally told him that I won't tell anyone.

So, here's where the main problem starts, I checked recordings of the cctv camera of the drawing area which leads to his room and found that the camera was pointed downwards. About a month ago, that area was being painted and I thought the painter had done it to paint around the camera. But as it wasn't corrected weeks after the paint job was done, I'm pretty sure it was done by him and this wasn't a one time thing, he's having an affair with maid maybe for more than 3-4 months. I say ""affair"" because I know the maid is in on it too. 
I can't actually tell anyone about it because he's one of my favourite cousin and I don't want to put him in trouble, on the other hand I also want him to stop this as he's gonna be married in a few years. On top of that he took such less precautions to hide this like he didn't lock the door of his room so, there's a good chance he'll be caught again and maybe this time it's his mom or dad or some other family member that will definitely get him in trouble.
What should i do now? 

TL;DR : Cousin is having an affair with the house maid. Promised him i won't tell anyone but i want him to stop because : 1. He's gonna get married in a few years 2. He's not taking great measures to hide this fact and if someone else catches him, he'll be in a lot of trouble and I don't want that.",18Apr2020,1

I would have took the plane to get my stuff since tickets aren't expensive, but it's taking unnecessary risks and it won't be soon because there are no planes before end of may.

So my flatmate and I came to the agreement that if he packed all my stuff and send it back I will not pay the remaining months. I thought that I could use UPS or DHL to send my luggage but both are expensive.

So I found other services that are cheaper, like [sendmybag.com](https://sendmybag.com) or [mybaggage.com](https://mybaggage.com) but I don't know which one to take, they basically all have the same prices and all seems to deliver even during this situation.

I have been calling the wildlife rehabber in our area with no luck. No one is answering. My husband is on his way to go get some mealworms because, surprisingly, this baby survived the night. I really thought it would be dead when I woke up this morning.

Anyway, i know you shouldn't feed baby birds because it's dangerous. The best thing to do is allow it to fast until you can get it somewhere. But anything past one night is probably not good. So were just going to try to see what we can do until i can get in touch with someone.

Ok so, something happened between a group of my close friends I’ve known for 3/5 years, and another group of friends. Group 2, I’ve known one for 5 years, one for like 6 months, and then another person I met that day on a gc. Group 1 was added to that gc and, after I left cause I was just out of it at the time, I came back to a separate gc with only the 2 people from group 2 and someone from the main gc everyone was in. The 6 month person and new person were really upset because apparently group 1 were ‘making fun’ of 6 months cutting herself and the new girls eating disorder. 

I have no idea what happened even now because group 1 weren’t taking it seriously because they were only joking but it still got too the 2 girls. A few apologised to them but most of them were still ‘taking the piss’ and joking. This really got to me cause I think I had/have a crush on 6 months, I’m not sure, but also because they’re my friends, I care about Them. And the fact that my close friends were making her and her friend this upset really got to me. It made me question whether I should even keep talking to them. 

I decided just to take a break from talking to people and haven’t really done so in a while unless someone’s asked if I’m alright or if I’ve needed to. I’ve got about 10 messages from either people or gc’s because I just don’t wanna talk to people.

But here’s the thing, I wanna talk to people but I’m just not in the mood. I don’t wanna lose or damage the relationships I have with people just because I don’t feel like talking to them but when I actually think about talking to them I just don’t want to, I don’t feel like it

Obviously,  she was the person who spent the most time with him during the day and can't stand the loss,  but it's been almost a year and she must be a little out from the distress by now,  right? 
No. My mom doesn't eat sugar after my dad passed,  cause he had diabetes. My mom doesn't eat any items fried in oil too,  cause my dad didn't like eating oily food. I'm not saying this is bad,  but it is bad when you consider the fact that we prepare certain food fried in oil during our religious occasions,  and she refuses to eat them,  even though it is customary to do so. Okay, you may think of me as religious,  and biased,  but you may change your mind when you hear the fact that my dad was also quite religious and never gives up these customs. My mom was also the same before he died (observing customs). I'm abashed when she doesn't behave normally cause I really want to make the parent I have happy,  and want to spend time with her,  while she is deep in thought about my dad. 
My mom and I (M17) have a lot of fights regarding a wide variety of things,  and my father used to be the glue that used to pacify them. Now that he is no more,  even though I try a lot to attach with my mom,  I just can't,  because she just doesn't replace my dad. She too feels the same,  and keeps to herself,  and answers me only when I speak to her. I actually feel scared nowadays to speak to her openly because of the fear that she'll pour out her grief about dad on me as anger. I agree,  she has no one else except me and my sister (F14) to vent out her grief and other emotions, but what I want is a bit more time and love given to us. 
Each night,  she comes to the bedroom along with us  (me and my sister)  to sleep, but I've often noticed,  she sleeps 2 hours after we've slept. We usually fall asleep around 12 midnight, and she falls asleep at 2 am. She stares at my dad's photos each night before sleeping,  and keeps my dads photos under her pillow. I keep trying to bring her out of this habit of sleeping late, and she wakes up fairly early too, around 7 am. I'm constantly trying to remove her from this habit,  since the habit can have negative effects on her health. But it appears to be in vain,  this is mostly because she misses him really too much. I loved my dad. He was the one I used to share everything with,  but he never used to be really there with us,  due to his job as a software engineer,  what with being on the phone and laptop. I miss him a lot,  but I'm sure he's with us always,  and can feel his presence. It's been always progress since I started thinking this way. I urge my mom to do the same,  but no. She doesn't come out of the grief. 
My sister, on the other hand,  bottles her grief,  and after I have gone to the bedroom for sleeping,  cries to my mom. This hurts me a lot,  because,  I would love to be there to comfort both of them. They just can't perceive me as a person to whom they can share, maybe not everything,  but at least they can share grief right? 
Recently,  during the lockdown, she misses my dad's presence a lot than usual,  and seems more distant from me than usual. 
What can I do to improve the situation?  Please help. 

TL; DR: My mom still grieves my dad,  dead,  a year back,  and appears to be distant from her children, me and my sister.

and here i am today the next morning. its been about 10 hours since then and i just attempted to fit the earring in again. it went through at first but it still can’t get through the back, probably because i used the smaller safety pin to do that part.

We’re going to be prisoners of our own home. I feel sick with worry. I’m going to lose all my friends. I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to seem like a crybaby for losing my phone which is what my mom keeps calling us. They won’t listen or explain anything they just keep saying “addicted” and “crybaby” even though my sisters and I have cut down on our usage time. I don’t want to seem like I’m entitled and complaining I’m scared I’m going to lose my friends. I can’t call or text them and my parents won’t let me see them because they hate them. I have no idea why they do as they won’t explain. I can only guess because my friends aren’t the goodie two shoes schoolboy ideal they want. They’re not druggies or anything bad they’re just normal people but my parents don’t listen. They’ve called me a “stoner slut” once because of my friends. I’ve never smoked, they don’t smoke, and I’m a virgin but that doesn’t matter my parents don’t listen. They always assume I’m lying. They’ve never listened to us. They think by being parents they where gifted with divine wisdom and any child’s opinion is irrelevant. At least it feels like that. Sorry if this was ranty.

531,"My relationship with my parents is not a strong one. They're not good at communicating with one another, nor are they good at communicating with me. Most conversations are short-lived and rarely do they pertain to something that I think has meaning, and if we do, it will eventually lead into an argument because our morals are completely different than one another.

My dad is racist, sexist, homophobic, etc. and outwardly so. My mom is much more content being passive aggressive and pretending she isn't and pretending that she is making attempts to not be, but she very much still is. There's other issues, but I think that is typically how most of our arguments arise: social commentary, lmao.

I think to some people this would be over dramatic, but to me it isn't. Even if I don't say anything initially, it's egged on and encouraged that I do.

Personally, I think people's interactions with one another and themselves are a clear indicator of what type of person they are. I'm not certain that if they were not my parents I would want these types of people in my life, and that is very painful to say, because I do love them. But I question if this love is something that exists because they ***are*** my parents, and not something you come to have for someone after knowing them, you know what I mean?

So my dad is coming over to give my sister a driving lesson tomorrow and I know that I should go for a drive too to get my hours up - in Australia we have to do 50 hours of driving before moving onto the next stage in getting our license. Now you see, I have 1 hour and 45 minutes in my log book and that was from 2018. 😭

Looking for some advice from some fellow nurses here. My best friend (truly more like a sister) is a nurse who is clearly struggling right now. She’s expressed to me how severe her anxiety is every night before she has a shift in the morning. Yesterday we were talking about the protestors in Michigan and she made a comment about some of the horrors she’s seeing...

“These people are so ignorant! Meanwhile I can’t shake the image of one of our patients we found cold lying in a pool of her own blood, patients crying because they can’t see their spouse that’s also admitted to the ICU, old ladies calling me in for “juice” and saying she lied just so someone would talk
To her, holding the hand of my dying patient who one of the last things he said is “I just wish I could see your face”.” 

She also sent me some pics of the makeshift morgue her hospital is building. 

In all honesty, I didn’t (and still don’t) know what to say to her. I’m not sure how to comfort her or what I can say to make her feel less alone or less scared. I’m making some meals to drop off on her porch/to surprise her with. But I’d love to hear what (if anything) your friends/family could be or are doing for you to ease some of your stresses.

540,"I have lived with my brothers for a few years in a house where dad is the landlord.  They make less than me but they aren't broke or paycheque to paycheque.

We decided at the beginning of our living at the apartment that the bills are in my name and I pay them and they pay me back their share.  Same goes for paper products and cleaning products because I have a car and they don't so that stuff is too hard for them to carry around.  

Anyway over the years they have each accumulated thousands of dollars of debt to me.  I bring this up to them from time to time and they have paid me back several times in instalments of a few $100 but they haven't paid me back recently and they aren't doing it regularly enough because they still owe thousands.

Our dad charges us much cheaper rent than market value which is the main reason I stay.  However, I added up my expenses today and the cost of rent and utilities combined (knowing I wouldn't see their share of it for months or years) per month is almost the same as renting an apartment at market value.

So, I suffered from depression for years before this, but had been doing better at the time. I had great friends, a lovely girlfriend who I loved dearly, and my cat who was extremely important to me. That all changed when the girl left me for a man twice her age (her mentor at her job, so probably cheated), my cat died, and when I turned to my father for emotional support, he called me a loser for not ""just being happy.""

So I'm in a bad state of mind as this all happened within a 3 day time frame. But I still had my two best friends! A married couple who were like family too me. I was in their wedding and they asked me to be the godfather of the child they were trying for. I loved them. They invited me over, and they just sat and talked to me and made me feel better. It was great. Until the husband left for work. It was not unordinary for me to hangout with just the wife, I was friends with them both individually. We've done plenty together just the two of us before and nothing weird ever happened. I wasn't attracted to her at all, for obvious reasons.

Well this time was different. The second the husbands car left the driveway, the wife was all over me. It was overwhelming, and I was mentally and physically exhausted from the nights of no sleep, working through the day, and just general crying all the time. 

She immediately jumped on my lap, facing me. Groping my privates and begging me to have sex with her. Whenever I would say no she would guilt trip me with things like ""oh I didnt realize I was so ugly"" and just generally trying to make me feel even worse for not wanting to have sex with her.

553,"Bit of a long story, but please read!

I sometimes describe my mom as crazy whenever we approach certain topics such as me getting older.

I don't want to share my age, but let's just say I am a bit young to have wisdom teeth. They have been hurting for a couple years and my dentist, who took an x-ray, recommends my mom to remove them.

Removing wisdom teeth is a big deal in my family. It usually means that person is fully grown and isn't a child anymore. I am considered the baby of the family even though I am almost an adult.

My mom refuses to believe that I am no longer a little kid anymore. Usually I'd understand, it's hard to see your child grow up so fast, but the pain has been growing and I keep telling my mom I want them removed. She argued that she won't remove them until they appear through the gums...the dentist told her my wisdom teeth are growing sideways. Then she claimed to want to wait until I'm in my 20s.

Its been a year since then and I'm still constantly urging my mom to book an appointment.

This has nothing to do with money issues. My mom has always believed I'm still 12-13. Like, heavily believed I am in middle school. Her family doesn't have a history of dementia or memory loss, it's just my mom being in denial.

The problem has been going on even when I was in 6th grade when we were given the talk about ""growing up"". My mom argued against me attending it. Claiming she doesn't want me learning until im older.

Even now she still believe I don't know anything about sex or puberty and I'm almost an adult.

I'd normally ignore her actions, but the pain from my wisdom teeth are growing worse. I am not at the age where I can make my own decisions. I still need permission from my parents. My dad is okay with it, but he won't argue with my mom.

I just want to somehow get my mom to wake up and accept that I am not longer a child that needs help with adding and subtracting in math. Or to at least accept it long enough for me to remove my wisdom teeth before they cause damage.",18Apr2020,3

556,"
I’m 23 and so is an ex friend of mine. I haven’t spoken to her in around a year now. We used to be the best of friends all through our uni years and the latter part of school, I hung on to the friendship for a long time and I did really value it. 

Things hit a bump when she went off travelling around the world and slightly prior to that, I started uni and had a new life at 20, I made new friends and new experiences and also invited her to join the experience with me also which she did. But I couldn’t always talk, sometimes conversation would just die out or I would leave it and pick it back up at a different time. 
Now bear in mind, I suffer from depression it’s not an excuse but sometimes I don’t want to explain it to others who don’t get it such as her and I do see it could be an issue with lack of replies but she never pulled me aside to raise the issue.  

She then went travelling and said nothing for 8 months. Not a word and not even happy birthday, I obviously wanted to talk but after her not wishing my a happy birthday I got a bit frustrated and said nothing. Anywho, she came back and basically sent a message saying something along the lines of 

“hey sorry I didn’t wish you a happy birthday the last 2 years I’ve not felt happy in the friendship and I feel like recently you’ve not needed me..so good luck and let’s draw a line here”

This was really out of the blue and weird to me a few months prior someone close was really really ill in hospital but I talked it out with her and she agreed to meet. For the next year I made a ton of effort and always asked her how she was etc etc but eventually I gave up it felt like too much of a weight and toxic friendship, I felt like I couldn’t tell her anything or talk about anything, I also felt a gut feeling she was jelous if my relationship in a way too

A year on since this we’ve not spoken but all of a sudden my iPhone suggested a memory and lockdown doesn’t help the fact I want to forget it. Does anyone have any advice, was I the only one wrong in the situation? I’ve been working with my therapist and processed that it is time to let this go now

557,"I'm sure this is going to get a lot of hate. Maybe I deserve it. However, I  do not think I am a bad person or a Racist. I'm sure some of you will  think differently. This might end up being long and perhaps even  disturbing, but I already feel better just typing this.

I'm  a guy in my early twenties. I attempted suicide last year because of  this. These thoughts that I'm about to open up about literally ruin my  life and question if I even wanna be alive anymore everyday. *When I see a white (Caucasian) girls or woman with a non-white guy I get a very extreme wave of suicidal thoughts.*  It sounds so insane but it's how I feel. I'll be having a happy day,  spending time with family or friends and just enjoying myself. Then,  I'll either see one of these couples on the street or in a restaurant or  in some sort of online post (YouTube, TikTok etc.) and I'll feel sick  to my stomach. I will wanna go home ASAP after this happens. I will  wanna drink alcohol or get high. I will think of suicide and often be  close to self harming. It affects me so much, I can't handle it anymore.  There's no escape, as these types of sexual relations between white  girls and non-white guys are super common and are only getting more and  more common each day. My life is just going to be hell because of this.

Why  do I feel like this? You might ask. I have a lot of reasoning as to  why. However, I admit I could still be unsure about the root of all of  this. Perhaps because I am a virgin, never had a GF and girls typically  aren't into me. Maybe I am possessive over white girls? I mean, black  dudes are possessive over black girls, so does this make me racist? It's  just... white girls with a non-white guy is so much more common than  non-white girls with white guys. It's just like white guys are being  ""cucked"" as other men are stealing them from us. Is this a crazy way to  think?

Not to mention it feels  like an attack on white men. The media and porn constantly promote white  girl/black guy couples more than ANY other coupling, and now suddenly  white girls are dating non-white guys as the norm? It's like they're  just brainwashed to hate white guys and this would fit with all the  Liberal medias propaganda. I mean, just browse through Netflix and look  at how many movies have white girl/black guy couples. Look at the porn  industry. Seems like every other video is an interracial one and there's  literally an entire site (blacked) dedicated to this! Get what I'm  saying? Plus there is porn called ""the end of the white race"" or ""white  girls! You need to go black"" and stuff like that. It all just promotes  an agenda. Or that girls love black guys because they are better in bet  and white guys are worthless because we have ""small"" you-know-whats.

I've  seen posts online from black dudes and it will say like ""tag a white  girl that loves black guys"" and the guy will re-post it and say ""all  white girls"" or something like that. Black guys as a whole seem to  actively be antagonizing white guys with all of this.

I  can't be happy. I see a cute girl on the street and I think ""oh she  probably likes black guys"". I'll never be enough. I am inferior to  non-white guys in the eyes of white girls. White heritage, culture and  history is over and now I just gotta rot away until i kill myself. I  wouldn't wish this on anyone, because nobody wants to help me, they just  call me racist or insult me. I can't seek help for this because I'll be  labelled a sick racist - which I don't wanna be. I wish I had black  friends but they seem to hate white guys now. But my best friends used  to be black. As a side note, I don't think I am racist because when I  see a black girl/white guy couple I don't care at ALL. Nor with most  other couplings. It's just non-white guys with white girls. Especially  like Arabic or Indian immigrants/refugees. Like, they just come to our  countries and get with 10/10 white girls. It's horrible and it's like  white guys have been ""cucked"". I can't stand this anymore. I'm a young  guy, I've attempted suicide over this and I think my destiny is to kill  myself because this isn't going anywhere.

Thanks  for listening. I know it sounds crazy, but I had to get this out. I  feel ""cucked"" , worthless, inferior and incredibly depressed over  this. Suicide is just the most clear path I can take to stop this. If I kill myself IT'S OVER and I don't have to live in misery anymore!

Most of you will throw hate at me which is fine. You’re free to do so. I am not trying to control anyone or change society. I am just not happy in this generation and I never will be. Other white guys just accept they are inferior and it doesn’t bother me. Well, it hurts me and I know I can’t control society. I just think the best course of action is to kill myself. I’m not inciting violence or hatred. Or trying to ban these couples or anything. I don’t get how all of you give me so much hate I’m just that something upsets me and I wanna die as a result.

558,"I have made many mistakes in my life. I have lied to and stolen from people, including my loved ones. I have been reckless with my own life and the lives of others. Many of this occurred during a period of my life where I was addicted to drugs.

I want to chart a new course. I believe this starts with forgiveness. Of course, the largest task ahead of me is forgiving myself. There was a time where I almost put my life at risk by taking an absurd amount of drugs. Not to mention the countless times driving in an impaired state. Forgiveness for this can only come from within.

However, much of what I feel guilty about concerns my actions towards other people. How should I go about righting these wrongs? What should the extent of my forgiveness be? OF COURSE, if there was anything that I had done in the past that has the potential to create future harm for another, I would need to confess immediately. ( If I knowingly gave someone investment advice that could jeopardize their future financial circumstances it would be my moral obligation to confess to that person. If I knowingly gave someone at STD/contagion that could jeopardize their own health and that of their peers/partners, it would be my moral obligation to confess.)

However, much of what has happened is in the past. It is done and over with. My lies are not actively and currently hurting anyone right now. I want to seek forgiveness for my past. However, I am struggling with formulating a plan.

It is not feasible to apologize for every wrongdoing. For example, how would I go about tracking down every single driver that had been on the road when I was driving stoned/high/intoxicated? Obviously I would not be able to. I don't know who they are and I put their lives in danger. Do I really need to track down every relative/peer who left their pill bottle out in the open for me to pounce upon? Or can I just seek forgiveness from those in my immediate family and call it at that? 

Should I admit to all of the wrongdoings that could jeopardize my legal background? 

I am thinking it is morally permissible to issue a few apologies and resolve oneself to live a more moral life. That is the ""sweet spot"" so to speak, for me.  Does this mean I wrongfully got away with things without having to even own up to what I did?",18Apr2020,1

A little background on her. She has BPD, consistently in and out of rehab. It's really hard to talk to her about anything because she is really sensitive and lashes out a lot. So I dont know how to bring it up without offending her. 

My brother-in-law is kind of a push over too, he always agrees with her. We already told him we do not approve of their marriage. She threatened to beat him multiple times and they lost their children to Cfs. It's really sad that he wants to do anything for her, but i think hes scared. Hes always been the type of person to say yes to everything to please others. We love  him and don't want to push him away by being ""rude"" to her, since that has happened before. 

Please help my husband and I find a way to tell her in a respectful manner.",18Apr2020,2

564,"I wish I was part of a tribe. I’m really feeling it now I’m getting older. I was raised in the foster system so I don’t have strong family ties, the foster families I’ve been raised by have been great but never go out on a limb to get in touch, it’s an out of site out mind type situation. 

I have a partner and child and as much as I live my son, I feel like all I am is a mother. I did move to be with my partner years ago (200 miles), the few friends I did have, I’ve grown apart, except for one who I sometimes talk to. 

It would be lovely to have a group of friends for support outside the home and to feel part of something but I don’t want it to be forced. 

I’m very self critical and don’t think I do anything that’s off putting when trying to make friends. Maybe I’m just a natural outlier, I can remember at school having fickle friends and I’d spend my lunches in the girls bathroom sometimes.

566,"To be honest, I am a rather lackluster person. I get high grades at school, but not as high as my younger sister. I do well on standardized exams, but not as well as one or two people my parents know. I'm really not sure if I can go into college, and my parents are paranoid that I will be rejected. Almost every single freaking night, my parents discuss if I need to retake the ACT or SAT. I feel really guilty and nervous when they do this because I KNOW that it is my fault they are fighting. In like 30 seconds it escalates into a fight with screaming and them barging into my room and lecturing me. And no, they're not even Asian, they're white.

And then every now and then I get into fights with my sister. She comes into my room without knocking at takes my stuff and never gives it back. I ask her to give them back, but she doesn't and says that she needs it. She takes my watch even though she has a watch (which she apparently ""can't find). She takes my phone and snoops through it because ""90% battery deserves charging"". It's UBER UBER FREAKING annoying, and she doesn't seem to care. And then she comes into my room when she needs help with math homework. She just says a problem, without even showing me the paper, and when I ask ""could you please repeat that?"" (which I think is a very reasonable request), she goes like ""what?"", as if nothing had happened. And then I ask ""what did you ask me?"", she says, ""what?"" again. Then my mom hears our conversation and tells us to stop. She then fights with my dad ABOUT ME, AND ONLY ME, saying that I don't treat my sister well even when she is the person stealing my stuff and I just ask her to give it back. I'm not sure why anyone needs two watches or two phones, especially when the electromagnetic pulses give you breast cancer.

568,"Hello. I am posting this here because it does not quite fit under relationship advice, or legal advice. I [23F] have been dating my bf [27M] for a little over 2yrs now. We moved in together WAY too soon, but seemed like the best decision at the time because I was graduating and wanted to move to his homestate for work. In the early phases of our relationship, there were plenty of red flags that I saw and recognized, but foolishly ignored due to thinking I was in ""love"". He is not physically abusive with me (yet) but financially and mentally abuses me. I will spare you guys of the details since this isn't advice on our relationship itself. Overall, I am constantly ridiculed, held up to an impossible double standard, not ""allowed"" to have my own friends (or make my own decisions in general), unable to see any of my family ( even before quarantine) etc. All of my friends here are able to recognize that I am in an unhealthy situation and are constantly motivating me to break free, and I am finally opening my eyes.

We lease a house that is approximately 3k a month. We live in a very expensive area. Originally when applying for the lease, we were denied due to our combined income being too low. He used to work with a salary+ commission job, and I had a low salary in a entry level job. Without the commission, we wouldn't have been able to afford the place, but with that factored in, we were well able to afford it, and were then approved. Even though he made double the $$ I did, I got stuck with paying almost ALL necessities and bills, and arguments would start whenever I tried to split things otherwise. He convinced me that i should be making all the financial decisions because i am the responsible one.. I was barely saving, and he was blowing his money on unnecessary purchases (gaming consoles, motorcycles, car parts, TVs, expensive dinners, nights out, etc). Fast forward to now, he lost his job in Feb (not due to COVID, got fired for other reasons). I have a new job making more than I was before, but not enough to be solely responsible for the rent on paper. He recently got a job that is commission only and he is not pulling in any money due to work being almost nonexistent with quarantine, so on paper there is essentially no ""combined"" income anymore.

I have been very clever with saving money with my new position in hopes of being able to move out. I have enough money saved to technically afford this lease for 6 months (including necessities). My bf does not know this because if he did, he would feel entitled to the $$ I have saved. I am wondering if it would be possible to break the lease due to COVID, since when we originally applied, he was the main source of income, and no longer has that income. And based off my current income alone, it is not enough to pay the rent. I have enough money saved where I can try and stay here until our landlord finds someone to replace us, but I am wondering if this is even a legit reason to break the lease in general. I am trying to find the least problematic way to break the lease. But, I need to get out. I can't wait another year of our lease living with this guy who has slowly been destroying me in every aspect possible. I can't deal with the constant arguing, being put down, etc.. If I can't get out for this reason, is there anything else?? Please..
I also feel guilty using the pandemic as an excuse/reason, even though it has severely affected our combined income. But ever since the pandemic, being stuck inside with him and unable to go anywhere, I can't get away, and its just getting worse and worse :(",18Apr2020,1

 I thought about sending her a letter to say goodbye and tell her i hope she is doing okay. 

I know its very unprofessional but iam in a role conflict. Iam her nurse but i think iam also her friend, i really dont know what to do.

So I am married to a man who has a 9-year-old son from a previous relationship. The ""baby momma"" is causing too much drama. She started by getting upset a while back because on Facebook I posted a picture of my 9-year-old stepson saying how much I love him and that he will always be my son a blessing from God, etc. She called my husband's father (the grandfather of his son) complaining and dragging him into this and he said: ""Just be glad so many people love him."" And then she called my husband saying ""don't let her call him my son."" She did it again last night when I sent her a text asking ""How my handsome son is doing, and asking if he had any school work left after getting to her house after being with his grandparents all week."" She said, "" OUR son is fine."" She really won't let this stupid thing go!! \*\*\* PLEASE NOTE!!! MY INTENTIONS ARE NOT TO TRY AND REPLACE HER.\*\*\*\*\*\* I ONLY WANT WHATS BEST FOR THE CHILD!

A little back story about the baby mama

She has never put her son as a first priority. She pushes her son to the grandparents so they can watch him 5-6 days out of the week. She neglects all his needs (education, health care, basic needs) The boy's behavior is very out of line when she has him. There is no discipline in the home and he acts out in school causing many problems. The grandfather and grandmother get called and is asked to step in. When he is with his grandparents he is a well-behaved kid and his bad behavior is quickly corrected! Recently we got a call from the grandfather and grandmother being told that when they had picked up my husband's son and that he had been wearing dirty clothes and his toenails had not been trimmed in months (his toenails were grown passed his toes!) The mothers home is always a mess and the man she is now married to doesn't care about his stepson what so ever. The grandfather and grand mother pay for the child's medical care, after school activities, clothing, trips/vacations, etc. At one point he had 5 cavities. The mother wasnt sure he was brushing his teeth and they were letting him drink soda all the time and the mother did not even bother paying for the dental work, the grandfather and grandmother did. My husband and I currently live 1500 miles away in another state, but we are trying to get my husband work in the state where his child is so we can gain full custody of the kiddo. WE do a lot for his son making sure he has clothing, shoes, everything he needs! So it's not like we aren't doing anything. And my husband PAYS child support as well and IS NOT behind on payments.

Anyway he had Dino for 9 years before he gave Dino to me. He moved to a new place where he couldn’t take Dino and asked if I would keep him. He came to see Dino maybe 5 times in the past 6 years and the last time was probably about 3 1/2 to 4yrs ago. ...all of that is beside the point though. He loved Dino. He loved him enough to know that he wasn’t giving Dino the life he deserved and put Dino best interests ahead of his own when he gave Dino to me. Dino would have been 16 in a few weeks. His age only really began to show in March, I honestly thought we’d have at least another year together. Dino unexpectedly to a sharp turn Monday evening and as I was calling the emergency vet to see about bringing him in, he passed away right next to me. I’ve been an absolute wreck all week.

I’ve been working at the same place for about a year. Company is okay and I’m pretty happy with my my job but I’ve always had the impression I could do better. While working from home since the covid-19 outbreak, I applied to a few vacancies around here.

But one day, I had a conference call with my boss and I had to share my screen with him. I’m pretty sure he saw my resume on the desktop. He didn’t say anything about it but I’m positive he saw it.

This was about 3 weeks ago. Today, by randomly browsing on the company’s website, I saw they were hiring someone at my exact position. Now, they don’t need a second person doing my work. The workload is much lighter than it used to be so that means they intend to replace me.

I don’t know how to react to this. I know for a fact that I won’t be able to find a new job until the covid-19 fades away. Literally no one is hiring (except my company, as it seems).

I was considering two options.

**1. Asking my boss for feedback about my work.**

Like what should I improve. Maybe if I do the efforts he’s expecting from me, he’ll reconsider hiring someone. BUT if what bothers him can’t be changed, this might serve as a ground to fire me right?

**2. Ignore it until…**

I don’t know when. But just forget about it. Work normally until they find someone else.

There are difficult times and I will have a lot of trouble if I lose my job now. I would be really grateful for any help I can get from here.

he basically ruined my entire life and my social life. and I've never had a genuine hatred for someone before this, but whenever something that even slightly comes up that relates to him I get mad (for example, if I hear about Poland in any sort of news he comes to mind because he's polish)

I have to say that I very good at what I am doing but I feel like Im going to waste at this work. Even managers or employees with over 20-30yr experience are often asking me for advice or about my thoughts on something job related. I really dont like this job, it costs me lots of stress and it is extremely ungrateful. My work is being very undervalued compared to other employees, the doctors whom Im working for are always looking for something to complaint about even if something is a standard process and not something I do wrongfully. The people that I've always been working with in this field are very selfish and cocky. I was also always the youngest at each office. The pay is not high enough too. I am looking to change my career roads. I would really appreciate if someone could lead me in which path and occupancy would be good for me. I think it would be a perfect time to think about career changes due to lack of job stability due to virus.

What I am looking for:

- Ability to work from home
- Ability to work on flexible schedule
- Ability to make more money if I work harder and better
- No or as least as possible phone calls
- Not having to deal with angry clients or patients

Personality:

- Investigator (always research and doing everything I can to complete a task)
- Intuitive (my intuitive has never failed me)
- Open minded and rationally thinking
- Hypersensitive (OCD)
- Perfectionist (Always have to clear everything so there's nothing left behind)
- Overthinking (Multiple thoughts at a time and making sure everything I do is correct)
- Liable (will always complete a task even if other people are dont worry about it)
- Honest (care and taking my work personal)
- Convenient (always looking for another easier way to accomplish something)
- Lazy but hardworking if I am into something
- Modest (think before saying something and not liking to say about myself in superlatives)
- Anxious (stressed easily)
- Individualist (prefer to work on a task myself)

Something more about myself:

- I am very tech savvy and great with computers
- with my modesty I shouldn't say it but I am pretty intelligent, all friends and family are asking me for help with something
- ability to complete any task, even when it is something I've never done before
- ability to research and find answers very quick and efficiently

- written english is better than spoken

593,"

I got a new boyfriend last month before this whole quarantine began. I’m 29 and Have been single for 5 years so it’s not like this guy is a flavor of the week or anything like that.
Without gushing because I’m sure you get the point, yeah I’m kind of over the moon for the guy. He has his shit together and we get each other.

My best friend/roommate (m27) has been weirdly negative about it. For background, he had a whirlwind romance back in September and he knocked the girl (21f) up. She had lots of red flags that he openly acknowledged to his friend group but ignored.  Before knowing about the red flags,I honestly was happy that he had found someone because he was kind of an incel for a while. I was very supportive of him as well as after the break up. Since the break up he has become very negative and quickly turned back into the incel personality. 

So I started seeing Dillon before the quarantine stuff went down and when we finally became official I was so excited. Dillon is a professional and award winning photojournalist. I’m also into the arts myself and I think it’s so cool that he *made* it. 

When I was telling the roommate what he did he just rolls his eyes and said “did you know that in other countries, people don’t care about your occupation? Like if they saw you geeking out over it they would think something is wrong with you?” I said “is this your way of telling me that you don’t care?” And he responded “yeah basically” then went on to tell me that he would probably cheat on me if he ever had to go on an assignment and to just keep that in mind. 
I told him I thought he would like to know that because he’s into art too and he said “photography isn’t art” I responded with “and drawing naked anime girls is?” 

The other day, He was laughing about some video regarding some new gen z slang “simp” and then started calling Dillon a simp. I didn’t understand what it meant and he was like “well you’re old so I don’t expect you to”. He knew I was getting anxious about my 30th birthday coming up. 

I’ve been keeping a distance but it’s been hard since we now both work from home now. Since then, the remarks are kind of directed at me in some instances. When I stand up for myself, it becomes an argument to him. He tries to “outsmart” me on stuff and when I prove him wrong he gets all huffy and puffy.  He never cleans up after himself or his cats, and has been EXTRA lazy since Dillon came around. I clean the apartment because he is supposed to come over the next day. I will leave to go to work, and when I come home from my overnight shift the place is a MESS. I’ve confronted him about it and he just shrugs his shoulders and closes his door. 
For the record, he’s not in love with me. I’ve seen him in love and he’s a doormat.

596,"I have been lying to my best friend for about 5 years. She was sexually abused by multiple family members as a child, and that experience has scarred and damaged her in terrible ways. A few years ago was the first time she opened up to me about the experience. I had no clue what to do or say to make her feel better and I wanted to empathize with her and make her feel like she wasn’t alone. I told her that my grandfather sexually assaulted me as a child. 

My grandfather is a very violent/angry man who would verbally and physically hurt me and my cousins as children, but there was no sexual assault or anything of the sort. However, around the same time my friend and I had that conversation, my family found out that my grandfather had been forcing my grandmother into sex groups and gave her multiple STDs. This probably is the cause for me making up that horrible lie. 

As soon as the words came out of my mouth I regretted everything, but I thought it was too late to take it back. I don’t know what is wrong with me but over the years we have bonded over our ‘shared experience’ and, as I don’t remember much of my childhood due to other trauma, I have basically convinced myself that the incident actually happened. My best friend is the most important person in my life and without her I genuinely don’t think I would be alive today. 

I hate living this lie but the worst part is that I don’t think about it often or really feel guilty. I don’t know what to do in this situation. Telling her the truth would almost certainly ruin our friendship. I’ve never told anyone about this but I genuinely just don’t know what to do.

597,"I’ve been in love with my best friend for almost 3 years. About two years ago I wrote her a letter confessing my feelings (Ik super lame but I already did it so too late lol). After I gave her the letter nothing changed, it was like it never happened, which tbh was a relief for me at first but now two years later I want to know what her thoughts were. To this day she has never said anything about it and I’ve understandably kept my mouth shut. 

Long story short she went out of state to college about a mouth after I gave her the letter and I stayed in state for college. We’re obviously all back in town now due to the virus, and we’ve been hanging out a lot (going on super long bike rides and Netflix parties) and she’s asking me to hang out one on one a lot more than usual and seems to be excluding our other friends on purpose.

598,I’m a 19 year old male and I live with my mom. Her and my ex step dad broke up in 2017 after 15 years of marriage. She’s been going out a lot and I don’t blame her but now with the quarantine situation is very irresponsible in my opinion. Just last Sunday she went to this guys house that I’ve never met and only when I asked her where she went for 3 hours she told me where she went. Yesterday we had a fight about how it’s irresponsible to go to others houses outside of the family Circe but she doesn’t care and says she’s an adult and that the government is trying to brainwash us to stay inside. And after that fight at 10 pm she stayed the night at the guys house. I was shocked because she just told me last minute she was spending the night there and she also said before going that she was too tired to cook something so she made scrambled eggs. She returned this morning at 8 am and we haven’t talked since. I don’t know how to feel about it and I feel like shit. I couldn’t sleep last night and I had no one to talk to.

599,"23/M from Ohio, US

So about a year ago I got a job where I was basically able to have massive amounts of downtime while working, during that time, paired with my ADHD I began to hyperfocus (can only control that to a certain extent) on social issues and things like wealth inequality, along with researching the subjects on that and climate change, then I eventually got into subreddits like r/latestagecapitalism and r/aboringdystopia. 

I started getting really depressed about the future and started having nightmares and anxiety about being turned into I guess a ""wage slave"" and being put in a hamster wheel life where I'll be forced to live paycheck to paycheck. The thing is though, no one in my real life seems to have any clue about the stuff that I've heard about (I don't even really know what's real anymore pertaining to the news.) 

All of my pessimism has made me more and more angry, cynical and depressed and has greatly impacted my relationships and overall mental health. I come from an upper middleclass family so no one really takes my mental health sersiously and everyone says I'm just lazy and need to get my life together and everything will be fine. I feel on edge constantly and even after cutting out most of the news and reddit, I still find my hopelessness creeping in.

 I want to be happy, and don't want to life a life where I'm a car accident away from being homeless (my overall biggest fear)I want to be successful and live a comfortable life where I can do a job I ennjoy and help people psychologically (I'm a psych sci. Major finishing up my degree this semester.) I don't care about being rich I just want to not have to worry about money and living to work. I'm really at a loss for what I should do. Therapy really hasn't helped, I take meds for adhd, but nothing else. I really just want all this anxiety and cynissism out of my head, this is not who I am. 

Any advice?",18Apr2020,3

I sorted by new and noticed that the auto-moderator is being doubled as an N-word count bot but is using a user's subreddit rank number as their N-word count, either by design or by accident, falsely exposing people for using the N-word when they haven't at all.

This could be a huge problem, totally innocent people could get harassed for no reason.

I messaged the mods via the drop down menu then contacted 2 separate moderators directly about this issue and got banned, with ""Don't be a cunt"" as a reason, I understand I likely got banned for messaging the mods in quick succession but that isn't the issue

surely it is unacceptable for reddit to allow a sub to falsely 'out' people for racism, then silence anyone who speaks up about it.

I couldn't care less about being banned from the sub, its the recklessness of what the mods are doing that bothers me

602,"Well, I need advice/help on dealing with increasingly aggressive landlords, paying $1600 by May 1st, and finding a home to move to by June 1st.  


Backstory: My mom passed away on March 8th, 2020. She did not have any life insurance or a 401K to help me with rent payments or her own debts that I found out she had. To top things off, lost my job due to CORVID-19. So no money coming in. I did apply for unemployment and I have been applying for jobs.  
   
At first, the landlords said they would help me by reducing the rent for a while to $1000 a month with the Corvid-19 going on. They knew about my mother's passing and about my situation. The regular rent is $1600. With other's help and the help of an organization, I was able to pay $1000 for April. However, as I was busy trying to get those funds, they said that I wasn't trying hard enough to get the money together. They also thought I was ruining the relationship between me and them because I didn't get the money fast enough for them? I said that if I had enough money, I would pay the full amount for May, but I don't and they know I don't. So I thought it would stay at $1000... Now, for May's rent, they said that if I am seeking help from others, that I should now pay the full $1600 regardless; thus, breaking their word of keeping it $1000. I do have proof.  


I know they have bills to pay and mortgage to pay. I don't want them to pay late fees, but what can I do? I'm scared now.. I was thrust into this situation by mom's decision to NOT have any life insurance in case something were to happen to her. I also have to have funds to get out of here. I NEED to get out.. Please, any advice?",18Apr2020,1
603,"I don’t know him irl, met on Reddit over 2 weeks back, exchanged many PMs and took it to email and in the last few days on a chat app. 

It’s not romantic or sexual I was morbidly fascinated with his life which was traumatic with unfathomable decisions. He shared intimate photos which I did not ask for, and I did not reciprocate. However I validated him as it was one of the few things left that he was proud of.

However I shared a lot of detail about my own life once he asked, as I felt that it’s good to build trust that way - sharing stuff that I wouldn’t want others to know. So it’s more balanced. Plus it felt nice to share.

He is estranged from family and friends, has a newish number, only a handful of contacts. I believe he may have a part to play in why the relationship is bad, that that he is not revealing... so I’m not sure how it’ll work if I reach out.. especially being a stranger.

Reason why I’m worried: he has attempted suicide before. He wrote his own obituary two years ago, and he tried killing himself just a few months back. This was revealed through a combination of my own online research, and him telling me the more we talked.

At the beginning he said he was getting better. In the last few days he’s said things that make me feel that he’s still in danger. He’s quit his job and sold everything, gave all his money away in the last week. I believe he’s living in his car now. This he told me in our last message exchange approximately 36 hours ago. I tried to tell him to focus on what he has to live for but I worry that I might have made things worse as I’m not a professional. He said he was tired as he had few hours of sleep so I told him to get some rest. 

Since then he’s sent one message (one hour after I said to rest), saying he will, and that he will delete Reddit (which he did) as the mods were ruining it. He said fuck it. And then he’s been offline since then. 

I’m really worried. I didn’t think he would kill himself yet as he said he is giving it 2 weeks to find something to live for (itself still worrying and still need advice even if he isn’t dead right now). 

I’ve dropped him a regular text message. What else should I do? 

I am halfway across the world. This made me feel safe enough to talk to him although I thought he was nuts.. now I know he has good in him, and I realised he’s suicidal, and my distance makes it hard to help.

Now I think about one of the earlier messages where he joked about moving here and living with me, and I got scared and told him he wouldn’t like it. I wonder if it was really a joke or if he was looking for something to live for. As he’s lonely.

Ugh what should I do? Will I get in trouble if I reach out to his family?",18Apr2020,1

609,"So my boyfriend and I have been together for years and live together. Our relationship is far from perfect but we have always managed to pull through no matter the obstacles we've been through. 

But as of late, he just seems to so argumentive. And I have no idea why. Like whatever I say I feel like he's always disagreeing with it and deliberately trying to pick fights with me. I have confronted him over it but he just gets super defensive and says I am just too sensitive and need to stop being dramatic. 

A few days ago, after we both finished work. We decided to have some drinks. And again, it happens all over. No matter what I say, there he is... disagreeing, even ridiculing and being argumentive. Whatever topic.. From the music, movies, tv shows, sports I like. Things happening at work. Upcoming plans. He does this for anything and everything I say. I tell him stop being negative as I am not in the mood to argue and I'm too tired for this shit. He says the same thing again that I am being too sensitive. This time, because I am a bit tipsy, I'm not so passive. I say ""WTF is your problem? You are always so negative towards anything I say. I am so sick of your bullshit!""...... 

What he says next I am not prepared for. He raises his voice and says that I need to shut up and that my mouth gets me in trouble. That's why my dad used to beat me. I am dumbfounded that he says this and am hurt. That was pretty vicious. I spilled all my personal family secrets to him and he just throws it in my face like that. By then I am furious, I say to him that was totally uncalled for and it's not fair to be personally attacking me like that. But he doesn't stop. He proceeds to say mean shit about the rest of my family. We are both screaming at each other and I eventually tell him to pack his bags and leave. 

The next day he tells me I am cruel for telling him to leave but I ignore him. He still hasn't left and we are not speaking. I am still upset by what he said and don't wanna be the one running and apologising to him, begging for his forgiveness.

611,"ETA: we are both 30F

My friend ""Rachel"" and I have been friends since high school. If anything, she has had much more difficult time in her life since she immigrated to the US when she was 12. (I immigrated when I was 4 so I pretty much grew up as an American.) She had to learn the language, get used to the culture, make new friends, etc. Her mother was especially hard on her and for weird reasons - she would keep pressuring her to ""just get married"" and stop being so ambitious. It was bizarrely antiquated for our culture. But Rachel did what she want, excelled in school, and got into a good college. Her mother would constantly dismiss her successes, keep telling her that a career was fine as a ""hobby"" until she got married and had kids. Again, Rachel ignored her, moved far away from her, and advanced in her career where she is now making 6 figures. She has a solid group of best friends, an amazing boyfriend, is outspoken and confident and constantly pushing herself to do the best she can. Of course I do know that she has her own insecurities (worrying about her accent, wondering if she should go to graduate school, worrying if her coworkers like her, etc.) But still- I think Rachel has ""made it"" in life.

Me on the other hand, had 2 very supportive parents who told me I could be anything I wanted, whether it made money or not, whether it was impressive or not. They supported me through all kinds of random hobbies and interests, indulged in my sensitive and depressive moods, and pretty much always told me they loved me, that I was doing well, they were proud of me, etc. But Rachel and I couldn't be more different. I never got along with my peers very well, never knew what I wanted to do with my life, floated around jobs, got into abusive relationships, and I know that I have very low self-esteem and a poor image of myself. Luckily, I was decently smart in school somehow and coasted by. I have a stable career now but I'm not passionate about it, don't really have any deep interests, don't really push myself to do much but the bare minimum. I pretty much always do the bare minimum and manage to get by - but never excel. I wonder where it all went wrong and why I am like this.

Mostly I find myself comparing myself to Rachel. I remember how much she cried in high school and college because of her mom, how she said she knew she was capable of doing anything and her own family didn't believe in her. I could barely relate because my family was nothing like hers and I felt lucky that my parents were so loving and kind. But in the end, she ended up more successful and satisfied with herself. Where did I go wrong? What am I still doing wrong? What can I do?

I wonder these things from a clinical perspective. I'm old enough now that I don't feel extreme jealousy or depression over my situation - it is what it is. But I still want to know the psychology of it. Is it because Rachel had to be her own cheerleader? And is it because I was coddled and sheltered? Am I doomed to just be like this? What can I do about it now? Any outside insight would be greatly appreciated.",18Apr2020,1

and now that i have so much time to be alone with my thoughts... i’m just a mess

i haven’t spoken to my friends in days. and i don’t even know how to explain it. i have ADHD, and of course that’s not enough, on top of that i have depression and anxiety— yay me! and no, ADHD, depression, or anxiety is NOT an excuse. i understand that. but it is an explanation. 

my parents have anger issues, and i’ve told by my psychiatrist that those with ADHD (or even depression/ anxiety) have a hot temper. and i do. and it sucks because sometimes i’ll lash out on people. they don’t deserve it. and i don’t want to hurt anyone. 

anywho, back to what i was saying with not responding to my friends. 

it’s not even a personal thing, it’s just a more of “i’m too exhausted to exist” kind of thing. and it’s really weird because whenever this happens, i go back in forth between feeling guilty and feeling like i did the right thing. by the “right thing” i mean by removing that persons obligation to talk to me, because obviously the only reason they’re reaching out is to be nice. and i go silent because i don’t feel deserving of love. i mean, my own fucking parents can’t love me, who can? 

i’m sorry, this is getting too long and i should just cut to the chase. 

i don’t know what to tell my friends because they are all so proud of my progress, and if i explain how i’ve been feeling, i feel like i’ll disappoint them. 
especially my boyfriend, when i was a really dark place he helped me every second of the way and was super understanding and just AMAZING. i really don’t deserve someone this good but he also worries a lot about me. and i don’t want him to cause him that anxiety.  

i guess my question is what do i tell my friends? we’re all in quarantine so saying i’m busy or something doesn’t make sense. should i tell my boyfriend/friends what’s going on? or should i just keep it to myself and make up an excuse as to why i haven’t been responding?

1. I (25M) am a recovering porn addict.  I mostly am attracted to men but have also...done things while thinking about women.  Nothing out of the ordinary but I'm not like a ""saint"" or anything even though I have made it known that I at least hold to conservative Christian beliefs
2. The friend in question is very outspoken about domestic rights for women (not in any bad way, I fully agree with her viewpoints)
3. I feel like if she knew that I was a recovering porn addict, she wouldn't want to be my friend
4. When I see her talk about these things, it makes me feel like I don't deserve to be her friend
5. I'm scared to talk to her about it because in all honesty we're not THAT close so it would come across as inappropriate (she's a coworker and our work has VERY strict sexual harrassment policies, rightfully so)
6. I hate myself but I would feel dissatisfied if I just like deleted her number and stopped talking to her, I want her to know so badly because I don't want to suffer in silence, but at the same time this isn't just something you randomly talk about with people

635,"I live in the USA and have lived in this particular neighborhood since 2018. Over that time-period until now, one of my neighbors has escalating bizarre behaviors. Another neighbor who has lived here longer has notified me that he is a vet, owns weapons, is somewhat recently divorced and lost his children in a court battle. Over the course of a year, he has put homemade signs on his front porch that, to keep things vague, are leaning angry-conspiracy-theory-ish and has a website listed where he goes into further detail about these issues. He also plays very loud music almost all day long. Through the time period, it sounds like neighbors have tried non-emergency lines to see if the police could address the noise issues but the police say he currently isn't breaking any laws. From what I can read into his website, he is quite disgruntled by the VA and our government for a myriad of reasons. 

Anyways, things are starting to escalate a little more and one particular neighbor is starting to feel very unsafe as this other neighbor is appearing to come more unhinged (music on earlier in the morning, playing angry recordings of himself over a loud-speaker). I recognize he is in desperate need of help and not any kind of punishment or anything but there doesn't seem to be any kind of resources that I know of. I personally have never met him but from I can read into, he really needs someone to talk to and be listened to. I imagine this quarantine is making it infinitely worse.

638,"A little background: Several years ago my two sisters and I purchased 3 acres in rural Florida for each of us to own and develop one acre. I purchased a mobile home for my acre with a plan to build a home later. 
3 years ago i decided to buy a home in the city. At the same time, my niece (one of my sisters daughter) found herself homeless. I offered to allow her to stay in my mobile home on my property on the condition she paid the annual property tax. 
My sister, (her mother) and I spoke further and came to an agreement she would trade 1/2 acre for the mobile home because she wanted her daughter to have a permanent place to live. I didn’t want to do this as I have my own children, 2 of whom would soon enter adulthood and the home could be a back up for them or even myself. However, against my better judgment, I agreed on the condition she move the mobile home onto her mothers (my sister) property within 2 years and pay the property tax during those 2 years. Win/win. Niece has a free home, I don’t have to worry about paying property taxes and I own another 1/2 acre. What could go wrong? Plenty. 
My niece had another child and her husband is gainfully employed. Instead of saving money to move the home, they’ve spent money like it was going out of style and are still on my property a year later than our agreement. 
A little over a year ago I became extremely ill and eventually found I had cancer. I had surgery in August and have now recovered but, during the time i was sick, I lost everything and now find myself essentially homeless. I’m saving money to place a home on my property and expect my niece to hold up their end of the bargain. 
My sister thinks it is shitty of me to tell them they have to move the home (that should’ve been moved before all this happened) and thinks I should let them stay there until the economy recovers. (When will that be??) Her husband is still working and there is no reason in my mind they shouldn’t be able to do it. 
Meanwhile, i am now the one in dire straits. I am a single mother with 2 young children, and I’m staying with my brother in another state and working whatever jobs I can find to save money to improve our lives that were shattered.
I don’t expect them to move the home right this second but I don’t feel it is unreasonable to tell them it needs to be moved within 6 months. 
Additionally, my sister admitted that she and niece felt that since I was doing well financially at the time and they weren’t, that it was basically my duty to be charitable. Niece was even upset they had to pay annual tax (in lieu of rent) and sister feels that I should give back the 1/2 acre. I feel my sister and niece to be completely ungrateful, entitled and have taken full advantage of me. 
Sister suggested I place a home on another part of my property. But, I would have to pay to have it cleared, septic tank installed, and power hookup. I don’t feel that is reasonable. Why would I do that when I’ve done so already? Not to mention, I literally do not have the money to do so. 
I suggested they move the mobile home to HER property and hookup to her power and septic which would cost considerably less than her suggestion to me and is legal in our county. 
I should’ve made her move the home before they even moved in as I was afraid something like this could happen. Hindsight is 20/20.
Honestly, I’m so ticked that neither of them give a damn about my current situation, I’m considering evicting them off my property if they haven’t moved in 6 months. Why should I continue to put mine and my children’s life on hold? I can’t stay here forever.",18Apr2020,1

I woke up this morning feeling worse than I have in years. Ive been checking my temperature consistently for the past few hours. I do definitely have a high fever. My breathing is shallow and my head is pounding. Maybe it’s also from all the crying. My partner who I live with it, is absolutely livid with me since he woke up and has randomly come to where I’m holed up to yell at me about trivial shit. I have yet to figure out why. First it was something not working on his laptop, so he accused me of snooping. Guys, I just don’t have the strength to go through it anymore. It’s a regular thing since we’ve been quarantined. I feel so sick but I can’t stop the fucking tears. My face burns every time the tears flow, everything is so sore. I have no friends here, my mother is 3000 miles away and I can’t harass her with my issues. She’ll worry and feel helpless and she’s already been through too much. I’ve never felt so alone in my life. I sat staring here at my phone contacts for 10 minutes. Frantically scrolling to find someone, anyone to call. Checked my last conversations on whatsapp and they’re all work. Nobody who I can just call and chat with. No one came to my mind. I wouldn’t even want to burden them with my problems. I never like to call and offload my issues on people. But I’m at the end of the rope here now guys. I don’t know how long I can take it anymore. I’m such a patient person, to a fault.

I get stressed when I can't remember the first time I saw a film or played a game. I know I played Skyrim before, and I can remember some details and the story comes back to me if I play it again or read about it, but otherwise it's a vague memory in my mind that happened at some point. I don't know when, where or how often I played it, only that 'I played it at least once before and can remember bits when prompted'

I often forget about people I met or things I did until reminded about it. I started a new job 8 months ago and anything from the past 8 months is kind of a blur in my mind with no definitive stand out moments to recall. I go on each day, sort of on auto pilot and will likely have forgotten the prior day by the next one.

Another example is not knowing when I first saw a film. I know I saw it, I remember bits of it, but I don't know when or where I first saw it.

650,"Nice housemate who has a stinky room. Not BO or anything—more of a dry/rotten/bitter smell. It's gross. Only in his room and only after he moved in. Strong enough that I can stand outside the room and smell it. Doesn't smell like a dead animal or mold or sewage.

The issue is not how to talk to him about it. We have already discussed it as adults and friends. The issue is how to help him **solve** the problem. He has already tried to clean his room, and that helped a little and not for long.

It's my house, and at the end of the day, I am concerned about a lingering gross smell and damage to my home. If he can't fix it, I would need to pay to have the room professionally cleaned and charge him for it—or worst-case scenario, kick him out. Not what I want to do! He's a good guy.

He does shower, does his laundry, washes his sheets, has a mattress pad, and generally doesn't seem like a gross guy. His room is not messy. He has no conditions that would keep him from being able to reach all areas of his body to clean thoroughly. 

My only guesses:

1. Maybe his personal hygiene is not as good as he thinks—not regular/thorough enough, not enough soap, cheap/bad soap, etc. Maybe not brushing teeth thoroughly or regularly?
2. Maybe he's not changing his towel / wash rag frequently enough.
3. Maybe his washing of his laundry is somehow not as thorough as he thinks it is—wrong water temp, cheap detergent.
4. Maybe he's forgetting to wash some items—like pajamas or loungewear.
5. Maybe he's wearing clothes too many times before washing.
6. Maybe he's not wearing underwear or not wearing socks with shoes.
7. Maybe he thinks he's cleaning his room sufficiently but isn't—not vacuuming everywhere, etc.
8. If it's none of these things, maybe there is some underlying health concern and he needs to see a doctor or dentist for an overall checkup.

652,"I’m a 20 year old guy with a lot of mental health issues, including mild autism. For some reason, I have been particularly interested in women’s bellies my entire life. I didn’t know why, but there was just something about a chubby/pregnant belly that was so interesting. When I was 12, I was also pretty lonely. I had little to no friends and I was just entering middle school. I was also entering puberty. I was on youtube when I discovered all these fetish videos of women rubbing their chubby/full/pregnant bellies. I would spend my nights browsing these videos. This was how I discovered vore. When I discovered it, I was so intrigued by the idea of a woman swallowing a person whole that I browsed videos of that too. On my 13th birthday, I discovered masturbation. The first videos I masturbated to were videos of women rubbing their pregnant/full bellies pretending that they ate someone. I haven’t been the same ever since.

I did masturbate to some normal stuff like the sports illustrated swimsuit edition, but nothing hit the spot quite like vore videos. I discovered deviantart and started masturbating to pictures of women swallowing people whole and digesting them. Some were drawings, some were animations, and some were pictures with captions. I eventually started masturbating to exclusively vore and belly stuff. This went on for almost 8 years.

A couple months ago, I somehow managed to get a girl to come over to my house to hang out. We made out, and eventually took things into the bedroom. As things started to heat up, I noticed a huge problem: I couldn’t get hard. I told her that a random hookup  wasn’t ideal for me. She took it well and eventually left. Ever since, I have told people on dating apps and irl that I was demisexual. Unfortunately, by masturbating to fetish stuff for all this time, I might have screwed up my libido so much that only belly stuff and vore can even get me hard.

I know that my secret will come out eventually. My mom and brothers already know about my fetishes. They thought it was disturbing, but at least they didn’t disown me or anything like that. Unfortunately, not everyone will be cool with my fetish for vore and bellies. In fact, the only people that would be cool with it would be the few thousand people who share my fetishes (apparently vore involving humans is pretty niche in the vore community, which is already rater niche). Also there is already such a big stigma associated with both autism and my fetishes. Imagine how people would react if they knew that I was an autistic man with a vore fetish. So I really have no choice but to either keep my fetish and be alone for the rest of my life or ditch my fetish in lieu of something more socially acceptable. Since the former is unacceptable, i’d like to go with the latter. How can I abandon my socially unacceptable vore fetish and develop more palatable kinks?

tldr: I developed a vore fetish that destroyed my libido and my social/sex life. How do I overcome it?",18Apr2020,0

This girl that I met 4 years ago moved &amp; now she’s single. We’ve always liked each other. We met in a hospital in late 2016. However, she had to move due to family reasons. She used to live 25 minutes away from me when we first met. But she was taken back then. Now it’s 100 miles from my place to her town. Neither of us have a car or drivers license.

657,"Long time lurker, first time poster. On mobile.

This is about women's health and menstruation. If this bothers you please dont read.

Important info: I (30) have 3 girls (12,8,3yrs)  and I have an alcoholic JNMIL who is a FB grandma. She has a pool the we only visit a few times during the summer. We live in a small community. Private or not, she is one to tell everyone's business. Family, neighbors, you get it. 


My MIL recently wanted to discuss a camping trip to the lake with me. The normal conversation turned into discussing my oldest daughter cycle. MiL suggested buying DD tampons to keep at her house and in her RV so she could participate in swimming activities. I politely declined and asked her if we could move the date of the trip so it wouldnt fall around my DD usual cycle. (There is no reason why the dates couldn't be moved a few days). Or I stated my daughter would just not swim (which is fine). I also let her know we most likely wouldnt visit her while DD was on her period. (She rarely wants us over, only to see her son or take pictures to post on facebook) She threw a fit, calling me names and saying I was ridiculous. I've already received lots of calls and texts about it. I dont want this to be an issue with my DD. My DD is not very close to her and is still a little shy when it comes to talking about this sort of thing. 


I have a very open relationship with my daughters. They understand the woman body and menstruation.  My oldest started her period for the first time in December of 2019, is fairly regular but very new to this. She also  feels comfortable talking with me about her cycle and hygiene but not so much others she's not close to.
 This will be her first summer having to deal with a period. I have supplied her with pads and wipes ect. but I am uncomfortable with her using tampons. Not only do I feel she is a bit young but we both have very heavy periods. She gets headaches and is often not in the mood to do anything. (Even fun things she will politely decline). Her periods are relatively short (3 or 4 days) so the doctor doesn't recommend any sort of treatment.

Honestly, I didnt use tampons until about 16. And I prefer not to because of how uncomfortable they are for me (plus I always leak). I feel she is too young and using them wouldnt really change the outcome. (Being able to swim or other activities). My DD is comfortable in her routine and hygiene and hasnt really expressed wanting to use them. (She knows they exists but I dont believe she knows how to use them) I should also mention we are slightly conservative and she has the mind of a 12yr old. (Shes a good kid who hangs out with good kids and thankfully doesnt try to act or seem older than she is)

As strange as this is I really would like others opinion and input. What age did you start using tampons? Would you allow your child? Should I continue doing what we are doing and wait until I feel she is old enough?  This is the first time I am doing with this as a mom and really would like others input. 


Thanks!

    Thanks for all of your advice! I will be talking to my daughter about all this soon and going over the pros/cons and responsibilities of using each option.

I started having chest pain, so I got tested the day after he got results and my test came back negative. I stayed in my room and had my parents drop off food to my room for a week. I started having a consistent low grade fever from 99.3 to 100.0 for 3 days and continued to have persistent tightness in my chest. So I got tested again at one of the rapid testing sites. And tested negative again?????

I think I am going to move back to my college apartment to live alone for two weeks (that’s when my lease expires). At what point should I assume I don’t have it? When is it safe to return to work? Or see my boyfriend that I haven’t seen in 2 months? My job is at a nursing home (so VERY high risk community) and my boyfriend’s parents are elder.

Also I might add, that the second testing site was HORRIBLE. They had everyone in close contact in a waiting room and people were coughing into the air into there masks (not sure how safe that is). I might even get it from that?",18Apr2020,1

668,"I started spending time with this girl in undergrad because we had all of our classes together. I always considered us to be more like ""school friends"" because we didn't spend any time together outside of homework &amp; didn't talk about anything else. After graduating two years ago, we both went on to grad school at schools across the country from eachother. We kept in touch the first year, just talking about school and adjusting to our new programs.

Now, I am definitely not perfect and I'm sure there are lots of people out there that don't like me. But omg this girl lol. She is just the complete opposite of anyone I would ever want to spend time with or talk to. We are completely different in our beliefs, humor, interests, literally everything. The only thing we ever had in common is school. It got to the point that I couldn't even stand talking to her about school so I tried to gradually end our ""friendship"" by not responding as much.

The thing is, in her eyes she sees us as being best friends. She will not take a hint and give up on this. I feel like I'm in a long distance relationship that I never asked for. If I don't respond to her texts immediately she'll call multiple times and leave voicemails. I don't think this thing is going to fizzle out on its own the way I hoped.

Even though I don't want to talk to her regularly, I don't want to have a big blow up to end things. First of all, it would be nice to have her as a professional contact in the future since that is the thing we've bonded over the past three years. But also, I don't even know what I would say to get rid of her. Literally the only reason I have is that I don't like her or her personality. You can't really just tell someone that and have no other reasoning.

She's probably the most dramatic person I've ever encountered so if I was direct about ending our relationship it would not go well. Idk I just don't know what to do. I don't know how it got to the point where she thinks we're going to spend our lives together as best friends after we graduate, and I can't even stand to see her name show up on my phone.

Any advice?",18Apr2020,1

670,"I know the title is rough, but this is what I’m going through: since I was ~15 (mid 20s now) my parents have gotten me gifts that I do not understand. They’re way off Mark, as in they get me things that clutter my room (like an action figure snow globe and a lamp from Harry Potter) or things that better match my siblings. It really throws me for a loop, because My siblings get such nice neutral things that I wish I’d get what they do. They know I love (live) plants... and proceeded to get me a neon green fake plant and I just don’t get it.

I do not have a good poker face when I get gifts I don’t like, so I know my face tells it all. I try to put on a brave face and say thank you, but my family always chalks it up to me being selfish and not appreciative. 

The lamp previously mentioned just came in the mail for my birthday.... and now I’m depressed. I do well enough that everything I could want I save and buy for myself. So at this point, I’m getting gifts that maybe my older sister should be getting and it hurts to deal with this constantly, I’d rather 100% they donate the money or literally do anything else useful with it. Idk why they are always ok with buying gifts I don’t ask for and are way out of the ballpark for what I want now or in the future. I do know they are coming from a spot of 10 years ago when I loved Harry Potter and I appreciate the memory, but i do not need a giant lamp or any of the other expensive kitschy gifts I’ve received.

TLDR: I know I’m whining and I love my family, I appreciate the gifts. I just do not need this anymore in my life, the lamp was pricey and I just am over the waste, the money could go to something better like being donated. Any advice on how to break this to them?",18Apr2020,1

The following is subjective, but I think having sex or jacking off is unhealthy for a person's psyche and rewires their brain to prioritize the short term over discipline. I understand if you disagree with me though.

I recently became single and decided that instead of pursuing tinder sex like I did before this relationship I would practice abstinence (and nofap). I, however, having been jacking off or having sex (more jacking off) basically for years nonstop. I so far have gone about 2 or 3 days without having an orgasm and the pressure is building up.

What are some ways I can prevent myself from trying to have sex? I am disappointed in myself, as I already tried flirting with some girls from high school that I knew were easy, one of which had a boyfriend.

682,"I (20M) like a lot of other people have been displaced from my college campus and am now back home and it's tough to say the least. 

My parents are on the brink of divorce so things are tense in the house. My mother seldom leaves her room and my father occupies the entirety of the lower level. As for my relationship with him, its never been a good one.

Growing up, he was an absent parent. Initially, it was because of financial issues and then health issues, but we eventually got our feet under us again when I was around 6. After that he really had no excuse-- he would come home from work around 5:30 and would sit around watching TV or playing clash of clans and if one disturbed him he would lash out with shouting. He put food on the table for me and I know I should be grateful for that because not a lot of people even have that, but does that entitle him to his definition of ""respect""? 

For reference, his definition is to do what you are told to do and forbid the possibility of a unique thought or opinion, and in general, he has no regard for other people's thoughts. He's a person that thinks he knows everything and as a result, he jumps to his own conclusions about what someone is saying to him before they finish their sentence. He's an extremely manipulative personality and ""plays victim"" so that others will feed his ego by telling him he's always right. He has an extremely ""fixed mindset"" and it's sad to see because I know he could achieve so much more if he humbled himself and embraced a growth mindset, but I know this is a lot to ask of him. 

Anyway, it was my birthday a couple of weeks ago and my girlfriend had come over to celebrate. We were eating cake when he started bombarding her with really intense questions like: ""do you pray with your family every night?"",""why do you pray with them?"", ""do you believe in god"", ""what does religion mean to you?"" 

She was visibly uncomfortable because she understands who he is and didn't want him to judge her on her responses and was looking at me desperate for help. So I told her, ""you really don't have to answer him if you're not comfortable."" I then requested him, ""please stop barraging her with such loaded questions, you can see how visibly uncomfortable she is.""

He lost it and came back with ""don't disrespect me like that in front of her."" I didn't respond to what he said because of how absurd I felt it was plus my mother had just suggested we go upstairs so we walked away from the conversation. My girlfriend said she'd rather just leave so I walked her out and headed back to my room. Needless to say, he came banging on my door, aggressively demanding I respect him in his own house, which I really didn't feel what I said was disrespectful. So I tried staying calm but I lost it when he brought up my school saying, "" you think that because you go to Georgia Tech you mean something?"" I have worked my ass off to get to this school, and I know it comes from him being insecure about the fact that he got rejected from the school when he applied several years ago. So after some shouting back and forth, he ended the conversation with ""you have lost me as a father"" and as much as I wanted to say ""good, not like you were one in the first place"", I held my tongue because I knew it would just make things worse. I want to say that I think he's just extremely insecure about me because my school has put me on the trajectory he wanted for himself and he's watching my successes while belittling himself as being just an uber driver. On top of all that he's not on speaking terms with my mother and has no work right now because of Corona. 

I haven't spoken to him since and have found a place near campus and plan to live there for the summer semester. I'll be able to get by this summer on scholarship money, but I am worried about my next few semesters because I lost my internship to corona and my father had been paying my expenses up to this point. (granted my total cost is only around a few hundred, but each time I needed to ask for money I was terrified by what I would have to listen to just to get it).

I just don't know, am I crazy for thinking that even though he's my father, he doesn't deserve the respect he demands because he doesn't respect others?? Should I even say anything to him before leaving? Is there anything I can do?

I'm faced with making a huge life decision by May 1st, and I am on the fence on which direction I want to go. I little about myself: I am a 20-year-old male, and I am currently an athlete for a major university, and I am about to wrap up my second year. I plan on finishing my undergrad next May next year, so this upcoming season will likely be my last. After graduation, I plan on fulfilling my life goal of becoming a commissioned officer in the military. I am not too picky on the branch or what specialty, however, I would love to fly (not a big deal if aviation isn't in my cards though).

I recently earned an appointment to a service academy, meaning two things if I choose to accept: I will have to restart my undergrad and spend 4 demanding years there, and I will likely retire from my sport. This will essentially get my foot in the door for accomplishing my life dream.

However, jumping on this opportunity has been hard for me. I love playing my sport (even though I technically haven't played in an actual game yet) , and the bonds I've made with my teammates have been amazing. I know I can accomplish my life goal through OCS (which is for aspiring officers who already have a degree but did not attend an academy or ROTC), but gaining acceptance can be tricky and very competitive year to year. There is no saying what the future looks like for military entrance for officership or even enlistment.

692,"My roommate and I started smoking cigarettes around the same time last year.  He had had a Juul addiction over the summer that he had gotten over.  On his 21st birthday in October we bought a bottle of booze and a pack of cigarettes each as way of celebration.  (Where we live the age to buy tobacco is 21).  He and I each smoked about 3 packs during the month of October, and each decided after a weird acid trip where we both smoked a whole pack in about 4 hours that it was time to quit.  I quit with no problems (my problems are more booze and weed) but he kept going.  

By the time January came around he was up to 3 to 4 packs a week.  He is on a limited budget and spent more on cigarettes than food by a wide margin.  This continued to get worse, and my other roommates and I all began to encourage him to quit.  He and I even bought pipes, my hope being he would switch to smoking the pipe and want to smoke less.  This is a silly idea, I know, but I'm a silly person.  My other roommate, who has been sober from drinking and smoking for over a year now, even had a heart to heart with him.  The addicted roommate suffers heavily from depression and I think that he views the cigarettes as a way to keep himself down.  A form of self hate, or something like that.  That's what I've been able to glean from a few conversations at least.  He has always had an addictive and self destructive personality.  He used to black out every time he drank, growing up he was addicted to street fights, if he plays a video game he begins to hate it and treat it like a job playing hours and hours a day screaming at the tv.

Eventually we thought we had gotten through with him and things were looking more positive.  During another acid trip he told me he had smoked his last cigarette and would never smoke again.  I had him do a pinkie promise, which I know may seem like a childish gimmick but is something I take dead serious.  He started a relationship with a girl and his health took a turn for the worse, but he recovered.  This all cemented the no smoking thing and over a month passed.  

Cut to two weeks ago.  The roommate decides to break up with this girl, a first for him.  We all help him as much as we can but he leaves the situation very hurt, goes for a walk, and comes back with a pack of cigarettes.  I wanted so badly to scold him, this broke our trust and it felt like him taking advantage of the situation to smoke again without guilt.  Now, two weeks later, he's on his third pack and smoking regularly again.

I'm ready to give up on this.  I felt in part responsible for the longest time and still kind of do.  I've tried my best, and with each opportunity he has made it clear that he does not want to quit.  He wants to self destruct.  I just don't know what to do anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR  my roommate got addicted to cigarettes some time last year when we both bought a pack together.  After many failed attempts to get him to quit he has shown he doesn't at all want to, and that the reason he smokes is because he is self destructive.  I am at a loss for what to do.",18Apr2020,1

699,"I made a throw away account for this because this is all so personal. 

I got laid off in mid March due to Covid-19. I worked part time in a place that was connected with Wisconsin schools. So, when the schools shut down for the rest of the year, I was out of a job until August. I was denied for unemployment because I did not make enough money. So the next logical decision was to look for another job, which I did. I got hired a few days ago as a cashier for a small chain store (they have 8 stores total in the area). I had my first orientation and paid training day yesterday and my first real day of work starts Monday.

I have always had severe anxiety and depression (been on meds since I was a small child, I’m 26 now). Obviously starting a new job is anxiety and stress producing for everyone, but when I came home from my first day I was in an awful place of mind. I felt like I would rather die than go back to work the following week. I’ve always had trouble doing things in the past, going to school or work, so I’m used to the severe dread that comes with living day-to-day life. But right now the feeling is so strong, maybe stronger than it has ever been. If someone told me today I could either go to work right now or take a pill that would kill me instantly, I would probably choose the later. In reality I won’t actually do anything to hurt myself, I’m more scared of permanently making myself disabled with an attempt, so I’m not actually suicidal. Just in case anyone is worried, I’ve lived with thoughts like this my whole life, and I’ve never tried to hurt myself, and I’m **NOT** going to ever. I’m just trying to express how awful I feel.

Also, the store is not a bad place to work or anything. The other workers are really nice, and I had no bad experiences with customers. I know logically it makes no sense that I would dread going to work there so much, but no matter how many times I tell myself that, my feelings don’t change. 

I live with one of my siblings and I have savings that could theoretically get me through a couple months of not working. But me and my sibling have been trying really hard to save up to move out of our crappy apartment and into a house, so my using up my savings that is supposed to go towards that isn’t ideal. 

I don’t know what to do. Should I quit the job I was just hired for and try to focus on getting better mentally (or look for another job)? Or should I try to force past my dread and stick it out and see if the feeling gets better? When I talked with my parents, my Dad says to quit because my mental health is more important, my Mom says I can push through and force myself to grin and bear it at least for a few weeks. 

Reading back through what I just wrote, I don’t think I’ve accurately described the state of mind I’m in. I’m still not sure how to. But basically I feel like I’m about to shut down, which means I practically go comatose: curled up in a ball in my room, can’t answer phone, look at email, eat very much, talk to anyone, I’d just sit there and cry and sleep.

I think that incorporating masks can be very beneficial, especially in this day and age. That doesn’t stop my fear from disappearing though. I remember when COVID was just beginning to trickle here, I went to grocery store amid panic. People were sporting gloves, they had wet wipes for their carts, but most importantly a large majority of them had masks. Internally I was terrified. I suddenly started to tremble, I was grinding my teeth, I couldn’t look anyone in the face. I refuse to go to the grocery store now. I’m terrified, and for the stupidest reasons. I can’t help but despise this fear. I know masks are beneficial to the community, but apart of me can’t help but be scared. This fear is admittedly very childish and silly, but I can’t seem to snap out of it. 

Does anyone have any advice for getting rid of this?",18Apr2020,8

707,"Hello reddit, I'm fairly new here and on mobile, so apologies for any mistakes, I wasnt sure where this belongs so if it should go somewhere else, please say :) I also dont know if followed all the rules correctly, sorry.

As you can see, I'm 17, and originally I was going to move out after college for uni at 18. But I've decided to restart college next year as im kinda failing as things are, meaning I would move out at 19.

So I wanted to get this off my chest because in nit sure what I should do. I have been given the opportunity to move out and live with a friend and their family up north. I really wanna go because it'll be a great opportunity for me, but my mum doesn't want me to go. I've thought of reasons for me to go and have most of what I'm going to say planned out, apart from my last argument,

(before I go on, I just want to give a trigger warning, as I'll be talking about being a victim of child abuse by the hand of my older brother)

With that out there, when we were younger, my brother took taekwondo and used his strength as an advantage over me, he was and still is a lot stronger than me, and hated me to the point that he would verbally and physically hurt me, weather it be calling me fat, ugly, stupid, etc. or punching me when we met on the stairs and generally hitting and kicking me. Not to mention how he would try to drown me whenever we went swimming (I'm not exaggerating, he would hold me under water and not let me resurface until I would kick and scratch at him). Things aren't as bad nowadays, but I'm still traumatised by the years of abuse, as I still flinch whenever someone raises their hand to high five me.

The reason why I'm most scared about bringing this up with my mum as a reason to go is that I feel she wont believe me, as she would always let it slide in the past, saying things like 'boys will be boys' or 'oh he's just a kid, he'll learn', which really isn't what a child needs to hear from their parent. It teaches the kid that this behaviour is okay is I thought it was normal sibling behaviour for a very long time, until my older sister (who couldn't do anything fo help me bc mum wouldn't listen to her about it either) told me that it was actual abuse. 

I wanted to get advice on how to approach this subject because I dont know how to do it, please help.

While I wasn’t exactly shocked at the video because I’ve seen so much of it before, in addition to my friend linking the video he said, “This is wild. I might have to make a TikTok now”.

I was fuming with anger the moment I read that. In theory, if I posted a gaming video and said “I might have to get into this game now” that suggests that I like what I see and I want to engage in it. Posting that video and saying “I might have to make a TikTok now” engages that he also likes what he sees. Which angers me, because he knows that he has a friend in the group chat who’s black and doesn’t tolerate that sort of stuff.

The worst part about all of it is that he has done this sort of thing before - see someone say the N word on Twitch and say “I love Twitch!” or defend Pewdiepie saying N word by saying “It’s just a word that everyone says.”

The question is what do I do...?

I’ve taken the first step by leaving that group chat but I have a personal chat with him and a few other people and for some reason I am just afraid and so hesitant of leaving and being called over dramatic without explaining why or being vocal even though this is entirely reasonable.

714,"A little bit of context: I was in a really financially hard-up situation a few months back, and confided in a friend about my struggles. I had bills to pay and debt collectors mailing me every week. I recently applied for universal credit (jobseeker's allowance) whilst I look for work, but just launched a successful project that earned me a small, one-off profit.

So, when I first confided in him about struggling to afford food and rent, he wired me some money to help out. It was a decently substantial amount - not a massive amount, but enough to make a difference, so I immediately (and persistently) insisted that I send it back to him. I asked for his bank details countless times to no avail, with him constantly reassuring me that the money is mine and that I don't owe him a penny. I eventually caved, expressed my immense gratitude, and agreed to accept the money, which for me, is a big deal (I'm terrible at accepting help financially).

Since then I've used the money incredibly carefully. I've spent it minimally, and on nothing other than food and bills. I have offered several times to pay it back once I find a job, and each time have been reassured each time that it was a gift, a favour, and that I did not need to pay it back.

Last night we ended up having an argument over something I regarded really mundane. Basically, I've had a rough few days and been struggling with my depression, so my replies have been really minimal, but I explained this and was again, reassured that I didn't need to reply. Anyway, he sort of changed his mind and got annoyed at me for not replying, and he started to say some really hurtful things that indicated a little resentment towards me. I figured there was something deeper, and I tried to explain myself as well as acknowledge his side of things.

This morning I woke up to a message asking for the money back. Upon instinct I agreed, but now I'm having second thoughts. The entire profit of my recent project (that took over a month to orchestrate) and my first universal credit payment will just about cover it, leaving me very little to spare to survive, and in the same position I initally was, just after things were getting off the ground for me. Given that he insisted so many times that it was a gift and I worked out my budgets with the remaining amount, is it unfair of him to ask for the money back? You wouldn't ask for a gift back after an argument, so is should I comply?

TL;DR - friend gave me money to help out my financial situation expecting nothing back at any point, but after an argument wants it back.",18Apr2020,1

719,"Last year, my little brother (17), K, really hit it off with a girl, Jamie, that he met on a shared interest’s discord server. They were friends for a while before starting a long-distance relationship just this January.

My brother really loves this girl and I know how much their relationship means to him since she’s one of his biggest supporters since he started transitioning (K’s a trans man) - besides me and our other brothers, of course.

So he’s been understandably devastated since she stopped responding to any of his messages to her around the end of Feb.

At first I was assuring him that she was fine and that she’s probably just busy since she’s an essential (retail) worker, but it’s been over a month and K still hasn’t heard anything back. If anything, everything’s been getting worse because he just found out that Jamie’s insta (where they usually chat) is now deactivated.

To be honest, something’s felt off to me for a while now and I can’t help but wonder if K just got ghosted. When I asked if he was friends with her on Facebook or anywhere else he can try to contact her, he told me they decided not to add each other for fear that both of their parents would find out about them and split them up. And when I asked about mutual friends, he told me he can’t get a hold of them either.

It just doesn’t ring right to me that you would let your S/O hang like this, especially during such a big crisis, without letting them know that you’re okay.

There’s the off chance that Jamie’s parents *did* find out about them and cut off all contact but, either way, this is destroying my brother and I have no idea how to help him through this mess of a first relationship. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",18Apr2020,1
720," Before you beat me up, I applied for 150 jobs over the past 2 months and I wasn't getting anywhere. I have 8 years of experience in sales but I'm trying to transition into another industry. I wasn't getting any call backs, just a slew of auto-reject responses. In a fit of frustration I made up two resumes and used them for all my job applications. One was dumbed down: erasing all my accomplishments, my college degree, anything that made me look good or experienced. The other I added a graduate degree from an international university, a degree that I do not possess.

The dumbed down resume has gotten me one job offer, contingent on passing a background check and security clearance, as well as a final interview for another job coming up this week. Today I got an email request to set up an interview for a job I applied for with the advanced degree resume.

I know lying on your resume is bad. And I honestly didn't think anyone was going to respond anyway (which made me feel good knowing that maybe my lack of responses wasn't really my fault).

723,"I live with my grandparents and three uncles, one of which has intense intense schizophrenia. He is given heavy medication for it, but one of my other uncles pays him for those meds in weed, so it's basically untreated.

A few weeks ago, I was smoking outside and he came out to show me that he was sharpening up a piece of metal to stick on the end of his protective arrows for his crossbow so he could have an actual weapon and it freaked me out.

At least once a week, he has insane outbursts. He punched a hole through the bathroom divider wall two weeks ago and he has threatened all of our lives many many times. Both me and my two other uncles have told my grandmother countless times that he needs to go into an institution because he threatened her life so many times, is destroying the house, and will not take his medication. She insists that she can't do that to her own son.

I have my cat walled off in my section of the house because my uncles' rooms are hoarder messes and when I lose her in there, it takes hours to find her. I went to go search my schizophrenic uncle's room and I found two hidden loaded guns.

He doesn't have a gun license. I have no idea where he got them. One of them looks like a glock (i'm not good with guns at all, they make me uncomfortable) and the other was a revolver. I called my mom and asked her what to do and she was like ""You know there's nothing we can do about him"".

I feel like I'm in danger. I want to call the police, but I don't want them to get my grandmother in trouble because it is her property so idk how it works and if they'll involve her since none of us have any stake in the land. Plus, if they search one of the barns outside, they'll find one of my uncle's collection of pot plants and I know he wouldn't own up to it and pass it off to one of us.

So earlier today, my mother just screamed at me for not going to bed yet (yes, yelling at her 26 year old son to go to bed). I was on discord with some of my frens and they heard it too. She yelled something n slammed the door really hard. I know its late, its 3 am but thats the same time i went to bed last night n she didnt make a fuss over it then. Her reason behind this is so i dont fall sick from sleeping too late. But whatever, i sleep late and i wake up late to make sure i get about the right amount of sleep. I feel like ever since this whole covid 19 thing she has been on edge all the time. But she doesnt seem to bother my sister all that much though. Feels like its aimed more at me and i spend most of my time in my room.

Just the other day she screamed at me for washing my hands n while washing, the water from my hands fell on a jug that was in the sink. She said she wanted to use it. Its getting ridiculous. I cant talk to her that well cuz she only listens to what she wants. She has limited understanding of english as well and is just not a very bright person (not being mean, but she needs our help to fill forms and stuff. Im not sure hw shes even made it this far raising us). There are some other examples of this crazy behaviour but i guess this should be good enuf to describe the situation.

I've offered to help prepare food before but she says she doesnt need the help. One time she complained when my brother came to visit that we (me and sister) never help cook, i got mad and defended my self and she gestured at my sister as if to shift the blame specifically to her (shes still going easy on my sister tho, she just blames people). Then the following day i ask if she needed help in the kitchen again and she said she didnt need any help. I water the plants when she tells me to, so i dunno, i really dont get her crazy behaviour. I know shes worried about the virus, but her understanding of it is just insane. To the point we gotta take extra measures which are pointless.

Dad is pretty much out of the picture so cant really get help from him.

731,"So I've been at odds with this idea for a bit now and I don't know if I should transfer colleges or not. I'm majoring in Theatre, minor in political science and I have no trouble keeping my grades up and everything good to go. I absolutely LOVE my professors, they're the absolute best and I've had sit down meetings with a few to discuss this manner but the answer is always the same ""it's up to me""which I agree with, but they don't offer advice past that.
The issue is the people I'm around. Everyone I interact with in the theatre program, I feel, is living this dual style life of drama (ironic ik) and necessity. There is always some new rumor being spread and no one has my back because if you're not friends with this select group, you're out. And you can be demonized for the dumbest reasons and I got sick of it, so I called out the pettiness and stupidity and had a few people back me up. A week later, suddenly everyone agrees but doesn't do a damn thing to change, ostracizing me and threatening to do so to anyone who backs me up. This means, if given the power, I won't be selected for shows, tech roles, placements in class, among other things and quite frankly im sick of it.
However. I do love my professors, as I said, and could see a lot of advancement here moving from college to the professional world as my professors have a lot of really good connections, and I am in good graces with a majority of them. It's actually how I got my current (former due to covid) job where I could manifest a solid and enjoyable career. 
So I don't know whether to risk it and transfer: going into a new school, completely new set of people who've already had a couple years to get to know each other and same with the professors OR sticking it out, sucking it up, and hoping things change in my current situation.

748,"I am the only neat freak in my family and everyone else is a slob. (I am a 21yr old girl)

It used to be only my dad and I but now with quarantine happening, my brother (17) lives with us now and sometimes my sister (23) comes to stay too. 

They are ALL SLOBS. They never clean, never pick up after themselves, and if they do it is very minimal. I have to clean EVERYTHING on my own. 

The other day I wanted to do a full deep clean of my house and it took me 8+ full hours because everyone else was just watching tv doing nothing. Just being lazy as I try to make our home clean. 

Now the thing is, I’m not close to my family. I can’t be like “my feelings are hurt you guys don’t do anything around the house” because they don’t care. I have told them millions of times to just clean and put away the stuff they use but they couldn’t care less. And they say things like “if it bothers you, then you clean it. BUT WHY DO I HAVE TO CLEAN UP AFTER THEM EVERY DAY? Am I a maid?? That’s how I feel. 

I took a strike 3 days ago to not clean or touch anything that I didn’t do, and it’s just disgusting. I can barley stand to look at the kitchen. It’s making me go crazy but I don’t want to clean it because I’m sick and tired of spending hours of my day cleaning up after them because even if I do clean once, they go and make another mess a couple hours later. ESPECIALLY in the kitchen.

My question is, how do I deal with this? My family couldn’t care less about my feelings or if the house is nice and clean. Am I just a forever maid until I move out?",18Apr2020,1
750,"So there's this girl. In the back of my head for awhile I've liked her; I just kind of stuffed it away though because I figured it's impossible. She's my best friend.

I started dating another girl. I really loved her and she  broke my heart this week, badly. I feel empty inside.

When she broke up with me I called l my best friend and I cried in her arms. She's always been there for me, when I was dating my ex if my ex didnt hear about a problem I had my best friend did.

Obviously I dont want to act on these feelings now. It's not good for me and would be unfair to her because, naturally, my feelings for me ex are still there. Those take time to go away.

I'm just confused. I know I love her, we tell each other we love each other - in a platonic sense. There's this little voice though, that's saying things like ""hey man, you might have romantic feelings"". I'm a guy so I'm not great at signs, but I feel like there's something mutual. I just dont know if it's my mind playing tricks though.

753,"How does one repair that connection and flirty fun and affection, kissing, touching, cuddling. 

Sure we have sex 3-4 times a month sometimes a couple times a week but outside of that there’s zero to negative huffing, kissing, touching, etc. I (m) always try to initiate it with my partner (f) but she brushes it off, pushes me away, gets angry about it. Like me grabbing her butt or lightly slapping it bothers her. If I try to kiss her it’s like a battle, or gotta ask for it ... like it’s a chore. 

I still have attraction and desires and a high sex drive and even with that she’s not much into oral, it’s just regular sex and that’s it. Maybe cuddle in bed sometimes but even with that she always thinks I’m trying for more so it’s like touching or rubbing or anything else she gets mad or upset about, definitely no kissing or making out just for the hell of it.

Sure we watch shows together, hang out, etc but the conversations aren’t really there.. we seem to be on different waves in life or just about different things. Even when I try to give her advice or any feedback or criticism I’m lashed out at or have something thrown in my face I’ve done 7 months ago or whatever. 

I’m trying to do all I can but now it’s come to a point where I’m getting tired of it but I don’t want to end it or leave there’s too much else involved. I just want that connection back and spark and affection outside of just those sexual moments. 

It’s like everything is a fight or argument even over the smallest things and so usually I’m just quiet and silent until there’s something that does require talking. Frustrations are building with both of us I’m sure but I don’t want it to end at this time. I’m just tired.",18Apr2020,1

It’s not even really a conversation and I’m not a big fan of small talk. Am I wrong here? I think she maybe calling me too much.

762,"So I just killed like 20 baby spiders in a row in my bedroom (they were all so tiny you could barely see them). Most of them were just hanging in the air, and most of them were also in the same part of my bedroom. 

I looked around but didn't really find a nest, but it might be hidden in the walls. Right now it's 10:30 PM and my bedroom is only 2x3 meter, if I still want to sleep here it might be too late today to gas the entire room with poison. I won't be able to air it out either because if I open the window even more spiders might come in from outside. 

Should I just spray poison in the entire room tomorrow and ""hope"" that that kills them all? Should I call in an actual insect repeller person to have him check my bedroom? Maybe I could only spray that one corner of my room before sleep but I'm scared that won't 100000% guaranteed kill all of them and that they might just crawl out of range of the poison.

763,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons. I would also like to apologise for the length of this post but I'm really desperate.

I should start by saying that I'm a 21 yo gay male. I never had many male friends, but one year ago I became friends with, whom at the time I thought was straight male. Our friendship quickly escalated and we were hanging out very often and talking on social media most of time. He knew I was gay from the beginning and never had any problems with it. As I already said I had absolutely no reason to believe that he was anything but 100% straight. He was straight acting and had girlfriends in the past. Everything changed about 5 months ago though. We were on a short road trip (road trips happened quite often in our friendship) and we were talking about our past relationships. He had a lot more to say than me (since I was single for most of my life, and even that one ''relationship'' I had can't really be called a relationship, but I digress). At the end of our talk he said something that completely shocked me. He said: You know, I'm not 100% straight either. At first I thought he was joking and just laughed at it, but after I saw he was actually serious I decided to listen to him. He said that while he most definitely isn't gay, he might be just a ''lil' bit bi''. I asked him why he thinks that and he said that there were guys in the past (especially instagram fitness models) that he thought looked good, but that he would NEVER do anything with a guy. He explicitly told me that I'm the only person that knows this and that I mustn't tell anyone because his parents and most of his other friends are extremely homophobic - and to this day I haven't told anyone nor do I intent to. I didn't really know how to react so I just said to him that I fully accept him and that if he ever needs someone to talk to I'm always here for him.

Over the following months more and more of our talks became centred about homosexuality. I have to say that he is quite good looking and now that I knew he's on the spectrum I couldn't help myself and I slowly developed a crush on him. Since our friendship was always so sincere I actually told him that and he said that while he appreciates me being honest with him he still stands by what he said - to never have anything with another guy. I fully accepted that but our talks about homosexuality and later homosexual sex continued.

At one point I said to him (and now I regret that) that if he ever wanted to try something with a guy, maybe just to see how it is and satisfy his curiosity, I would be up for it. At first he was against it, but a couple of days later he contacted me and said that he has thought about it and that he might be up for me giving him a blowjob, but only if I could give him some money. He said that he couldn't live with himself if he accepted a blowjob from another guy without money, because with money he could at least say to himself ''I did it to improve my financial situation and not because I actually wanted it''. At this point I should probably say that my family is quite rich and he knew that but I want to clarify that I know that he didn't try to exploit me, because he isn't poor himself. Despite that, the amount of money he requested was extremely high and I'm not going to tell the exact amount, all I will say is that it was quite a lot higher than just a couple of hundred dollars. I agreed to it and we set up the date. I had the money and we did the act. I gave him a blowjob and he said that he quite enjoyed it, but that he feels like shit and that this just isn't him and that he never wants to repeat it again - but that he is thankful nevertheless, for me giving him the money and  helping him clarify things for himself. We never spoke of it again until a few weeks ago when he said that he actually couldn't sleep for a few nights after we did this because he felt so bad and so ''not like him''. I said that I understand and that if he wants we can never talk about it again.

Fast forward to a few days ago. We were on a road trip inside our municipality (corona stuff :/) and I kind of asked him if he would maybe like to repeat the blowjob act (right now I regret this so much and if I could live again I would've NEVER done it). I actually enjoyed it very much and thought what harm can asking him do - if he had said no i would have stopped right there and than...but to my surprise he said yes, but again for money. Again, I will not say the exact amount, but it was higher than the first time but not too high for me to decline simply because of that. So we decided to do it today. We met up at my place and just did the blowjob again. At the end of it he looked a bit depressed so I asked him if he's okay. He said that while it was physically very pleasing and that he enjoyed it very much; mentally he wanted to kill himself because that was so not him. That really worried me, because I knew that he had some other mental problems from before (he even visited therapist a couple of times because of that) and he had quite an extensive history of self harm. We did watch a movie afterwards and ordered a pizza and we had an amazing time, he laughed and as I drove him back to his home he looked very happy and not at all depressed, but because I know that he is very good with repressing his thoughts and emotions I'm extremely worried that the act we did today might be the tipping point for him and he might actually do something really bad to him.

A few other things I feel like I should point out:

* we are both closeted to our family. While I'm completely out to most of my friends my parents know absolutely nothing about it. I'm quite lucky that it's not immediately obvious that I'm gay so I managed to keep it from my parents for all 21 years of my life and I do not intend to change that any time soon, since my parents are also extremely conservative and therefore homophobic. On the other hand, not only is he closeted to his family, he is also closeted to everyone besides me (as mentioned before)
* absolutely everything we did was 100% CONSENSUAL. Both times we did something I always asked him if he's 100% comfortable, doesn't feel forced and if he actually wants it (regardless of money). Both times he said that he knows what he's getting into and that he doesn't feel forced at all
* the reason I said that I know he didn't try to exploit me is because if he actually intended to exploit me he could have done so MANY times before. I had a car way before he did and also offered him rides, but he always declined - insisting that he doesn't want to be a burden. Every time I offered to pay for a drink he always said no and even if I did he ALWAYS returned me the money (even if I didn't want to accept it). Also, one time (at the very beginning of our friendship) his family was doing quite bad financially and since he was paying for his university in instalments I offered to pay for one of his instalments and he could return me the money whenever he could (that was a friendly gesture since I'm aware of my privileged position, and NOTHING more) and he declined even that - despite the fact that he might have had problems with his university. 
* outside of those two times we had an amazing friendship that I wouldn't change it for anything in the world and I'm extremely grateful for it.
* I already decided for myself that after this time I'm done with doing anything else than just being friend with him, not only because of me (every time we did this I developed some feelings) but also because of his well being and will NEVER agree to another such ''deal''

My question to y'all now is...do you think that I'm overreacting and that he just said that he wanted to kill himself because he was just in a very hard moment emotionally - maybe questioning himself if he actually is ''only a lil' bit bi'' or that there is actually a chance that he might hurt himself. And also how should I approach our friendship from now on. Should I give him a couple of days (weeks?) of space and maybe even wait for him to contact me or should I be the one to initiate the conversation? What should I do and how should I approach this situation,

Thanks to everyone who actually read the entire thing, I'm literally shaking right now because of how worried I am for him and blaming myself that I might be the reason for him not doing well mentally...and advice would be extremely appreciated.",18Apr2020,2
764,"Yesterday was supposed to be the day of my schools prom. The day I told this girl how I’ve felt for almost a year now, and of course, a day that got canceled. It was a day that got canceled before I even got a chance to ask her, but since I come from a small school, and have a small senior class, I decided to drive to all 8 of my friends houses yesterday and just drop off a gift of some kind that I thought that person would smile at. I went to her house last, and she was waiting for me outside, the moment I got there (although she had asked me if I could drop it off, because she was out of the house when I was first heading over. I told her it’s not exactly that kind of delivery, so she came home.) I came out of my car with flowers, as well as a small piece of paper that had our formals theme on it. She was already in shock by this, and to make matters even weirder, I opened the trunk to my car, and showed her the poster I had made for her long before we knew formal would’ve been canceled. After she overcame how weird she found this situation, as well as the shock, she started getting really sad that our formal was canceled, and started just hugging me a bunch. She said she was both really happy and really sad we had to do it this way, because it really fit the weirdness of our friendship, but at the same time, I wanted to go to prom with her, and she told me she definitely would’ve wanted to go with me, too. I’m sure she appreciated the whole gesture in the moment, but I’m a huge over thinker, and she has super complicated emotions; perfect combo, right!? I’m just worried that now that she’s had a chance to sleep on it, she may look back on it and find it more weird then she does sweet. I hope this isn’t the case, but it feels likely. Like I said, yesterday she had a purely positive response to everything I said, but she only reached out to me right after I left to get all the pictures we took, and now I’m just wondering if I should reach out to her, again. If I do, I have a few more things I want to tell her (not how I feel about her yet, tho, saving that for after quarantine finishes) but I don’t know if she’s ready to give me that opportunity yet. We ended everything by me telling her I missed her, and her saying she’s super excited for quarantine to end so we can start hanging out again...Idk why I’m so worried to continue from here. Maybe it’s because yesterday was so positive and I’m worried today just won’t be, no matter what I do or say. I do really like her, and really do want to try and build something with her, but I know I can’t be pushy with her, either. I guess from an outsiders point of view...Do y’all think I should wait for her to call me, or should I reach out to her, at this point?",18Apr2020,1
765,"hi reddit. I think my ex is probably stalking me... but I’m unsure. We dated for 6m and broke up because he was still hooked on his ex, flirted with other people etc... I mean it was a mess and I was stupid. We cut contact off and once I started dating my current boyfriend my ex stated to come about. My boyfriend and my ex are “friends” as in they knew each other in high school and hung out not v much. Anyway, i decided to block him on everything because he started creeping me out (my ex) , he’s in the military, he sent me a letter at first which was a response to an old letter I had sent him because he actually came back to town and was looking forward to seeing me at an event but I didn’t go, and his friends told me how upset he seemed about it ... so I told my boyfriend about it and he thought it was okay to send a “hey hope youre alright:)” letter, kept it short, and we didn’t think much of it. His letter was just about his experience in the military, he eventually ended it with a “I have other things to tell you , but I would rather you text me” which from what my bf and I concluded it involved feelings but I don’t have the letter w me that was about 5 months ago, and from there he started to pop up more and more into my life. He hung out with my boyfriend and couldn’t for the life of him stop talking about me, tried a bunch of times to “jokingly” take my bf phone whenever he saw him texting (which was me lol), and at one point of the night one of the other dudes got so annoyed with My ex that they said in a “jokingly” way “yeah that’s why X (my current bf) is f*cking M (me)” to which he actually parked the car and for a hot minute seemed like he was being serious about kicking the dude out of the car and then proceeded to creep everyone out by acting normal again. That entire day was so annoying my boyfriend decided to avoid hanging out with him again.  


I blocked him on my main account (IG) because I didn’t want him knowing about my life(he was also always the first to see my stories etc it was starting to get weird) , on my finsta (back-up acc) he tried following before, VSCO (he could not have found me unless if he looked me up since I blocked his number before and you can’t see who people follow anyways), my phone number after i told him to stop texting me In the first place, the FAKE account he made of a friend I have in school and he came out saying “it was a prank” and that everyone got pranked but that actually really just was the cherry on top for me to have found out that he made an account and followed me and others and actually kept up with it to “prank “ others. While having that fake account he also promotes another old friend of mine accounts and I even texted that friend (i still didn’t know at the time about the other account being fake) and from all that I know it could also be fake. So I texted that friend about my concerns and told them to text my # and they still haven’t even opened the msg. There was another account made (so far two people that I haven’t talked to in years are now resurfacing) and this time this girl had an Instagram and a Snapchat, with a score of 52 and her Instagram with no photos, I was already hesitant because I’m honestly getting just a bit paranoid about my ex, so I unfriended this person as well. This is all in a span of 5 months maybe? 


My biggest fears is getting a stalker, that’s why I’m asking, I don’t think I’m the 💩 or anything of that sort, um I’m just concerned I can’t even friend people not knowing if those accounts are fake because they seem like it v much.

Every time I called without fail Carly was there too with the phone on speaker, I would make jokes with Lucy and Carly and we'd all be laughing all night long. Carly seemed happy and never gave any hints on the phone at least, but yesterday morning she hung herself. 

She was hot, had a boyfriend, family all together, and basically didn't seem to have anything wrong and nobody knows why she did it.

Lucy is devastated. Carly was her only female friend, and they spent every day together. It's like on the level of losing your soul mate.

774,"This will be a long post so I'm including a tl;dr at the bottom. Also I will probably delete this post after a week or so.

I'm a college student at a university in the US. This past semester I was studying abroad when I met a girl in my program from the same university who I wound up becoming friends with. We were very close friends for a while and I eventually found out (because she told me and a number of other people on my program) that she was in an ""open relationship."" She wound up telling me that she had a crush on me and we wound up essentially hooking up several times and more or less dating while abroad. She told me a few times that she was thinking about breaking up with her fiancé (of two and a half years) and we started talking in vaguer but emotionally charged terms about some plans for the future.

Then, out of nowhere, our program was cancelled due to Corona and we had 48 hours to leave the country. I went back to my home state on one side of the US and she wound up on the opposite coast at her fiancé's apartment. She immediately began looking for an apartment in the city so that she could move out of her fiancé's place and she encouraged me to move to the city with her, even offering to let me stay with her in her apartment. I wanted to be with her and was already planning to be in that city for the summer so I found a two month sublet and moved in two weeks ago. Three days before I left she broke up with her fiancé.

Things got off to a bad start between us from the first day I got here and after ten days she told me that she still had feelings for her ex and had gotten back with him.

I know with fair confidence that she never told her ex anything about me, what we did while we were abroad, or why she broke up with him in the first place. I also found out that she had lied about having an open relationship with him and, as a result, had been cheating on him with me while we were overseas. To be honest, I found this out while I was abroad after we had first hooked up, but rationalized it (I know, I know) by telling myself that she was planning to break up with him anyways and she had legitimate reasons for needing to do it in person, etc, etc.

He's now taken her back not knowing about any of this and I feel guilty and have the urge to tell him. I'm waiting at least another week before doing anything because I want to make sure that I do it while I'm calm and not acting out of anger. To be honest, I'm also sort of afraid of how she'll react because she can be incredibly impulsive and I think she has done some sociopathic stuff in the past in terms of cyberstalking/harassing people and I'm a little nervous about her making up lies about me or trying to retaliate in some way.

If I decide to go through with this, there's two ways I could do it: 1) send him a message over facebook with a description of who I am and what the situation is (I've already drafted one that I think is truthful, apologetic, and as tactful as could reasonably be expected) or 2) contact a guy I'm friends with who I think might be friends with or at least know him (they're in the same fraternity) and have him break the news somehow.

**Here's my question:** Should I tell the guy what happened so that he knows what he's getting back into or should I suck it up and let him live his life oblivious to the fact that the girl he's asked to marry him cheated on him for close to three months? I feel like if I was in his position I would probably want to know, but I also understand that it's not necessarily my problem any more and if he's going to find out he probably doesn't want it to be from the person she was cheating on him with. Any advice you guys have would be very much appreciated and if there's any relevant information you feel like I left out let me know and I can include it.

**TL;DR** I was essentially dating this girl while she was engaged to someone else, she broke off the engagement with him in part to be with me, then broke off stuff with me and went back to him. He doesn't know about me at all and I want to know if I should tell him and, if so, how.",18Apr2020,1

I left first because I'm not trying to downplay what's happening to him, it is definitely very terrible but as a girl what I was going through so much worse (my family is very sexist - threats of getting married off, pulling me out of school, etc). Because of the virus everything shut down and my youngest brother couldn't leave because he would have nowhere to go.

783,"I could really use some outside opinion on what to do in a situation I've just been put in. But first I need to give some background.

My wife and I have been married for 10 years. However back when we first started dating she was living with her older brother and his wife in a college town that we both had just moved to and met at a church event. From the very beginning of our relationship, her brother and sister in law had it out for me. They told her mom that I was some weirdo she had met and that I was FAR too old for her (she was 18 and I was 23 when we met). Since her family lived in another state they had no opportunity to get to know me and trusted their judgment. It got so bad that at one point we discussed breaking up before it got too serious since she was being constantly called, or taken out to ""have a conversation"" to talk about me and try to convince her she was making a mistake. Eventually, we decided that the only way to really go forward was for me to fly out and meet the rest of her family. Her parents and other siblings immediately connected with me. The trip went so well that I actually asked her parents if they would approve of me proposing to her, which they did and we were engaged before ever flying back home (which as soon as her sister in law heard we were engaged she contacted my wife mom to make sure she was aware).

Its been years since the worst of it and we live far from them so it really isn't an issue anymore but I still have some deep feelings about the way they have always treated her (dumping their kids on her whenever there's a family gathering like shes still some 12-year-old babysitter, acting like she's just some dumb kid, etc. etc.).

Which brings me to yesterday, we get a group facebook message from the wife stating this:

""Adam (name changed obviously) is turning 40. He isn't able to be with us (he's travelling for a new job he just took). Think of a memory you have of him either written down or in a video of you telling the story. Email me. We're putting something fun together.""

Maybe I'm overreacting but first, I have not a SINGLE good memory of either of them and second how presumptive of them to just demand that we do this for him. In all honesty I would like to tell them my greatest memory is proving them wrong that we were right for each other even though they were determined to ruin us so many years ago. But, doing this will not make the situation better and probably only be used to treat my wife more unfairly than they already do. But, just making something up also is not what I want to do because all that does is allows them to go along with life completely oblivious that they have only ever treated us like garbage.

tldr; We've been asked to provide a memory of a relative that I only have animosity for, do I just make up a memory and move on, tell them how I really feel though that probably will only create more strain, or just not respond at all and let them decide on their own why we have chosen to not provide a memory.",18Apr2020,1

If anyone reads this, please help.

My girlfriend is currently stuck in Los Angeles. 

She originally traveled to the US as a student, last January. She was supposed to graduate and come back to Belgium in May but due to the whole Covid-19 mess, her classes have been canceled, she was literally thrown out of the university campus without any compensation for the money she'd paid for her room, so she had to find a place to stay through friends and acquaintances otherwise she would have been homeless. 

She had already paid for a plane ticket for Belgium but she had to wait until May to take it, so it's basically canceled. 

She bought another ticket following none other than my advice... She was supposed to come back on April 24th. 

Now that ticket has been canceled too. 

For the past month, she's been staying at some friends' place. Her mental state is at risk, I talk to her everyday and she's never been so mentally tired. She can never have a moment of peace to study. She's stressed out for her family and me back here, in Belgium.
The people she's staying with are completely oblivious to the pandemic and take the whole situation so lightly they don't even care about social distancing or basic hygiene. She's at risk of contracting the virus the more she stays with those people. 

The Belgian ambassy is a gathering of tools and carefree idiots. They told her she's not eligible to be flown back to Belgium through their ressources because there still are some commercial flights.
EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE CONSTANTLY CANCELED.

I am at my wits end, I can't stand the idea that she's withering away over there.

I'm humbly asking you dear redditors, please help me bring her back home to me and her family, where she belongs.

790,"So here's the story. 

PREMISE:

My best friend named X lost her virginity a month ago at a hotel with a dude she met on bumble and I have no shame or judgment. (This is being mentioned due to background). I bring it up in a joking way since I have known her since high school and she was deeply religious and viewed sex as being disgusting and now she's opening up. Now a few weeks ago X saw her ex-boyfriend who took her two years to get over on bumble (he was requesting only hookups) and our other friend named Y told her to swipe and to go for it. X went on about how she is over him and that she wants to have sex with him because she never had the chance to (for nostalgia), with Y egging her on. I did not think this was a good idea and mentioned this. 

I think it's important to note that X had sex with her ex-boyfriend multiple times during the past two weeks DURING THE QUARANTINE. I mentioned how immature and irresponsible she is being because of 1. She's not even taking account of her FAMILY. She lives with her family. If she lived alone this wouldn't be an issue. I told her this and her response was well if I have it then I have it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Current issue: 

I am also talking to several people and one person brought up his many odd fetishes and I was telling X about him. She made some goofy comment and I mentioned jokingly she should have sex with him since she has nice feet (weird I know lol) and she became defensive and basically said she wouldn't do it ever and I still jokingly said you had sex with a dude at a hotel that you knew for a few weeks it's not that crazy to do anything else wilder. Basically she got upset and asked why I always brought it up and started insinuating I was shaming her. I got very angry and told her to not even begin insinuating that especially with all the support I have shown her and I told her that I am mostly in disagreement with the fact that she's having sex with her ex. We literally joke around all of the time and I didn't think it was a big issue. I basically told her that it bothers me how much she defends her ex (any comment I make she shuts me down and says he's a great person) when it's painfully obvious she still has feelings for him. Basically we got in a huge fight that really did not need to be and I blew up on her for acting like I am a bad person for just looking out for her. I was still angry and I apologized but I felt I needed an apology too since she was being extremely defensive and acting that me getting angry at her was without reason.I admit that I was being very angry and defensive but I apologized later about it. And basically she blamed me for everything told me my apology seemed backhanded and that I should just let her do what she wants and support her. I used to support but now I feel as though its becoming reckless and stupid. Now Y is defending her also saying how I need to just respect what she does (because its female empowerment) and if she gets hurt then oh well. I always wanted to be a support system for X (as we have other friends that are judgemental) but after this, I am beginning to realize that maybe I shouldn't be supporting her with everything she does.I am just still very angry that I am being portrayed as the bad person but why? I never shamed her into not doing something. 

Basically my advice is whether or not I should draw a line in giving a safe space for X tell me everything she's doing or draw a line and what I should do next.",18Apr2020,2

I’m (28f) having issues with my ex (34m) my daughter’s (11) dad over this whole quarantine thing. 

He is demanding to see my daughter even though I have already told him I don’t feel comfortable with that because we are trying to do our part (when I say we I am referring to myself, my mother (60), and my niece (13) who I have custody of and am in the process of adopting) to social distance and remain home as much as possible during this pandemic. 

I also received a message from my niece’s social worker that stated that the juvenile court judge signed an order that temporarily suspends visits with any relatives, friends, etc. due to the pandemic that’s going on. So even if I wanted to I cannot have anyone in my home to visit because of this order that the juvenile court judge signed. I also informed him of this a month ago and he seemed to be fine with it but now is growing impatient and is demanding I let him come to my house to see my daughter. Or that he takes her out of my home to his home to spend time with her. 

Now, he doesn’t own a car and either takes public transportation or Uber’s everywhere. Which is fine, but I don’t feel comfortable with my daughter being in an Uber at this time and definitely not comfortable with her being on public transportation. I just don’t want to take any chances or get into some kind of trouble if my niece were to get sick. 

I have told him several times to video chat with her and to just be patient and understanding of me and the situation because I’m not keeping her from him on purpose or because I want to cause problems. But he doesn’t care and doesn’t want to understand. 

It’s gotten to the point where I am having physical symptoms and severe anxiety (which I suffer from) due to the fact that he constantly makes things complicated. During our relationship he was physically, verbally, and emotionally abusive which is why I left him. And I am to the point where I can’t physically or emotionally handle the constant abuse from him when I don’t do what he says, when he says it, and how he says it. 

He’s threatening to take me to court if I don’t let him see her. I honestly don’t know what to do anymore? Am I not doing the right thing by not allowing him to see my daughter during this time? Please help :,(",18Apr2020,1

I’m looking for a little guidance. Lately, I have been dealing with a lot of self sabotage. Bare with me, as I may be a little all over place with this post, but I’ll try to get the main points out as clearly as possible.

Before the quarantine,
I was in a 2 year acting conservatory program
In Los Angeles. This is my second full time program, since moving here from the east coast. About a year and a half ago my older brother died of a heroin overdose at age 30, and about 3 months later, on my birthday, my sister passed away from an overdose as well. In between their death’s, my parents both got a form of cancer. My mother had her surgery, and my dad begins chemotherapy in a few weeks, after just getting his prostate removed.

A few weeks after my brother passed, I met the girl that would soon become my girlfriend. Being with her helped keep my mind off of everything that has being going on, however, I soon realized that by doing that, I wasn’t able to process anything on my own. After a little over a year, we broke up, and it feels like EVERYTHING came crashing down. 

I suddenly started feeling guilt and shame, not due to the relationship, but I guess because the typhoon of emotions that were going on inside me, didn’t match the confident persona/mask that I had to put on around others, just so I didn’t seem like a mess. I don’t know. 

I grew up an athlete, so I didn’t really dabble on drugs. However, since all of this has happened, I started drinking a lot, smoking weed, doing mushrooms, LSD, cocaine. 

I’m just having trouble figuring everything out. If it weren’t for acting, I would have probably gone mad by now, so thankfully I have that. But even acting brings out its own insecurities, fears, and thoughts of unworthiness within myself. 

I’m just trying to figure out how to get back on track. I feel all over the place. I don’t know if I’m even grieving correctly. I don’t know who the fuck I am anymore. It’s messed up. I sometimes contemplate suicide, and I feel so fucked up for even considering something like that. I honestly don’t know where those thoughts arise from. I feel so lost.

Anyhow, that’s all I got now. I guess I just needed to rant. For those who read this, thank you for taking the time. For those who have any sort of feedback, I’m looking forward to talking with you. 

Much love.

He lies all the time about how long he spends online, and I can tell you right now it is unhealthy how long he is online, pretty much all day. This isn't really the problem though, because I know being online is somewhat natural for teenagers.

He's also become really spiteful and rude. He's never really cleaned up after himself or done housework, but now he is genuinely so rude to my mother for literally no reason. My mom has told me a few times how much his comments hurt her. He cannot hold a proper conversation with her, as most of it is spent telling her how annoying she is and asking her to leave him alone so he can game.

My dad puts him in his place, but those lectures only leave an impact for a day before he is back to being a menace to my mother. With me, my dad and his friends, he is USUALLY normal. Only my mom makes him angry in this way. 

He is just a super frustrating person to be around because he is really entitled and bratty. He thinks he is so amazing, and he just hates people that tell him he's wrong or that he needs to change.

How do I make my mom's life easier and also help my brother develop a personality outside of being a  gaming addict?",18Apr2020,7
808,"My roommate currently works as a bartender at a local restaurant. Right now they're only doing takeout orders because of the virus. I'm worried that when the state opens back up and he goes back to working normally that I'll be at an increased risk of getting sick. 

I like living with a roommate because I don't have to pay as much rent, so I've been paying off debt and saving money. I just don't know if it's worth potentially getting sick. 

My dad also has stage IV pancreatic cancer and I know I don't have much time left with him. I haven't seen him in weeks, and I know that once the state opens back up if I'm still living here I won't be able to see him at all because I'll never know if my roommate is sick and I'm exposed.

I don't want to sound like my roommate is the only person that can get me sick, but I'm extremely paranoid about this virus and I rarely go anywhere unless it's to the store. I'm working from home, and I've been strategically planning Walmart grocery pickups so that I don't even have to go inside the store. I've also been doing Hello Fresh meal delivery for over a year. So if I do get sick chances are I got it from him. 

Another problem is that he doesn't care at all about changing his habits to lower the chances of getting me sick. He blows his nose an abnormal about throughout the day and every morning when he wakes up the first thing he does is loudly blow his nose and then goes straight in to the freezer to get handfuls of ice for water. I've asked him if he would please wash his hands before doing anything in the kitchen since it's a shared space, but he said that was a selfish request. He mostly just eats fast food and take out and he doesn't even wash his hands when he gets back from getting food. 

I just don't know what to do. If I could live by myself and still save money, I would move in a heartbeat. But that's not realistic since my rent would almost double.",18Apr2020,2
809,"Hello Reddit,

I am a loss how to progress with my life.   
This year I will be 30 and only have a Bachelor of Arts in English and Philosophy. Originally with this I wanted to become a teacher, but after years of psychological problems and university really putting me down, I decided not to do my masters degree and therefore not working my dream job. I am not able to handle more university. (There is really no way. I needed 10 years to get remotely healthy and near my bachelors.)

But what the fuck do I do with Philosophy and English, specialized in teaching and actually not even feeling competent in either of the subjects?  
Also we have a pandemic and will face regression.

I have no idea what kind of job I could find this summer/fall or what apprenticeship would be good with my degree. I have no idea where even to apply.  


I love working with people, but not with retail customers.   
I have a grasp on science but no experience and have been out of school without any math for 10 years.   
I have a huge moral compass and could not ever shake somebody down like selling useless stuff to gullible people, fake myself all day or sell my soul.  
Nothing medical, no boats or heights.  
But I am honest, loyal and learn quickly.  


And by now I am not interestet in a big career anymore. I just want a 9 to 5 job and be able to afford living alone for the time being. 

I lost my way and my love for what I do, but I need to start out somewhere.  
So I am asking your collective intelligence on ideas to point me in a direction.",18Apr2020,1
812,"Back story.. basically I'm a graduating senior in college but due to the Coronavirus I had to leave my school. I didn't intend on moving back home and would prefer to stay in the state I'm going to school in and that my boyfriend lives in. We intended to get our own place after I graduate, however, that isn't going to happen for a while and instead we had to move into his parent's place.

While living here, my boyfriend has pet reptiles (snakes, specifically) and they live inside of what's called the snake room in this house along with another relative's snakes. This relative, however, does not take care of their snakes. They barely feed them, most of them have dried up water bowls, and the snakes basically live in their own feces. There's probably around 30-50 snakes. The smell of ammonia in this room is so strong, my boyfriend and I are worried it might be causing some health issues to his own snakes even though their enclosures are always kept clean. In the past, my boyfriend and his mom has helped this relative clean every single bin many times but the relative didn't help much with it. 

We're trying to talk to this relative about it but they act like they're fine and there's nothing wrong. Every time this issue has been mentioned, there are excuses involved and they never end up making any changes.

Do we...

Clean up the cages anyways and say nothing, the animals deserve it?

Try telling the relative that we can try to help them clean, but they have to put some effort in too?

Or call the authorities, the relative doesn't deserve to own animals?

Or if you guys have any other advice, I would really appreciate it.",18Apr2020,4
813,"Hi, i just want some input on my path I plan on taking to get to where I want to be by the age 28. 

I am 23 rn, single, still living at home. I am ready to want to be a man and grow up and get out of my moms house. So i am leaning heavily on joining the Navy. I already went to school and got my degree in sociology. I still do not have a job I want and I was recently let go from my job i worked at for 3 years being a valet.

My goal by 28 is to own my own home in the DC area or the Phoenix area. I plan on going into the navy to become an Air Machinist Mate, working on plane engines. Assuming I get this job, i will save as much as I can in order to get my home I want and pay off my student debt. Hopefully the navy will help me do that as well. Ill try to get a job at a local airport, either Regan National, Dulles, Or Phoenix Airport. I would continue to make money off my skill I learned in the military. 

Also by then I hope to have a found a nice woman to build a family with in my home. If not, i will live the life of a bachelor for a while. Also use my GI Bill to go back and gain a masters degree in Something I enjoy.

She lives in my house rent free (she has offered to pay before but I told her regardless of if she pays rent she’s going to follow rules). We have a curfew of 10pm every night for her and we bought her a car. She has put 1,000 down towards the car but hasn’t finished paying it, thus the title is in my name. Well, we took the car away from her after she got home at 5am and had an obvious hickey on her neck. It’s been three weeks and she told me she wants to go for a drive. I told her no way unless she gets a tracker on her phone. She pays  her own phone bills and paid for her phone but she LIVES IN MY HOUSE. Anyway, I told her she will not get the car until she puts a tracker on her phone. Now all she does is sleep all day long and she refuses to talk to me. She blew up in my face and said “you think you’re hot shit but you’re not!” After that, she told me she wants her 1,000 payment back and i refused and WILL NOT give it back. I told her that, that’s the cost of driving the car for a year and she will not get her money back. If she wants to be a bitch about it, I’ll just kick her out. She paid for gas on the car but I paid insurance, so. I’m tired of my daughters attitude. What do I do?

822,"Hello anyone reading this. I am experiencing a weird and fucked up situation. I live in AZ and had been in a relationship w someone for years (8). Last year, we broke it off but still kept in touch and I still helped him alot. Now, alot of reasons why we broke, or I did actually, because of drug use and physical abuse. This past year, he was struggling bad and needed help w finding a job claiming to be clean from the worst of it but admitted to still use some time. So me being the good person, and dumb, person I am let him into my home to work on finding a job and to get help w getting/staying clean. There's no intimate connection or nothing tied like that mind you. Just felt like the guy needed my help since most his family is a POS otherwise. They're worthy ppl but tend to look the other way when it's drug related and don't wanna taint their beautiful family tree with such. Long story short, this whole COVID shit put a hold on everything and recently he started asking to borrow money saying he'll pay me back. I did a few times like 5 here, a 10 here. Then I noticed some things missing from my storage. When questioned, the big IDK was a common answer. He's been acting funny lately like grunting or making weird noises at times. So one day when I hear sounds in my storage, I open it up and he's there, smoking some gross shit from tin foil. It's not weed, believe me, I know a rigged weed pipe when I see one as I partake myself. I was upset and disgusted. I told him he needs to get himself back where he came from or find some place else to stay. He's not so assuring. When I told him please don't do that in or near my home or be under the influence of that shit in my home, he's quick to say ""I'm not bothering anyone"" THEN disappeared for a good hour and came back weird as shit- grunting, smacking his backside, and picking at little things here and putting them in other places they don't belong (clear sign btw of some kind of drug beside alcohol or weed). Omg, idk what or how to react. I really want to call the cops but I have some illegal flower in my house that I'm sure they'll cite me for and I'll lose my job. I need to get him out BUT where's he's from is a sesspool for the COVID-19 virus, it's thriving there. I want him out but I don't want to have to include the police because they're not any help anyway. This person is extremely difficult to deal with when under the influence of drugs and I feel like I got myself in too deep. I should've just let him rot out there. I hate myself for letting him in. He won't leave, he just mocks me when I tell him to. Please if anyone has a cleaver idea I'm open to it. Thanks for reading and I hope you're all staying safe out there.",18Apr2020,3
823,"I'm 20, I probably sound like a little kid though

My aunt:

Steals money from my grandparents

Stays there without their permission

Steals their prescriptions

Assaults them on a regular basis

Crashes on their couch and sleeps for days after drug binges

Has beaten, and stolen from her five kids, none of which she has custody of.

Brings meth into their house.

Steals their car on a regular basis

Has threatened to kill just about everybody.

Recently slashed my neighbors tires for no reason at all.

And now, is going partying with her friends, where there's a good chance she might catch the virus and will give it to my very elderly grandparents.

We tried calling the cops,but they told us they can't take her to jail unless she commits murder basically, because they can't crowd the jails.

We called adult protective services, and they can't do anything. we called CPS, and they can't do anything.

She's just a total piece of shit waste of skin who's Making my families life hell. Especially to my grandparents.

I'm tired of this shit, and don't know who to call. My grandmother has been staying at my house for the past few days because she's scared to be around her.

My cousin (Who my grandparents have custody of) would rather stay with my aunt (Who's a nurse and who's come into contact with multiple Corona positive patients) than stay there with her abusive crackhead mother around.

Help, I don't know where to go, and I don't know what to do. She constantly guilts my grandparents into doing things for her by saying ""If you don't take care of me I'll starve"" and ""Who would put their own daughter on the streets, or force her to rot in jail"".

I'm tired of it. I'm done. I don't know what to do. She's already gotten one person killed before, I don't want her killing anyone else. Especially my grandparents.

829,"Heres some context:

I'm living by my grandma since im 6 years old, now im 19.

My grandmother had to suffer many things, her husband got alzheimers and and got moved to a

retirement home. That alone broke her heart. She's paying nearly 3000€ a month just for him.

We didn't have enough money, so one of their sons moved in to support us financally.

Then, we had enough money but her son is completely fucking her up mentally. He has a completely broken worldview and he's changing our life to the worst. It's sad to see how my grandma got so depressed because of him, yet she doesn't do anything against it. She's letting him do that to her.

Not only because of him, most of her friends turned against her. I don't really know why.

Sometimes she's coming in my room, just to talk about it. She even told me, she just wanted to never wake up again. Some deep shit.

(I also tried talking to him, but that doesn't work. Like i said, he has a completely broken worldview.)

I hate that, so her son and i are getting in conflict pretty often, but she told me she don't want us to fight. Why is she letting him do that to her?

The whole thing got in fact so bad, that i don't want to live there anymore. So i told my grandmother about leaving - in which she nearly cried. I feel like, if im moving out i'm taking her last will to live. Yet, i  just can't endure this anymore. We're not cooking anymore, the only thing she's doing is watching her tv shows.

I already got accepted in a school 50 kilometers away from home.

830,"I'm 19, my boyfriend is 20 and his brother just turned 17. I live in their house.

I really don't like germy stuff, and I have anxiety related to catching things from other people. I don't share drinks or anything else that could potentially give me an illness, even with my family. This is an ongoing problem because my boyfriend's brother has had hand warts for over a year and refuses to treat them. 

He has about 8 warts all over his hands and went to get them frozen once but it ""hurt too much"" so he didn't go back. His mom bought him a topical treatment, but he refuses to use it. He's had them since last school year, and since I'm in college it didn't matter so much as my boyfriend and I were leaving, but now that we live in the same house, share a bathroom, touch all of the same things, I'm extremely distressed.

We've all talked to him many, many times about it, and given many gentle reminders to him (his mom is very protective and doesn't want his feelings hurt), but nothing works. We will talk to him, he'll say ""I'm worried I'll pick at them again"" (he picked them last time he used the treatment and left blood and bloody bandaids all over the bathroom that he refused to pick up/wipe for two weeks), and that is literally his only excuse. This boy does *literally nothing.* He has no requirements except a little bit of homework that he doesn't do. All he has to do is put on the f\*cking treatment, and he won't.

He picks them at the dinner table across from me and flecks of ""dry skin"" (I don't know if that's what it is, that's what he says he's picking, looks like he's just picking warts to me) falls on the table/his plate. It literally makes me want to throw myself off their roof. I don't know why nobody yells at him ever. I know the gentle talks aren't working because he doesn't care enough to treat it and he knows there's no punishment. If I had it my way, he couldn't leave his room until he'd put on deodorant and the wart treatment, but his mom says there's no way to force him to treat it. So on he goes, touching every remote, the Brita filter, reaching into the ice because the ice machine is broken, helping with dishes... Their mom even asked him to help knead dough with his hands the other day, and I had to talk to her privately and put my foot down. 

I feel so out of control. I have nightmares that I have warts all over my hands too. I don't know how to get him to treat them. He is gross in general, smells bad, doesn't wash his hands or use deodorant or shower, and is also pretty rude a lot of the time, but the only thing I care about right now is the warts as they are contagious. I can't yell at him or anything myself because I am a guest and grateful they let me live there.

What do I do?! I've never known anyone this gross in my entire life. I cannot fathom why he won't just treat it. I feel like there's a pandemic outside and an epidemic inside. I'm going crazy.",18Apr2020,1

840,"So over the last couple months I finally managed to detach myself from my former crush, after one long fucking year. That is mainly thanks to a girl, who we will call J from now on. But now I have a problem. I have a crush on her, and that one is multiple times larger than the one before that. 

J and I really got to know each other at my best friends birthday party, where he, because I have never been drunk before, made it his personal mission to get me as hammered as physically possible. J basically got me through the night, as she watched over me while I could barely walk. That was when she almost didn’t know me, mind you.

You should know that she is like a goddess to me, she is intelligent, kind, beautiful, has a heart of gold and (big plus incoming) really likes the English language. As a non-native speaker who LOVES English this is an extreme positive. I am very much your typical teen, maybe a bit smarter than most, but to cope for that I have two right hands. You should already see that she is waaaay out of my league. I haven’t really confessed my feelings for her yet, but I frequently compliment her whenever it fits and isn’t feeling like an awkward pickup line.

I just don’t know what to do now. The whole Covid-situation makes it hard to do something other than texting together. Also I don‘t want to lose her by confessing or flirting too hard, although I doubt that she would drop our friendship. It’s just that neither one of us ever had a real romantic relationship, and subtly hinting at things won’t work, because she is just as lost as I am when it comes to these things.

Last year we became closer than we’d ever been probably because we’re older. He is usually a more introverted person and doesn’t get out much unless with family. Randomly one night he told me he was going to a hotel party with a friend we’ll call “Kyle”. So Kyle is also a gay guy we went to high school with. I didn’t mind because my boyfriend had always been faithful to my knowledge and I thought it’d be nice for him to go out because I’m always out to functions or traveling. 

The day after the party he FaceTimed me, we talked like we normally do. I was of course waiting for him to mention his time at the party but nothing. I instantly knew something went down but I still didn’t worry too much. Days go by and he literally hasn’t said one word about the party ,so I asked. 

He could tell by my face I knew something and I could tell by his he did something. He starts telling me irrelevant ass details just to end up telling me he kissed Kyle’s “friend” (he describes as a peck). I know a kiss might not be that serious but 1. He kissed a stranger in front of someone that’s knows us both and that we’re together 2. He deliberately omitted info 3. I didn’t believe is was just a kiss. Knowing Kyle he probably suggested they full blown fuck right there. I started distancing myself cause I was trying to figure out my feelings and I told him that we should just take a break to figure shit out. 

I wanted to focus on work while trying to find it in myself to genuinely forgive him. I cut him off for about 2 weeks until he texted me to talk again, I told him I didn’t believe it was just a kiss and then he revealed to me they were making out and at one point looking for a condom but then “snapped out of it”. at this point I lost all trust. 

About a week goes by and i spend sometime with him and half jokingly ask “did you fuck anyone during the 3 weeks” and he tells me yes 🥴 and he had sex with someone we both know (also a former classmate) that we’ve called desperate and unattractive. My heart breaks all over again. He says I shouldn’t be upset because it was a break. I understand that BUT during the 3 weeks he was also texting me saying how he feels like shit for kissing that guy, how much he loves me and can’t stop thinking about me... that to me is contradictory, when you fuck up and you feel guilty you don’t go fuck someone else. I can’t fake like I’m okay with any of it and he picks up that energy. I tell him I want to be best friends because I don’t want to lose him but I honestly can’t pretend or be lovely dovey.  He tells me we can’t be friends, he loves me too much to be platonic and that if he can’t be with me he feels he needs to walk away completely for his own heart.  I think it’s a weak excuse and I feel like he wants me to completely forget it. 
Like I said,  I don’t want to lose him he really is one of my best friends and I love him. Usually if I got cheated on that’s automatic break up but 7 years feel like a long time.  What do I do?",18Apr2020,2
845,"I am a 25 year old female and I never had a boyfriend before. I've slept with 20 guys but they have all been hookups, I cannot even get to the ""friend with benefits"" stage. Literally no guy will even sleep with me twice, even just once.

Does this mean I have something wrong with my body, I am unattractive or that I am bad in bed?

In other words I've only had sex 20 times in my life and feel jaded. ",18Apr2020,0
846,"So this is kind of a long story, I'm sorry. I'm 27f in canada, and so is my ex 30m. We have 4 little children together. 

He was very abusive, I finally left in January and moved to another city with my children. He doesn't know where I am, but gets weekend access with the kids. There is a restraining order in place, so there is to be no contact. 

He has an extensive history of sexually abusing me, assaulting me, and he's manipulative and perverted. 

He has sexually assaulted girls as young as 14 (when he was 22) that I know about. 

He's had a huge history of stealing/lying. He has an extensive history with the police.

I do not trust him with my children whatsoever, I do not feel that they are safe with him, but until proven otherwise, I have no reason to keep them from their dad, that would be incredibly unfair to my kids. 

I have access to his phone records (which I'm assuming I shouldn't), and can see what numbers he's texting/calling, and like the crazy person he always claimed I was, I check them every weekend while my kids are with him. I have no way of checking their well beings or making sure they are ok. 

He has always talked to the same people, plus a random girl here and there, whatever. 

This week, he started talking to, but mostly photo messaging 6 different men in a different country, who are between the ages of 35-75. I reverse searched the numbers and called them behind a private number to confirm the names. 

I have a huge sense that SOMETHING IS WRONG and I'm losing my mind, I can't really go to police because I would get in shit for having access to his phone records still.  

What do I do?",18Apr2020,0
847,"Most of the time, when I'm alone,  I am happy and generally feeling good. But when I socialize with my parents (college student, had to come back home), I tend to get irritated or a little annoyed. I never show it, and I'm not an asshole or anything, but I just get annoyed with how they treat me and the things they talk about. I get a bit quiet and closed off around them too, when at college I am very social. They have never seen that side of me though. They treat me like I am a little kid (im 19 yo male lol) and I have goals etc. 

It is very hard to explain, but it is almost as if my father tries to embarrass me / always point out flaws. And he is always telling me to do shit I already do. ""Make sure you do x"" and ""have you been doing x lately?"" It seriously gets on my nerves when they treat me like this. He always tries to change me and my path and its very annoying. I'm in fucking college and they talk to me like I'm some sort of moron. My mother treats me like a baby, thinking that I'm some sort of pussy or something. I'm perfectly normal, and they have this weird look on their faces all the time like they have never met me. They always compare me to my brother, saying ""why arent you doing x, like your brother?"" Or ""your brother has always been such a ladys man. You're just such an introvert."" Yes, I am not going to bring any girl home to you when I'm in fucking college. Why do my parents keep treating me like some sort of dumbass? Any advice would be greatly appreciate.",18Apr2020,1
848,"some of the pictures on there are the same ones he has on his instagram so i'm completely sure it's him. I've suspected he was secretly gay or bi since she introduced him to me but i couldn't put my finger on why, but now this both confirms that and most importantly shows he's actively looking for other people.

849,"Every single day I experience a thought of “if i don’t do this something bad will happen tomorrow” it’s usually at night time, it can be from not having a hot water bottle with me and my thought is “if I don’t have a hot water bottle me and my boyfriend might have an argument tomorrow”, or if I don’t put my dressing gown on my bed “he might break up with me tomorrow if I don’t have my dressing gown on my bed when I sleep” it can be anything from turning my pillows over before I go to sleep, to not laying my 3 teddies in a certain position in my bed... it’s driving me crazy I just want to feel like I can live my life without worrying about what might go wrong if I don’t do something correctly... right now I’ve forgotten my hot water bottle, I hate the dark but I still want to go downstairs and make myself one just so I can fall asleep and feel like nothing will go wrong... does anyone else feel like this?",18Apr2020,1
850,"A little over a year ago I began talking to a long lost cousins daughter through social media. Because of an incident that happened before either of us were born her dad cut all ties with the family and moved to California from Canada. The poor girl is 18 now and has had a really rough go of things; both her parents were junkies, she was molested by her mom’s boyfriend as a child, thrown in foster care, the whole lot. As a side effect of all of this she’s developed a very skewed sense of what a relationship should be and has been living out of a car with an awful boyfriend. Now that this pandemic is happening she’s gone to Michigan to stay at her boyfriend’s parent’s home. While there he’s gotten worse and worse and she wants out, but I have no way of getting her here across the border and she has nowhere else to go. She isn’t a dual citizen yet, but her dad is Canadian and she should be able to apply.

I look up to her a lot, I haven’t seen her in over a month and I was growing used to seeing her on a daily basis. I’m also getting work withdrawals. Would it be odd if I asked her if I could just chat with her for a few minutes? We had a comfortable relationship at work, but it was strictly professional. We aren’t friends or anything as she is almost 10 years older than me on top of being a supervisor. However, I did invite her to a potential event (which is postponed, obviously) and she said she’d be down to come, and  I always send her a message on holidays to wish her well. I’m  having a hard time interpreting boundaries right now and need insight.",18Apr2020,1
853," 

Three years. This whole situation began three years ago. Now don't get me wrong, what I'm stating is not necessarily fact. I question myself every day.

What are the odds of this situation happening to me? Low. Why would someone put so much effort into this situation when I'm just a normal person? No one would, there's no motive. How come someone would waste so much money on gas and most importantly time on me? They wouldn't... it doesn't make any sense why they would. Plus how would they even know where I am? This must be all in my head.

Now that being said let explain my situation so that I can better understand if this is simply just all in my head. To give you some context, I'm now 20 years old and I am a female. When this began I was 17.

Back in July of 2017, my sister had just come to my hometown to stay for a couple of months. For some context, my hometown is a small town. Literally it puts the 'town' in hometown.

During this time we made it our daily ritual to go for long, daily walks. We would walk everywhere and often we would walk to a local cafe that was situated in front of a busy road.

Now I am a huge motorbike fan. I think those large cruiser motorbikes look pretty badass. Anyways, one day as we went to the cafe halfway through our daily walk we passed by the coolest looking motorbike I had ever seen at the entrance of the bakery. The rider was still on the bike. He had entire leather biking attire. He also had his helmet on. His cruiser bike was silver with blue on the sides. The way it shined in the sun made it look extra cool, and I couldn't help but look. Then we went into the cafe as normal and got our drinks to go. We left afterwards and as we were walking out again I looked at the bike and saw that the rider was adjusting his gloves. He looked so awesome and it kinda made me want to eventually get a motorbike.

My sister and I continued to walk along the footpath of the busy road, with me being on the side closest to the road. We saw the same motorbike we had seen earlier pass us. Again I couldn't help but look because the way it shone in the sun made it look really nice. After it passed, I forgot about it. Then, a few minutes later, the motorbike passed us again. This time it was driving in the opposite direction and the biker was staring back at me. Anyways, since he was coming in the opposite direction he was soon out of sight and out of mind. Until he once again drove in the opposite direction to the previous time and came passed us, again staring in our direction. When this happened, however, I started to question it a bit and so when he drove again past us only to drive back in the opposite direction a couple more times I was a bit shaken. So my sister and I turned to walk in a quieter street that came off the main road. It was quite a windy street since it had lots of curves on the road. My sister and I kept walking and a few minutes later the motorbiker turned into the street and drove past us. This time, he literally came to a stop in the middle of the street and stared at me. I felt quite uncomfortable and looked to my sister who now appeared uncomfortable also and was staring at the ground. I don't know what possessed me to then stare back at this motorbike but I did. It was us staring at each other for like a whole minute, with him moving walking distance beside us on the road. Eventually, he drove off and we didn't see him again. After he left I tried talking to my sister about that experience. She just shrugged it off so I forgot all about it.

During this time I was a senior in high school and since I'm from a country that experiences winter in July, I had school a couple of days later. As I was walking home that day, I noticed a strange early 2000's green car (sorry I'm bad at car models but it was a Toyota) kept doing what that motorbike did. It would pass me from behind and then minutes later, it would come back and pass me in the opposite direction. It did this so many times I didn't even count. But what I remember is that there were two dudes in the car.

One had blonde hair and looked in his thirties. This guy was the driver. One had darker-whitish hair and maybe looked in his fifties. I turned into the small cul-de-sac that was where my home was when the green car came into the cal-de-sac and drove past me back out of the cal-de-sac. The blonde hair man was pointing at me as the car passed me. I found it strange since the car began driving past me shortly as I left my school premises. I went into my home and locked the door and after that experience, my sister and I did not go for our daily walk that day.

The next day as I was walking to school I saw the same green car parked on the street coming out of the cul-de-sac with the same blonde guy in it. He was wearing a hoodie. At that moment I thought that it just must be a neighbour and I walked past the car and looked at the guy in the driver's seat. He was staring so intently at me. I don't know how to describe that stare. His eyes looked so happy yet he wasn't smiling. He wasn't even blinking and had his head turned to stare at me. I just walked past. But the same thing happened again. The green car would drive past me from the back and then minutes later it would drive past in the opposite direction. Again, it did this a few more times. Then I reached school.

When the day ended the same thing with a car passing me and then turning around to pass me again a few minutes later happened. But this time it was in anew car. This car was identical to the green car (early 2000's model) but this time it was red. I thought I was losing my mind and just said to myself that there wouldn't be two different cars following me. It just didn't make sense because they were driving the same way as the motorbike and the green car and it was the same blonde guy driving it. When I went home I told my mum but she said I was just making it up and that no two cars would be following me.

I also told my sister but again she said it was just my mind playing tricks on me. I believed them because why would someone waste so much money on gas on this, and how much time did people have on their hands anyway? And besides, there would be no reason to this. So I ignored it and my sister and I continued our daily walks.

A few days later I was walking back from school quite late because I had a tutorial. As I was walking back I turned into our cul-de-sac and a very expensive sports Audi that had matte black stripes drove past me and stopped in front of me and began to toot. It drove past out of the cal-de-sac. I found this weird as there were only four houses in that cal-de-sac and nobody I know owns an Audi. Anyways, it must have just been someone visiting them or it could have just been someone using the cul-de-sac to make a u-turn.

After the Audi incident, the same blue striped cruiser motorbike would drive past me as I went home from school and turn around to pass me again a few minutes later. Again, it would do this so many times.

I saw that motorbike do this on many occasions over a 4-5 month period. It was the same rider with leather attire and he wouldn't pick up anyone from school. He'd just slow down and stare at me as he drove past me and he would also rev his engine near me.

I saw the red and green cars a lot in the weeks that followed. They would always do the same thing of driving past me. A few times I would look at the car to see who was driving and it would always be the same blonde guy. But once logic kicked in, I stopped looking at the car because I didn't suspect them of anything.

But I remember seeing either the green car or red car whenever my sister would go for walks or whenever I'd walk to school. Eventually, the same cars would begin to park at a point of the cul-de-sac where my house (and specifically my room) was visible. I have a study desk in front of my window so I was able to see the same green car (or red car on alternative days) would be parked in front with someone sitting inside at the driver's seat, but not coming out. Again, I refused to believe that someone was doing this on purpose. This had to be some neighbour, etc because just why?

This happened for months. I just learned to ignore it every time I would see the cars and had in my mind it's just a neighbour. One day, long after my sister had left, I was out for a walk with a boy I had a massive crush on at the time. We went to the cafe, got a bite to eat, then after decided to head to the local small library to study. We went to the library and spent some time there. There weren't many people there at the time. We were sitting on a desk facing the door. My crush was reading a textbook and I was staring at the entrance when an angry-looking man stormed in. He didn't look at me but he was glaring at my crush in a scary way. His face was red and I kid you not his eyes looked like they were about to bulge out of his head. He wore dad jeans and had a faded t-shirt tucked in and he was wearing a baseball cap. Anyways he walked slightly past the desk we were sitting at and then stormed back out. He looked familiar. I remembered where I had seen him from: he was the second guy with dark-whitish hair in the green car I had seen a few months earlier.

A few days later my crush and I decided to go back to the library to study. We were sitting at the same desk and this time there were a bunch of newspapers that were piled on top of the desk. They had come from the newspaper stand literally a few feet away. Anyways, so my crush and I were discussing some exam questions when this dude with a beer gut, glasses and in his fifties came to our desk and leaned over my crush to grab the newspapers. He also looked so pissed and my crush looked so shocked because where I'm from, people are friendly, and would usually politely ask you to pass the newspapers. The guy then took the third seat at the desk and pulled it two feet away from us and sat down, facing us, to read the newspaper. Mind you this guy was also wearing an orange high-vis vest.

After that, my crush and I decided to take a break from studying and go for a walk. We walked all over town until we reached a lesser-known walking track. When we reached the entrance of the walking track we saw a black pick up truck parked with the same orange high-vis guy sitting in it. We just walked past it and once we spent some time walking to the end of the track as we left the exit of the walking track we saw the same black pickup truck with the same guy in the high-vis jacket in it. He was looking at us. By this time it had gotten late and we decided to head home.

During this time I had signed up for more after school tutorials. My crush and I would go to these together and sometimes we would be the last two students to leave school. Since we lived on opposite sides of the town we would say bye at the school gates. Anyways, after these tutorials, I would notice that there was a separate red car that would always cut me off walking or beep at me and drive off in an angry way. It was literal road rage but I wasn't in a car and I hadn't done anything wrong. Now, this is the bit that is spooky: the driver was always the same blonde guy. This time I told my parents and they got worried and began to pick me up from school most days and on the days when they couldn't pick me up, they told me to take a picture of the car next time I saw it. I didn't see it again.

Mind you during this time I was still seeing that early 2000's model green car. I began to notice (from my view of the cal-de sac- in my room) that on most days on the week at 4 pm the car would park in front of our house and the two guys I had first seen in the green car would come out and make a walking loop around our cul-de-sac, not stop anywhere and head back into their car. Every time they would walk past the part of the cal-de-sac where you could see my room, the guy with the blonde hair would always stare in the direction of my window.

At this point, I thought I was losing my mind. I told everyone but because they would drive so many different cars and there were was more than one guy I would see I understood how outlandish my story seems. Heck, if someone had told me this I wouldn't have believed them and would have chalked it up simply to a hyperactive imagination.

One day my dad had gone out of town for a business trip. So it was just my mum and me at home for the night. That night I had fallen asleep with my lamp still on and (stupidly) my curtain was not closed all the way.

At around 4:00 a.m. I woke up to the sound of tapping coming from my window. I woke up but thought I was dreaming. I sat up and listened to it. Then I heard three knocks and stood like a dumb deer in headlights. I didn't believe what I had just heard. Then I heard three more knocks coming from outside of my window. I freaked out at this point and rushed out of my room to tell my mum. It took a while to get her out of bed and she said I was just dreaming. She checked, but there was nobody. But I know what I heard. I was wide awake and sitting up. Again, it must have just been my imagination.

After that, I would see this blond guy everywhere and he would always be staring at me in the same intent way. He looked so happy yet he was not smiling and his eyes were unblinking. It was freaky.

Then I moved town for university and I didn't see anything else. I moved a two-hour drive away and thought that was the end of that and it was. While I was out of town there was nothing. Also, as soon as I came back home for my semester breaks there would be no activity. But as soon as I visited the local grocery, or went for one of my walks around town the activity with the green car would start again. One time I was catching up with a female friend from high school during one of the semester breaks and we decided to go for a walk to a local track. As we left the track we were cut off by that same black pickup truck and we were nearly run over. The truck sped off but I saw that the driver was that blonde dude.

Then, in 2019 there was no activity. Even when I worked during the holidays at one of the busiest places in town I didn't see anything.

But recently about 1 and a half months ago I came back home due to quarantine. The activities started up again with the green car and the blonde guy being everywhere and I even see him on my daily walks at the walking track.

I've told a lot of people but I have no proof and even if I did take pictures I end up looking like a crazy person because there is more than one car and you look like a paranoid person taking a photograph of them on. I don't know what to do. I feel likeI'm just being paranoid and imagining all of this. Why would someone do this? They wouldn't and so I'm constantly questioning if this is all in my head.

Advice please?? :( There have been more incidents but I can't write them all since I forgot some of them, these are just the main ones I remember.",18Apr2020,2
854,"I’m from a city, and recently moved back home from my college due to Coronavirus. My family has a house, and on the other side of the street, is apartments. You can kinda see through windows if they’re open. When I was a senior in HS, my dad thought he saw a neighbor across the street looking into my room with binoculars and became very concerned however I never saw this myself and my Dad is a worrier and overprotective so I didn’t know if he was imagining things. Anyways, I like to leave my windows slightly open during the day to let in light but I try to be somewhat cautious but mostly forgot upon coming home. Today, I was getting ready, looked out the window, and this old man was staring into my room, might’ve had binoculars, and that window has been uncovered for a few days now. I freaked out and closed all of my windows and they will remain closed especially when changing or doing anything of the sort but I am scared for my safety. This man knows I live here, and at any moment upon leaving now I’m a little scared. I regularly go running and go to get groceries and when quarantine isn’t happening I am out late with my friends and come home very late.

855,"My reasoning is probably illogical, but, y'know, mental illness. 

I've been having an extremely hard time lately. With Covid not letting me leave my house except for work, a lot of my friendships have started to slip up a little bit due to neither of us maintaining them through text - which is obviously 50% my fault, but that's not the point of this post so whatever. But because of that, I don't really talk to anyone often enough right now to justify suddenly venting all my feelings to them, except for one person. With that one person, though, we went through a major falling out at the end of last year. We're better now, but I'm still really afraid of fucking things up with this person, and the thought of talking to them in excess about my feelings right now makes me horribly anxious. I'm very emotionally distant from pretty much everyone in my family, I don't have a therapist, and because of personal reasons I don't feel comfortable talking to a random stranger about how I feel through some kind of chat line. 

I'm not a danger to myself or anyone else, but bottling all my feelings up for what has been around 6 months by now is seriously exacerbating the depression I thought I finally had under control. I don't know what my options are. I'm tired of pretending like I'm fine to everyone around me when in actuality I'm the worst I've been in months, but I don't know what else I can do. 

This got a bit more edgy and depressing than anticipated, but if anyone has any idea what I could do in this situation, any advice would be seriously appreciated.

861,"Okay so the title is only dipping into the surface of my issue. I am a 19 year old female, who lives in Michigan. I am currently living with my parents. They’re pretty strict sometimes but overall they kinda give me freedom. My dad is a real mess. He was recently caught cheating on my mom officially for like half a year. As you know, COVID is happening prettyyyy heavy in michigan, especially near Genesee County. Ive been really depressed with all the fighting and negativity that happens in this house and always have. For context, Ive been diagnosed with chronic depression and generalized anxiety since I was around 15 years old. I normally work two jobs and can distract myself enough to where it doesn’t bother me AS much but right now I feel like Im more depressed than ever. Ive tried a variety of antidepressants and nothing worked, so no comments about going on meds pls :’) Anyways, I talk with a psychologist over zoom at the moment since we can’t meet in person. She recently told me Im really depressed because of the environment I live in and that its just too toxic to handle for my weakened mentality to begin with. She asked if I had anywhere to stay and I didn’t really know what to say since my boyfriend is the only one who lives remotely near me at the moment. We’ve been dating for over 4 years so I thought maybe I could ask since it was my mental health on the line. I was disappointed when he told me “Well I don’t know what you can do either... I guess just try and make it better the best you can at your house for now.” It kinda broke my heart that he didn’t even think about it ... because Im the type of person who would do that at the drop of a hat. For more context, my boyfriend lives with his older brothers, who are around 34 and 36. He’s the same age as me as well. 

My question is... should I just drop it and try my best to push through the terrible-ness at my house..? Even if its not really good for me.? Or should I pry a little more. For context, he shut me down before I could really explain all the details and say it was only temporary. I feel awful burdening him with such a harsh request like moving in. I also own a bird, a cat, and a dog but my brother told me he’d watch the bird and cat at the house. Id just have to take the dog which my boyfriend wouldn’t care because before COVID I would always bring her over to play with his dog and cat. 

Also, it would only be temporary until I could find my own place since he’s made it very clear he doesn’t want to move out anytime soon.

863,"I didn’t grow up with role models, I grew up around people I didn’t want to be like. Money has been a problem for my family my whole life. I’ve been around wealthy people before and I’m addicted to the life style, I refuse to settle for the cards that I’ve been dealt. I didn’t do to well in school due to the fact that I dealt with trauma at a young age (no I didn’t get touched). But I’ve always been focused on more important things such as researching the ethics of business and things that will actually improve my life , not algebra. I’m enrolled in a business course right now, I’ve always had a businessman mentality and I’m obsessed with wealth. My plan is to start my own decorative concrete company. What is the most reasonable way to go about this ? I know I need a decent amount of cash to start a company.

864,"For this post, I'm going to call my sister Kim. I am currently 18 and she is a year or two younger than me. Not going into detail. I'll also preface that she knows about this post since I asked her permission to ask you guys, to which she agreed to. So if you want to speak to her directly in your answers, then that's fine. 

Oh, where do I even begin? This is going to be a long one. 

She recently messaged me, saying that she had something she wanted to tell me but didn't want to talk to me face-to-face about. I egged her on pretty harshly about it as I was dying from curiosity. That was until she sent me a multiple page PowerPoint presentation explaining that she realized that she may be suffering from DID ( Dissociative identity disorder) and/or OSDD ( Other Specified Dissociative Disorders). I'm not going to share this PowerPoint with you guys due to anonymity reasons. 

Before I continue on, let me also preface that I have suffered from depression, paranoia, rare reoccurring random sounds and voices in my head, and some pretty creepy episodes of physical hallucinations in the past (I saw a therapist about my problems and am now fine.) I don't know anything about psychology, but this has me thinking that we lost the genetic lottery. 

Now then, moving on. Kim has told me that she has suffered from the symptoms I'm about to list since the second grade, but hasn't told anyone about it because she didn't want them to think that she was crazy. She has only talked to her closest friends and also me about it. Kim has emphasized that she refuses to let our family find out about it since she believes that they would doubt and alienate her. 

She claims to:

* Have around nine alters within her head. They all have different appearances and personalities, and she has also given each of them a name. 
* Kim said that one of them is always ""fronting"" but I don't really understand what she means by this. To me, she has always seemed like the same Kim. I'll admit that she has random bouts of unexplainable anger and hate towards me, which could support this.
*  She also says that she has a little amnesia based on who is fronting. In the past, I have noticed that her memory is very bad. We both watch a bit of anime and it is common for her to forget entire plots and character casts a year after watching it while I remember most things from anime that I watched years ago. 
* She says that she hears random sentences and monologues of her alters in her head. An example she gave was from last night when she was trying to sleep. One of her alters commented something like ""Okay tictok is so great."" Another one then said ""Mmm no, ever baked a pie."" She experiences random monologues like this in her head throughout the day. 
* The voices are definitely coming from her head. I asked her specifically that. 
* She has begun to refer to herself as ""we"" and this worries me immensely. 

A quote from her that I don't really know how to paraphrase: "" We've got like this inner world place, look the more I talk about it the more I feel insane an overthink it. Just know I've already researched everything and I would tell u I have osdd if I wasnt absolutely sure. However theres this one alter who is constantly doubting it, and its frustration lmao"".

I asked her many questions about her experience in order to figure it out the best for myself. I shall present this upcoming section in a Q&amp;A format. 

**Q:**  ""Are one of the alters violent or give you violent thoughts, tendencies, etcetera?"" 

**A:**  ""Eh we still figuring everyone out. I know we've got a gatekeeper, 2 host, a protector, and a little. Ur talking about a persecutor, then yeah we've got him too, but he's not very active and hes the most disconnected from the host""

**Q:**  ""Can you define these terms? Gatekeeper, host, protector, and little?"" 

**A:**  ""Yaaa so gatekeeper keeps and decides who's allowed to front, host are people who front the most for the longest time. Core is the person who identifies with the body and holds the farthest back memories. Protector is an alter made for like stress. Someone who tries to protect the system and stuff. Like only fronts when triggered by a situation where the system would need to be protected? Then little is a very young alter, ours is like 10. Persecutor is an alter made for like stress relief and basic spends most their time making bad decisions and influencing other alters lol.  We're still figuring out everyone's roles, but ik alters are made and developed for certain reasonsss.""

I have not asked any more questions. What I have decided for the time being and told her is that:

""Right now I'm planning to speak to my therapist and make a deal. I'll refer him to you under the circumstance that he does not speak of any of it to our family. He will agree to that, but if you speak about anything physically threatening or harmful to yourself or your surroundings, then he will be forced to tell people.""

She responded with:

""That's okay, I'm not a threat to myself or anyone. All things considered I think we have it pretty under control. I told my councilor I had a friend and explained some things to her, pretending it was a friend not me. She said we should see a physiatrist who takes our health insurance. Anyways maybe try to see if he understand did first? I hear some people dont believe in it and I dont wanna end up in a situation where someone tries to tell me I dont exist.""

Where do I go from here? I'm taking this very seriously. Mental health is no joke. I know that, especially after going through some bad episodes in the past. Since I trust her, I'm assuming that she's not messing with me or doing this for attention. 

On a side note, after this conversation was over, she told me:

""Okay dont overthink it. I wasnt really planning for u to go detective mode lmao.  I'm just vibin with my new self.""

This whole thing has got me a little thrown off. I'm going to treat her the same as always though.",18Apr2020,3

867,"Hi! This is gonna be long so bare with me

We've been friends for over 2 years. I met him my freshman year of college (I'm currently a junior) and it was clear he was interested in me from the beginning. Long story short, we talked for awhile, eventually kissed (thats the furthest we've gone) and I eventually asked him what his intentions were. He said he didn't want a relationship at the time and we left off on good terms and stayed as good friends. Sophomore year came along and we still stayed as friends and he would ask to hang out here and there but we never did anything physical or anything.

Summer entering this school year, things changed completely. We began to talk a lot through Snap, he would tag me on things on Facebook. Immediately when classes started in August, he asked me to hang out which then became a consistent thing throughout the year. From August to March, he did a lot of things for me such as: asked to hangout a lot more often, always pay for my coffee several times, always try to hold my hand when we hung out, bought me wine, cooked for me (even bought me a steak because I specifically asked for one), asked to hang out in the city and Facetime over winter break. We were at two parties together this year and he stayed by my side the whole time which was unusual because the past two years he would be hooking up with other girls. At one of those parties, I was dancing close with another guy and I knew he got jealous but just didn't say anything. Anyways, he also remembered my birthday and bought me a bottle of wine after I jokingly asked for one. At my party, I got really drunk and was apparently flirting with his friends and one of his friends the next day told me he looked stressed when I did that.

Fast forward to March, our school required all of us to leave because of COVID19. The day before we all left, he asked to hangout with me because he said ""this might be the last time I see your face."" We get coffee, he pays and holds my hand. Eventually, we go back to my room and we talk for a bit. Eventually, he asks if I wanted him to kiss me and I say no. He asks why and I say I'm not good at this physical stuff (By physical I mean like kissing/making out - i have no experience) and he ensures me its fine. I say I'm only comfortable with just the cheek and he just kisses me on the cheek and kind of just makes out with my neck. We then cuddle for 2 hours. Later that same night, I go to the bar with friends and I get a text from him saying he's coming too. I dance with my guy friends and then later, I see him hooking up (making out) with another girl. I then got kind of pissed so I find another guy where I eventually sit on his lap and I knew he saw it.

I like him but I'm still confused on whether he wanted a relationship or not but I’m leaning more that he did want one and just started to realize this now.

I know I should’ve asked what his intentions were but I feel like he should be the one making it clear if his intentions from freshman year changed — not me. I'm not sure if I should reach out because I don't know if he still has feelings for me or if he even thinks about everything that has happened. We’ve barely talked since all of this happened (it’s been around a month

Should I reach out or just move on and wait for someone who’s more mature and has better communication skills? I’m tired of the immature games and not knowing. I’m well aware that I need some growing up to do too and need to work on communicating better

tl;dr: I don’t know this guy wanted to just hookup or wanted an actual relationship. Should I reach out or just move on",18Apr2020,0

I’m 19 and have history of mental health problems (anxiety and depression), I finally feeling like I’m starting to do well and live good life, however recently I can’t stop thinking about all bad decisions and things I did over last 2 years whilst blackout drunk or being intoxicated like;

1) Whilst very drunk I made racist comment and jokingly said “N- word” few times too Asian taxi driver. Was a joke and not aggressively aimed at him but obviously very inappropriate and horrible to say! 

2) Got very drunk and waited outside club for my ex to confront her and then screamed/shouted at her about all things she did and dumping me! Embarrassing and had full mental breakdown.

3) Whilst drunk, a ex told me I had grabbed her and touched her bum inappropriately multiple times (obviously sincerely apologised next day). In same night I had made claims of sexual encounter which I can’t remember. Still to this day, don’t know whether I made it up or not- very worrying. 

4)In club I was so drunk and just ran upto random girl and just kissed her out of blue. Luckily she reciprocated but would have turned out very different in another worse scenario ! 

All of these things make me really anxious and I wonder what else might have happened whilst drunk. I am much better now and try to drink responsibly going forward but still feel guilty!

my sister is a 32 year old mom of 3 with a husband who loves her but is also not the best partner. she’s voiced her struggles with me a lot about being depressed and constantly having anxiety. this ranges anywhere from her feeling trapped (quarantine isn’t helping) at home/in life to feeling unfulfilled in her life.

It's clear she's very insecure about her weight, which has brought out some negative qualities about her.

887,"Hi all. Long post ahead. Sorry about that.

So, my mother has depression for about 20 years now. 

It (presumably) all started with my parents moving from an ex-USSR country to Portugal to get a better life around year 2000. At the time, I was a kid (10) and couldn't really understand what was going on until later.

After a year or two, my father was working the whole week away and was only around for the weekends. So, me, my mother and my brother would stay the whole week on our own. We had enough money to live a basic life, but there were no family trips nor vacations.

For the first 2 years, my mother also worked at a factory. I remember clearly that during the first summer she got really upset with the factory owner because he wouldn't pay her the vacation subsidy (which, by norm, everyone received in Portugal). I remember her crying and actually drifting in her thoughts regarding going back to our homeland. After this instance, she quit working, and was a stay-at-home mom. I don't really know why since me and my brother were at school all day anyway.

We had a hill near where we lived, and it had a cross on top (I don't know why), and we could see it from our kitchen window. On one instance she started hallucinating/imagining that our father, who was at work 400+ km away, would come to the top of the hill on a flying car and would take us back to our homeland. She also claimed that only her phone had connection to our origins.

Many times only me and her were at home and she would start talking with herself and complaining that people were plotting against her. Then rage at me for no apparent reason. I was a kid, not really knowing what to do with that information. I was trying my best to please her but it was hard since many of her complaints were out of my reach, and I felt helpless. And after any verbal confrontation between my mother and our neighbours (they happened from time to time, always started from her side), I had no other alternative than to apologize for her words and to feel ashamed of it like it was me who did it.

There are other episodes that I remember but I think one can understand that something was not right.

Me nor my father/brother don't recall her having any depression symptoms before our coming to Portugal.

Important note: she did not receive any treatment in Portugal for years. Reasons for that: 

\- she never acknowledged that she is depressed. When confronted with facts regarding what she did, she would throw the fault at someone else: our neighbours, my father, us (kids), God, etc.

\- she did not adapt to the culture nor language, thus it impossible to find a treatment for her that would be in a language that she would understand.

\- our finances were already too stretched, so some private treatment was not really possible.

\- we couldn't/can't send her to get treatment against her own will. Something serious needed to happen in order to get an arrest/lockdown warrant. Gladly she didn't do nothing serious.

After some years of this, my dad made the decision of sending her back to our homeland to get treatment there. I'm not going to lie, the moment she left was like a huge weight lifted from everyone's shoulders. At last I had peace at home. But in reality, the problem didn't disappear, it just went somewhere else.

There she stood with her mother, and my granny later on managed to send her to get treatment to a psychiatric hospital. After coming back from the hospital, she was indeed a different person, but that change did not last long. About 5-6 month later, she would stop taking her medication and then roll back to the same state of ""they're plotting against me"". 

At this point in time, all friendships my mom had were gone, so she was completely alone. She even turned against her own mother, for some reason. So, without friends, without an occupation, without a goal in life, she would just stay at home and relapse again and again into depression. She was hospitalised 2 or 3 times more.

When I was around 20, my father decided to also go back to try to amend things. And for some time she got better, but still remained at home and still without friends. Later on they came back to Portugal, and she relapsed again. So, back again to receive treatment and then again to Portugal.

Even when she's fresh after getting treatment, she still won't acknowledge that she was/is depressed. She still says the problem is with the others, not with her.

Now, after this introduction, I am writing to /r/advice because I really need an advice regarding what I can do regarding this. 

I'm sure she'll relapse again. She will eventually stop taking medication again. She will say again that it's not doing anything. And we can't really force her to take it. 

Currently she's basically at home all the time. She cooks, cleans, sees random youtube videos. And by random, I really mean random. And the weird thing is that it really doesn't seem she's watching, she's just looking. 

What can I do to at least help her find something interesting for her to do so that she at least gains some interest **in something?**",18Apr2020,1

I understand that it’s a job, and they need one, but going to multiple stores in a day isn’t appropriate.

891,"So I had a... kinda drama thing with my ex. We had originally just said goodbye and were cool with each other (no contact still) and then his new girl blocked me on socials (all fine no worries) but then she still looked at my story on Snapchat and unblocked me to block me again. It was petty but I made a post calling her out bc it bothered me and creeped me out. It wasn’t cool and I know I should have gone to him. My reason for not was a bit of anger still and I just did not want to speak to him. My friend ended up screenshotting it and sending it to him (she told me after and I didn’t really mind). He texted me we talked about it in a kinda aggressive manor but not like crazy arguing. I was rude and just said I’d delete the post and asked to be left alone and then I blocked him on everything. The thing I need advice on is that I feel bad. Like I owe him an apology. But I also know he doesn’t want to talk to me and I don’t want to speak to him either. The idea of it makes me feel uncomfortable and uneasy. I just want to move on with my life as he is doing. Is there anything I could do? 

Ps: I know this probably sounds childish and dumb. It is. I just hate the fact that I was kinda rude to him again even though yes I was the one who caused the conversation in the first place. I did something dumb and feel dumb. I just know that he wouldn’t want me to contact him again so I cannot apologize even if I feel like I should.",18Apr2020,1

I have three kids, the youngest of which is 2 and he has never met. He was a shitty dad and I never plan on speaking to him again. I have been getting so sick and tired of the messages so I texted him today (today is my birthday and I got the text at like 6 this morning). My text reads ""You'd think after 5 years of not responding to you that you'd get the hint that I want absolutely nothing to do with you. Don't text me anymore. Don't ask about me anymore. You will not see me, (husband), or the kids ever. They will not know who you are. Lose my number. You and your wife are toxic people.""

901,"Sorry for the long post but stick with me. I truly need advice. 

So my husband and I just moved to our dream house in Connecticut. It’s in a small town and it has a nature preserve in the backyard which we though would be awesome for privacy. 

Our one real neighbor is very nice old man, but on the very first day I saw a family of four bears in his yard. I am used to bears and thought I would let him know since earlier in the day he was spreading bird seed out. I was expecting him to have a reaction like “oh thanks for letting me know, I will stop with the bird seed for a while” but no his response shocked me. He said “yea I have been feeding them they love the bird seed and I buy bulk bags of corn!”  I was shocked since that’s the number one rule when it comes to rural communities. Don’t feed the bears! We have seen them everyday and they are not scared of us our our dog. They seem docile but it’s a mom with three cubs so she might become aggressive. I have a toddler and am nervous for her to play in the beautiful backyard. I spoke to him about it and he said he hasn’t noticed the bears that are there every day! I called the resident state trooper who said there unfortunately is no law about feeding the bears and he will report it to the DEEP. I also reported it to them and they said if they are not causing damage there isn’t much we can do! Seems counterintuitive to wait for something bad to happen before taking action. 

So I got my neighbor to stop with the corn. I thought Awesome, this is all resolved. That is until the next day. The night before I had seen two foxes and a pretty good sized coyote in his backyard. He came over to my yard the next day to chat and I mentioned it to him. They guy was not surprised and began to explain that he has been leaving out chicken!!!! I mean a random walk through is expected but this guy is literally trying to lure animals to the yard, insane! 

The DEEP’s budget has been cut so much here they made it seem like there isn’t much they can do. And this is a new neighbor, I don’t want to start a war, but I am getting increasingly worried. I don’t want the guy arrested but I am honestly at a loss for what to do at this point. 

Any advice would be appreciated, maybe a way to deter them from our yard but not injure my dog who has an electric fence and can roam freely.

Flash forward it’s now April and nothing has changed he’s speaking about moving to the bigger town a few hundred miles away and being homeless and I can’t help but feel guilty and like I failed as a son but at the same time I have my family and I need to put them first 

I want to help him I’ve done everything in my power to but yet i still feel helpless I’ve spent thousands of dollars housing him and trying to help him and I cannot do more 

I feel guilty I’m afraid he won’t make it and I’m afraid of what may happen to him 

Do you think there is anything I can do to help him more should I let him stay with me longer and keep hoping he is gonna do more or should I just work through the guilt and let him do his thing and live with the fact that I put him on the street

910,"This is going to be a long one unfortunately but I'll try to keep it concise.

Basically, I had a girlfriend a couple of years ago and after we broke up we had a weird relationship. Went from not talking to talking and doing bf and gf stuff but not labelling it etc (this is important for later).

Now, regarding this girl, she has a few problems in terms of her mental health and her family. She has a family that hates her for pretty much no reason at all with her dad who tried to even strangle her. She didn't deserve any of that. 

During my final year of university, in the final half of my final year there was a group of people that would try breaking into her flat and getting to her (still don't know who they were and why they did it), and it was constant. So she ended up living with me. However, for as long as I've known her she's struggled with mental health issues such as depression and it came to the point where I was trying to stop her from killing herself maybe a few times a week. It was tough on both of us and my mental health, which was already fragile, was taking a hit. (Imagine trying to support someone when you can't support yourself).

Anyway, uni finishes and summer passes by and we're still friends and she's still living at my old flat to stay away from home. Eventually she has no choice but to go home and ends up homeless because of her parents. So, come to the end of the year and she loses her shit when she finds out that I don't want to be in that type of relationship anymore or get married or anything. We then talk about it and then for the first time ever, I kind of wanted to be free. I hated how I've not been happy for years and I wanted to start fresh. I simply didn't have anything left in the tank to give her. But I was going to continue to support her but I didn't want a relationship like we had before anymore. Things gets toxic and she shows me like a list of ""why OP is bad"" and it had dumb stuff like ""takes too long to reply to a text"" or ""doesn't surprise me anymore."" A month of back and forths later she grows distant and we part ways. 

A couple months ago we had an exchange where she wanted some of her things I had and it was weird. She started calling me an abuser etc and it did hurt me. However, I thought I'd send her stuff and that's it. Leave me alone type thing because she's obviously upset.

Fast forward and she's posting on Reddit about how I abused her etc and every week she'd post something new but add a new thing. Her most recent was that I had anally raped her and was also a murderer. She blames me for her lack of friends and how I kept her from everyone, when in actual fact she saw everyone as beneath her and just acquaintances. I wished she had friends to even give me some alone time. All of this shook me to my core, not because I was guilty but because she was actively trying to ruin my future career and education by trying to find a way for me to not get into university again or in my chosen career. I've never had strangers wish bad things upon me until I saw her posts. As well as this, I knew that shit sticks. Once you're accused on social media, you're done.

Now, I was at work and people have been messaging me asking what's going on. I find out that she's posted me on twitter with some random screenshots. One from an argument we had, one from a set of tweets that were about literally nobody and one where I was angry and said something like I was going to kill her. Granted that was bad and i did lose total composure during that argument and we actually apologised to each other that same day. She  has used this to paint me as a violent abuser. I don't have the chats to refute anything because I deleted them. So all people get it's one side and  nowadays that's all people need. The anxiety for the past couple of weeks has me feeling sick at work and I'm not someone who typically experiences this type of thing. 

Honestly, I don't know what to do. I'm happy to answer any questions people may have. I've been looking to see if I can sue her or anything. Thanks for taking the time.",18Apr2020,1

She obviously was bothered by it and said ""wow, that was not okay."" I think both parties brushed it off and were seemingly playful afterward. She later grabbed the baton and slapped him on his ass pretty hard, causing laughter from both parties.

Hi, I’m a 25 yo nurse in the U.K. who usually works in the operating theatre, and I have done ever since I qualified nearly 5 years ago. I have recently been redeployed to a covid positive ward (80% of the staff I work with have also been sent to various wards under the same circumstances.) 
I have been on the wards a short while and I am having an extremely difficult time, I have no idea how to be a nurse on the ward or how to deal with situations which could potentially seriously harm someone’s life. However, this is expected of me, or is expected of me after a short time of being on the wards.
I am not one to cry, or even become sad. In normal circumstances I would say I become upset a small handful of times in a year. 
I have cried every night this week without fail and had an overwhelming feeling of fear and anxiety just thinking about what’s waiting for me on my next shift. Not only that, I don’t know anyone who works there, I was sent to that ward alone and when I asked if I could be sent with someone, anyone I know they said no. I also live alone, so I basically do not see anyone I know ever.
At this point I have no idea what to do, a part of me is hoping I show symptoms of corona virus so I have an excuse not to go to work (I would never intentionally put my self at risk.)I am scared to phone in for mental health reasons, and I feel completely ashamed and a pathetic nurse for not being able to help for more than a week on a corona ward.
