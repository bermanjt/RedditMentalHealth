0,"I scored a 92 on the ASVAB and would like to join the Air Force, but I was told my teeth will most likely disqualify me unless I get them repaired. They have been neglected for most of my childhood and teenage years. I am now 25 and only started caring about my dental health when it was too late and I only had a handful left to care about. I do not have dental insurance and most procedures, other than pulling, are VERY costly. I can’t afford $30,000 implants, but I would not be against dentures. What are my options for affordable repair/ accommodation?

Edit: in case this is important info; I am from the US

2nd edit: I just counted and (I know I’m an idiot for letting it get this bad. I hate my self for it.) I have 19 teeth total and only 7 are completely intact. The rest have major cavities or are missing pieces.",05Jul2020,1
1," 

Went to her surprise birthday party today and we all were lined up shoulder to shoulder to surprise her and after the surprise she went around hugging everyone. She hugs the person to my left I extend my arms a little ready to hug and she skips me and hugs the person to my right. I'm a dude for context and she hugged all the other dudes too. We're close friends and man this just hurt.

What does this mean? I feel so bad after this. I even made her a handmade present for her birthday when some people didn't even bring one. I also bought her a milkshake.

3,"I want to tell my mum that I’ve finally decided what I want to do when I grow up, I haven’t been able to decide for years, but I know that the career I want isn’t one she wants me to do.  Also, my career of choice - if it helps - is racing driver.  Luckily, my mum will *support* me in anything I do - even if she doesn’t agree with it. My mum and my relationship with each other is great by the way.  My dad is a diehard racing fan, so maybe I should tell him first?  I just want to tell my mum without her getting wound up (a mixture of stressed and annoyed for you non-Brits out there) with me.  Any help?  Obviously I don’t expect you to tell me exactly how to word it, but a little help on how I may be able to would be great :)   Sorry if I haven’t given enough info, I gave as much as I could without going into personal stuff.",05Jul2020,2
4,"For years now, I have lived in the countryside, surrounded by barley, pig, dairy, and ovine farms. I 99% of the time, buy from a local butcher, who is sold meat from the farms in the area, and I can trace it back, to the animal. 

I've visited the farms in the area (being a friendly neighbor and such, as well as being a farmhand in the summer) and I know the animals are treated with love and care, and they live it pristine, ethical conditions. 

I've watched hundreds of animals go from birth to plate, and been there, every step (aside from butchery) and I continue to buy from the local butcher, eventhough the food is much more expensive

Recently I was harassed online by a group of vegan/vegetarian activists, calling me a socio/psychopath, saying I was a sadistic, horrible person, all because I posted a video, of the life of a cow, from birth to plate.

I made this video, to show that not all farms are giant, industrial, horrific factory farms and that the animals in farms actually have a nice life, and are treated with utmost care. Now, of course these factory farms utterly disgust me, that's why I work with and around local farms

Don't get me wrong, I have no issues with vegans/vegetarians, so long as they aren't trying to push/guilt trip people into becoming like them. It's a personal lifestyle choice, that I simply cannot get behind

I just wanted to ask if anyone has had a similar experience, or knows how I can deal with this",05Jul2020,1
5,"I was unemployed for a good 1 and a half years after I graduated from college. I got a BS on Computer Science. I got hired for a trainee position for a Game Dev Company as a Game Programmer 4 months ago. I was happy to finally take part in making games for a living because that was my dream. It started out very well, but as time went on I found it harder to keep up with the material during training. Now I find myself underperforming and a week late on one of my tasks. I can feel myself getting laid off in a weeks time. I feel as if I've failed myself, my parents, and everyone who told me I could do it. I feel like I've dug myself into a hole. I coundn't even make it through the training phase. I feel like I've wasted my degree. Now that I've come face to face with the reality that my dream job wasn't for me, I feel like I've lost direction in life. What does someone whos lost do at times like these?

6,"I'll preface this with the fact that I'm a 20 year old guy, at home from school, and my parents are pretty controlling. Anyway my family still wants to go on vacation this year and have chosen Orange Beach. We're supposed to be leaving this Friday, but I don't want to go. I'm really worried about getting COVID and having to spend the rest of my summer in quarantine or worse. I also don't wanna risk getting anyone else sick as I work for Instacart, and my girlfriend works for an assisted living facility. Now if I brought my girlfriend into it things would not go well as they don't really like her and just tolerate her.

Now Orange Beach is considered a COVID hot spot and is rated very high risk by the Alabama Health Department. They're insistent on going, but the closer we get I'm feeling nervous about it. But also I'm feeling anxious about talking to them about not going because I know it'll be a huge fight. Can anyone give me some guidance?",05Jul2020,1
7,"With the pandemic and lockdown measures, I've been having a hard time accepting loved ones' choices to do things that I deem to be ""unsafe"" or contrary to what I deem to be ""good for society."" For example, if a family member doesn't socially distance and goes to hang out with a friend during Covid-19. Or when a close friend travels out of state to socialize over 4th of July weekend. On one hand, I feel I'm being too rigidly moral and that stressing over other peoples' actions is costing me my peace. On the other hand, coronavirus is really serious and cases are only rising in the US. I also would like to think that I surround myself with people who understand the gravity of the issue. 

TLDR; I need advice on how to maintain my own peace without being distressed over other peoples' actions that I can't control. Also, how to separate someone's actions from their character.",05Jul2020,1

11,"My parents recently found my bud. My dad is a somewhat conservative Muslim man and my mom is a little more understanding, but the problem is they would have never expected me to use drugs. Im a 4.0student, I have never gotten in trouble in school, and I have a clear set of plans for college/ the future. Naturally, they are disappointed and shocked beyond words. Obviously, weed isn't completely bad for you and Im not even a regular smoker, but that excuse would obviously not be enough for them. (I know some parents are chill and could brush this off in a few days but coming from a traditional Middle Eastern culture, it isnt so easy to just brush it off. ) However, I think its important to mention that my two older siblings have both faced addiction in the past and now my parents dont want to let me be the third to have to deal with a potential addicition in the making (not necessarily to weed but to harder drugs). I truly dont believe that would have happened, since I havent been using it excessively or developed a dependence. Im a relatively introverted person and I value and love my parents beyond words. After all, they are all I have and they have been given me their all since day one. I dont want them to believe I wanted to repay their efforts by betraying them. The trust they had is now completely broken, which I understand, but it breaks my heart that they will never see me the same way again. They feel very hurt and so do I.

Due to the Quarantine, her condition seems to be much worse. Following you're advice... I took her to the doctor of those things (sorry my vocabulary is small). They took her away for 3 days, making her wear the leather thingy. (because she would resist them, thrashing around uncontrolled.) 

She got out because ""she no longer shows signs that she needs to be put there any further or what not"". 

After she got out, she was TOTALLY UNRESPONSIVE. She got home and she would just sit down and sulk. She wouldn't talk to me. She should just cry and accuse me of leaving her. How????????????????????",05Jul2020,0

14,"Bit of an odd title, I know, hear me out.

My best friend (who I met at university) has a history of being sexually abused as a child. Over the past few years, she's opened up about it, enrolled in psychotherapy, and found charities that can help with her specific trauma. 

However, with the lock down in the UK pushing her ability to get help back 3-4 months, she's currently unable to stop herself from self harming. We have a very open relationship, and she has told me face to face that she feels like she has to attempt suicide in order for her health to be taken seriously so she can get the help she needs. I've discussed sectioning with her, and she has said that she's okay with me making the decision to get her sectioned. I plan on making the call this week as I've seen her at her worst and there's been a few nights where I've had to bandage her up covered in blood and I can't deal with that anymore.

What I'm asking for advice on, is how can I best make sure that her mental state is taken seriously after making the call? If anyone has sectioned a loved one before, what was it like, how can I make sure the authorities understand how bad she really is? 

 She won't be kicking and screaming having a meltdown when it happens most likely, and we're both fearful that will be taken as ""not that bad"" when really she is probably a few glasses of wine away from taking her own life.",05Jul2020,1
15,"I am a junior in high school now and I have always kept to myself and been an introvert. I havent gone to any parties, dated anyone, or had a close friend group. I have friends at school but I don't talk to them outside of school much besides playing video games with them every once an a while. This is mostly due to how my main friend group became toxic and the ""leader"" bullied me into leaving in middle school. From there, I had a hard time finding a friend group that did everything that I did as they were all I talked and hung out with.

I have gotten new friends, but some of them are from different groups and don't like the same things (ex, one group of friends likes magic the gathering and other 'nerdy stuff' while the other plays games like DBD and Valorant). I want to expand out of my comfort zone and go to parties and hang out with people outside of video games and the internet (this is how it was before covid and stuff too). 

As for the snapchat thing, I feel this is part of the problem. I have it but I only send streaks and do nothing with it. From seeing other people, I think that by using it more, I can get more confident talking to others. I just don't know how to start talking to people. I have a sh\*t ton of people added and when I do yolos and stuff or post to my story to 'hmu' no one talks. What can I do to change this?   

I have looked for advice but usually the advice is ""just be confident"" or ""ask them to do something,"" but especially now with covid, what can I do? And ""just be confident"" isn't going to help me. I just want to be more out there and have fun during my high school years.",05Jul2020,1
16,"I had an on-off series of romantic times with my best friend during and after HighSchool. We never actually did anything other than the “oh, I like you. NO I like you! But right now isn’t the right time” bullshit, and I eventually realized I was just being stung along as either a backup or the “always be there under my thumb” guy, so I asked for time away. She blew up at me and called me every name in the book, so I blocked her and moved on. However, whenever I think of her (which I try not to do) I get a feeling of spite. 

This all leads to today, my parents and I took a road trip to visit my grandparents in my hometown (where we both grew up). Trust me, I know it was a bad idea with COVID but I was forced into it. She happens to see my mother in a store, and messaged me on an old number that she had that I didn’t think to block. I thought I would make small talk for the sake of politeness, but I fucked up there.

She lives in another country that I visited 4 months ago, that was when I finally saw her. I felt connected to her, she used to give me little kisses but she told me she didn’t want something serious because she’s planning on finishing college before having a relationship. 
One day I asked her to make a playlist for my trip back and the day I was leaving she sent me the playlist, I felt like she was trying to tell me something with those songs. And she keeps adding love songs to the playlist to this day. But we don’t talk. 
I feel like some of her tweets are for me, but I also have my insecurities thinking that I’m probably hallucinating and it could be for someone else or no one. I don’t know if she likes me, I also don’t know if she’s trying to tell me something adding songs to that playlist she made specially for me (which actually is named as me lol).
We don’t talk by text because I feel like we don’t really talk, as if there’s something that won’t let us be open to each other. When we were in person it felt all nice, we could spend the whole night drinking wine, listening to music and talking about everything. I miss that and I really would like to know her a bit more, or at least talk to her without feeling this pressure and overthinking if she likes me or not. 
I really would like some advice, I also haven’t told this to my friends because they’re also friends with her, and my best friend is her sister lol so I wouldn’t like her to tell that girl about my feelings.

20,"Last few months have been rather difficult for me. I was already dealing with depression pre - quarantine, but with my college closing, living alone in a small apartment and not being able to go out for the most part; i closed off more and more. Days, weeks, months, it all blurred together and i spent most of my time constantly tired, asleep and/or not doing anything at all. When i think back to this time period, pretty much all i can remember is blankness and nothingness.

This week, though, something has changed. It feels like i am slowly waking up, or trying to wake up for a long, long nap. I am ready to make an effort and get professional help, it's going to be a long road but i don't want to live this way anymore. So i will try.

In the meantime... it feels like i have forgotten how to be a human being. I have no interest in hobbies i once used to love, and with nothing to do except sit in my house all day, I want to slowly learn how to be a functioning individual once again. I am wondering if anyone has suggestions that i could implement to my daily life. How do i start over, what are some things i could do to start feeling human again and to feel joy again?

With my saved income floating around everyone is telling me I shouldn't be saving just yet and that to treat myself. So I did I bought myself a new monitor.

52,"i have video/audio recording of my dad and his girlfriend being abusive to me. 
i haven’t seen my dad in about a week and he only ever communicates via text. 

recently, ever since i left the abusive household a week ago, he’s been sending a bunch of hurtful things and i haven’t replied. 

his most recent message, i quote, he said: “If I didn’t love you I wouldn’t say those things to you. You are better than that and you need to be better than that. “

i am tempted to send a video of him being physically/verbally abusive asking “if you loved your daughter, you wouldn’t have ever treated her like this”. 


should i do it? it will probably escalate the problem and add more emotion.
he can never admit to his wrongings and i don’t even think he knows he is abusive. 
or i could send one of his girlfriend doing the same to me. 

i am unsure if i really wanna send it bc i don’t want it to be an immature move (i’m only 20 so obviously i’m not mature). 
and i also don’t want to escalate things more. 
btw my state is a one party consent state so since i’m one party of the video it is legal to share it with my consent i guess? 

i need some advice bc i don’t know what to do. 
most of my items is at my dads house still and i’ve been at my moms place.  and i love my dad and never showing him these videos and knowing he’ll never consider how his gf treats me and how he treats me, hurts. i have no voice or outlet and i feel like i’m going to go down. 

the entire household treats me like shit and i want to move out so bad but i’ll lose my dads support. but if i go back i’ll just keep inviting abuse into my life. 

what do i do????????",05Jul2020,2
53,"Basically him and I had been flirting for around a month and he was constantly gushing to my friend about me and he’d blush and everything and it seemed like he really liked me. Than one night he told my friend he wanted to invite me to formal and asked her if she really thought I liked him.. and he flirted with me for like an hour that night. But when I was talking to my friend he walked up with his friend and than my friend asked me to go find someone with her and I did. I think this made him mad because he sent me a picture of a girl in his room so I was rude back. Than the next day he was angry and telling my friend he wouldn’t take me to formal and him and I talked about it but it was kinda a play fight. 

We tried talking about it the next day for over an hour but we both lied about what made us mad. So we made up but we didn’t discuss the real issues so it didn’t help. Him and I ended up getting in huge fights because of drunk texting and getting really mad but still not communicating why we were mad. I think he got so fed up with me and was over it and he ended up dating the girl he brought to formal instead of me. Him and I didn’t see each other Over those two months.

Eventually, after my winter break him and I started seeing each other our again often and he was obsessively trying to get my attention. He was trying to come up to me or whoever I was talking to every second. He was always smirking or staring at me or walking by me. He would get upset and be cold to me some days and some days he’d be really nice. But it seemed like he was using the girl because he would stare at me while he was talking to her out of the corner of his eye and than he fully turned away from her to talk to me. And when I didn’t want to talk to him he got super upset and stood there looking heartbroken broken than ran away. He also was super rude some days. But basically he was always kinda obsessing over me. These weird hot and cold games lasted for months but I didn’t really respond to him or try to talk to him because I respect relationships. Now they’ve broken up and I’m sure he will try to contact me again when quarantine ends and we are back at school. I just want to be able to communicate with him about what he did and why. I’ve kind of been pushing him away this past semester because I didn’t like that he was trying to get my attention while in a relationship.",05Jul2020,1
54,"I'll try to keep this as short as possible --

One of my friends is upset because she feels left out of 4th of July activities by her family, due to the fact she went to a restaurant and hung out with some friends recently. She lives in California, in a county that's being heavily impacted to the point they're rolling back their attempts to re-open/shutting back down. Her family is very concerned about getting it for a variety of reasons. They didn't disinvite her, they just told her if she comes, she has to stay 6 feet apart, and wear a mask. 

To me, that sounds perfectly fair. I understand it's hot, and a lot will be taking place outside, but she made the choice to see friends closely prior to a family event *knowing* they're paranoid about getting it. 

It doesn't seem like the time to tell her I disagree with them, but I have a really hard time contributing to the conversation when I feel like they're in the right. I've said things ""I'm sorry you're going through that""/ ""if you feel isolated, maybe it's a good sign you should move to the Midwest, where you have family you feel closer to"" etc. She continues to rant, and I just don't know what to say, but I feel like I'd be a horrible friend for ignoring her. 

We live across the country and I'm also working, so I can't offer to do a movie with her or something virtually. 

How can I give her support, despite the fact I don't agree with what she's upset about?",05Jul2020,1

I'm a 25f. When I was in middle school my curiosity about sex awoken. As most of us do, I went on a search to discover what sex was all about. Using porn as my source of information, I discovered that i enjoyed lesbian sex a whole lot more than heterosexual sex at least visually.. In my adult years, I do identify as heterosexual sexual and enjoy hetrosexual sex. I have no desires to be with a woman and have had no physical attraction to them my entire life. I still continue to get off more to lesbian porn than hetrosexual porn on my own time however. Can anyone give me some insight into why this is?",05Jul2020,2

58,"I’m 29 (F) and I have no idea what to do...
This may be a little long, bless you if you actually read it.

I left a job about 4 months ago related to worsening depression and anxiety - I had a mental breakdown while at work. I went to a doctor and it was decided that I should not continue in the position and I was started on a low dose antidepressant. I blamed the job for exacerbating the symptoms, I’ve been dealing with mental health issues for the past couple of years now.

I took the antidepressant for about 4 days and began to experience some pretty bad symptoms: racing heart, excess sweating, and GI issues. I stopped the medication, I did not inform the doctor.

I had a follow up 4 weeks later which was more so focused on emotional and mental aspects, I did not discuss side effects or stopping the medication. I had not gotten any better... surprise. I was ashamed to admit this to the doctor. After the appointment, I started the medication again, second guessing myself as to whether the symptoms were related to the medication or if it was anxiety. Again, I made it about 4 days and began to experience the same effects, possibly worse related to putting myself through the experience a second time. I stopped the medication.
(Side note: I had taken this same antidepressant last year for about 4 months. I noticed feeling fatigued and restless while I was on it, but I attributed this to anxiety and depression. I continued the medication as I thought it would eventually help. All the while, I was paying mind to diet and exercise, and resting as I was able. I came off of the medication as my situation had improved and I began to feel better after stopping it.)

Over the weekend I had began to develop a serious migraine and I was nauseous. I called Monday to inform the doctor. She prescribed a new medication. After reading the side effects, I had a panic attack and called again to schedule an appointment. All the while, I had not been getting consistent sleep - may be 3 to 4 hours per night for the previous 2 weeks. 
I had requested to stop the antidepressant, although I had already stopped it, telling her that I did not experience symptoms like this in the past. She advised against it, but ended up stopping the medication and starting a new antidepressant. The appointment lasted for about 45 minutes as I was excessively talkative, and, also, had a panic attack. I did not start the medication for migraine prevention. 

At this point, I was 5 weeks into being off of work and I have not consistently been on medication. When I came to this realization, I was overwhelmed with anger at myself and drowning in shame. I don’t know why, I couldn’t bring myself to tell her... But, also, I was trying to figure out a reason to live and didn’t think I would be needing the treatment anyways...

A day goes by on the new medication, and I’m still panicky. I woke the following day in a panic attack and decided to admit myself into the hospital. 

The hospital stay was okay: the psychiatrist was great (although doctors make me nervous), the activities were great, and the medication was monitored. However, I was not comfortable at all... I felt the anxiety was worse, partially related to how impulsive the decision for admission was and not considering the implications of the decision. I discharged after 8 days which was against the doctor’s advise... I was ready to be home. 

I returned home and things went well for about a week. I was sleeping okay. I was doing things around the home, taking care of my puppies, journaling, walking, etc. Then, I fell back into the same pattern. 

I’ve had a follow up with a psychiatrist and I’ve been speaking with a psychologist. I don’t particularly enjoy speaking with the psychologist as I don’t like the thought of being psychoanalyzed. I, also, have a hard time opening up to people. I feel like some things are better not to be talked about. 

I should mention that prior to the hospitalization, I had thought my husband was “recording me” and conspiring to construct a law suit against me. During the 2 weeks prior to the hospitalization, I went through an intense period of “flashbacks.” After this, I started to feel a little better and realized the absurdity of the thought. However, around this time, he installed a front porch camera and began to show me videos of myself sitting on the front porch. So, the “delusion” returned and was upheld. He, also, while I was lying in bed after starting the new antidepressant, came through the door and jumped up and down while asking “you thinking people are out to get you?!” He began to laugh. I started to cry and said “no, I don’t truly believe that...” 

During the hospitalization, when I would phone him, he would say things like “I don’t have any proof / evidence of how he treated me” - this was related to him recently stepping down from a position at work and speaking about a co-worker which caused him grief. A different time I called when he was grocery shopping and he asked if he could “get me anything” to which he responded “oh wait, you’re not here.” I begged him to please stop with the antics, that I really wanted to recover and return to work. He replied with “there are not any antics, it’s all in your head” and then stated “oh, *my name* and her career” in a seemingly creepy tone. The whole thing felt off...

On the day I returned home from the hospital, he had gotten me an ivy. It was nice. However, he proceeded to tell me that he was hallucinating and delusional and had thoughts of committing suicide, and then asked “if he should admit himself to the hospital?!” He got into the car and began to drive recklessly away from the home. I called and asked him to please return and told him how much I loved him. He told me he wanted to drive into oncoming traffic. When he returned home, we hugged and I profusely apologized for extra stress I had caused him. In the end, he said “think you’re going to leave me again, huh?” and then turned it off as it things were back to normal.. I was confused by this and chalked it up to a deep seated fear of abandonment. We’ve been together for 11 years and we have never dealt with anything like this... 

Since the hospitalization, he will say certain things which trigger me. He knows what triggers me, although he will claim he doesn’t. I’ve told him absolutely everything - pretty much any thought that crosses my mind - which I know is not exactly healthy. I only put that out there to uphold that he knows what I truly care about and what really worries me. He knows I care about my parents, about them returning and being happy. He knows I love working out and going to yoga. A week after the hospitalization, I was talking on the phone to a friend and discussing returning to work. I asked him to please allow me the time and space for this... he proceeded to phone my brother, which I hadn’t talked to in quite a long time and tells me after the conversation that my brother wants to speak with me at some point to discuss my parent’s retirement and that my brother is in the best place he’s ever been mentally. I sank with stress thinking about planning for my parent’s financially and thinking about not getting to develop a relationship with my brother... he smirked. I was drowning in the stress of needing to be functional enough to get a job and needing to be able to help my parents. I’ve continued to trust him throughout the entire time, but it’s eroded a little related to my questioning of the blatant intention of him using the triggering during specific times. 

A few weeks ago, we got into an argument. I stopped and told him I couldn’t do it any longer, I wasn’t feeling well. Afterwards, he began to collect his belongings in the middle of the night and load the car. I asked him to stay as it was late and we were both upset. He told me a lot of awful things which I can never forget... one being that “at least he would make it to the end of his life” because he knows I’m not in great shape related to the condition. (I’ve had suicidal thoughts and told him as it scared me, he responded with “how could you do this to me?!”). 
After he left, I discovered the oldest dog was gone. I immediately called him and he returned saying he “cared about the family so much.” He found the dog. I still am unsure if he allowed him to escape or if he escaped on his own... 

Since that time, I’ve asked him if we can speak “human to human...” I just want both of us to be happy. I’ve told him how I feel, and, at this point, even when I look at him it triggers me. I’m especially triggered when he begins to talk loud and fast... which he does often. He tells me he does it because of me, that my actions and words cause him to act a certain way which I get... The problem is that I’m in no shape for a divorce. I asked him for this a few times over a weekend when I returned from the hospital. He responded by running around the table, grabbing a notebook, and yelling “oh yeah, is that what you think you want?!” I began to second guess myself... I knew it wasn’t what I needed at the time, but the relationship is causing a lot of pain... I thought I would be able to ignore it and love my babes and enjoy the comforts of my home. But, it just seems to have intensified. Also, he continues to remind me of my past actions which he magnifies and that could possibly get me into trouble and I’m in no state to deal with any extra stress. Also, I’m on his insurance. 

I’ve had the support of some friends and family, but at this point I’m isolating again because I don’t know what to do. I’ve told a couple of friends about some of his actions and the way he speaks to me, they think I’m crazy and delusional as he’s a “kind and docile” person who could “only want the best for anyone.” 
He’s taken our gun over to a close friend saying “things are getting bad” when we barely even speak. He calls my dad to tell him that “she only bitches at me” to stress him out, which he does not need. When I’ve asked him about a divorce now, he claims that he’d just be too worried about my current state so he can’t leave me... he tells me if I want a divorce to initiate it, but then reminds me of past actions which he could report and magnify them to get me into trouble. Also, the doctors are requesting to speak with him at the next visit... 

So, I know this is long, and, if you’ve read all the way through, I thank you... I’m just at a loss with what to do. I’ve contemplated running away and becoming homeless. With my current condition, I’m unsure if I will actually recover as I’m quite positive I experienced a psychotic break and I was stupidly ashamed to admit that and receive proper treatment. But, my home environment after the hospitalization had not been the most conducive to me regaining a healthy mental and emotional state. I don’t know why I didn’t go stay with my parents, but I guess I didn’t want to burden them with this or have them see me in this condition. 
I’m thinking at least I could have some experience at the end of my life without doctors and without family having to see me in this state. I haven’t been completely honest with them about the current condition either.... I guess I haven’t really wanted to be honest with myself, I’ve always adopted this “oh everything is fine” or “it’ll all work out” mentality. I guess that could be a good thing, but a strong plan would be nice... In regards to a future though, I’m just really unsure.",05Jul2020,1

I said today that my parents are still iffy on me driving 50 minutes to meet him in person (it is not my car and I do live at home), and I gave him a heads up about that again tonight.  I’ve already told him a couple times this week that they still may need some convincing, but reminded him that they didn’t yet tell me “no”.  After lots of texting, he asked, “if we can’t meet tomorrow where does this go?”  I was confused and asked why we can’t reschedule. Then, I told him I would like to meet him before I start being openly affectionate, as I’ve been hurt in the past through an online-only relationship and I don’t want to fall as hard and fast as I did that time.  Then, he started saying he no longer wanted us to pursue a relationship if I couldn't be affectionate until we met in person.  I asked if he honestly thought I would never be affectionate. He didn’t give me a straight answer. We are no longer meeting tomorrow, or at all. I don’t understand what I did wrong and asked for clarification a few times, in which he mostly said the same thing. I’ve been open about not being an overly affectionate person before, and it didn’t seem like a huge problem. Why is it a problem now?",05Jul2020,1

63,"Hello. I'd like to start off with saying I have bad anxiety and tend to overthink things very much. I was driving through the city as I was going to upstate new york to visit a friend and, while driving through the city, a homeless man was asking cars for money. I took out a one dollar bill and while I slowly drove passed him, I handed the bill to him. He had gloves on and our hands did not come into contact but neither of us had a mask on. The interaction was very shortlived (a second at most) and he muttered thank you (I wasn't looking at him so idk if he was looking down or covering his mouth) and now I can't stop overthinking the possibility that I may have contracted corona from him and may be passing it onto my friends/family as I'm sure homeless people may be more at risk for contracting the illness. Am I overthinking this situation as I barely had contact with this man? I mean he was easily two-three feet away from my car as I fully extended my arm out to give him the dollar so the only way I would've gotten it was if he released saliva particles into my car when saying thank you... idk. what should I do?",05Jul2020,1

66,"No joke, I'm 18 and I unironically can't think of any way that'd help me. I basically feel like I'm on randomness's mercy(that's kind of the definition of life I guess)

Let me explain this a bit more. I don't want to write a relatively huge post like I usually do..

So, I hate parties and I'm so introverted that after spending a few hours doing social interactions(like you'd do during a party) I'm totally pumped out of energy mentally, this is very tiring for me in a very unpleasant way. These two things are my reasoning for not attending to parties. Ever. 

I also don't do that at all bcs of the people that surround me, a few of them used to be my good friends but when they decides to start partying A LOT and drink A FUCK TON of alcohol our ways naturally parted, I thought being myself would pay off, that's what happens in movies, right?

So I don't like leaving home at all at this point, I love playing video games and I believe I'd have the time of my life watching some weird, twisted and funny videos on watch2gether if I had right people to do this with

Okay it came out long sorry I feel like without explaining what's on my mind I won't get my point across. I expect to get ""video game happenings are the place to go"" advice which isn't that helpful because of my social anxiety and not enjoying socially active places that much, going to some video game happenings just isn't that appealing as I'd end up being a ghost and then leaving defeated.

The longer I live the more I start to understand how many things have to go right in order for two people to get along ACTUALLY really well, I feel like I'm so specific in many ways that finding even one person who'd actually like me is an insane challenge(I'm 18 and so far I only achieved losing 2 good candidates when they chose to party a lot with ppl I don't like) therefore finding a whole (small)group of people who'd get along with me and each other well enough to create meaningful relations appears to be a borderline impossible goal for me




Tbh I don't even know what I'm writing this for.. I guess I just wanted to let these thoughts go, it's not like there's one magical advice that'll change everything

To be clear, I don't hate myself for what I am and what I like, I actually kind of like myself, my humor especially. I only hate the fact that I can't find right people to have around which makes everything I like/would possibly enjoy kind of suck. Like watching weird funny videos, not fun alone. Editing videos of me playing with someone just for me and this person/group of friends to laugh at later, not fun when done alone and actually impossible. I could probably list a few more things but you get what I mean, I realize that I have no idea how much fun I could get out of life

67,"Tldr: friend A feels she’s been emotionally gas lighted by friend B and wants me to cut off from him, except she will not let me talk to him about it. How do I navigate his situation?

I (F, 22) have a friend A and a friend B, and both are very dear to me. They were pretty good friends with each other as well until A cut off from B, because she felt like she was being made to feel uncomfortable in their friendship, she felt gas lighted, and like her boundaries were being crossed. Now, I understand where she is coming from, I understand that certain conversations would make her dislike B, but to say that B gaslighted her because he had a different opinion than her, or that B crossed boundaries that A hadn’t even set in the first place, is a little harsh.

Anyway, she decided she did not want to be friends with him anymore and ghosted him until he got the hint, but never explained what happened, and also didn’t let me talk about it to him. During this time I’ve grown very close him, we hit it off great, we have some projects together, we have planned post-quarantine adventures, talked about personal issues, everything and I genuinely like this friend. Until friend A tells me that she feels disrespected and hurt by my actions, that despite knowing what he did to her, I choose to be such good friends with him. 

I told her I’ll cut off from him because I care about her very much, but she should at least let me speak to him about it. B and I have a rule that we never let anything that’s bothering us about the other go unsaid, and this feels like a betrayal to this rule. A straight up refused, saying she can’t stand B talking about her, and that I should also just ghost him until we’re not friends anymore.

I can not possibly do that to friend B, but I also don’t want to hurt friend A by being so close to someone she actively feels hatred towards. Although I feel like A is being too hard on me, it also makes me feel wrong to want to stay amicable with someone like B, who made my friend feel like shit.

Honestly though, I'm a little worried; I've literally had the thing running nonstop since I got it last week. I work from home right now, and since my car is in the shop, I literally don't leave my apartment.

I'm worried that, do these things overheat? If I have it running 24/7, is the thing likely to break? I also have a few more weeks, I can add a full warranty to the thing; it's $80 for a two-year warranty, the unit itself was $400. That seems expensive, but perhaps it's a worthy investment?

Anyways, I know this is a weird thing to be posting about for advice, but this is legitimately very important to me. My apartment felt CRAZY hot before I got this thing in, and I honestly don't know I could go back to living without this A/C unit.

Any advice for maintaining this thing is appreciated, as well as know whether or not running this full-time is highly damaging or not.",05Jul2020,2
73,"I live in Shanghai China and I deperately miss my home in America, but for the time being, I can't leave which has caused my girlfriend whis chinese and older than me to pressure me about getting married.

74,"TW: SA/CSA

I've never used reddit before but I made this account just to ask for advice about this, so I apologize in advance if I do something incorrectly. But basically: My grandparents on my dad's side have lived in the same small town in the bible belt their whole lives and have never left the state. They got married young because of a surprise pregnancy, but have been together, loyal, and happy for over fifty years now. For the entirety of their adult lives, they built careers around community work and have been active in their Methodist church. I love my grandparents very much, they are kind, hard-working, just genuinely good people, and they have so much love to give. In fact, the only tension I've ever felt with them was after coming out as queer and trans later on (they have never been hateful or rude about it, more just confused) and it definitely hasn't affected our relationship.

So that's all great, but there's this specific memory I have of a conversation between my father and I that has been bothering me. I remember I was pretty young and my father was talking to me about my grandfather- I don't remember the topic of conversation or how we got there, I just remember him saying ""If he ever touches you someplace you don't want him to, you have to tell me."" At the time, I remember thinking he meant like a punishment spanking or something (he only ever spanked my brother once, I don't think he ever spanked other grandchildren), but a year or two ago I realized he was talking about molestation. The thing is, I don't know if I can really trust my memory. I suffered a traumatic brain injury in high school that affected my memory, the extent to which was never determined. I lost a significant amount of my childhood memories, and the ones that are left are not always accurate. I've searched my state sex offender registry to no avail, but that doesn't mean he didn't do anything, it just means he was never convicted or he was convicted before the registry began. I've also done some minor archival research to see if his name was mentioned in local newspapers, but came up empty there too.

I don't want to live the rest of my life thinking my grandfather is a sexual abuser and a pedophile if he isn't, but I'm worried if I ask my father about it he'll think I'm accusing him of horrible acts with no reasoning or justification. I feel like I have an obligation to find out, because associating myself with a known abuser is incredibly fucked, but I don't want to cause any rifts in my family if it turns out my brain just misremembered or completely made up that memory. How should I approach this topic with my dad? 

&amp;#x200B;

TL/DR: I have a pretty unreliable memory, but I remember having a conversation in which my father hinted that my grandfather is a pedophile and/or sexual abuser. How do I ask him if this specific memory is accurate?",05Jul2020,2

76,"Okay, so. This is weird. I've lived in my current house for almost three years. The house belongs to my parents, but my college aged sibling and I live there on breaks.


We've never had an issue with this particular neighbor, who I will call Larry. He is a grown man in his 40s, well over 6 foot and built like a linebacker. He has always seemed kind of weird, but a nice enough guy. A little backstory is that about a month ago he put up a fence on a part of my property without asking us or letting us know he was doing it. It was a small fence, and we asked him to take it down. He had not done so up until this point. 




Today is the Fourth of July, obviously, and they were setting off fireworks in their yard (illegal, but everyone does it). Issue was, they weren't setting them off high in the air. They were setting them off low enough that they were exploding right next to my windows, which was terrifyingly loud and bright and was scaring the shit out of my cats.



My mom went outside to ask them to stop. He made some snarky remark about 'welcome to the neighborhood' and my mom started to argue with him (bad move, I know). But Larry went PSYCHO. My mom came inside because she didn't want to fight, and next thing I know, my &gt;6 foot neighbor has ripped the fence he put up on our property off and is waving it above his head, screaming my mom's name. 



I just want to put into perspective that my mom is an extremely thin and small woman, and this huge man comes out onto the sidewalk and starts waving the fence around and screaming at us from the front of the house, trying to throw it into our front yard and hitting it against our front gate. We were terrified.



When I went outside, he saw me and immediately shut up and went back into his house. I don't know if it's because I was visibly frightened or if he just didn't want to fight with a teenager, but it stopped after that.


I'm so shaken. I have never seen ANYONE freak out like that in person before. I'm afraid he's going to retaliate in some way. To be honest, my mom can be rude, and because I wasn't outside I didn't hear the full conversation, and I don't know if my mom was more confrontational than she should have been. But I don't think his reaction could EVER be appropriate. 




Part of me wants to apologize on behalf of my mom just to keep the peace. I can't think of anything else to do. I don't want to live next to someone that hates us as much as this guy apparently does. I am so shaken and angry right now and I would really appreciate any advice from someone who's had this kind of situation before",05Jul2020,2

hello, just looking for an opinion. i’ll give context so you can understand best. 

my (16M) girlfriend (16F) is threatening to break up with me if i don’t stop talking to another girl.

we’re all in the same friend group. me, my girlfriend, the other girl, and a few others. the girl my girlfriend is worried about, (we’ll call her haley) can have a flirty attitude around boys, at least to my girlfriend. i always took it as her being extroverted and having fun. 

but one night, my girlfriend and haley were having a sleepover, and i snuck out and we all got drunk. while we were drinking and on the topic of sex and stuff like that, i told haley my dick size. i know that’s a boundary but i was drunk and it just came out. of course this upset my girlfriend who thought i was trying to impress her. i swore i wasn’t and that i was stupid and drunk, but she didn’t believe me. 

the next was when haley’s dog had to go to the hospital. her dog was very sick and most likely had to get put down soon. as someone who has lost a dog, and understands that pain all too well, i texted haley. she facetimed me crying and i tried to comfort her but she hung up a minute later. this upset my girlfriend who thought facetiming and texting was too far. i thought it made sense, i was only trying to comfort a close friend going through something i had gone through. i felt split, should i comfort a friend or not because it hurts my girlfriend’s feelings. 

haley also exaggerates a LOT. i promised my girlfriend i wouldn’t talk to her, just snapping so streaks and stuff. i swiped up on her story once to see how she was doing and then haley goes to my girlfriend and says things like, “he’s SO sweet! he swipes up on my story ALL the time! we’re always talking!” 
i don’t know why she does that or what that means. maybe a girl can reply in regards to that with her opinion. but all of this combined, along with my girlfriend being VERY insecure, has created this situation. 

i don’t believe in couples being able to dictate who they can and can’t talk to. it seems manipulative and weird and i’ve never done it. even though she’s talked to her ex boyfriend who still has feelings for her and hates me and talks shit about me to her. i always let it go because i trust her. but she doesn’t trust me, and this is not as bad as that. she says just the fact that me and haley are in contact hurts her and she cries about it. i can also say that absolutely nothing has gone on between me and haley. we’re just friends. the only reason i push back with my girlfriend is because i feel strongly about people in a relationship being able to talk to who they want. i know i made mistakes, but i just want to be able to talk to and be there for my friend, while keeping my girlfriend and happy and not jealous. 

i know both of these things aren’t possible. so i’m left with two choices.  

completely cut out haley, and stay with my girlfriend, even though it goes against something i believe in. 

leave my girlfriend, and enjoy my freedom of being able to talk to who i want. i love my girlfriend. i know i’ll be crushed if we break up, but this just seems too far.

82,"Today I went back to work for the second time this week since Corona. I have been finding it harder to cope because of the change. I work in a restaurant as a waitress which is a very fast paced environment so I’m used to the stress. 

The chef I work with is the husband of a family friend. I’m used to him basically verbally abusing me (swearing at me, raising their voice) I’m used it. I know they don’t really mean it, it’s just stress. 

However today the chef crossed a line by calling me a r*tard with a very hard r. Knowing full well that I am autistic and that is a very offensive slur against the autism community. I was in so much shock I said nothing. 

I know it will probably be just a word for most of you reading this but personally it is so much more. I have faced prejudice in the past from my peers at school so this seriously cut deep. I understand that being a chef is a stressful job and they probably weren’t thinking when they said it but in eyes this is not an excuse. Especially when my co-worker is middle-aged. 

What can I do if this happens again? I’m just afraid I will not be taken seriously if I bring this up seeing as my co-workers and employer are not that educated on the topic.",05Jul2020,3
84,"\[F, 29\] Hi! I'm getting married in November and with this covid fiasco, I wanted to use that excuse to not invite my extended family to my wedding.

For starters, I'm Filipino, and if someone is getting married, the whole town is invited. (i'm kidding ofcourse, but with a big family like mine it feels like the barangay is there to taste the lechonn too)

I planned our wedding for almost 2 years and already set up my guest list, My fiance's side only consist of his mom, dad, brother, and a few of his friends. My side is the problem.

My mom has 6 siblings, who has in total of 7 kids, and I'm only inviting 2 of my Aunts. My mom doesn't have a problem with this, but with the family drama being toxic and petty, not inviting them would mean our family is rude, entitled, and selfish.

I love them dearly, but It's going to be my Wedding day and I don't need the side drama from my family's side.

We’ve been dating for 5 years .I feel like we are pretty old enough at this point to handle going on vacation on our own. My partner has a job, has been paying his own bills since he was a teenager, and is extremely responsible and financially stable. I recently graduated from college last month and I’m going to uni in August. So my partner and I seem to have our life together right? 

My partner and I want to go to Los Angeles (which is only 6 hours away from our hometown if we drive) for my birthday. We want to rent an airbnb and just relax down there. We have wanted to go on a trip by ourselves for two years now. Every time we sat down my parents and asked them if we could go by ourselves, they gave us a flat out no. No explanation. Nothing. I would ask my mom on private why she said no and she gave me answers like “because you’ll be having sex” or “because you’ll be sleeping in the same bed.” which is really frustrating considering my partner and I are two consenting, legal, financially stable adults. My parents will not be financing our trip. We can pay it on our own with our own money.

88,"Throwaway just in case my best friend reads this. For the sake of this post, I'll be referring to her as Maria.

I met Maria in college, and we quickly became really close. We've been there for each other through pretty much everything in our adult lives (about 7 years total), and we think similarly. When I'm around her I'm inspired to be a better person, and have really been working on myself. About 9 months ago, I realized that I was in love with her.

Maria was in a poly relationship with a married woman for the past 3 years (the husband was cool with this, not behind anyone's back), and she has tried to date some men but it never worked out. When I realized I was in love with Anna, I got motivation to try to fix my life. I've lost about 40 lbs (started at 280), started working out, eating better, going to therapy. I really wanted to become someone who could give back to her everything she's given me, so I worked on becoming the best me that I could in hopes that I could ask her out once I got my life into a reasonable state.

Right before quarantine started, she started dating her old high school sweetheart, a woman who is also our age. That woman is not interesting in a poly relationship, so Maria is now monogamous. Maria also seems happy for clarity. I love Maria, and I mean that genuinely, and I would never want to ruin her happiness or make her confused. Once she told me that it meant the world to me that I'm her only friend that never puts pressure on her, so I wouldn't want to do that either.

I guess I have 2 questions:

1. Am I doing the right thing by saying nothing to Maria? I don't think she's interested (haven't talked to her so can't be sure), and I'm really scared that telling her will make her uncomfortable/pressured to act a certain way in our friendship. I don't want to cause stress or hurt our friendship, and I also don't want to disrespect her relationship. Can't stress enough that she's done nothing to lead me on.
2. Assuming that the right answer is saying nothing, how do I get over her? I've never felt this way about anyone. I genuinely care for her so much that I just want her to be happy, if I did anything to ruin her happiness idk if I could forgive myself.

90,"So, here I am, 4 month later still resented about the promotion I didn't get at work on march and still feeling hurt.

Let's name the characters: Sansa(Manager), Bran(Manager), Edd(Co-Worker), Petyr(Ana and Mike's manager), Rhaegar(Previos Petyr Manager) and me(Snow) under Ana or Mike department(not sure). We work on a technology division of an important company of the country. In the company, we have departments which are leaded by managers and divisions(compund of one or more departments) which are leaded by division managers. And of course, under the managers the project leaders(me and Edd). This is a very stressful job since company give you a phone to be always available and project has to market earlier than competition since is the best company of this type in the country. A project leader is basically a mix of project manager and business analyst so the job actually prepares you to be manager right when you begin.

I joined the company on 2012 when I met Petyr and Rhaegar all in the same department we were all project leaders and became friends(I thought). We were on the same department and they of course are older(in age and in the company) and way more mature than me. Time past then Petyr got promoted to manager along with Rhaegar to division manager I remained as project leader as it was supposed to be that moment. I was really glad since both are very patient bosses and didn't yell me or motivate you to work based on fear of losing your job like the previous one wich Rhaegar replaced. In the middle of these years(2016-2018) I suffered for 2 years of high anxiety levels which made necessary for me to take meds(clonazepam and SSRI) prescribed by a psychiatrist. Later I learned to manage stress and anxiety thanks to psychotherapy and some good books. I always considered Petyr my friend so I told him about it and he understood and always gave me permissions for my therapy dates during working hours. After that Bran and Sansa entered the company. Company created another new division and Rhaegar proposed our VP to be transferred to that division so Petyr could be promoted and suddenly we had 1 vacancy for manager. Others manager positions opened as well and Rhaegar wrote me by whatsapp that he recommended me for the new managers positions as he thinks I was ready which of course I was and still am very thankful to him. Mostly because he is no longer my manager and still have goal to help me be promoted. I was in shock mostly because he used to make bullying about my balding, LoL.

At that point Sansa, Edd and me had been working on a very important project since a year and half. Edd is basically new and a little lazy and Sansa were often mad at him because he let work undone which I had to finish. She just stop talking to him and assigned thing via chat because she was resented. Me on the other hand never stopped advising him or let him know the things he is done wrong. As soon as I knew positions were ready I tried to be super productive to show Petyr I was ready to take more responsabilities but Sansa didn't like it.

We used jira for the open bugs and Sansa complained about me taking his cases and solving them. Of course she didn't told me anything I figured it out when accidentally I see Bran's phone and there was a message from Sansa telling him not to give me information about her cases. I thought it was right since we are the same in the project and it doesn't matter who solve the case(Edd and I agreed on that). Then I called her and apologized for not respecting her space. Although she did forgive me and told me not to worry as I would be chosen for sure things were never the same again. She began to ignore me at mornings and then talk a little in the afternoon and start to hide thing fearing me trying to steal her job. By this time Petyr asked me about the project status and I needed Sansa's info to complete the update but she was very defensive now and I never could response Petyr about her part of work. On the other hand when Petyr ask her I always make sure to provide her the information which make me think she was being a little unfair to me.

Then she told Edd to not let me answer to Petyr about his work status because that was making him a damage(translated as it was told in spanish). What I find very hilarious is one day a manager ask me help him with some presentation so he could deliver to his superior which I delegate to Petyr since I was in aother important task at the moment and Edd was seen as the lazy one. When I finished I return to workplace and find Sansa secretly telling Edd what to write in the report and starting to lower the voice tone as I(the work stealer) approached. Only if she knew I was the one who let him show off his skill on that report. Why would I take it from him? I also want to mention that when the project started, Sansa has no technical knowledge so she would move next to me to help her with her task as she didn't know how to do the job. I end doing mine and her job until later she learned something.

At that point I was the oldest project leader in our division, which more knowledge about how things are done or who department do certain job. Also by that time I made some friends which help me to get things a lot faster since I just have to call them and ask because I helped to them in the past as well, had a better college and master(international) degree in tech and project management respectively and a supposed friendship with Petyr. Bran was working on an Equally importante project earlier than me and Sansa.

Then the first choice was made and Bran was the new manager. I felt jealous as first since he was a very shy person who even after getting promoted I witnessed an employee of his calling him name in his face. When I approached Petyr he said I he was chosen because he was worried about me and my previous stress problem, but then told me that I improved that a lot and shall be considered next time. I was demotivated for a while but then I started to see the positive qualities of Bran and accepted the fact that now he is the manager and of course we have another position open so lets go get it.

Then corona came and the second choice was made. Sansa was the new manager and I felt worse than when Bran was chosen. Petyr told me she was selected because she was more organized and better managing than me but if another opportunity arises it would be mine for sure. It was that bad as I was the first to know when RRHH made that effective since I accepted to help her with her locked username and technical support told me she was promoted. I felt paralyzed and chills in the body. I was so confused, and felt like a wrecking ball hit me and prevent me to get up again. Until this day although it was in march I still feel resented and jealous. I'm resented with Petyr for not supporting me besides all the effort I had made in the company and the times I got sick for working overtime to deliver things on time(recall anxiety from previous paragraph?). I feel resented on Sansa because I feel like she didn't play fair.

My friends who used to work the department but live overseas told me to leave Petyr as soon the know the notice. Some managers in the end user department(the one who request our service) even told Petyr you better remember about Snow(me) he is the one who deserved it. Even there is an important project which involves some part which I'm the one who knows the most and I was specifically called by the CEO of another company and VP of my company in which of course PMO and end user told in front of everyone that I am the only one that know about that. They(PMO and end user) also tell me the are pushing for me to be promoted as they think I deserved it already.

Things are complicated becasuse the COVID situation jobs are limited and promotions or transfers paused. But I'm now thinking of changing to another division where Petyr is not the manager since I feel Im not being taken seriously. It's been 4 month and cant stop thinking about that and really feel as the division's bastard.

We never have intellectually stimulating conversation and if she weren't my sister I personally don't think I would associate with her and she has told me the same thing. I am more mellow and like talking about politics, fitness, cooking, and finances . She on the other hand likes to go out and talk about things that don't interest me (make up, drinking). We argue a lot because she tends to grab my things, doesn't pick up after herself, and she always feels like I judge her when I don't. Sometimes I feel like being around her unmotivates me and drags me down. I don't enjoy my time around her and I can't change that. I wish things were different but they're not and I am fine with that. She annoys me so much and I don't even know why. I admit that I am sometimes rude and mean but she just annoys the f\*\*\* out of me.

Sometimes it gets so bad were she says ""I wish I had another sister"" or ""you're dead to me"" and to be honest these comments do not hurt me one bit. I don't know what to do.",05Jul2020,1
100,"I’m 18. I’ve always been an introvert. I stutter. Badly. Especially around my parents. I don’t know why. But I think it’s due to stress my mother, who committed suicide when I was 13. I think it is from trauma. So I don’t talk much. Especially around them because it is so difficult. 

They know this. I’m not sure they know the reason why. But they understand my difficulty.

This is easy enough to deal with. I’ve dealt with it since I was 13. The only added confounding variable is this: I’ve been even more so withdrawn from them because I think I am depressed. Not in a minor way either. I’ve withdrawn from my friends as well. I lie to them. I say “I’ll brb” while I’m on call with them to go cry and sleep. At like 6pm. I’ve done this on the daily now. 

I haven’t been eating, and I regularly think about the possibility/logistics of ending my life. 

Maybe it’s just the depression messing with my mind. But all of this, and my increased withdrawal, lead me to believe my parents are starting to lose patience with me.  Here’s an example. 

I was on the phone with my dad. The conversation went like this 

Dad: do you want to come watch fireworks with us? 
Me: no I think I’ll - (I was going to finish by saying sleep. I was already asleep in my room when he called) 

My dad just hung up on me. Before I finished. 

I love them so much. But I don’t know what to do. I feel like I could do anything. This multiplicity of options is not something I’m used to. I want them to understand. But also paradoxically I’m not sure how I could express how I feel. I kind of don’t want to tell them either. I’m thinking of riding it out until college, because In college I will be alone, far away, and without the sort of confines that come with living with your parents. But I don’t know. Any help is appreciated.",05Jul2020,1

105,"   I thank those in advance who have taken their part of the day to read my terrible grammar and helping me.

I will just get right to it. This has been happening for awhile now and I don’t know what to do. About two years ago my friend decided to drop out of high school. He just decided school was not something he wanted to wake up for in the morning and he didn’t believe school was necessary for him. At first I believed he truly did not care, but I began to understand there was something more behind his actions. He gave me this idea when he somewhat mentioned that he’s been regretting his life choices. 

   The thing is, I’m a terrible friend. He has done more for me than I have for him simply because I was incapable/had no perseverance. I also do not have the ability to catch onto signs fast and help out without giving up. I am one of those friends who gave up. However, he is still breathing today and I want to keep that. I do not want to be one of those friends who did not help when they could have anymore. 

 He has been talking about obtaining a G.E.D and going to community college plus university somewhat recently, but he lacks the motivation to. My friend is someone who is strongly apathetic and has zero motivation to do anything but working for money and going to the gym. He also isn’t the one to sit down and have talks about getting help and whatnot. He had therapists talk to him about his problems but he claimed they told him stuff he already knew. So talking to him and giving advice is extremely difficult.

   So what I’m asking is, how should I help him? I don’t know what to say to him because he seems to already know what he wants to do. I also do not know his full mental condition, but most days he really seems down and sleeps a lot. What can I do for him?",05Jul2020,2

109,"So I’ve been somewhat seeing a guy for a couple months now. Let’s call him John. We’re long distance so don’t get to see each other much, just weekends when I come home (I’m away for school). Yesterday (Friday) I go over to John’s for a short visit. When I’m leaving his place, he’s letting me he wants to see me tomorrow (today/Saturday) with a lot of enthusiasm. Even requesting I stay the night. I’m excited. He’s got stuff he’s gotta take care of in the morning, which is fine cause I do too. But he says he’ll let me know when that stuff is taken care of so I can come over. 

So throughout today I’ve been getting invites from other people to hangout, which I decline cause I’m waiting for John to let me know when I can come over. Fast forward to 8:00 at night and John messages me saying he’s in a shit mood and doesn’t wanna see another soul for the rest of the day. I’m trying to be understanding that he’s in a shit mood and wants to be alone but I’ve been waiting all day for him to give me the green light to come over, declining other invites and choosing not to make visits I wanted to cause I’m not sure when I’ll hear from him. Earlier in the day I got an invite to a bbq which I told John about and he responded he didn’t wanna go to that. Not at all suggesting he didn’t want to hangout, just that he didn’t wanna go to the bbq. Whatever, I wanted some alone time with him anyway. 

So my question is, after spending all day waiting I’m pretty pissed that he didn’t give me an earlier heads up that he suddenly decided he didn’t wanna see me today. So I’m tempted to be petty and say no if he asks me to hangout tomorrow. Although I’m afraid this will piss him off and mess up what we’ve got going. Do y’all think I should say no or just suck it up and visit with him tomorrow, if invited?

113,"I live with my mother, father, and sister. When there are no conflicts, we're a very happy family. My family is not an unhealthy family. Let me just get that out of the way. At least not ridiculously unhealthy. No lasting harm is done. I don't expect things to ever get physical and they never have.

&amp;#x200B;

My parents recently had an argument and it's following the same pattern that it always has. When they have an argument, my parents don't speak to each other unless absolutely necessary. Sometimes we don't all eat dinner together. This can go on for weeks or months. Usually no longer than a month but it has happened.

&amp;#x200B;

The first day or first couple days, my mom will shout at my dad and my dad usually doesn't respond but sometimes he shouts back. Eventually they just don't talk and go about their daily routines. The problem is that we live in an apartment, so there isn't a lot of space to avoid each other.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, these arguments are over the most fucking ridiculous things and they cannot resolve this small problem. Nothing like money problems or affairs, just little mistakes that someone could make and they will latch onto that problem and feed off of every fucking shred of anger that they can salvage. They'll just continue on not speaking to each other until it gets awkward and slowly, we go back to our regular routines.

&amp;#x200B;

Usually during this my mom will talk shit about my dad to me and my sister while my dad will just continue on without saying anything. Sometimes if I try to intervene and try to stop them from shouting, my mom will get mad at me for trying to bring in a reasonable suggestion.

&amp;#x200B;

Seeing this process pisses me off every single time because my sister and I get over our arguments extremely quickly (Granted, they aren't ""adult"" problems but still...) and my parents cannot solve their arguments for their fucking life. They just wait for it to die out.

&amp;#x200B;

I know it has to be me because my sister just avoids this and my parents won't magically come to the idea that maybe a calm 10 minute conversation will prevent weeks of awkwardness. I know this because, again, I've seen this happen before.

&amp;#x200B;

So how do I get them to quicken the whole ""healing process"" without pissing anyone off further? Or should I just let them use their process? Is it healthier for them to go through the process on their own pace or should they talk it out?",05Jul2020,1
114,"Alright so this is going to be very long, but I need to get it out. I’m sorry if this isn’t the place to post, but I just kind of need some support. My dad and I had a great relationship up until I was about 9. I just had a horrible gut feeling around him and I couldn’t describe it at the time. I was avoiding him and answering him with simple yes and no’s because I hated his company (and I still do). 

When I was 11, my brother and I traveled alone to stay with my Dad’s side of the family, and they’re all eerily quiet and socially out of touch. They’re great people, but while I was staying at my grandad’s house, my dad’s brother (who was about 40) did some things to me that can still haunt me. It’s embarrassing that I’m so affected by it because he never raped me or anything. But the main things that get to me: 

when he took my luggage up to my room, he questioned if the suitcase was mine. I said it definitely was and even after I told him up to three times that I knew it was mine, he decided to open it to “make sure”. I’m so disgusted thinking about it, but right in front of me, he finds the compartment of all my underwear and just feels them shamelessly. To this day I can have a panic attack when ANYONE touches my laundry. 

Another time, we were playing basketball, and as I was just standing there, he comes up behind me and pressed his crotch into my backside as if he was playing defense. He did that a few times throughout the game and would stand there for extended periods until I quickly moved away. 

Anyways, I’m going off of topic, but back to my dad.. after these instances, I became way worse. But a big turning point that (I’m ashamed to admit) caused my hatred for him was when I was walking down a corridor of a hotel. I was around 13 and there was a mirror at the end of the corridor so I watched his reflection (he didn’t realize I could see him) for the full maybe 30 seconds as he stared at my butt with one of the most creepiest looks I have yet to see from anyone else. 

I’m 16 now and I’ve caught him multiple times with the disgusting look that makes my stomach drop. I usually end up crying every time. I guess the topic I need advice on is that we’re going to the beach soon and I’m really nervous to wear bathers. I specifically bought one pieces because I don’t want him seeing a lot of skin. I feel dirty and I just want him out of my life. 

( I have gone to therapy because my mum was angry that I clearly hated my father. I have an amazing relationship with my mum but during the time I was forced to stay with my uncle, I did text her in tears, saying I was terrified of him. I was 11, and after I’d texted my mum, grandma, and best friend that he was dangerous, they all ignored me. They never spoke of it again or asked me what happened. I’ve never been able to forgive them for that because I think the lack of support sent me spiraling into the dark years that followed.)

Well, seeing how long this is, I don’t expect anyone to read through it. It feels good to let out the pain though. Sorry again if this is the wrong place to post.",05Jul2020,1

My siblings keep on giving me the blame on everything wrong THEY do, and my parents shout at me for that.

My parents are saying they love me, but they really dont. Whenever I try my hardest to cook something for them, they just take a bite and say it's good, then not eat anymore. That really hurt me cuz I really want to get better at cooking for when I grow up and my kids wanna eat something. But now, I feel like I dont care if I destroy the bloodline. My siblings can take care of that.

116,"Crossposted from r/neighborsfromhell TL;DR - I want to help the neighbors with my noise level but at what point do I stop? What else can I do?

  
Hello, I am actually the neighbor from hell and I would like any suggestions for this sans moving out or revenge.

I've lived on the third floor of my apartment (2BR) building for few years and never dealt with this. The building is 60's - 70's with carpet. Due to school, I come home late. I am working from home for COVID-19 and so are my neighbors. Since EO May, they have been passive aggressively letting me know that I am a nightmare. That's fair. This is what I have taken to be directed at me.  All except for two occurs between 7:00 am to 10:00pm\*:

\*Issues\*

1. \- I am heavy footed when walking around- my heavy footedness shakes the entire building
2. \- Turning on the kitchen fan irritates them (banging on the walls)
3. \- listening to podcasts and TV at a level I really can't hear (12/100 causes banging on the wall adjacent to the TV). Cell phone (podcast): 7/100 no headphones can be heard from my bedroom as well
4. \- \*Close the windows when hanging out. I am at fault. But essentially something similar to this happened ([https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3vkyua/creepy\_neighbor\_plays\_audio\_of\_me\_having\_sex/](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3vkyua/creepy_neighbor_plays_audio_of_me_having_sex/)) They made no contact just the audio/porn.
5. slamming the front door
6. \- typing anywhere or at my desk
7. \- working or getting up (6:00 am - 1:00am)
8. \- cooking late or being in the kitchen a lot
9. \- sitting or sleeping on my bed or couch (everything rocks back and forth)
10. \- tossing and turning and going to the bathroom at night
11. \- smoking weed
12. \- existing loudly
13. \- bluetooth incompetency

It took a week for me to figure out it was directed at me. The minute I realized that ITA I started to make the following preparations. (in order with the above)

\*Fixes\*

1. \- I've added two shag rugs to the apartment (9x7, 5x8), I wear slippers or fuzzy socks as well. If I am barefoot I limp with my loud food. I do walk around a lot. (I rearrange plants to calm myself)- I experienced falls in the apartment.
2. \- The kitchen fan was replaced. Does not sound like an engine.
3. \- I bought headphones and I only turn on the TV if I am with someone
4. \- Windows &amp; blinds are closed &amp; I have bought curtains
5. \- I called maintenance for that as well. It's better.
6. \- I have not solved this one. I am a grad student so I type a lot. Sometimes it's a hit or miss. The two finger method seems to placate them but I am behind. If I type on the couch or desk, bed (or floor!) it still happens. Same as texting.
7. \- Quiet hours are between 7:00 - 10:00. I've added a foam pad next to my bed so when I hit it, I don't disturb the neighbors. I stop talking and I go on headphones at 9:30pm now.
8. \-I did cook at two in the morning...last call is 9:30 pm. I take forever to do I bought a portable dishwasher, saves time now.
9. \- This one is still going on. If I breathe, I feel the entire bed shaking. I've held my breath on both to see if it was me. I exacerbate it but I think the neighbors are causing this one. I have bought vibration pads &amp; shock absorbers, tightened the frames. Still happening. It seems to happen only if people are in that room. So I sleep on the couch so they can go to bed and I can too. If they are not in the room, nothing shakes. I can tell the minute they are in the room. I just move to the couch now. I don't flush after 1:00am.
10. \- During that time I bought an air filter, switched to vape and I recently stopped smoking. Weed also wafts from my bathroom from someone downstairs but there are 2 floors so I do not know.
11. \- They are the first downstairs neighbors I've heard as well. I whisper into my headset when I am on the phone and while the OTHER listener on the end can't hear me and the neighbors can...I don't know. I've had friends come over to hear the banging and it becomes reduced by alot. They still do bang but not as frequently.
12. They just started to talk into the vents that they wished the upstairs neighbor would ""Shut the fuck up"". I have video meetings. Doors and window are closed (they hear me. Even with headphones on).
13. \-I blasted porn onto the wrong device. Device now in storage.

\*The weird ones:\*

\- They can hear me going to the restroom but they don't like me turning on the vents. I can hear them giggling and I really do not need a group of people ""ew-ing"" when I pee. Doors are closed, shower curtains are closed (that helps).

\- The couch and the bed shaking. I've been here for years and I don't know what to do. When COVID-19 caused me to wfh, if I sat on my bed (foam), it will wobble/vibrate and neighbors will bang. I can roughly feel where the neighbors are relative to me I've moved the furniture (desk, couch, bed) from the wall. Added the shocks and pads and carpet under and in the from the bed. .I have weights (textbooks) and gravity blanket. However the bed still shakes. 

\- I keep smelling food from the bathroom when I'm not cooking. I am the top floor..

I've gone down twice with the intent of asking them to list the offending noises and maybe a mediator from the apartment management.

The first time one person stepped out and they said that they lived alone, and I wasn't bothering anyone.Second time, no one answered even thought I came down immediately about the banging (I was typing).

They won't respond to attempts of contact and some of the banging just confuses me (example: I am in another room and I hear my couch wall) and they expect I know (it gets louder if I do not stop the offending noise).

There isn't anyone connected to me except them. I contacted our landlord after the first contact with the neighbor to let them know that I was making all these changes and noted the times they let me know I was noisy. I requested a walkthrough and maintenance but the manager wasn't too worried and maintenance does not help with sound proofing. Banging has stopped for everything but the typing, bed and couch shaking, and talking.

That took me setting up a camera and talking in a normal voice that I was recording the neighbors noise complaints and my every movement. They are pissed in general however, I cannot figure out what to do about that and I really do want to fix it. They have the right to peace and quiet.

Advice from people I asked  has just been ""fuck them"", ignore them or report, but I can't continue doing what I am doing if I am annoying them. I have nothing to report because I am the one making the noise in the first place.

I can't accept praise easily. I feel like I am undeserving. Everything in my life has been so easy, yet I have nothing to show for it except my grotesque attitude. I am extremely insecure. I am self absorbed. I am judgmental. I am trying to change, so hard, but I lack discipline and control over myself. It is because of all these things, I truly believe I am not a good person and undeserving of praise. I am always seeing ""self-love"" messages/posts that I can tell are trying to speak to people like me, however I just don't feel 'allowed' to internalize it.

I know that I should love myself unconditionally but every time I try and have that mentality and enjoy myself, all the terrible things I have done flash in my mind and I end up agreeing with those thoughts. Even now, while articulating all my feelings, acknowledging that my mentality is poor, I still cannot look past myself. I feel like the only times I was happy or accepting of myself was when I embraced my trash personality, and I don't want to be there again.

This isn't a cry for sympathy, really. I just want answers to what this is I am feeling, everyday. I want to feel good about who I am, consistently. 

Has anyone else experience similar thoughts?

e: I feel very high highs and very low lows. I can go a day feeling okay, but after a day of trying to be a normal person, I feel like a fraud. My 'normal' attitude throughout the day was just a facade of me being fake positive. This is what actually inspired me to make this post, a low-low after a high-high kind of day",05Jul2020,2

Soo what would u do in my situation. Currently Im living in Europe in Balkans. I plan on moving maybe 5 years from on just so I could work to get some money. Now my avrage income would  be 5000 euros per year soo 5 years from on I would save about 25 000 euros since I live with my parents and they agreed that I dont pay any rent that I should save this money. We could sell our apartment complex which is worth about 50 000 euros. In total 75 000 euros.

135,"I (15 M) have a serious behavorial problem. When I'm happy, I'm probably one of the nicest persone you'll ever meet. Calm, funny, caring, etc. And these things are natural, not like I'm putting a mask

. However when my temper rises (the rate of rising depends, it can either be real quick or just absorb everything and I'm still calm internally), I go from 0 to 100 real quick. I can go from laughing to feeling a burning sensation inside me to hurling abuses and hitting to feeling guilty and horrible in look ike 10 seconds, again depending on the situation.

 For most of the time It stays at laughing, at max a burning sensation but in some cases i can go to hitting/abuses and guilty. Guiltiness always comes after hitting (which is why I'm writing this post in the first place).

My problem is that I can't control myself when in anger. My anger is like rage. Sure, people aren't the best in anger but in my case when I get angry I become a villian.

I really want to fix this cause I don't want to have such nature in adulthood. I've seen some people who have no control over their behaviour when angry and I absolutely do not want to become like them.

I preformed sexual acts with them for gratification purposes as I thought the only thing of value I had to offer was my sexual services.

150,"I \[25\] need advice on how to help my boyfriend \[26\] who is depressed.

My boyfriend and I have been together for 3 years. When we started, he was sweet and very open about his life and everything just clicked.  But once we got to know each other longer, I observed that his past traumas still haunt him.  

Normally he's a jokester, a hugger, very sweet, a good listener and talks openly on the pressures he's feeling in life and he lets me holds his hand.  Whenever he feels depressed, I observed that it is usually triggered by stress and exhaustion. When he is in the state where his mind his clouded, he suddenly turns on me and suddenly hates me to the point where I cannot reason with him and he starts cursing and saying things out of spite (ex. let's break up, go find someone better, I'll just cheat on you, you are nothing to me.. along those lines)

When I do try to talk more and reach out to him, he becomes very defensive and aggressive to the point where it gets physically abusive.  This incident happened several times already.  Before, my solution was never leaving his side even if it can hurt me. Thereafter, he does calm down and turns back to normal again. 

But I am exhausted and recently, instead of staying and bringing him back to normal, I did what he asked even though I knew he said it out of spite, I left the room. I did this because he said he needed space and I'm tired of the cycle. 

Now, I'm panicking out of my mind.  He lives alone and I care for him.  His family is far away and friends are also far away. He sometimes tell me that he'll jump off a bridge or kill himself, out of nowhere, due to his state. So, I'm scared because I don't know how to help him.

If I stay, I get hurt and it's exhausting and repetitive. If I don't stay, I'm afraid he'll do something he doesn't mean to.

We tried to go to a doctor but it failed because there was no connection when they talked and pills are not the solution we're looking for.

I promised that I would never leave his side (and I don't plan to leave at all) and while I gave him space to breathe, how do I help him?

&amp;#x200B;

151,"I know there’s a lot here, so if you can read all of this, thank you.

Often every time I want to reach out to Reddit for help, I stop myself because I know there are a few thousand posts each day from others like me who are struggling as much as I, so I think I don’t deserve a forum to speak. Nevertheless, I know I need help.

After barely passing the low bar of my Spring Semester of college, I’ve been working a sweet 86-hour temp job I landed last minute for two months now. The reason I did so poorly in college was a dangerous combination of anxiety, isolation and psychedelic drug abuse. Hell, I barely got clean long enough to pass the screen.

Now that I’m away from the drug scene for a while, I know I’m still not over it. I’ve instead turned to sugar and sometimes alcohol for comfort, and have reversed all my fitness progress over these two months. The Pandemic destroyed my plans of learning MMA over the summer, and I *cannot* stand online therapy.

I know that I suffer from depression and anxiety. Being self-aware of the symptoms does not do anything to solve the problem. I’m caught in a self-perpetuating loop, where I think I know exactly what to do to escape my worry, yet lack the strength to follow through and rationalize away hope. Ironically knowing that in itself makes me sadder and harder to pull myself up. Fuck, I’m too smart for my own good.

I couldn’t bear to call even my best friends to express my emotions, because it wasn’t until my most recent bad LSD trip that I realized all I ever did before this job was complain about my shitty drug-addled life and make my family and friends uncomfortable. Now, I just bottle it up to save others from knowing my shame. My friends don’t deserve to be treated as self-pity sponges, and I feel like doing so anyway in these moments of despair would make them distance themselves from me.

Above all else, my biggest desire in life is to write and maybe publish a fantasy novel. I’m terrified that the pressure of living life will kill this dream, and that if I can’t get over this depressive state I might never fulfill that goal. Everyone else seems more invested in pursuing real-life careers, and I still don’t know what I want to do with my life as a Uni Junior transferring universities.

Simply, I’m the only person in my current social circle whose ever *frequently* used and enjoyed psychedelics and thoroughly enjoys reading and writing fantasy. I hate sounding conceited that “nobody gets me,” but these days I have such a difficult time relating to anyone that opening up and sharing my life with others makes me shudder inside, because all I have right now are gloomy sob-stories. Even my damn counselor I’ve known my whole life has become unhelpful, as I believe he has no experience dealing with psychedelic drug abuse.

I don’t know where else to turn for help right now. I feel very reluctant to reach out to my friends and family, who I genuinely fear would look down upon my weakness, so I instead confide my deepest fears to strangers on the Internet. Thank you for reading.",05Jul2020,1

161,"In the market for a new TV but don't have a ton of money to drop on one, trying to stay under $750 but definitely under $1,000. The two I've narrowed it down to are the Samsung 65"" RU8000, 2019 model, and the TLC 65"" 6 series R625 4k QLED. The Samsung is on clearance at Best Buy for $600, down from $900, while the TLC is $750. The TV will mostly be used for sports, cable, and movies but some console gaming will be done as well. I mostly game on my PC, mmorpgs and FPS, but I do plan on getting a PS5 when it comes out, prefer RPGs and other games on console. I will use a sound bar so the sound of the TV is irrelevant. I should mention I'm upgrading from a 42"" 1080p Vizio so either one will be a big step up. 

After some research Samsung wins out when it comes to response time, has 120hz, and has a variable refresh rate all of which would be important for gaming. 

TLC wins out on picture quality and has full array dimming. So outside of gaming and watching sports, which suffer from motion blur, the TLC takes the cake. 

My gut instinct is the Samsung; better for sports and gaming, lower price, more reliable brand, and the year it was released got largely positive reviews. But the picture quality on the TLC is definitely better, I went and looked at them both, and outside of OLED TVs gets some of the best rated reviews for picture quality. The reason I'm second guessing myself is I'm not sure if the games I play on console will make full use the 120hz and variable refresh rate. 

Any advice anyone has on which set is better, or a better alternative in the price range, is much appreciated. I'm pretty set on a 65"", but if there is a 55""-60"" that would be much better I'm open to it. I did look at the LG 65"" Nanocell 8 and was not impressed with the picture quality if that gives a reference.",05Jul2020,1

I never trusted men, and I thought I would never be able to have a boyfriend or have sex. (I am currently dating someone very amazing, but it’s still hard for me to fully trust him) 

My mom and I got into a deep conversation the other day where she told me that one day when I was 4/5 she was getting me dressed for school and she noticed bruises on my butt and legs. She asked me what happened and I said,”Daddy hit me.” 

We had this conversation 2 days ago and I don’t know how to feel. I’m scared and I don’t know where to go from here. I was right to wonder all these years whether or not he beat me, but it’s not something I wanted to be right about.

Also, my mom got a part time job (on top of her regular job) making $30,000 a year when I graduated high school so she could work for a few years, pay for my school, and put the rest into an account for me to have when I graduated high school.

164,"I'm 16F and a little bigger. Not exactly ""fat,"" but I'm borderline overweight. All my fat went to my hips, thighs, and calves. So I don't look too bad, but I'd like to lose weight so I stop feeling so self-conscious about myself. It's really ruined me, realizing I'm a little bigger. I've accepted it a little more over the years, but now I realize that I truly want to lose weight. 

Anyways, onto the issue here:

I suggested that two of my best friends (both male) and I make plans sometime soon, since we hadn't hung out for months.

Well, one suggested that we get coffee or something, and I said sure. 

I don't mind getting a drink with female friends (since most of mine are a little bigger), but with male friends (and some female friends of mine) they all seem quite thin, so I feel fat, or like I shouldn't eat anything. Except I can't do that because it's loitering and it's rude. Plus, it'll probably make my friends feel awkward if they have drinks and stuff but I don't.

We've hung out and ate out tons of times, but this feeling just never gets better. It's alright after I get my order, but as I'm ordering I just feel awful. Thoughts like ""what if I order something sugary and they think I'm not managing my weight?"" or ""Why can't I be thinner?"" start sprouting in my mind and it just doesn't stop until we sit down or something.

I don't know why I feel like this. My best friends are very nice, they've never once judged me that I know of, and they've always been supportive of almost everything. I've never brought up my concern with my body, and maybe I will, but I don't know how it will help.

They also eat a lot whenever we go out, so I don't get why I should feel embarrassed about getting just one drink. I highly doubt they care. 

I feel completely confident when I go out (my anxiety/confidence has improved a lot throughout the years). I don't wear clothing that shows much skin because I just don't like it, but I wear mostly whatever I want to and I feel prouder while I do wear it. 

I just don't feel confident when I have food or a drink in my hand, and I haven't quite gotten used to wearing dresses/shorts in public without leggings or pantyhose. I know I'll feel better about these when I lose weight.

But I can't lose enough weight by Monday or later. That's physically impossible and not healthy. 

So... is there any way I can feel better about going out to get drinks/food with my friends and not have to worry about my legs?",05Jul2020,1
165,Halloween is coming in 4 months. I haven’t celebrated Halloween since I was about 10 years old and I was invited to a Halloween party. I live in the USA currently and since then I’ve become a communist and Soviet historian. I saw some Soviet army uniforms that I’m interested in. But the thing is I’m black. The Soviet Union did not have many black people let alone any black soldiers so I’m just wondering if it would be weird for me to dress like that.,05Jul2020,1

168,"i am dealing with a lot right now.  The last few months have been hell on earth &amp; I’m sure a lot of you can relate to this.

But there is nobody here to comfort me right now.
I haven’t told anyone yet &amp; I don’t think I want to because I don’t want to make my loved ones worry but I find myself thinking of dying all the time now.  Whatever sort of chapter of life I’m experiencing, I just want it to be done.

My family’s financial situation is falling apart.  I was banking on going to school and getting health care once I turned 26.  Well.  My mom got arrested in April for domestic violence and then my dad bailed her out.  Then a month later my mom quit her job during a zoom meeting.  And at this point, we were already suffering with our income.  We’re relying on my dad’s severely cut income (50%, + commission).  He gets 2K once a month and we live in the bay area.  Rent will go back up soon.
I didn’t realize until recently when I hurt myself that I didn’t have health insurance because my mom quit.  I’m also an essential worker and working with a significant amount of people 5 days out of the week.

In addition, my biological father is acting like he suddenly is autistic or has asbergers and is acting weirdly.  He says he didn’t go to a doctor but he saw a video and said he could relate.  This is problematic because my dad is just being annoying &amp; he hurt me in a sexual way when I was a kid and so honestly anything that he says is just annoying and this is low key triggering. 

And I’ve just been really caught up in my anxiety.  I’ve been trying not to let my loved ones in on it.  I have been talking to my boyfriend but I havent told him that I’ve been thinking about dying because it just honestly sounds dramatic and he has other shit going on (like his mom dying of cancer and his little cousin catching covid).  But when I tried talking to him about what the next step should be for me (while I was feeling sad) he was really upset and told me to fucking deal with it.
This hurts because recently he has been becoming very mean.
A couple of weeks ago he called me a fucking dingus.
And idk... he can be really aggressive with his words... 
i feel like i’m losing him and all i wanted to figure out was what my next steps should be.  i get that i am emotional sometimes but I felt that i was holding it together decently well?  I wasn’t wailing or even crying.  He could just tell I was upset and got triggered by it. 

i feel alone.
i feel like I don’t belong anywhere.  i know i don’t belong here.  
My mom is emotionally abusive and I hate being at home.
My step dad is an angel but I feel like he puts up with way too much from my mom.
My bio dad is crap.
i want to leave this world but not the people or things i love.  Specifically my little sister.  She’s 19 and she doesn’t always want to talk to me because of her misophonia but I fucking love her.

This year fucking sucks.  Can I get an amen?
There are good things that I try to focus on too, but today has just been heavy.  I might be exposed to the corona virus and I have no health insurance.   


Tldr: I need health insurance and I really want to see a therapist but I don’t know what to do or where to start.  I live in california.  I have a part time job but I might be able to go full time, but I saw that two weeks ago the open enrollment for health insurance for full time employees ended?? So idk.  Can I enroll any time or ??",05Jul2020,1

170,"Before we get started, f.y.i. this is gonna be a long one. I've never gotten everything out like this before.

So I am currently a \[M19\] freshman college student and halfway through my Spring semester I got sent home because of COVID-19. My home is about 1 hour away from my college. Once I got home, there was the usual stress of getting used to living with my family again, We quarantined for a while and it's been this way for most of the pandemic. Recently for the last month, my state has been doing well (&lt;400 cases a day) so they've given me permission to go out and see my friends who were also quarantining. I usually go to the local school or the park and return home by dark because they don't want me out at night. We mostly did activities like play tennis or go hiking, wore masks, etc. Recently, we found this big lake in our village and decided to start visiting it. There was a no trespassing sign but I went past it with my friends and checked it out anyway (yes I technically broke the law but we were just looking and it was isolated). I was at this lake with my friends, and all of a sudden they called me and demanded I come home. When I got home, they were screaming at me. They can track me on Life360 which is a phone app that gives them my location. They were so mad at me going to the lake. They basically checked my location, I was like 2 miles from my house, and they googled where I was. Google had information about the lake and the fact it had a few trespassing signs and it was potentially dangerous. They told me all of this and screamed at me like crazy.

They said I'm ""starting so much sh\*t in this house"" and I have no right. I'm grounded and have to do whatever they say for the foreseeable future. I haven't seen them this mad in years. Then they started telling me ""my place"" in this house and I need to do whatever they say. They said my friends are a poor influence on me, and starting now they were ""no longer my friends"" and I had to cut them off. Here's where the story gets more interesting. Recently, I've been talking about moving out of the house, working, paying my own rent and living in my college town while they paid my tuition. They seemed amicable to this idea at the time, but now they bought it up and yelled how I dare say that and their job is to provide for me and mine is to do whatever they say and get my degree.

Basically, right now I'm stuck in the house, cannot leave, and they're not letting me go to college in person anymore for the next two semesters (they want to to take the online option for all my classes due to COVID-19). Before I ask my advice, I'd like to provide more backstory to my life.

When I was very young I used to get extremely physically abused by my father. As far back as 4 years old he would regularly beat me for any unwanted stress or anxiety I caused. One time I was in kindergarten, he had to come pick me up because I was sick and couldn't eat my lunch. I guess he had a bad day at work that day or something but he beat me to the point I will never forget in my life. He threw my on the floor and started stomping and punching me. I started bleeding and he threw me against a small table. He then opened my uneaten lunch and threw it at me and the floor, and I couldn't leave until I ate everything off the floor. For years and years on it was not uncommon for me to get beat once every few weeks or even multiple times a week. I would be slapped, screamed at, thrown around and stomped and kick. Sometimes after these punishments, I would get thrown in the dark garage for an hour or so crying at why my parents hated me so much and what was wrong with me that I deserved this. I continually got beat until I got a little older. The last severe beating I had was in 6th grade when I couldn't understand how to do my math homework after I got bumped up to the higher level in school. Since then I just get yelled at a lot or berated.

In high school, they started tracking my location on a phone app. They were very restrictive with where I could go and never let me go anywhere. They made me focus so much on my grades and the consequences were disastrous if I did poorly. As a few more years passed and I could drive, I started going around more. One time, my tracking app wasn't working and they got so mad at me and screamed the house down for days. Basically this is my leash that they pretend they don't check even if they do. Once I got to college they started tracking me on campus and questioning the places I would go and what I was doing. They say I have too much freedom and I'm having too much fun. I have a 3.5 GPA, I'm an engineering major and I work very hard. I really feel like my parents give me no respect and think I'm some sort of little kid. My mother is always berating me and saying these annoying things that work to destroy my self confidence, or criticize me in some way such as ""you can't take care of yourself"" or ""eat now"" or ""go for a shower right now"" or ""go to sleep right now lights out"" Things I feel I should decide for myself. After 1st semester, they said I didn't look well so they took me to a psychologist who said I may be slightly depressed. As a result they started controlling me even more. Second semester they forced me to come home every weekend, even if it was super inconvenient for me and forced me to spend more time at home. Then the coronavirus struck and I was back permanently. I feel like they were the biggest drain on my mental health but as usual whenever I say something like that they act like they're innocent or say that I'm overreacting.

My dad is always screaming at us to do things because he knows no one will challenge him if he's angry. He is extremely critical of everyone and is always thinking the worst of everyone. Something I'd like to mention is that when I started college, he wanted me to work for his company hourly and make my own salary to pay my tuition. He did this to save money through some tax workaround which would cost him less for my education. Schooling for me is around $20,000 a year (on the cheaper end for US colleges) and we can easily afford to pay for my schooling. However, I offered an alternative suggestion where I would pay for the difference myself through another job and pay him back for the tax difference. After hearing this he got so mad at me and told me how ""stupid"" or ""what an idiot"" I was and banished me from the room. I don''t understand how he can say its fine for me to rely on him for financial reasons and then do this. He was quite mad for a few days. Later however, my sister talked about med school and said that it would cost $70,000/year for 7 years. My dad told her this is not a problem at all and he would take care of everything. I was quite surprised at the trouble he was putting me through if this wasn't a big deal for him.

One time, we were on vacation, and I was stressed because I drove us there 3 hours. I have a medical condition called PANDAS and it was acting up because I was stressed. As such I started doing physical ticks like shaking my head and twitching my eyes or stomping my feet. He got so mad at this he said it was my phones fault, so he destroyed it and threw it out the window and I got such a bad yelling. I was phone less for the next few months.

Another time, we went kayaking, and one of my paddles drifted away. We were in a calm lake and I had a life jacket, so I swam over and got my paddle. When we got back to the pier my dad got so mad at me that I ""could've drowned"" that he threw me off the pier in front my family friends and I scraped my inner thigh it started bleeding.

My mother gets so mad at me when I talk about moving out of the house and starting my own life. I do admit I say it a lot but I feel like it's always gnawing at me. I just feel like living in this household is such a mental drain for me and there's always problems or stress. My friends always tell me my parents are so strict or I'm a grown man and they tell me everything. I feel so lost in life and lack of control. Every decision I make I always hear their opinions and ideas telling me what to do. It's affecting my relationships. Their whole mindsets are they're always right and everyone else is an idiot. I've been pretending and lying to myself for so long that I love my parents but recently found that I indeed do not. My dad hurt me so badly when I was young and he always yells at me now or keeps trying to control what I do. My mother is always nagging my and telling me negative things all the time. I don't know what to do anymore.

For years I've had poor posture. After some research I realized I had muscle tension since I've been unconsciously tensing my muscles for years. Once I relaxed these muscles I felt amazing. After research, I found that sometimes these muscles lock up in times of fear (the stomach area). I then realized every time I'm around my parents I'm tensing myself. I've done it for years without realizing. I came to the conclusion I have serious fear of my parents and I didn't even realize because I was lying to myself.My parents have given me a solid life though. They've raised me for this long, bought me things I've wanted, taken me on vacations, sent me on school trips and been generally nice. It's just these things that I've listed in this post are really off-putting me.

Do you guys think my parents did anything abusive or had abusive behaviors? I can't even tell anything anymore. I cried while writing this post. Or are things not even that bad and it's just how life with your parents is and I should adjust to it because they're providing for me and all I'm doing is complaining. I have 9k saved up so if I worked I could legitimately go live by myself. They once promised me they will always pay for my tuition no matter what, so if I left I think they'd pay for tuition (5k a semester) but I can't be 100% sure. Should I just suck it up right now and do what they say while they pay for me, or should I strike out on my own (pretty sure they'll pay my tuition) and live by myself? Does anyone have any advice on how I can get through this quarantine or how to communicate with them? I don't know what to do I've never felt so confused. Any advice you guys can provide me regardless of what it is would be appreciated. Insight into your own situations could help me understand mine. I do believe my parents genuinely love me but I think they are super controlling of my life. I've been trying to become my own man and the authority in my own life but it's so hard for me to do that.

Tl;dr - College student at home with parents during quarantine. Things are starting to spiral out of control due to past problems and new ones. Need advice on what to do because I can't see and happiness in the way I'm living my life right now.",05Jul2020,1
171,"Hello, 22F here.  I have always had anger problems, when I was a child, I remember being put in a special class for it and all I ever did in that class was talk about what made me angry and how to resolve it and draw pictures. But now as an adult, my temper has really gotten out of hand, I would lash out at people, punch my door and walls leaving holes in them. I would throw things or knock them over and scream. Sounds like a tantrum haha.

But as of late, I would stay angry a lot of the time and it won’t go away until I do something about it, not taking it out on my wall, or a punching bag, or a piece of object, but on an actual person. I would be walking down the street and get a vivid imagination of me getting a plank or something and beating someone with it, to take out the anger that I feel inside.

I haven’t done it, but I know it’s coming, I can almost feel myself break, and when I do it’ll be bad. I want to get the help I need before I maybe end up killing someone. 

I need help, but I don’t know who to go to or where else to start that will be able to help me. Please comment suggestions, I greatly appreciate it.",05Jul2020,1

175,"Hello everyone. I am 21 and this would have been the year I got my bachelors had I not dropped out of college twice and changed majors once. I dropped out last semester because I didn’t get into the nursing program due to personal/family issues getting in the way of me studying. 

There is a 6 month IT program I know of that will get me certified to work as a Linux admin, making around 50k/year. The first time I dropped out I was taking an IT class and honestly it was so easy but it was just a beginners class so I can’t say i would be a great IT person. 

What I want to do though, is go back to school and get my associates as quick as I can so I’ll be able to start working as a nurse by 23-24, and then get my bachelors and eventually go to crna school, which I won’t be done with by around ages 28-30. 

The thing is, I’m already 21 and wasted the last 4 years of my life. I graduated high school at 16 and at 21 I have nothing to show for it. I dropped out of college because starting my second year, I had to work full time and help my dad pay bills+debt. I did not have a day off since I started college, either working, class, or both. Any day I wouldn’t work I would get yelled at for being lazy and that others my age were working so much more than me. (They were all people who weren’t in school). Although it was a job where I can go in whenever I wanted, I would be woken up early on weekends or days off from school by getting yelled at that I’m getting late for work. 

This went on for the last three years until coronavirus. During this virus, I confronted my strict and controlling parents, told them that I’m taking control of my life and doing what I want to. They get mad every time I say something like that and eventually I will probably be kicked out, but who cares.  

The worst part is, my girlfriend of two years broke up with me because she said she needs someone who she can build with and someone who has a strong work ethic. The ONLY reason I did not have a strong work ethic was my controlling parents and toxic household. I even told her my plan for life, that I am going back to school and getting my degree but she ended it saying she wants to get married but I haven’t shown her I can take responsibility, and that she can’t wait for me. She said if it’s in our destiny we’ll be together in the future. 

I want to do the IT program just because it’s quick and will get me out of the situation I’m in, as well as get me my ex back. But what I truly want to do is become a CRNA which will take years. I’m having so many mixed emotions I can’t make a right decision. I need to apply to school or the program by Monday to go to either one.

I know I always denied being upset but i guess I was trying to trick myself just as much. I have tried way too hard to change myself and all I’ve done is set the bars too high and upset myself and by doing so I isolated myself from you and my other friends. I was a bitch to you and I couldn’t even help it"" 

and I respond with: ""been thinking how to reply to this for a while now and i’m just going to wing it and i can’t promise any silver linings. i have to admit that in my eyes it seemed like you were just disinterested in talking to me and i didn’t know why and i didn’t want to ask why because it wasn’t my place to ask. this in turn sent me spiraling into “what-if’s” and “maybes” and i just kept making excuses for you by saying “maybe she is \[blank\]” or “what if i did \[blank\]” and stuff like that and it sent me into a even deeper spiral of self pity and self degradation until the point where i was having suicidal thoughts. and that was why i texted the helpline multiple times after the first time. then when i tried to talk to you about something about anxiety or whatever and mentioned that, you snapped back at me and that actually made me feel really shitty and i’m sorry for snapping back afterwards it was just a kneejerk reaction to you being rude after subtly making me have suicidal thoughts. the past couple weeks have been just me trying to come to terms that you’re just not interested in talking to me and it was something i did that i can’t change and i’ve been trying to have more self worth and dignity than i did. i’ve tried working on your drawing like 2 days ago but i couldn’t without crying. today was the day when i fully gave up and told myself that “you can’t force someone to like you” and i just am really tired. i might usually say something like “oh no you’re not a bitch” or “i forgive you don’t worry about it” but i’d be lying to you and myself and i need to know my self worth at this point. there’s no silver lining anymore. if you would like to keep talking to me or whatever that’d be great but i just need a few days to think about everything if that’s fine'' 

and then she says: ""Let me read that tmrw I gtg to bed cuz my sister is sleeping with me but I will read tmrw I swear""

This last text from her really hurt me that she didn't even have time to read my text with the like 5 mins it would take to read it.

I was surprised by that answer and wasn’t really focusing on the convo anymore and next thing I know he’s shoving a picture to my nose showing me an old friend of his, but also someone my mom cheated on him with. I’m like cool a stranger my mom cheated with and disregarded it. 
I thought it was odd that my dad kept a close up style picture of a man my mom was unfaithful with 24+ years ago. Kinda felt bad for him afterwards, thinking he was holding onto old hurt. 
Fast forward a year later and lots of pondering I’ve come to the conclusion that conversation was deeper than I realized. Little memories come back from my childhood joking that I was ‘the mail mans kid’ bc I looked like neither parent for quite some time. By this time my overthinking brain has created an entire conspiracy that my dad is unsure if I’m his kid or not and keeps this pic of this man secretly as a comparison and in some kinda fucked up way, that night, showed me that picture to see if I’d notice anything or say something. 
So this sits with me for another year. 
Present time, my dad is in the hospital (he’s ok) and I’m cleaning up his space for when he gets back. I decide imma snoop and finally look at the picture again and look at it THAT way to see if I notice anything similar to myself. Keep in mind I don’t look like my dad. 
Eventually I find the picture! I stare and stare and compare against myself in the mirror and get nervous. I share with my friends and we all agree I look A LOT like this mystery man. We share the same jaw line, lips, brow bone, eye shape. He has curly hair and I’m the only one in my fam with curly hair. And my nose is very different shaped kinda peanut like and he has the same nose just way more exaggerated! It’s definitely intriguing. 
Now the dilemma is I can’t ask my mom for she will lie thinking she needs to cover something, plus she’s just a pathological liar. And I don’t wanna ask my dad what his name is especially now while he’s recovering. I really am curious if anyone has any advice on how I could go about finding someone based off two developed prints. I just want to see more pictures of him or possibly his kids. I want to discover how undeniable or easily mistaken this could be. Any advice would be helpful! 

Ps I plan on eventually doing a dna test against my father or ancestry test for more clues but again I would try to do this under the radar and I’m not a detective so I don’t even know how I’m gonna go about this lol",05Jul2020,1
186,"I (female) have been dating my boyfriend for 2 years now. The relationship has gone very well so far and I trust my boyfriend wholeheartedly. Although, for these past 2 years I’ve been too scared to tell my father about it. I feel horribly about the situation but I’m not sure how to fix it now.

Here’s some important background information. My mom and my dad are divorced. My dad isn’t involved in my life very much and he only sees me a few times a month. Everyone else in my life besides my dad (and his new wife and kids) knows about my boyfriend and I. My mom does not know that my dad doesn’t know (considering they don’t talk much anymore).

This secret that I’ve kept from my dad has definitely hindered my relationship with him, although I don’t think it’d be great even if I had told him sooner. My father’s overprotective and strict attitude is very damaging. I’ve been too scared to confront him for the past 2 years, and I know I need to do something about it. What’s the best way I should go about this?",05Jul2020,1
187,"For context, I’m an artist/animator with a reasonable following on YouTube and Instagram. For the most part, it’s fun and means a lot to know I can inspire and help other young artists. As a result, I try to be personable by replying to DMs and talking on live-streams etc. I also offer paid critiques where I send audio files so it sounds like I’m talking directly to the recipient.

In combination, this can definitely give followers the false feeling of knowing me even if I have no idea who they are.

Normally I’m fine with follower interactions but over the last year or so, one person has been following me on like... Every form of social media I have. It’s obvious that I’m being searched up because a site is followed every few weeks, including ones I don’t use *at all* (including places where I only browse and don’t post)

This person sort of knows me irl. We’ve talked a handful of times and I’ve been polite but not too friendly or anything. I don’t think they have any bad intentions but it makes me super uncomfortable... but I don’t think they’d understand if I explained that to them and I don’t wanna come across as rude by saying something. I could also block them but I’m sure they’d notice and I don’t know how they’d react to that (they clearly lack social awareness + have acted unpredictably in the past). It’s hard to avoid them in person and I’m worried that if not online, it could transfer to the real world.

I feel like I’m overreacting but I’ve been feeling uncomfortable for ages now: my heart drops every time I see their username.

I guess the best thing is talking to them or blocking but I’m not sure how I’d approach either.

**TLDR: being low-level cyber stalked by someone I cross paths with irl. Talking to them/blocking them might blow up in my face cuz their everyday behaviour is unpredictable.**",05Jul2020,1
188,"So I matched with this woman on a dating app, and she messaged me quickly and asked for my cell number, where we began texting..

a few weeks later and she promised me she would meet up with me but needed ""gas money"", I finally gave in and sent her 20 dollars on Cash App, and she never showed up because of a ""flat tire"", 

and then a week later she promised me she would visit me and I finally gave in again, and sent her $20... and she didn't show up because she's in debt apparantly. 

Anyways, I'm never giving her any money ever again... I'm just concerned that she may be able to figure out where I live by my phone number or from the Cash App?

189,"I already have a lot of degrees; I spent 9 years getting 3 bachelors (criminal justice, psychology, anthropology) and a masters in criminal justice (no student loans). I’ve centered my whole education on getting into law enforcement. But that hasn’t been going well, and atm I’m working for the state in a job that doesn’t even pay me enough to live here (CA - my home state). I started trying to look into going into private sector jobs, and have realized that I have almost no marketable skills for the private sector.

One of my friends suggested an MBA, which if I get into my university I would not have to take the GMAT and would cost roughly $15k. Now a JD would be significantly more than that (likely over $100k - I’d need loans), but is more interesting to me and closer to my field.

I’ll be 29 next month, and feel I’m at a tipping point, where if I’m going to change career paths I need to do it soon. I genuinely can’t figure out a field to go into with my skills that I could make a decent wage (aside from law enforcement).

The dilemma we're facing is whether we tell our parents about it or not. If you were a parent how would you react to a situation like this?

192,"Yes, I want to ultimately break up, for a myriad of reasons. Without delving into all the reasons, fundamentally I am just not happy with who he is and we are incompatible. He has been making a lot of effort to change to become more palatable to me (that’s already something I feel bad about — he shouldn’t have to change who he is so that a partner accepts him. Which is why I think breaking up is the answer — he can find someone who genuinely embraces him for who he is). 

Anyway, to get to my point, a few months ago, I was unfaithful to my bf. I lied to him saying I was meeting a girl friend at the park. In reality, I was meeting up with a very attractive guy who had been pursuing me. I was also flirting with him via text before this arrangement. When we met, things eventually became sexual (basically foreplay) but I did not have sex with him. 

It’s been months now and I am wondering if I should tell this to my bf, or just break up with him and leave this detail out. 

I know telling him this detail will shatter him and cause him deep agony and trust issues in the future. But the only reason why I want to tell him is because he puts me on a pedestal, literally says I am the “best person in the world” (despite knowing my flaws), and all that. 

I am in no way making excuses for my shady behavior, but I do believe it’s deeply rooted in the fact that he had a lot of sexual experience before me (many partners, a promiscuous and non-committal lifestyle) whereas I lost my virginity to him. This fueled a deep resentment in me and I felt I had “missed out” on having a variety of sexual experiences, and felt it was unfair he did. I know this doesn’t justify my behavior but that’s also why I think breaking up is good, so I can explore freely without feeling resentment towards him.

Tldr: I was unfaithful to my long distance bf and I lied to him about who I was meeting. He thinks the world of me and wants to marry me. I am planning on breaking up with him. Should I break up and omit this detail, or tell him what I did so it shatters his idealized image of me that he has in his head?",05Jul2020,1
193,"30M here. So 2020 has been brutal for me. I broke up with my gf of 6 years due to cheating and self loathing on her part. And during corona I’ve come to the realization that I’ve been abused all of my life. 

Back story: I was homeless for most of all of my childhood, up until the point I went to college. My parents refused to work, were lazy, and believed that we were homeless because we were gods chosen ones. I endured all sorts of shit, and was always sleeping outside in various places. I did eat well. Never had any friends, still don’t even at 30. I taught myself, managed to pull myself out of it, now have a masters, home, and work as an engineer. 

It hurts thinking about how I went though all of that all for most of my life for nothing. Just because I had shitty parents. Now my mom is passed away, dad lives with me in my house. He’s almost 70 and getting senile, he’s very controlling and has threatened to sue me multiple times now, tells me he’s the reason I’m successful and that I’m just an ungrateful little bitch. He refuses to acknowledge the neglect and abuse I endured as a child. He just fucking sleeps all day long on the couch. I’m looking into what to do for that situation.

I have an absolutely amazing job, but the commute is killer. I feel like the only thing going right in my life is my job. Everything else is going to shit. I have no personal life. No friends.

To top it off I hate myself. I hate that I’m 5’6, I see bigger guys all of the time and think that Im inferior. I’m in amazing shape and got a decently high IQ, but I keep telling myself I would trade that in to be 6’3 dad bod with a shitty job and low intelligence just so I could be more attractive to women because in my mind height is all that matters.

Which brings up the topic of dating. I’ve only been on the apps for a week or so and getting women that seem to be really into me, even though I put down I’m 5’6. They also tell me that they love how I make them laugh over text, and that I’m special from the other guys. I just think that once we meet in person they will be repulsed, that I’m not good enough due to my height and baldness. 

You can see I’m fucked up, any advice?",05Jul2020,1
194,"I’m getting more and more frustrated with my mother for not letting me have a life. My grandparents were really strict on my mom and basically locked her in the house when she was young so I understand why she won’t let me out as much as other parents would, but as a parent, wouldn’t you want to do better and want better for your children. She always uses the excuse of “my parents never let me out the house so you should be thankful that I even let you go out with your friends in the first place.” I don’t think that’s okay at all considering my mom had a bit of a miserable childhood, you’d think she’d understand my point of view even more. I’m 17 turning 18 in December and she forbids me from going out with boys, going out during night (my curfew’s at 6), and if I go out for three consecutive days with friends, she would say “You’re acting so strange, no normal kid acts the way you do, why are you so weird, do you have to go out so much?” Like what the fuck, just because you don’t have friends doesn’t mean I don’t. I’m literally just going out and I send her pictures of who I’m going out with and she still says she thinks I’m doing drugs, prostituting myself for money (I seriously don’t understand where she got that from). She also caught me topless IN MY ROOM, watching A TV SHOW, doing absolutely NOTHING, and accused me of sending nudes to older men for money, like what the fuck MOTHER, I’m allowed to do whatever I want in my room.

Anyways back on topic. I’ve been invited out for dinner countless times and occasionally to bars and clubs (let’s be real, so many teenagers go out to clubs and never tell our parents so like 🤷‍♀️) And I’ve turned most of them down because as I said, curfew’s at 6 💀. But it’s getting really close to uni and I’d really like to meet a couple friends before going off to uni. Should I just sneak out tonight because it’s an important event and I really would like to mingle with new people. I can already predict how much trouble I would be in like banned from going out for a while and forcing me to turn in my phone and let her check. I’m not sure if I’m acting a bit bratty because sigh, she’s been shielding me all my life, this summer was genuinely the first time I’ve ever gotten to go out with friends. I wasn’t allowed to go out with classmates after school because she would pick me up and keep an eye on me 24/7, I just want to enjoy what’s remaining of my teenage life.

204,"To sum things up, I have an older estranged sister. We haven't spoken in about 6 years, and our split cut me pretty deep. I have dealt with a lot of anger and really struggled with the fact that she has abandonned me years ago.

The details aren't important.

Anyways, she has 5 kids, the eldest is now  23. I haven't heard from him since, until recently he sent me a FB friend request. His request awoken a lot of anxiety in me. I don't want my older sister to have any glimpse of my life. I accepted his request, thinking that everything that has had happened between his mother and I, has nothing to do with him. In fact, I became kinda excited that he summed up the courage to reach out.

 He liked a few of my posts....so I decided to write to him. I wrote a pretty generic message, thanking him for reaching out and asked him what he was up to.  This was about a month ago

He doesn't seem incredibly active online, but I have seen him reply to things posted on his wall over the past month. He hasn't "" opened"" my message on messenger and hasn't replied to me yet. He chose to ignore it ( maybe temporarily, maybe not). 

In all honesty, he doesn't need to reply, but It bugs me. I literally struggle years trying to get over my anger towards my sister, and this entire thing is re-opening wounds ,that I spent so much efforts to lick clean.

Hi, I'm a 22F living in Melbourne. I live at home with my parents and they are very conservative about having sex before marriage and would not be ok with this. I want to go to the doctor to get a prescription for the pill, or maybe an IUD, but my name is still on my parent's medicare card, as the 4th listed name. I read online that I can fill out a form to get my own medicare card, but I would rather try not make my parents suspicious.

My dad's bank account is linked to the medicare card that my name is currently on. Does that mean that if the doctor charges me for the appointment, or even if it is bulk-billed, will it show up on my dad's bank account/online medicare account?

I recently created an online medicare account and it shows all my previous doctor appointment history. I am worried that as my dad's name is the 1st listed name on the medicare card, he has this kind of access to the medical history of everyone on his card?

If I do end up going on one of these kind of contraceptives, will any doctors at future appointments I go to, be able to access the information that I am on contraception? Sometimes I go to the family doctor with my mum for general blood test checkups etc. and I am worried that they might be able to see on my records that I am on the pill. MY family doctor and my mum are on very good terms and are friends so I wouldn't want her to accidentally bring it up in convo like ""oh your iron levels are low but maybe thats because of the heavy periods you are probably experiencing from your copper IUD"" etc.

208,"I want to preface this with the fact that my large family was very privileged growing up, I on the other hand I did not. Everyone got cars at 16 from their parents and their college paid for... some of them had access to their parents credit cards at 14. 

I grew up without these luxuries, and proceeded to have a very tumultuous life. At 18 I moved to a big city, lived in ghettos and lived a terrible life of getting robbed and seeing a ton of crime. 

Robbed at gun point 4 times, knife point twice. Had a brick thrown at me and robbed while unconscious. Seen a woman get kidnapped by 3 black men in a Ford Aerostar. Had my house broken into, seen a drive by shooting which resulted in watching a stray bullet explode in a 12 year old girls head like it was Gallagher smashing a water melon. I was attacked by a flash mob and was attacked by 20 teens and had my jaw dislocated and they kicked and broke my dogs ribs... every crime committed was by a black person. I know I’m not racist, most of my friends are black. I supported my black friends family when he was in jail and paid money each month toward His commissary.


All of this made me a tough person, and it sorta fucked me up mentally and I can’t relate with normal people. I know deep down I’m still a good person and try to help people. But I can’t relate with my fake woke family members. They preach on social media that black lives matter but, honestly I can’t back it, 100% of all the crimes I’ve seen in my life are committed by black people. Because I was in a predominantly black area. I don’t think black lives matter, no lives matter in my mind. Also I fucking hate cops.


All I want is to be the person I was when I was younger, softer... mentally. younger and I just can’t.  I want to relate to my family members but they’re such fucking frauds. 

I also want to say that I was involved in a police brutality case at 18 where I was beaten within an inch of my life, 2 cans of mace ,4 batons on my back and legs, and tazed twice. They planted drugs on my friend. This occurred in July and after the mace they turned the heat to full blast to fuck with me.

211,"I’m writing this as this just happened an hour ago. First some preface: I am part of a south Asian housed and I am the favorite one out of the two children. Basically my Dad just treats her and sees her like eh due to my sister giving the same treatment to the folks (whatever, what’s the point if I’m going to get yelled at). But in my folks defense she never cleans up her act or takes any initiative in change.

Fast forward to today, it’s Fourth of July everyone is drunk. I’m drunk my dad is a lightweight and my folks are old and are very anti-COVID. Sister wanted to go to a bbq with some friends but I talked her out of it since it would bring up some bad vibes in the house. She decides last minute that she will go to a friends for only two hours and when she comes home my dad says something snarky and she gets very sensitive about it (wasn’t a big deal). I go to her room and ask her if she wants to talk, she tells me no but mind you I am drunk and full of emotions seeing my sister like this. It’s also to note she’s been having troubles with her boyfriend and everything so she’s extra sensitive. Anyways what stupid drunk me does is go to my bed and say “mother fucker stop treating her like this” I don’t know why but I regret that cause that just escalates into WW3. Just want to say I don’t think he did anything wrong, I guess jsut emotions plus seeing my sister like this got me fueled up. 

M dad is a very loud guy and doesn’t think  I.e shoring, going off emotions. So it’s a lot of “FUCK YOU MF” “GET OUT”, and stuff like that. At one point had to put him in a full Nelson cause he was getting out of hand. Obviously I was in the wrong for coming up to him like that and at the point sobered real quick and perfumery apologized (that didn’t work). I tried talking with him but his yelling overpowered that. He has never acted like that to me ever and things got heated. 

Parents room is past my sister room so I told him “please I’m sorry but when you got your room don’t bother (sisters name) it’s not her fault”. He thinks she told me some lies or something that made me act that way toward him.

15 minutes later i get a text from her saying “I’m spending the night a XYZ house” obviously having parents that aren’t covid friendly aren’t taking that lightly. She leaves the house before telling the folks (I told her too tell someone).I messaged her friend and her many times telling her to come home due to the possibility of WW4 tomorrow morning. She takes some time and comes home. I was surprised my dad didn’t come out of the room saying something. 

Anyways I learned a lot on out myself and things I need to change. I can’t fix everything, don’t mix emotions and school together. First thing tomorrow I’m apologizing again and again and throwing away all forms of alcohol. But my dad isn’t the listening type he just does whatever he wants. So how do I help my sister who is super Sensitive to things and my dad who just sees her as lazy and etc (which she is). My mom tho right all of this has a i don’t care attitude. Deep down she cares but doesn’t show it out of i don’t joe pride. For example when I said “please text her to come home, it might help” she goes “why should I she didn’t tell me she’s leaving. She’s an adult like you and my”. Then when i left the room she texts her lol. Typing all of this out actually helped my mind, if anyone has some thoughts feel free.

212,"Was told a week ago by a notification that someone in Lima tried to access my Apple ID. In the last week the same thing happened with various other accounts online including steam, Ubisoft, Amazon and various others. I’m about 99% sure no one can guess my passwords, I’m careful about these things and I use different passwords on all with no personal info. I’m also fairly certain that these companies are lying to me about these security threats just to get me to change my password. They’ve all happened within a 2 week period.

214,"More specifically in the upper/middle trap area. It happened on a day I was exhausted from lack of sleep and went to do a warmup set of dips. The pain ran from the top of my shoulder up through my neck.

This was 6 weeks ago and I can still feel discomfort there occasionally. For the first few weeks I tried to just do pushups/pull-ups but kept agitating it. So finally decided I would take a break from upper body and shift focus to jumping rope until it heals. 

Today the pain is no longer in my neck, but like I said before I can still feel some discomfort on top of shoulder. I'm nervous and growing anxious to get back to my routine especially since my body fat % has been raising. 

Can anyone give me a more specific idea of of what happened and how I can accelerate the healing process? It would be much appreciated. My apologies if this isn't the place to ask this sort of thing but I just am at lost here and want to feel better.

215," I'm currently in foster care. Never knew my dad and my mom is an addict. I was 10 when I was taken from her and since then I have jumped from multiple foster families and group homes. About 2 years ago I was put with a couple with no kids of their own. They are the best foster parents I've ever had and they've been so nice to me. I met my boyfriend around the same time when I transferred to a new school. We became friends then we started dating. He introduced me to his parents and at first they were polite but then they found out that I was in the system and they've been pretty cold ever since.  


I found out that I was pregnant in April and it was probably the scariest moment in my life. I was scared that I was going to be shipped away again so I hid it from my FP. They ended up finding out pretty soon because I suck at hiding things. They reassured me that I wasn't returnable to them and they took me to PP right away. I made the decision to keep the baby. We spoke to my social worker and it seemed like everything would be ok.  


I decided to tell my boyfriend once everything was sorted out and he wasn't exactly happy about the news and was mad that I waited so long to tell him but he said that he would be there. He told his parents about it and they called me. I've never been more afraid in my life. On the call his mother was yelling at me and telling me that she's going to take her son's child away from me and get full custody because there's no way she'll allow some teenaged delinquent junkie whore raise her grandchild.  


I'm so scared right now. I haven't told my FP yet because I'm so shaken. They are related to my baby by blood so I'm scared that the court will side with them since I am a foster kid and people view us so negatively. My boyfriend hasn't returned any of my calls or texts.

The first time it was when he had text messaged a girl that he was interested in buying her products (nudity) and she replied saying dont you have a girlfriend and he says back no. 
I caught him right there and he deleted the convoy shortly after so we could forget and move on.

The second time it was when I was pregnant he would say things like he wasnt excited for the baby and didn't want to pay for my food if I didn't have money or whatever so I'd sit there watching him eat. 
Would call me ugly and never wanted to bond or have time together. Was always on his phone or video games (I also play video games. But I try to pay more attention to him) but during my pregnancy it was tough with low self esteem because of body changed and that PPD hit hard. He didn't seem very supportive at all. Didn't want to stay with me at the hospital after we had our kid.

The third time, was when I was finally fed up with our sexual activities. It was never fair. Never felt right. And he would always masterbate in front of me and even watch porn. Before, during and after pregnancy. Ofc I'm gonna feel insecure and shitty. And everytime we had sex hed finish in like 30 seconds and leave me with all this energy, hanging. 

Now recently, I thought hey I'll help him save up for a PC. I gave him about 400$ for his birthday. He got his pc.
Now I thought hey I want to save money to buy myself a better phone (I'm using a tracfone and have no service...) and I asked for his help. 
YOURE CRAZY! He said. That hell only put in a little but that's it. 

I just feel like hes no good for anything. He hardly bonds with the baby either. He does work a lot. But hes also got a negative mindset and feels hopeless. No GED or HS diploma.

229,"
So this is the kind of long story, sorry guys. 

I met this guy a few months ago around February while doing a group project at college. We seemed to kind a hit it off and I thought he was cute so I asked him to hang out one on one after our group project ended.

We watched some movies at my place and it went well. He didn’t make a move on me or anything but I kind of assumed that was just me being shy and not really giving him the right signals. Or maybe he just wanted to keep getting to know me before initiating anything physical. 

So we stayed in contact, and started talking a lot more especially on the phone while quarantine was going on. And then he said something to me about him being asexual. I was kind of surprised by this as I hadn’t known a lot of asexual people before but I wanted to respect him and I still really liked him as a person so I was happy to stay friends. As soon as he said he was a sexual though I pretty much abandoned, or at least tried to, the idea of getting romantically involved with him.

However as we’ve gotten to know each other more and more what started off as a pretty staunch statement of “yeah I’m asexual” turned into “well maybe I’m not asexual” “I don’t know” and then “well maybe I’m Demisexual” and then “well actually I realize I don’t think I’m asexual at all I think I was just kind of insecure about the fact that I am inexperienced sexually.”

Through getting to know each other more, he’s offhandedly told me multiple stories of random girls from school or girls he’s friends with hitting on him, or showing that they were into him, and him feeling really uncomfortable and not being interested, which in turn ruined their friendship. 

He also said a few times that he’s considered himself aromatic, but then I found out today that apparently he’s been on dating apps and met up with people a few times, even just a few months before we became friends. The dates never went anywhere and sounded like they were all bad, but still not something an aromantic person would do. 

At this point I’m really confused as to wtf is going on with him. I mean it seems like he has the vague inclination to date but never wants any of the women who have come onto him.

I also feel weird that he told me a lot of personal things about himself and his questioning asexuality, while neglecting to mention he’s been on dating apps, even though I’ve brought up the topic of dating apps lots of times when talking about my own experiences. Maybe it was accidentally, but it kind of felt like he was hiding that from me. 

Also, he’s pretty close with his 3 siblings but has told me that he never mentioned anything to them about his potential asexuality. Yet he felt comfortable sharing a lot of about that part of his life with me, only after knowing each other a few weeks. 

He’s also made an off handed comment or two about me being “hot” or 10/10. Having a great personality, being a catch etc. 

We get along really well and talk all the time, he recently introduced me to his family and his siblings seem to like me to. I spent 4th of July with all of them after he invited me to their BBQ.

I like him, but I don’t want to be another female friend who he ends up rejecting. If he thinks I’m attractive, and a good person, and we get along well enough for him to talk to me really frequently, why doesn’t he want to date me?

TL;DR I have a crush on my guy friend who seems to have a history of rejecting female friends who like him romantically. He also claimed at one point (somewhat unconvincingly) to be asexual and aromantic, but revealed later that he doesn’t think he’s actually either of those things. He’s commented that I’m an attractive person and we get along really well. What am I missing?",05Jul2020,1
230,"I was lost in a 15 minute zoned-out train of thought the other day and the idea kinda just hit me. I was texting him at the time (btw I’m m16 and he’s 17 but we graduate in ‘21 so we would be 17 and 18 at the time of the trip) and I told him we should take a trip to Japan. We have both said before how cool it would be to go there and it just hit me that this is the sort of thing we could possibly do. I talked to my parents about it and they both seemed pretty unsure about the whole idea but I think if I earned it and payed for whatever I needed of the whole trip they would allow it. My friend is pretty easily home-sick and has expressed his sort of discomfort on short camps and such but I feel like he would really enjoy the trip and it would be a nice sort of step into adulthood, if that makes sense. I am definitely not going to try and force him into anything because I really value this friendship. This would only happen if he was also 100% for the idea and wanted to do it. I really want this trip to happen and I have a little under a year to prepare and plan but I feel like I am overall very ignorant in matters that apply to this situation. I am a pretty smart person and could do some research and figure out a plan and most of the on-paper factors but I feel wildly unprepared for this large of a task. I feel like I have a sort of intelligence vs wisdom sort of complication here. I feel capable but when I think of all the different factors of a trip abroad and the planning necessary I just feel way overwhelmed. I feel like I screw up a lot of things that are important like this so I really want to make sure I do this right and take any proper precautions or steps.

233,"Today I went on my usual walk with my s/o. I had just ate dinner but that's pretty typical. It was a beyond burger made at home. Our walks are typically an hour/ hour and a half long. After going through majority of the walk (1hr 15min in) we began smoking a Stizzy 1g pre roll, (which isn't uncommon we smoke everytime about the same amount) and I had smoked majority of the roach at the end. 

We were sitting down relaxing , already done smoking, when I suddenly started seeing black all around me. I then had to lay my torso down on my boyfriend until I abruptly threw up. I felt like it was gonna come out of one end or the other I couldn't even stop it. I then laid down there for awhile drank water poured some water on a rag and on me and breathed until I felt better. We went to go walking home so I can I lay down and next then you know blacks surrounding me again and I don't know what's happening at all, i don't even recall what happens next my s/o said I fell to the ground and they brought me to a place I could sit I sat down I fell forward my s/o caught me and had to lay me on the dirt ground. 

My s/o then started shaking me and calling me and I was no responsive, and then I made a very unnerving noice I couldn't speak, and my s/o told me they were going to call the police, meanwhile from my perspective everything went completely black I felt like I was in a deep sleep my entire body tingling I have absolute no memory of this AT ALL. I woke up to my s/o crying reminding me of our first dates and the first time we met begging me to stay with them. I then started seeing slight glimpses of my surroundings and remembering what happened last. I finally came to and my s/o poured water on my shoulders and I sat there until I could get better enough to finish the walk. We finished the walk until at the very end I started seeing black again my s/o ran to the bottom of the street got the car and drove me the rest of the way. I've been laying in bed ever since.

They have heard a lot of good things about down here in the new city and how WAY WAY WAY WAY better it Is than the previous town. We already talked and planned for my friends that we become roommates! But big issue. They are class of 2021 and I'm class of 2020. 

So we decided to wait until they graduate and save up money to get a place. Great idea right!! Eh maybe. 

After months of being settled on the plan and me working and being kinda independent. I've had more candidates as roommates come up (they are all people I highly trust) and decisions are getting harder. So I decided to think about a townhome or a house to rent so we all can live in a house together and of course split rent and essential bills (that are not personal) there are 4 people that are trying to move in 2 have already graduated this year while the other two that I previously mentioned haven't 

Anyways.

We were planning to rent someplace by November of next year as from what I've been told is that that month is the cheapest for renting places (please please correct me if I'm wrong) but I have no clue whether a townhome or house would be better?

I understand the main differences of course. But I'm not sure if there are any benefits to having one or the other

243,"So first off, I greatly love my dad very much. I would say he is a good father to me and my sister. He paid for my college schooling (I only did community college, have no interest in getting anything further, and I would have to go into debt as he couldn’t afford it). I am and will forever be grateful for him in my life.

However.

Him and I greatly disagree on many things politically. This might not sound like a big deal, but it does kind of get rough. I would say he is very ignorant, stupid, and arrogant. I would even say that he is not a good person.
Just an example: the BLM riots and the murder of George Floyd. He does not believe it was murder and is blindly pro-cop. He hasn’t seen the video however bc he doesn’t want to see a guy die. He thinks if it was a white guy, none of these riots, etc would have happened and nobody would have said anything. He thinks the cop losing his job was more than enough.
I do not think my dad is evil. He is also a non-violent person, he’s not a redneck, etc. But he’s just so ignorant and indeed racist. He doesn’t align with conservatives or liberals and thinks it’s all a bunch of nonsense. But he sure acts conservative.

I fight with him on these types of issues, me being fairly nuanced and liberal in my views, and he always says “you can have your opinion and I can have mine”. I agree with that to a certain extent, but sometimes that can’t be a viable excuse.

Basically I want advice on what to do. I don’t want to disconnect from my dad. He’s never been abusive toward us and has always been greatly supportive and positive about me and my sister. But at the same time, these views of his are just immorally wrong based on ignorance and lack of compassion for anyone besides his family. Beyond what I’ve already done which is trying to make him see his ignorance, what should I do? Should I give up because he’s set in his ways? Should I disconnect from him entirely because these views are inexcusable? Should I keep arguing but don’t take it too seriously? What should I do?",05Jul2020,1
244,"Long post so there will be a TL;DR at the bottom.

Since 16 years old(currently 19m) I've been on a downward spiral and just don't know how to get out of it, I have yet to graduate(will now be 2 years late in graduating) no job, literally 0 friends to hangout with, and my parents don't try to help, they just get angry at me that I'm stuck in this shitty rut. 

It started back in 11th grade near the end, I had always had school issues, and even completely missed half of my 10th grade classes(I was able to go to 11th though cause in Canada you move up regardless of your grade, you just will retake classes in the next year) but somehow I brought it back up and managed to get on track to graduate by the end of senior year by the time I ended 11th grade. However this was also when my life went to shit, I had gotten my first girlfriend at the end of 9th grade, and had 2 friends who I was constantly hanging out with(A is friend 1and B is friend 2, will be important later) they were the ones who supported me and lifted me up when my family didn't. They played a big part in helping me fix my schooling and get back on track. Then, at the end of 11th grade my now Ex just, left. Barley gave me any reasons(I know she doesnt have to but, still sucked) and practically shit on the whole 2 years we had together, it sucked. After that my friends  A, B and I planned to move 5 hours away to a bigger city, where we had all gotten offered a job by A's stepfather, for over a year we all, together would talk about our new life in the bigger city, being able to leave this terrible town and actually foward our lives. We were meant to move August 2019, and then when the month came for us to move, I tried texting A/B to have them help move my stuff(B had moved into A's once he was 18) and neither of them responded for the whole month, effectively ghosting me, even A's parents had stopped communicating with me and my parents about the move. And then 2 days after the supposed move date, I get a text from A telling me to give all the stuff back he's given me over our friendship. Needless to say I was broken, and in a lot of pain, I truly haven't been the same since, and everyday I think about why they left me and what I've done wrong in life, I've been feeling completely empty and emotionless to the point I stopped trying to finish school all together, and last job I had I was so enpty while working my manager thought I needed a therapist before working somewhere again. So here I am, no friends, no job, no diploma at 19, and no one to talk to. I just need something that could help

TL;DR: had a plan to move away and start a new life with 2 friends after my ex just randomly broke up with me. They decided it's better to leave me behind without telling me, now I've been feeling empty and lost for over a year with no ideas in what to do",05Jul2020,1
245,"This is weird, but I don’t remember losing my virginity at all. I know it happened but I couldn’t tell you how or where I lost it. I know who it’s with but I’m unsure of why I wouldn’t remember anything about it. 

I’ve never asked the guy because I didn’t want to come off as rude for not remembering something “special”, as he also lost his virginity, but I also don’t have a clue what happened that night. 

Does anyone have any advice or maybe a similar situation that would explain what’s going on? I haven’t ever had memory of the event to my knowledge. I don’t remember talking about it much but I’m sure I knew where I was the day after. Now however, and even less than a year after it happened, I lost memory of it.",05Jul2020,1
246,"I am a permanent resident of a country where there is mandatory 2 year national service. I’m not sure about the legality of me leaving at this stage but if I do I won’t be able to work here at best or never be able to return at worse. I don’t see a future in this country except for the  decent university opportunities and the fact that I have family and friends here. If I do stay I’ll be going through 2 years of service with shit pay and very little time to focus on improving myself and having a social life. Afterwards I can stay on in the country and go to university and get a decent job. On the other hand if I leave I’ll immediately start Uni and start working earlier and get to stay in a new country which feels much more fresh than the country I’m staying in right now. I’d like to add that my Long term plan is to immigrate either way to Europe or another country. 

What this problem boils down to is should I stay for short term stability and keep whatever friendships and life I have now while potentially wasting 2 years of my life or should I make a leap of faith and start “adulting” earlier so I don’t have to take on the burden of serving a country I plan on leaving in the future anyways.

I suggested that instead of wording questions like ""Do you want to....?"" say ""Can you...?"" but he feels like he shouldn't have to ask and that we should automatically know when he needs help.

I push carts at a grocery store 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. I work from 2-10 so I have weird hours. I also stay up until 3 in the morning and wake up at 10-11. I don’t feel like I can work out before going to my job because then I’ll be too tired to run around and push 15 carts at once. I feel like I can work out after work in my garage but I just don’t know when’s a good time and also I cant be loud because my family is in bed at this time. However my job helps me burn calories and keeps me from becoming fat, it has actually helps my calves and biceps. However I’m not all muscles. I know I can be better and want to be better.

I eat like a trash can. I drink nothing but soda and I only eat junk food when I’m on break. I try to make healthier choices but they never seem to stick. On top of that I don’t know how to cook and know nothing about protein and calories. I use to work out and ate the things I was told to eat but it never showed much results.

253,"Ok so four years ago my special needs son reported his older half brother (also special needs)for playing a “game” where he “changed” my sons’ (plural I had three) diapers (all potty trained by then) and used this “game” to molest them. My stepson does not and did not live with us. His mother was the primary caregiver and was paid child support because she insisted on sole custody. 

After some CBT we were advised by CSB they would close the case and he could translation into being allowed back into our home during visitation or during my husbands weekend to take him since his (stepsons) mom needed to get respite. 
Stepson has the cognitive functioning of a toddler. And he has autism. 

But he still hurt my kids. And he was phased back in way too soon because bio mom was insisting that she needed a break and couldn’t deal with him alone. 

Anyway I accepted this but then I had to do 90% of the check ups whenever he was out of my sight because he had a tendency to masturbate in front of my minor children. I brought this up to my husband and he kept saying “just tell him to stop”

Ok but then stepson also has unmitigated anger issues. He starts shaking and screaming and turning red if you correct him on the slightest stuff. He tears clothes out of my kids closets that I spent hours organizing 
And I correct him and he becomes violently shaking. He doesn’t hit anyone but himself but still you cannot correct this dude without him acting way too intense and tbh idk how much therapy he ever received for his behaviors. Even since 2019 I had to correct him for masturbating while looking at my daughter while visiting MY home. 

I spoke to my husband tonight that I think it’s disturbing that his son keeps sending me and him pics of diapers labeled with our children’s names on them specifically kids he molested.

He said stepson doesn’t mean anything by it. Ok but that’s the instrument of abuse he used on my children. And he’s allowed over all the time even tho covid is still a real threat. He’s 21 now and he was going on 17 when he molested our children. 

Husband thinks I’m overreacting and being unfair. Because I said “idk maybe he should go to jail if he touches my kids again” but literally every other child molester would be in jail. Because it’s his child it’s not fair. And I get there’s an element of him having a disability so maybe it’s not the right choice but I don’t like my kids being exposed to someone with predatory intentions and he has access to my kids photos. I can’t know why he’s using the photos. It could be innocent. But he wouldn’t have them if my husband would have deleted his Facebook like he had said he would. My Facebook is long gone. But my husband said his games are too important to delete the app and besides stepson shouldn’t have to not have pics of his siblings butt imo if he’s looking at them and putting them in diapers in his mind that’s really disgusting.

I don’t know how to navigate this situation to where all of our children feel part of the family and protected and wanted. I’m not saying we ostracize the 21 year old. (Literally if it were any other 21 year old masturbating in front of minors....) but I’m saying we need a solution. My kids are starting to forget those incidences because they were so young. But forgetting them doesn’t or shouldn’t warrant complacency. My husband says “if I have to watch him better when he’s here I will”
But I’m like “ok but so far you never ever watch him. I watch him. I follow him around” I don’t have the energy to follow him everywhere. I have chronic illnesses and cannot keep following him into every room. 

What if anything can I say to his dad so this gets nipped in the bud because I can’t promise I will be nice if a repeat of what happened with my sons happens again. I don’t know how to be calm a second time. I was already nice about it.",05Jul2020,1
254,"My 17 year old cat wasn’t eating much and she’s been lethargic for days. She also began wheezing a little. I took her to the vet yesterday and they ran bloodwork and listened to her lungs. The vet said her lungs sounded mostly clear and maybe she was anemic because she was borderline anemic last year. She also  went from 6 lbs to 4 lbs in a years time. He gave her some fluids, did a urine sample and blood panel and I left with an appetite stimulant med for her. 


Since yesterday her condition has deteriorated. She isn’t eating and we’ve offered her just about everything- cat food, chicken, tuna, whole milk. She drank some water from the faucet but that’s it. She is weak and can’t walk far so I’ve been carrying her. But she doesn’t want to lay with me like she usually does. I bring her to bed with me and she stands up and walks to the edge like she wants off. So I pick her up and set her down and she keeps going back to the refrigerator to lay in front of the vent where the the hot air comes out. Even though it’s warm in the house this is where she wants to be. So I took a towel and laid on the floor with her while I cried. How do I comfort her? does she want to be left alone? I don’t want her to feel abandoned or die alone. 


The vet called me back and said the bloodwork was mostly normal but neutrophils (I think) were in the normal range but the high end which indicates inflammation that could be anywhere. He said she might have asthma or a lung infection and we could do xrays tomorrow. He also said this could just be an overall organ shut down due to her age. Said to call in the am if she isn’t any better.... which I’ll do. I know in my heart she is dying and my heart is breaking. I don’t know if she’s in pain. I’ll probably have to put her down.

For example this one girl got braids the same color as her and she said “wow you really gonna do that” when she walked by. Like?? 

     So a month ago I got my sister to come work with me so it’s easier for my mom to drop us of she’s 16 but last week another one of my managers had a talk with my sister telling me Jenna counted her till and has found out she was short over $50 on more than three occasions and then Jenna came by and said if it’s another $100 missing she’s going to be terminated. Now I know my sister can’t count change she’s one of the smartest and most careful people I know and I know for a fact she’s never pocket the money or anything like that. She also mentioned she heard another manager talking with a coworker that when she opened the office door, Jenna quickly closed the screen that we count our tills on. 

    My boyfriend who also works with me has told when I first started working there she’s known for finding drawers that come up short all the time and it’s always happens when’s she’s counting the tills and it’s usually only her. I talked to my sister and she doesn’t know what to do, is this something I should take up with corporate or discuss with another manager because she has “tenure” in a way she’s been working here for almost 20 years so I don’t think they’d ever believe us over her.",05Jul2020,1

After being furloughed from my part time retail job for almost 4 months, I go back to work tomorrow. But I'm honestly dreading it... before the pandemic started, I was looking for other jobs that would pay better but they were jobs that I wasn't really passionate about. I only cared about the money. Money is kind of important right now cus I wanna move out of my parent's house. 
But anyways, being unemployed for so long has made me realize that I'm sick and tired of being unhappy with my work. I hate that feeling. A few weeks ago, I started a side gig doing custom hand painted shoes and I love it. I've always loved painting and I would say I'm pretty good at it so I thought maybe I should have a career in art but I know most art jobs are low paying and next to impossible to get hired for. I also love animals but again, they are low paying jobs and most animal jobs are done by volunteers (like at an animal shelter). I graduated community college about 6 months ago with a degree in social and behavioral sciences because it was the degree required to transfer to the university I had chosen to get a degree in criminology but I realized that I wasn't sure if I wanted to do that or not and also that's what my family wanted me to do. My family now keeps asking me what I wanna do or when am I gonna get a ""real job"". They're really getting on my nerves but I don't want to do something just to make them happy. I already did that by getting an associate's degree in something that I may never use. I know I want a fulfilling career that I'll be happy with. I told my family I would like to have a career in either art or animal care and they basically just told me those aren't real career choices and I need to either choose a real career or marry someone rich. It makes me sad and depressed because I want to do something fulfilling but right now, I feel like I'm wasting my life away. My bf has tried to help me look for jobs which I really appreciate him for but they weren't anything I really wanted to do. I'm sick and tired of feeling so lost and confused with my life.

So I'm really at a loss here. Is there anyone who could maybe give me advice on how I could find a fulfilling career in either art or animal care. Or perhaps how to help me figure out other career options I may be interested in? Anything would help. Thank you :)",05Jul2020,1

276,"My boyfriend and I (20s) are nearly inseparable. He’s one of the kindest and most open people I know, and I really, really care about him. He’s very sweet to me and tries including me in everything. His family seems to like me, we have similar interests, and he’s basically my dream man with the exception of this one thing. I’m 99.999% sure that it’s an issue with me rather than him and I’m hoping to figure out how to move past it. 

Recently I started wondering if he still has feelings for his ex. They were together for a few years and only decided to separate a few months before he and I started dating. He didn’t want to end the relationship. She pushed to end it and he just gave up and said okay. I knew that they were still talking in a friendly manner when he and I were still dating casually, but they eventually stopped and we became more serious. I’m not sure why they stopped. I think they just drifted apart. 

One thing I hated was that I didn’t have him on anything. No Snapchat, no Discord, no Facebook, nothing. I wasn’t too worried since he only uses Snapchat and Twitter (I don’t think he has a Reddit) and I rarely use either, but it’s still kind of weird in my circle. He’s often on both and we regularly look at things on each other’s phones. It’s always with permission and often to only look at random memes. We both know each other’s phone passwords, but neither of us believe in invading the other person’s privacy. 

He was showing me something a little bit ago and my heart kind of sank when I looked at his screen... his ex’s name was there. She hadn’t texted him but he was still following her. He occasionally reminisces about their time together but I thought they had cut ties. Apparently she’s cut ties, but he’s still connected to her in a sense. 

It really hurt knowing that he was still following his ex but he (to my knowledge) had made no effort to connect with me elsewhere. I had though. It’s partially jealousy and insecurity for sure but I decided to tell him how I felt. I didn’t ask him to unfollow her or anything, but I did tell him that it felt a little weird being unable to show anyone photos of us or really having anything to show that I know him outside of his number in my phone. Eventually I admitted that I was scared that they had something he and I never would; I was (and am) worried that he regrets his decision to date me rather than take her back. The issue is that he agreed that we may never have what they had. 

I was hoping he would unfollow her. I won’t deny that, but I trust him and believe in coming to compromises. He says that he was following her because he wanted to make sure she was safe, but it’s been several months since they’ve last spoken and she’s obviously in no danger given what she was posting. The “resolution” was that he added me... after I removed and re-added him so he could find my tag. He was talking about her the morning afterwards just like he normally would. I brought it up again and he stopped bringing her up as often... until we were talking about my upcoming classes. I was unhappy that we wouldn’t be able to see each other as much due to my online classes, and it somehow turned into how he was used to doing that with her. And how his friends would go out to a breakfast diner we both like when their girlfriends were out of town and how they did it when she left. And what she liked. And... well, I could go on. 

Occasionally he has days where he’ll just talk so much about her... it’s very hard on me to be honest. He promised me that we’re a better pair and that we share more than they did, but I guess I’m just scared that he prefers her over me. He says otherwise, but his stories and actions indicate that he still cares a lot about her. How do I address my insecurities here? I verbalized how I felt and we had a conversation about it, but I can’t seem to let this fear and pain go...",05Jul2020,1
277,"Hi hello! This is my 1st time posting anywhere on reddit but I really need some help or at least trying to figure this out because this was worrisome. So my younger brother, his girlfriend and I were on the street outside of our house looking at the fireworks. We live in a dead end , secluded long road Cul-de-sac (if that makes sense) . So we're all hanging watching the explosions when a giant red van comes full speed down our street . Not only was it going super fast with what seem no intention of stopping, the beamers were on blinding us. As it came closer we stepped on the sidewalk and stared at the van. The van does a super sharp turn so its right in front of our mail box . We are right across the street but in full view if the mail box and the van just sits there for 30 seconds as if the person inside (whom we could not see) was staring at us. We freak out , cross the street and starting heading to the back of house , once we crossed the van took off super fast. Should I jusy forget about this situation or alert the authorities??

278,"Disclaimer: I know very well motherhood is not easy and is very stressful, and I don’t mean to discourage any moms out there by insisting parenting is easy, but please only reply if you have anything positive to contribute:

I am so tired of hearing new moms complaining about having kids and making it seem funny how tired they are and being “so relatable” while doing nothing to actually telling us how they make it more bearable. They only seem to want to add onto the “I’m a mess, my house is a mess, I’m constantly tired and sleep deprived.........BUT I LOVE MY BABY” trend, but frankly I need to hear something different.

Are there any stories you have as new moms where you found pregnancy, labour, and giving birth much less abrasive and less stressful as advertised on tv?

Are there any instances where you found a great way to get a reasonable amount of sleep with a newborn and not be “walking like a damn zombie?” I can’t believe not one mom found a solid basic system (despite all babies being different)

Who has actually kept their houses tidy despite the fact a baby is one tiny person who can’t possibly make the entire house a mess?

281,"Ok, for context. I'm currently 17 years old, my Dad is an older Irish-American Catholic guy age 56. Back when I was in middle school, my mom came to me and told me that she looked through texts on my phone and from reading my messages she was now aware that I was a lesbian, and she also told me that my dad was now aware of the situation as well. I was really depressed at the time and especially after that incident, I felt really betrayed and confused and my parents let me start going to therapy. 

All interactions surrounding my sexuality and mental health were via me talking to my mom or my therapist, never me talking to my dad. I was raised Catholic and the reason that I never officially came out as a lesbian was because I feared that my family wouldn't be accepting, most notably my more religious dad. I've been really lucky in that in my family nothing bad happened to me after they discovered my sexuality. However, it's been four years since then and while I got the opportunity to talk it through with my mom and brother, I've still never truly sat down with my dad and discussed it with him. 

I don't know if I'm being irrational, but I'm secretly terrified that he is disappointed in me for being gay. I no longer attend church services either. This is another stupid minor detail, but whenever my family discusses future weddings or girlfriends or anything, we always focus on my brother and never me- kind of like we're avoiding a touchy subject. I don't really know how to talk to him, he's a very stoic traditional guy and even though I know he loves me it's a strange existence to never have addressed it, as well as never having had an official coming-out experience. I don't communicate well with my Dad, but I feel like I need to hear him say that my being gay doesn't matter to him or that he supports me in that way for me to feel closure with my sexuality and my family, but I don't know how to address the situation.

284,"I live in a house that was bought (25 years ago) and is owned by my grandparents (dad's side). I have lived in this house with my family and grandparents for 25 years. My parents have been paying for all the bills (ultility/hydro/property tax,groceries, etc.)

When my grandpa passed away in 2015, one of my aunts (I will refer to her as aunt M) got power of attorney for my grandma (it was some BS excuse since my grandma was and still is fully competent).

There has been family drama since I was a kid, but in short all of my dad's siblings hate my mom and would do anything to make her life miserable.

Aunt M is an extremely manipulative person and coerced my grandma into believing that she needs to move into an old age home and sell the house. Despite my grandma being fully competent she will side with her daughter no matter what since she is more worried about her reputation than my family (who has been caring for her for 25 years).

Here are my questions:

1. Is there anything me/my family can do to have Aunt M hand over the will, since she is not named in the will (my dad is)

2. Is there anyway we can revoke her power of attorney?

3. Although the house that I live in is under my grandma's name, does that fact that my parents have paid all the bills for 25 years do anything positive for us?",05Jul2020,1

However, i am terrfified that if my GP or reffered psychologist is homophobic, they will tell my parents and i will either end up homeless or dead. For the first time in 2 years i left the house to apply for an income support payment. I have to get a medical certificate from a doctor to exempt me from looking for work for 3 months. I know that he won't let me go without reffering me to a psychologist. And after the 3 months i have to start looking for work or my payment will be cancelled. The only other option after that is a disaillity support pension, which is extremely diffcult to get, as your condition needs to be seen as fully diagnosed and treated.

Here is my story to provide further context about my situation.

Growing up in primary school (k-6 in Australia) I acted feminine. I remember people used to say “Are you gay?”, “Are you a boy or a girl?”. I don’t think I cared that much, I just knew I was different. It wasn’t until i started to hear my parents talk badly about gay people when they would see them in public or on tv that I knew that ""it wasn’t ok”. I also grew up a Jehovah’s Witness and at meetings they would talk about how gay people were going to die in Armageddon. My father was also physically abusive. He would chase me around the house and laugh and beat me with the belt. He once choked me and dragged me outside during a meeting and nobody did anything. I remember I did a car park security check with my dad and a JW member and they were talking about how if they weren’t JW’s they would go around killing gay people. I was probably 8 at the time.

I had to learn to keep my feminine personality at school and a “normal” personality at home. All my friends were girls and when my parents questioned me about it I just told them that I’m not interested in the same things as the boys. I think they let it go because they thought that I wasn’t acting “gay” anymore. And they also probably thought that they weren’t a good influence on me because JW’s believe that “worldly people” are bad and boys tend to be more into violent video games, movies etc. One time when I was out shopping with my parents a friend ran up to me. I didn’t know how to react. I just stood there silent and frozen because I couldn’t be the person that I was (that my friend knew me as) in front of my parents.

I was so brainwashed by the religion that when I was 5 years old I remember telling people in the shopping aisles that they were going to die because they weren’t a JW. They just looked at my mum like she was crazy. I had nightmares about dying in many different apocalyptic scenarios. God facing me in front of my parents and telling me that I was going to die because I was gay. These nightmares didn’t stop until I was 15 and stopped believing in god.

I'm not going to come out until I move out. I don’t think I can tell my parents because I know what the reaction will be. I’m even scared of giving them my new address, because if they find out that i'm gay I fear they will come after me. I will have to cut them off completely.

At the end of the last year of primary school I would cry when I was around my friends because I was scared of losing them in high school. I was scared of what the older kids would think of me and I knew that I wouldn’t have the confidence to be the person I was in primary school. I was scared that my friends would leave me because they would be judged for associating with me. And unfortunately that’s exactly what happened. After a few days into year 7 my friends acted like I was a stranger to them. They told me to leave them alone and stop “following them”. I messaged them and told them why what they did to me hurt me so much. The next day at school they said I could be their friend but I had to act “normal”. I didn’t know how to act “normal” and “fit in”. The way I acted “normal” around my parents was by being shy. I had no personality when I was around my parents.

This is when the social anxiety began. In Year 8 (2015) I completely shut down. I developed acne and I hand no self confidence. I could no longer talk to people and I isolated myself completely. I would walk around school with my head faced down because I didn’t want anyone to see my face and acne. I only left the house to go to school. If my family went on trips and I was forced to go with them I would never leave the hotel room. It was debilitating. At this point the social anxiety and depression took over and the suicidal thoughts began. I would go on suicide forums looking for the best painless way to do it. I had a plan but I couldn’t go through with it. I was scarred that it would fail and I would have to live with lifelong disabling injuries. I remember having nightmares about being paralysed for the rest of me life, stuck inside my head forever. Forever unable to end my pain. In Year 9 my skin and self confidence improved, the suicidal thoughts weren’t as often, but the social anxiety, depression and isolation remained. In Year 11 I started to develop panic attacks. The amount of work I had to do became overwhelming, and I began questioning if I was good enough. I was worried about what my teachers would think of me if I didn’t succeed. In classes my heart would race, I felt dizzy and nauseous and like I had a lump in my throat. I felt like I had to run out of the room. The panic attacks would last for about 15 minutes and would happen almost everyday. I stopped going to school from June 2018 and long distance education was organised. I haven’t left the house since. As soon as I turned 17 (allowed age) I dropped out. After i dropped out my plan was to go to the doctors to get help but I haven’t been able to force myself to go.

Any advice is appreciated. Thank you for listening.",05Jul2020,1
296,"Hey guys, I could really use some advice. I've been absolutely miserable in my current job for over a year now. The workload is brutal and it's definitely put strain on my health, both mentally and physically. I've been applying like crazy and this week I got a job offer. The company seems really great but from the onset my gut made me feel uneasy about the job. I had two interviews, one of which was with the CEO (it's a smaller company); neither interview really asked me about my skills or experience.  The second interview was maybe 10 minutes long and only involved me telling them what I currently do in my current role.  And after those 10 minutes they were ready to offer me the job. They seem nice, were rated one of the best places to work in my state for their size and have unlimited PTO. 

The offer just seemed too easy to get; neither person I spoke with cared to ask about my qualifications.  I can't pinpoint why I really feel this way, but something about the company feels off. Every interview I've ever had in my career has been at least somewhat difficult or challenging. 

In this job climate what should I do? Accept and move on or turn it down and keep searching?",05Jul2020,1
297,"Okay so I wanted to have a discussion around body image and stuff, because it was brought up in a group I was in, and there is one person in the group who always expresses their idea that the future could bring the technology to just switch appearence at will or to take your own mind and put it in a new body, they also often play as the opposite sex in video games and have a severe body image issue, their ideal form is the opposite of what most people of their gender would want.

Does this sound like body dysmorphia or some kind of disphoria about gender or EVEN, some kind of uncomfortableness with their own sexuality when it comes to same sex?

299,"I know everyone says that to be in a healthy relationship you actually have to discuss the things that bother you and work through them. I also know that everyone says that sometimes in a healthy relationship you have to be able to let things go and understand when a conflict isn’t worth having.

I’m currently annoyed at my girlfriend over something that I know is small. She did something I think was really inconsiderate. I know it was unintentional, but it really hurt my feelings.

But on the other hand, I feel like bringing it up to her would only create unnecessary strife &amp; hurt her over something I know was unintentional and not a big deal

How do you learn to walk that line in relationships. And more importantly how do I learn to let things go without letting them turn to resentment?

300,"Using the alt so he doesn't see.

TL;DR My friend lives in a total shithole but he seems really happy with the life he lives. Should I report it to CPS? 

My friend who is also 14 (we are going into 9th grade) lives in a severely dangerous household. His mom is a Grade A coke addict and sells herself while he's there, she sells all his stuff for coke money and lets plugs live in his room all the time and sends him out.

The area he lives in also seriously worries me as it is one of the worst parts in my entire city and he has been directly involved in seriously unhealthy and unsafe situations. His mom is not only a Coke fanatic but also a Booze Connoisseur and dabbles in the art of marijuana from day to day, and has let and even encouraged him to try the lesser two of three evils on multiple occasions. His house was the wrong number in a drive-by shooting and his room was hit by three bullets. He got seriously traumatized by this, as is to be expected and she did nothing to soothe him.

She barely ever pays attention to him except for when she needs something from him and has let him eat whatever he wants and he's gotten to be well over 300lbs by now, and is almost entirely inactive. She never lets him do anything and destroys or sells all the stuff he has and has effectively turned him into her lapdog, the kind of lapdog you enjoy screaming violently at whenever it poops in the neighbors yard.

He completely flunked this year thanks to her encouraging him against going to school and in some cases forbidding him from going to school. The times that stand out to me are when he missed nearly 2 weeks and refused to tell anyone why, and when he missed a week because his 'grandma slipped in the tub' (I've never noticed any signs of physical abuse but I am led to seriously believe she kicked the shit out of him when these situations happened).

I try to play games with him and I have been able to on and off for a few months, but that's not okay with his mom because that means he can't be her Butler for the entirety of 30 minutes and in order to avoid that she screams at him and has apparently recently been telling him that I'm not his friend and he needs to stop talking to me.

I know it probably is weird I know so much but I'm really close to him and although obviously I can't prove it over the internet I can assure you these stories were not made up. I'm sure most of you know the types of people who pour things out on you once they trust you. He's definitely one of these people and for a justifiable reason.

What I just layed out should have a pretty simple solution: Report it and let CPS handle it. However, I really don't know if it's the right choice. In a very strange way he seems to be happy when he's with his mom even though she treats him like garbage. He seriously loves her and cares for her in a way that's reminiscent of the son on a mother's day poster. As awful as she is I think he's her only constant, as he's had 3 dads who are all dad and an abundance of brothers who have cut off ties when they got old enough. I don't know how he would react if he lost her too, and his friends. And, having a parent who went through a similar process along with a friend who went through a similar process, it doesn't seem like being taken away from a situation like that will even improve his life. I've nearly reported it many times but I don't have the balls to do it when I think about all that. My mom found out about it and was obviously disgusted by the way he was being treated but also is hesitant to do anything.

I think it's become pretty obvious what I need advice over. Should we report it? I seriously don't know what to do. All I want is for him to be happy. Any and all advice is obviously appreciated.",05Jul2020,1

Ever since I was little every day has been filled with rampant shouting and screaming, always insulting either my mother or my twin brother (who has downsyndrome) for issues completely unrelated to them. For example, if he is struggling with something and asks one of us for help and he doesn't immediately get it, we receive a 30minute screeching of how useless we are and that we are a waste of space. For me, I'm not sure why, he has always been calm with, minus the punches/smacks when we were younger, which (I think) is normal. But he compltely loses it at my mother/brother.

For example he has my mother in a place where she is so mentally abused she breaks down every other night, which gets met with abuse from my dad to her and my brother (because he lacks the emotional empathy to realise it is himself causing the pain). Or when he is shouting, saying anything in defense that not being able to instantly do something for always a perfectly good reason isn't her fault is met by more horrible screeching which he then completely devalues her as a human and blames her for everything. Then 20 minutes after he goes back to being a normal parent until he flips again. I understand this may seem pretty petty for me to pick up on but it has completely destroyed her motivation and self value of her self and how she feels she can't do anything.

However what I think is worse is how he completely hates my brother and constantly tries to ask my mother to leave him and send him away (always when I'm not around, again I still don't understand how he always seems afriad to do anything when I'm around, as im not exactly the biggest threat to him). Whenever my brother does something wrong he shouts at him at how awful he is as a human and how much he hates him and wants to leave. As he has DS he has a wide array of different behaviour problems and inability to aptly express himself which leads to anger and this only worsens things. The reason why I am writing this is because when my brother was trying to push my mother away (sure misbehaving but not to the extent that warrants an extreme reaction) he was dealt the whole charade aswell as the line *if you dare do that I will kill you* I think it is a flawed insult as he has never physically abused anyone in my immediate family (in my lifetime atleast i think) and his attacks are only verbally.

Whilst many of you may think it is only him shouting 'grow a thicker skin' it is really tearing my mother to shreds and if my brother fully understood the extent of his rages it would to him too, and I just can't stand seeing the two most important people in my life suffer, so eventhough I'm only 17 is there anything really that I can do in this situation?",05Jul2020,1

307,"First off I’d like to say a couple things

1. I apologize for bad grammar I’m typing this around 3 am
2. This is my first ever reddit post so I’d like to apologize if this isn’t the right reddit for this post if not can someone direct me towards that.

Anyways. I’m a 17 y/o M who lives in Midwest US. I’ve had a good life. Loving parents, never had money problems, always food on the table etc. (also i should add my parents are split but still friendly which I’m also very lucky for) I am atheist but I’m not against religion i just can’t convince myself in anything. Despite all this I’ve been heavily depressed for the past couple years and have been going to therapy ever since i took an attempt on my life around a year ago (I’m much better now) but still i don’t know my place in life and i feel so alone sometimes. 

I don’t really have friends, I have many friends who are girls but only one guy friend who i am close with pretty much. Most girls im friends with are just fwb anyways I’m only close with about 3-5 of them but still I kinda just feel alone. I’ve been caught smoking weed a couple times and have stopped because i want my parents to trust me again but I’ve continued my use of psychedelics typically acid and mushrooms trying to find myself which in all honesty has helped but i feel like the more i feel at one with my world the more alone i feel. (I’m not promoting drug use by the way) (also id like to add my lack of friends isn’t my main problem I’m ok having 2-3 or 20-30 friends it doesn’t really effect me)

The reason i brought up smoking is because i felt at peace and it never really came up in my head whenever i would be high on anything I also listen to music as often as possible because they are both crutches from reality in a way, like it brings me out of my current mindset and puts me somewhere else which hides me from the problems with reality and everything i guess.

I recently reconnected with a friend from my old school and she recounted my life at the time to me now and i realized how much of my life I’ve supressed and talking to another person about it we came to the conclusion the person who i reconnected with is probably the only person who truly knows me or is at least closer to knowing me then anyone else i know including myself 

So, I guess what I’m asking for advice on is what would any of you suggest on what I should do to try to find my place in this world/ find myself

I personally don't  have any issues with the way i look. Im just me and I've accepted it. So I need help trying to understand better. Its a constant thing that keeps bothering me.

309,"(English is not my first language and the COVID-19 stuff is mostly under control in the country I live in.)


Last year I (at the time 13F, now 14F) went to a camp and it was great and all. My parents ""forgot"" to pick me up and it broke my mind. I was mad and confused cried  myself to sleep a cuple of nights afterwards. My parents never said sorry and I never forgave them. I gave them the cold shoulder for a long time. It was the only thing I could do. They just pretend that didn't happen at all.

I have a sister (16F) who always gets all the attention so I assumed they forgot me because of her. It's not her fault and we are on good terms now, but every time she's been at camp they always are on time there and sometime one hour early.

This year I'm going to camp again and my mother is insisting that I start exercising because ""Last time you where so tired and just cried"" and ""you where so tired and treated us so bad"" (I am not in any means overweight btw). I don't mind exercising, but every time they talk about last summer's camp it opens a memory I've tried to burry. I know that I treated them bad and after all they paid for the camp, but it doesn't change that they remind me of a sore memory. I get really uncomftable and try to avoid the topic. Now it's starting to sound like they're taunting me.

Should I confront my parents why I gave them the cold shoulder last year? Should I just do as they say and try to burry the sore memory again?",05Jul2020,1

He’s tried to find out where my dorm is, and one time right before we all moved out due to covid I made the mistake of telling him, because he was with one of his friends and I didn’t want her to get mad at me for not revealing it. He creeps me out. To most, he seems like the sweet fun guy. But he’s creepy with me. He’s tried on multiple occasions to get me to let him come over, and he always wanted to know when my room mate wasn’t around.

I have CPTSD from 20 years of bullying at school and at home. I’m tired of it and want out. 

My issue is... I am going for a master’s in social work, with a focus on reproductive rights, medical (disability/sexism/racism/etc) discrimination, and body image issues with women, girls, and LGBTQ people. A LOT of the work I’ll be doing professionally will be online. There will be a lot of writing, public speaking, and “slice of life” sharing to boost campaigns I run or support. 

Additionally, I’m disabled myself. My friends are largely also disabled, meaning we have a wonderful and loving connection but the likelihood of us ever meeting is person is scarce. 

I’d also like to keep the book of faces around for memories, photos, some of the groups I’m in. 

I’m almost wondering if it would be better to create a new “professional” page for myself, scrubbed of anything I wouldn’t want employers to see, and then only add those close friends to that page. It seems like a lot of work and I feel like I’m maybe overreacting.

314,"There is a girl i met on the internet, she is beautiful, intelligent, highly educated and all in all the perfect girl to have, at first sight at least.

She goes on the internet everyday after work, hack and bully other girls. One time she made a little girl on minecraft cry and she was laughing about it.

317,"So, boy do I have a story.  And this is a long and complicated one.  Not even sure where to start.  Regardless, I’m here to tell it and come to the great people of reddit for advice.

To give some context, I’m a middle schooler in all of these stories. Technically, until September I guess I am still a middle schooler, but whatever.

I developed a crush and liked this girl for a bit. For privacy, we’ll call her #1.  #1 was probably at the time the only girl I had any interest in. Personslity, looks, and everything was perfect to me.

I get the idea of asking #1 to a dance for a first date. I end up not doing it because I simply chickened out.

I later learn (2 years later) one of my friends told her and she would’ve said yes.  Call me stupid for not trying. Please actually do. Thats #1’s story for now.

Since I figured it would be awkward to ask then, I just said to myself to get over her.

Next comes along #2 (again name blocked for privacy reasons).  She is also someone fitting all of my requirements.  This is the crazy part, she liked me.

I liked her back.  So we started dating temporarily. Then things derailed. No idea why. No arguments or anything.  She moved away, and I never got any texts back.

I told myself to just get over her.


Let’s move on to #3.  #3 I’m not sure how I feel about. She’s the most recent.  She also fits more of my requirements than #1 and #2.  I liked her and she knew I liked her too.  I even have strong reason to believe she likes me back (99.99% sure of it at this point).

There really aren’t any problems except that I have to often start the convos. She can usually keep them going however.

#3 and I have slowly distanced, however. I worry that soon it will end up like #1.

Let’s move on to where all this is where I need some advice.

Recently, #1 followed me on instagram.  I got over her, or so I thought. Then I started getting a fast heartbeat.  Which is usually a symptom of stress or fear.  What had I to fear?  Nothing happened.

Recently also, I learned #2 was still doing well. Which prompted me to think why she stopped messaging me as she moved away.  I’m not always open to talk about feelings, but I cried. She sent me nothing after 1-1/2 years. Not even a text saying “I don’t want to talk to you.” Or something along those lines.

Where does #3 fit into all of this?  Well.  We plan on going on a date after all the corona stuff in my country is over.  If we end up dating, I don’t want to have feelings for other girls whilst dating someone.

I loved #1 and #2. #1 couldv’e been fixed, #2 not so much.  I need help. How can I get over a these people?

(Before anyone comments “You’re a teenager!  If you’re heartbroken now, wait a few years!” I’m aware. I’ll probably be coming back in a few years asking for similar advice.)

TL: DR: I have feelings for multiple girls.  I might date one of them, and I don’t want to be thinking about other girls if I do so.  How can I get over the other girls?",05Jul2020,1
318,"I (21f) just realized today that whenever I get extremely upset, I literally hold my breath until I HAVE to release it. 

I never even realized I was doing this before. 

OR, I will exhale my breath and not inhale until I have to, then it’s a gasp for air. 

I have panic attacks and realizing this today was like an epiphany for me because I could never understand why everyone always said “focus on your breathing” 

It’s so weird to me that I just now noticed this. 

However, it did always seem like when I did try and focus on my breathing, my lips and extremities would get very tingly and I would feel like I’m gonna pass out. 

So I’m wondering if I just picked up holding my breath to maybe avoid that.

321,"Throughout my life my parents have been really controlling. When I wanted a part-time job at a cafe, my dad and I argued about it and he threatened to cut off my tuition. Mind you I only wanted spending money and wanted to work for it myself. When I got my first internship, they said I should finish school first then get a job. I ended up ubering to my internship and broke even for 3 weeks before they let me borrow a car. I feel like my parents learn (somewhat) from their parenting mistakes and treat my sister differently. She was able to work at a cafe for extra spending money with no arguments. She was given a car right before college (after I fought with them that it was insane to have her dorm for a college that was 15 minutes away). When I got my second internship \~600 miles away, I quickly accepted the offer before my parents could tell me no. My mom wanted me to come home and ""talk"" about it.

I feel like this needs a little backstory, My grandmother is my legal guardian because both of my parents our drug addicts and in prison. My grandma was a nurse in the army when she was younger but she doesn’t like talking about it. She also was raised really poor, her mother had 8 kids and they lived in a 2 bedroom house. Me and my grandma are pretty poor to right now but no where near “we don’t have money to live”. My grandma was abused multiple times by her spouses, she refuses to have a relationship with anyone now even though I tell her I would protect and I really would. I love my grandma so much she’s basically my mother. 

The reason I didn’t tell anyone is that I was scared what would happen. I checked her phone recently and it’s pretty normal searches. I don’t think she’s suicidal anymore but I would feel guilty if she killed her self and I could have stopped it.

326,"I am 24, my boyfriend is 25. He is from Virginia, on the other side of the USA. We have lived together for 4ish years now— no problems in our relationship whatsoever. We are both white and joined some of the protests that were nearby our apartment to stand in solidarity with our community. 

We watched the military roll in and shoot people on their own porches during the curfew. We got pepper sprayed by police after a semi truck rammed through a crowd of thousands of people. Signal blockers have been in place for some time and we barely have cell reception. 

We stand for the protests. I’ve seen first hand the travesty our police system is. But that isn’t what this post is about. 

Our neighbor down the hall of our apartment building is going through an abusive breakup. Her face has been busted open on more than one occasion and I have gotten between her and him when they’ve fought in the hallway. I’ve had to get out of bed at 2 in the morning to chase a belligerent drunk guy out of the building (someone must have let him in after he rang everybody’s door buzzers) before he busted her door down. (I am 5’10”, my boyfriend is 6’8”. We’re tall and bulky people. I can lift about 300 lbs myself) 

We rent through a slum lord company. Our building isn’t up to fire code, the windows are old and there is mold everywhere. They keep jacking our prices on our rent each year we renew. 

With the riots, many places of employment burned down. I have been unemployed for some time and don’t qualify for unemployment due to my depression and anxiety. Needless to say, we absolutely cannot stay. There is no room at my Oma’s place and my father hasn’t talked to me in years.

My boyfriend and I have decided to move to Virginia— an 18-ish hour drive for us to get out of here and get a fresh start closer to his family. However, I have lived in Minnesota my entire life— I don’t know what it is like living anywhere else (save for Germany, I have been multiple times and adored it). My family are all here (again, save for the half in Germany, haha) and I will be arriving without knowing anyone. Our goal is to finish school (he is going for a writing degree, I am going for solar engineering) and save up for a house, living with my boyfriend’s father while we do so. 

My problem is, is that my anxiety is telling me I will hate it, that my depression will get worse and that I will putter out and fail. That I will let my boyfriend down.

334,"The title says it all but I'd like to provide a little bit of the story as to why I need advice.  TL;DR at the bottom.

My family consists of me (20F), my mom and dad (both 48 years of age) and my grandmother and my grandfather (both over 70 years of age).

I am a med student and for the last few days I have had most classes (online) dedicated towards COVID-19 and how to stay safe in the middle of the pandemic. Naturally I'm a bit more scared than usual. And on top of that my home is very close to a containment zone.

My mom suffers from asthma and high blood pressure and I have breathing troubles and allergies. We are both high risk individuals. My grandparents are too because of their age. We (me and my mom) have done our best to stay indoors and follow social distancing laws as much as we can.

My dad and my grandparents however are a whole different story. At first they were convinced COVID-19 was a hoax and didn't wear masks. Later they did start wearing masks but still went out everyday to chat with friends, to the market, to walks and what not. I came up with a plan that wouldn't require us to go out of the house more than once every 14 days (for groceries and stuff) but needless to say everyone except my mom threw a fit. 

Every time I try to respectfully make them understand that this pandemic is far from being over and we have 4 high risk individuals in our house, my dad screams at me, tells me that we are all doomed to get COVID-19, and that I am too young to know anything about this (Keep in mind I am a med student)

My grandma flat out lies to me. She says she goes out just to walk outside, but I've seen her talking to many people in the neighborhood (not maintaining social distancing laws)

My grandpa goes out to the market every single day. 

My dad's defense is that my grandpa feels depressed staying home. And also that this is how we are supposed to live now and we need to make antibodies to COVID-19.

And none of them have good hygiene. I've told them many times to wash hands properly, bathe and wash clothes right after coming home from outside but still they don't. 

Now I'd never forgive myself if my mom has to pay the price for their ignorance. I'd really appreciate it if someone can give me advice on how to deal with my current situation. Apologies for any mistakes.

I’m very happy for them but I can’t help but feel extremely lonely. I feel like I should be there right with them. I recently began a new relationship with someone and it’s going great. Except he doesn’t want kids (I do), he plans on moving to another location in a year or so (I don’t necessarily want to) and said he doesn’t want to do long distance if we’re still together then. I feel like I’m going to be living someone else’s life, which is what I’ve done for SOs in the past... 

I grew up in a pretty shitty household where I was neglected and abused. I’m not even exaggerating when I say I’ve wanted to die at 10 years old due to what was going on. Nobody was ever there for me, even friends growing up. It always seemed like there was something or someone better, and I’d be dropped like nothing. The friends that I have close to me aren’t like that, but I still do fear that it will happen one day. 

It’s almost 4 am where I am. I’m crying myself asleep, at 25, a confident person in all aspects of myself, but not when it comes to feeling like a valued person. Like someone someone else will want. I fear that I’m never going to meet someone who’s going to want to spend the rest of their life with me. To have a life with me, and to consider what I want and need too. 

Fuck. Is this really much to ask for? I don’t know why I feel so undesirable.",05Jul2020,1

342,"Hello, hoping for some advice as i'm young and not entirely knowledgeable on how exactly car insurance claims go about. 

&amp;#x200B;

On the forth of july i was headed home with my gf. We had just stopped at an intersection and were waiting to make a left turn. A few seconds after we had stopped we got hit from behind by a Model X. It must've been a 10-15 mph accident. 

The other driver got out, agreed to stop somewhere safer and agreed to trade information so we could handle the accident appropriately. He told that he did not want to get insurance involved or the police for that matter and told me to get him a quote to any body shop i wanted and that he would pay for everything so that my car gets repaired. 

The damage to my car involved rear bumper damage (cracks and broken tabs, definitely need a new rear bumper) and some dents and scratches to the trunk. I will take the car to a shop soon and get an assessment on whether anything else was damaged that might be overseen. 

I got the driver's information regardless, License/Insurance/plates/pictures of the damage, AND got footage of him hitting my car. I have a forward facing and rear facing camera that got footage of the incident. Also, the footage clearly shows him distracted on his phone trying to either record or capture pictures of the fireworks that were shooting all around us. 

My request for advice is, should i just get a quote from a good body shop and take care of everything eithout insurnace, or should i invovle them and make an insurance claim? what are the benefits of doing/not doing one or the other?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, i might feel some soreness tomorrow, but my gf definitely has some soreness in her neck. Luckily no airbags blew up and there was minor vehicle damage. (The Tesla literally only got one dent on the hood). If her condition gets worse would an insurance claim pay for doctor/chiro?

This was a minor incident thankfully, but i dont want to underestimate mine or my Gf's injuries. Thank You",05Jul2020,1
343,"I (19F) want independence/freedom from my parents without losing them and them thinking I am disrespectful/irresponsible/immature

~*~ I vent A LOT and zigzag through my thoughts, but I promise it will make sense soon ~*~

I always feel like I need a therapist when it’s too late. I have always craved for someone to know exactly what I am going through, exactly what I need, exactly how my parents are, all to be able to guide the path and make the decisions best for me — but I am that person. 

I always wish for my life to be at least somewhat normal. I graduated from the #1 high school in my state, and I made it into the engineering program at my college. I don’t party or go out or have a crazy life that my parents should really comment on. But, of course, I am treated like a child.

I just go with it assuming thats what it is like for everyone my age (19F), especially because I have sisters who are 13 and 2. I guess it isn’t. All of my friends say my parents are controlling for no reason. They really have never had a reason to not trust me. I have always been known as the friend who you may want to hang out with, but avoid doing so because it probably wont happen anyway. 

I feel like I have been so obedient all my life that even the littlest things, such as coming home 15 minutes late, is beyond disrespectful and immature to my parents. I recently told my parents I want to be independent, and they ask me what that means. Well, I want to see friends at any hour that I want (literally just past 8pm, PLEASE). I want to make decisions on my own... and that is literally it. They let me pick my college and major and life goals, but I want to live. I didn’t get that fun high school experience filled with sleepovers, dates to dances (my fault I guess, I was never asked but went anyway), football games, and just sneaky things I guess that most teens go through. 

So, on to the main issue at hand. I am 19 dating a 24 year old (M). Please refrain from comments about “grooming” or that I am “immature” to see red flags. I get that. I know. I read up on this all the time just because people freak me out. My relationship is healthy. I need help with my PARENTS. Moving on. We have been dating for a year. About 5 months into the relationship, I, believing this was the responsible and mature approach, told my mom and step dad about him. (I waited this long just to know how serious the relationship was) Their first reaction was “Oh, so you want more of a mature guy.” Like yes, I guess. I didn’t think I would be dating a guy 5 years older than me, but it just happened. He is mature in our relationship, but is still mentally close that we can still bond and have young fun. I don’t know how to explain it, but I hope you get the point. 

A week later my mom says that he is a “pedophile” and that this is “disgusting.” I offer to introduce him, but it becomes a quite toxic situation. She says that she will never, ever, *ever* meet him. 
— side note/background info: my mom and dad are divorced. they met at 17 and 25 and were together for 10 years —
I at first believed that my mom was scared that I was going to grow up too quickly, as in move out at 17, her, marry at 18, her, and have a child at 19, her. I have told my parents for years that I dreamed to be an independent woman: to have my own car, house, job, and life! I have always been so excited for that. Yet, she doesn’t look at that. She praises me on facebook, but once its really about me, she sees me as a complete child. I don’t want to blame her for that, but I just wish she would listen.

Anyway, she tells me that she will tell my dad about him. My dad is a foreign, a Muslim, and well, a dad, so yeah, protective. I told her I wanted to tell him on my own. Again, I want to do things on my own, and I felt like this would be a good example of hey, I got this. She told him anyway. He becomes angry, expected. And they tell me to break up with them. I decided lying about the break up was the best idea because it seemed no way out of this. Since then (8 months later), my boyfriend has been brought up like 3 times. Now it is more serious than ever.

Long story short, my father gave me a long talk about how if I don’t break up with this guy, I will “regret it,” my dad may “go to jail,” and I will “hate him” for the rest of my life. Now, I have never seen my dad as violet or super angry, but the only time I ever see him real angry is after drinking A LOT. He gave me an ultimatum that if I don’t leave, he will talk to my boyfriend himself, and he doesn’t want me to live with him anymore. My mom and I had a fight about this recently as well, and she answered a tad bit differently. She said that if I am not going to “listen,” then I should move out. I told her I believed this isn’t something I should just stop because she told me to. I want them to work through this with me. 

I just don’t think it is fair for my relationship to end just because they said so, especially because they have not even met him. I don’t want to pick between my parents and my boyfriend. One friend of mine says that I shouldn’t risk losing my parents just for a guy I may not be with forever. I understand that, but my parents are kicking ME out. I don’t want to leave. I really want to work this out with my parents. Other friends are saying these are dry threats, possible, but I have never been in a bigger fight than what it is now. I have bad anxiety (I think? I had self diagnosing), so I am constantly overthinking. “If this goes this way, this may happen, so I must prepare for that, or this too so I need to do this. But wait... THIS could happen....”

This is how I see it: if they make us break up, I will have such strong tension for them and really be angry at them for a long time. But, if I stay with him, they will have strong tension to ME and be angry for a long time. I have seen miracle stories about parents ending up loving the boyfriend. But I feel like this will never happen with me. Everyones lives are so different from mine, I don’t know what to do.

I need advice for my parents. That is the main thing. It goes beyond this relationship with my boyfriend and more with how I just want a chance. I want to learn on my own, not through them. I have tried to go through this situation respectfully and work with them.

TL;DR! I need help with my parents. I just want some freedom in making my own decisions. I want to come out of this situation with my parents and my boyfriend. 

Thank you for taking the time to read and understand what I am going through.",05Jul2020,1
344,"My best friend, I’ve known him for 30 years, since we were children in grade school, has lost his goddamn mind.

348,"Me and her had “sexy time” maybe a week and a half ago? Her period is due in about 5 days. And ever since our sexy time I can’t help but be worried that I might’ve gotten her pregnant. I used a condom, but not by the book. So it should be at least 85% effective? Right?

Well what if that 15% prevails? What if she is pregnant? There’s no way that I could consider keeping it. Am I selfish for thinking that? I’m a 16 year old. We have so many aspirations (Working at the CDC, making a breakthrough in Virology. And she has a lot of potential to do something amazing) and if we have a kid, many of them, I imagine, would be impossible to accomplish.

Me and her have talked about it, and she might want to keep it but isn’t 100% sure. If her family finds out she would definitely have to keep it, they are extremely religious.

So what I’m asking is that if we decide to abort it, how could we do it without having to have to get a signature from both families?

Me and her have also talked about it and if we manage to get through this without a kid, we aren’t having sex until at least she’s on the pill and I have a condom with me.",05Jul2020,1
349,"So we had/are having a number of dramas with our wedding photographer. She's lovely to talk to but at the end of the day she did a bad job and has caused me a lot of stress and heart-ache. 

When we hired her she had fantastic reviews, a cool style, and international experience. I really thought I'd found a winner. But with all the of the drama finally coming to an end and us finally having all of our photos and videos in-hand I feel I need to address these things with her. 

I was going to write her a long email detailing my concerns and why I'm unhappy. I don't expect anything from her, even though a lot of people I've talked to think we should demand a refund. I just feel like she should know why she's the only thing I regret about my wedding day in the hopes that she addresses the issues and doesn't do these things to another bride. 

My partner feels strongly that I should give her a negative review on her social media/website. He thinks it's unfair for other couples not to know what we went through. But I don't know that negatively affecting her whole business is right? She's a self-made/run company and in the wedding industry I imagine a negative review can be really detrimental.

352,"A bit of background, I'm 23 (24 in a few months) and I've been in college pretty much since I graduated High School in 2014. I'll fully admit I'm not the greatest student, I barely skirted by graduation by rushing classes in an online thing they had, and I've been aimless in my college education for a while, only going part time and trying to just relax after a rather hellish k-12 experience. While I place part of the blame on my college for this, I accept the majority of responsibility in this. I made this bed, and I don't know where to go from here. Also my college fees have been very cheap thusfar, no extortionist loans I need to pay back.


I started going to college right out the gate at a community college in town. Unfortunately, the classes I needed were at another campus. Because our college uses a labyrinthian web app, web advisor, they thought I wanted a liberal arts degree, not a game design degree, so I wasn't alerted until after the degree was dropped, much to my frustration. This was last year that it was pulled. This pulled pretty much any remaining wind from my sails. I managed to work up a second wind but then COVID pushed classes online, and not all my classes were able to transfer cleanly, resulting in me failing 2 of them. I later found out I could have passed one if I actually did the final, but my math final was big and the numbers didn't line up in the gradebook, and I even asked the professor directly if I could pass if I did everything that was left (this was 3 weeks before finals), no response unfortunately. Needless to say, that sucked all the wind out of my sails. I took a summer history class, but I've never been good at textbook reading classes and I'm on course to fail horribly. I originally intended to transition into a computer science degree by transferring to a university but I just don't know anymore.


I wanted to get into game design, still do, and intended to use that computer science degree to get my foot in the door. I could follow through on this, but I just don't know if I could pull it off. Between moving away and living alone or with a stranger, and this utter burn out, it's hard. I've tried telling my grandma I want to take a break, but she always takes this tone like she's going to disown me, like I'm just going to quit on college outright or just never go back. I don't have a concrete plan on what I'll do if I take a break, ideally look for a job but I don't know who would be hiring at this moment in time due to COVID and us living in a small town, but still.


TL;DR: College burn out from being in community college for 6 years and had my major pulled out from under me, no major sunk cost aside from time, not even actually in uni, don't know what to do. I'm exhausted and terrified. Any advice is welcome.",05Jul2020,1

Because of my incredibly overbearing Christian parents and 12 years of oppression Christian private school, I have a fear of sex. It’s been ingrained in me to want something intimate or with sex is wrong and evil. I no longer believe in Christianity but I can’t change my thought patterns on sex. I’m very confident in other parts of life, but have no confidence in anything related to sex.

357,"I adopted a kitten but I am really anxious and stressed out about the responsibilities for it
I’ll be honest. I love cats and have always loved them. I had a stray for a while back when I was a little kid which was regimes because we had to move and I remember that I loved having it around so I’ve always wanted one. A few weeks ago, it was my birthday and I wanted to get a cat before I was too old and had more time commitments (before university). I have 3 other siblings all younger than me and we live with our parents. My youngest brother is 11 and he also loves cats so he was mostly the one who supported me. My parents didn’t really want the cat. My dad knew it would be too much responsibility for us and while my mom was scared of cats, she was still okay with them as long as they didn’t harm the furniture. My dad was really adamant about not getting the kitten but he never really explained why he didn’t want it. All the while I thought he just hated cats. So after days of crying and begging for a kitten, my passenger finally agreed and we were off to getting one. Now, I know I was really shallow because I always used to see Instagram posts about cute little kittens and I was envious of my friends getting their own kittens while I didn’t have one. All I really cared about was getting a young, cute kitten and I was very ignorant of the responsibilities that would come with it. The vet bills and the comment meant of 15+ years was all ignored in my stubbornness. I also didn’t care much about our financial situation though we just shifted homes and our pay check was much lower than before with increased expenses. I just used the argument that it couldn’t be that expensive with my parents when they talked about money and I told them that a kitten was the only thing I’ve ever wanted. I am really pathetic. I know. Once I got the kitten, I was initially very happy with it as it’s a very cute sweet thing and very energetic and affectionate. But soon I started getting worried about the expenses and especially the responsibility on my shoulders. I was full responsible for getting the food and cleaning the litter and making sure it slept and wasn’t out the doors and that it saw the vet. My parents also weren’t sure about the neutering surgery for it and I was worried about having to convince hem of that too. Now, I do love the kitten and the house likes it too and they are all okay with the kitten. My dad too tolerates it but once he mentioned that he only didn’t want it for the responsibility, I realized he was right all along and I really am not old enough or responsible enough to commit myself fully for a lengthy cat adoption. I am really stressed out about the kitten and what to do with it. It hasn’t gone to the vet yet and is only 8 weeks old so I know it would hopefully be able to go to a new home and forget about us. I am only starting to realize that my parents were right and I do now understand that the financial commitment is also a lengthy one. I don’t want to burden to my parents anymore and am just realizing that I was selfish before to not want to listen to their reasonings. I am thinking of re homing it while I still feel really guilty and so anxious that I have a hard time sleeping at night nowadays. I don’t know what to do.",05Jul2020,1

359,"When I (M) was 9 years old, I was hanging out with a few others boys my age in a room at a family friend’s house. Our families were at the house as well for this dinner party we had all been invited to (but not in the same room as us). 

One of the boys, a childhood ‘friend’ my age who was physically a little bigger than me, pinned me down on the couch and ‘dry humped’ me repeatedly. I felt uncomfortable and scared and didn’t know what he was doing and what his actions meant. Nonetheless, I felt humiliated and my face was burning in shame. I was struggling to breathe. I tried to escape from his grip but he kept pulling me back. The boy kept thrusting his body and genitals onto me (we were both fully clothed though) but I couldn’t free myself. The other boys kept watching and laughed at me as I struggled. This continued for 15-20 minutes before he finally stopped.

At the age of 22 now, this experience still haunts me but I’m not sure if it classifies as sexual assault. I know some people have experienced things way worse than me so I don’t want to trivialise anyone’s experience sharing this story.

Considering it happened only once, we were both the same age and we were both clothed, was I a victim of sexual assault that night?",05Jul2020,1
360,"Sorry - it’s a long one.

My bf (M27) and I (F25) have been dating for 3 yrs. We’re both only children with divorced parents and currently live in his home city. Things are fairly serious between us, we’re moving in together in the fall and have been living together since quarantine started, and are planning for a life together. Unfortunately, I do not get along with his parents. His mother has hated me since day one and from what I gather this is pretty typically behavior for her in regards to his girlfriends. She’ll say things such as that our children won’t be athletic because neither of us are very athletic, despite the fact that we were both college varsity athletes and I recently ran a marathon. This wouldn’t matter (and doesn’t to us) except that she then ties it back to how my bf was so much better looking when he was skinny (he’s currently 6’1” and 220 lb) and essentially makes it seem like he’s somehow worth less because he’s not as skinny as he was in high school and college. She then gets mad when he doesn’t want to spend time with her and blames it on me. Both her and his father have the expectation that because he’s their son he should be doing everything they ask - this has repeatedly led us to be hours late for time sensitive events, miss out on plans because they last minute throw something in he’s not comfortable saying no to, etc. I’ve talked to him about it but he’s told me that’s just the expectation in his family and that he isn’t comfortable saying no. His mom has also glazed over the fact we’re pretty serious and has yet to address the fact we’re moving in together. Whenever it’s come up she changes the subject or simply pretends we didn’t say anything. 

They’re also both convinced I have covid because I work for a hospital even though I’ve been working at home since mid-March, wearing a mask and social distancing, and have had a negative covid test in the last two weeks. Bfs mom told him she thinks it’s a false negative and they have repeatedly used it as a reason to cancel events such as golf with him (it’s open in our state, they take separate carts and cars, wear masks, and stand 6 feet apart). At this point I’m at a loss what I can do about it, and my boyfriend keeps telling me not to take it personally which is a little hard to do. Despite this, they’ve both stopped wearing masks or social distancing for the most part, but still believe we (who continue to do so) are the biggest threat because of my work ... that I haven’t been to in over 3 months. 

We went up to the dads cabin with the whole fam for 4th of July (camping, all meals outside, masks at all times, and only the four of us plus our puppy) and his dad has made repeated comments about how poorly trained our five month old puppy is because she’s still working on “come” and has taken to begging for food, his mother is constantly questioning everything I do with the dog and everything my boyfriend and I do together. Finally, tonight after dinner we were playing a board game and my boyfriend and I got really competitive. His dad yelled that I could either play nice or stop playing then glared at me until I said I would play nice. Honestly, it felt so rude and condescending to me and I don’t feel like I can keep doing this. I love my bf, want a life with him, and know his parents will be part of that life, but I could really use some advice on how to make this work.

I live in a house with my parents and older brother, he’s a piece of shit and he’s never home so my parents always expect so much from me because they want me to be better than my brother. My mum is really emotionally abusive and manipulative, she never ever lets me go out and she gets mad at me everytime I talk to my best friend or ask to see her. She’s never done anything wrong, my mum just doesn’t like me interacting with anyone outside of our family for no fucking reason.

All she ever cares about is she wants me to study and be successful and it’s like I’m living the life she want.

362,"Yes. This is entirely my fault. Studying is a student's responsibility, I know this. I'm not trying to say it isn't.

I'm not sure if it's because of my depression or just me being lazy but I can't think. In exams my brain is mush. It's like I'm almost at that point where it connects and the perfect answer comes to me, but it doesn't connect. It takes a lot of effort to keep track of my own logical sequence. Like there's a cloud up there.

I wasn't like this in middle school or my freshman year, I was that kid who didn't study and somehow passed everything. Now that's not working. Even if I hear something multiple times I forget it right away.

I know this means I have to study. I tried to, but I keep forgetting what I've just read, and I have to read through maybe three, four times to grasp anything that requires math/logical thinking. My finals are coming, I'll have my physics final tomorrow, and I'm really scared. I don't want to fail, but I'm afraid nothing on the paper will make sense to me. I'm really at a loss here.

363,"Im sorry this is a lot to read :(( anyway. 
I'm 18 and I've been thinking about moving out for quite a while. I'm torn and I honestly just need advice. 

I've lived in an apartment for a few years with my 2 siblings and my mother and now a little over a year ago due to some emergency situations we now have my moms boyfriend and his 3 young kids living with us too.

I always had problems with privacy and not having my own space when it was just my siblings and my mom. My younger sister would log into my personal accounts on social media or anything she could get into and screenshot all my messages and send them to my mother, with no reason. Everyone in my family listens to everything I say to my boyfriend when I'm on the phone with him and I can't even go outside or sit in my car without being questioned either. I fought with my mom constantly over these and I also fought with her on how my younger brother treats her as well. (Which is very shitty. Like saying she was the reason for my parents divorce, even though my father cheated and left his children. And saying she's possibly the worst parent ever, although he has his own xbox and phone which never get taken away no matter how horrible he is) 

Besides all that. I have no privacy and I felt like I could never leave the house and I feel trapped especially now that I have absolutely no area to have as a 'quiet space'. I always had a plan to move but I never was very serious about it until about a month ago where I started fighting with my siblings more and more and it got to the point of my sister smacked me on the back of my head because I stopped In the doorway to let the younger kid go by. She is 2 years younger than me and I was in wrestling for a while so I've never hurt her or my brother when they start throwing punches I just pin them to the ground so no one gets hurt especially with 3 little kids running around (all under the age of 5). 

I would be moving in with my boyfriend who lives across the country, he did live in the same area as me when we met and then just recently moved to see his family out there again. We both have around 6,000 saved each. My savings would go towards a car out there. We both have talked things over many times and this is what we both would be happy with so I'm not worried about that side of things. I would have a job going out there and it would take a bit of time but I would get a car as well. 

I'm torn on the fact I feel guilty for leaving my mom even though I really have no reason to be. But I know that I would be much happier out there and I feel like I wont resent my siblings when we are older. I just recently started college here in California and that's another thing that it's like do I stay through the 2 or 4 years and have my relationship with my siblings and hurt myself overall suffer for it so I don't upset my mother or do I leave and try to get college done out there where I would have a quiet and peaceful environment?? Even though I do fight with my mom about little things the one thing she asked me to do was to finish school before having kids and I feel like we are going to fight a lot because she doesnt want me to move in with my boyfriend even though we would be in a stable situation.  

I'm happy to an extent where I am but I know I can be happier. And I have no clue how to even start this kind of conversation with my mom without fighting or crying. And I would really love to have things sorted out before the next semester of college starts...

I honestly would appreciate any kind of advice.

368,"So I’ve been using Xanax recreationally for a few months now. Recently I’ve been doing a lot, about 4 bars a day give or take. They are from the dark net so i don’t think they’re actually 2 mg each. 

I’ve had this problem a couple times now during sex, it’s tough for me to get an erection. When I finally do and it’s time to go I pretty much instantly get soft over and over again. Only sometimes I can finish.

It’s very frustrating and kinda embarrassing, is this a problem for anyone else?

Also went without taking any xans today and instead did 75 mg of Adderall (spaced out a couple hours) and has a few shots and a beer. This was the night I had the toughest time during sex. I don’t do addys frequently at all.

I’m thinking it was because I still had a little bit of benzo in my system, took Adderall and drank a little bit that made it so bad.

369,"Hi everyone! This is going to be what I hope is a short post, but I have no where else to ask. 
I live in the UK, and I want to go to university in September. The standard fee is £9250 for university fees, and then £7200 for accomodation, plus what I assume would be anything else for food, printing, going out and any other extra stuff I need. 
I applied for my British nationality back in October, so I could qualify for the entirety of it (fees, plus ""maintenance"", which could help with accomodation and everything else). I received the answer and I was successful, but I need to attend a ceremony for it to be official, and for me to have proof of nationality and in turn get a passport. 
However, with Covid, this isn't happening, and probably won't happen for a number of months. So I'm stuck, and I'm not sure what to do. I can either keep waiting and hope this gets sorted by the 31st of August, or I can apply for EU funding. Under this, I'll get nothing but the fees, (9k) which will go directly to my university, so I will get nothing. I'm starting to panic (mildly) because I've already taken a year out to sort all of this out already. Should I wait, or risk going to university?

I've contacted my GP to see why I haven't received my results yet but apparently they don't get the results so they can't do anything about it.

378,"Hi all, this happened several years ago, but it's been on my mind lately. Everyone involved was in their early 20s at the time.

A close friend, who I grew up with, started dating a girl he met at college in Montreal. After graduation, the girlfriend moved to my city for work, and we spent time together because she didn't know many people here. To be honest, I really disliked like her - I found her pretentious, self-absorbed and frustrating - but I maintained a friendship to be kind and also as a favor to my childhood friend, who stayed in Montreal.

Eventually, the two of them broke up, but my friendship with the now-ex-girlfriend continued. I would've preferred to stop seeing her, but she made clear she valued our friendship and I felt too bad to end it.

About a year later, the ex-girlfriend texted me, unexpectedly, telling me that my friend had sexually assaulted her when they were dating, and asking if I would end all communication with him. I was caught off-guard by this. I told her I was sorry that happened, it was horrible, and that I needed some time to process my relationship with my friend. She said she was fine with that.

(I'll already know I should've handled this situation very differently - you don't have to tell me.)

I messaged my friend about the ex-girlfriend's accusations, which he denied. I didn't (and still don't) know any specifics about the alleged assault - when it happened, what occurred, how or whether they discussed it after. 

A couple days later, before I had a chance to follow up with her, the ex-girlfriend posted publicly on Facebook about the assault, naming my friend and also accusing him of being a ""white savior"" that ""belittled women of color."" The post was long, and at the end she said something to the effect of, ""I want to move on with my life, and not think about this constantly."" (I can't remember the exact line now, but it was something like that.)

I never followed up with her, partly because I assumed from her post that she didn't want to talk about it. But to be honest, I also let my dislike of her color my thinking. I know it's absolutely not my place to judge how a woman deals with sexual assault, and I know how crucial it is to listen to women and take accusations seriously. But something about the way the ex-girlfriend wrote the post felt strangely performative, using a ton of social justice language and almost presenting herself as a martyr so ""other women could keep themselves safe,"" brought to my mind the same qualities I had disliked about her. In any case; my friend still lived in Montreal, hours away, and I rarely saw him, though we were still in touch. So I didn't do anything.

A couple weeks later, I discovered the ex-girlfriend had blocked me on all social media. I sent her a text and got no response. Eventually, I heard from a mutual friend that she had decided to end our friendship because I wasn't supportive enough. She said she'd expected me to have ""a direct confrontation"" with my friend, that I was ""enabling sexual assault"" by remaining in touch with him, and that I'd let her down by failing to ""be there."" I sent a long apology message, telling her how sorry I was to have let her down. She never responded and I never saw her again.

I felt awful about this - sad and guilty for not supporting someone in a moment of need, but also frustrated that she seemed to have set a litmus test (which I failed, without even knowing) instead of communicating openly with me. I was upset with myself, with her (I know, she didn't deserve my anger), and with my friend, to whom I basically stopped talking (though we remain connected on social media, we never had a real conversation about this or anything else after that point).

The ex-girlfriend is long gone from my life and I have no means or desire to contact her. But I've been thinking about my former friend lately. He still lives in Montreal and has a new girlfriend; he was doing well professionally until Coronavirus left him unemployed. My mother liked him and his family, and felt it was wrong for me to have permanently cut him out. I've also since spoken to a few others (both men and women) who knew the ex-girlfriend and said they believed she exaggerated the accusations, that had frustrations about her similar to mine, and that remained friends with my friend.

I've been thinking lately about re-connecting with this friend, at least to check-in on how he's doing during this tough year. We had a very deep friendship for almost two decades and I've always felt weird and unsettled about how it ended, with no closure or clarity. I'm generally someone who lets bygones be bygones, but I'm not sure if that's appropriate here.

What would you do? Re-connect with the friend or stay away?",05Jul2020,1

Some questions I have are :

Do you look into the graduate course rank or do you look at the overall rank of the Institution?

381,"(TLDR at the bottom)


I’ve been having a lot of trouble making what I feel to be a life-changing decision. 
My decision is whether or not to go to a top college that I REALLY want to go to, or one of my state colleges that I feel “meh” about + the prospect of continuing to live in my homestate kills me. Because of my family’s financial situation, I don’t have as many prospects in life as some of the other academically successful teenagers I see on the internet who all seem to be going off to their dream colleges. Of course things are much less glamorous for us now because of COVID/online school/travel bans, but I’m trying to focus on my long-term future and think about what comes after the pandemic. Even though I know things may never be the same culturally, the only way I’ve been staying sane these past few months is focusing on positives like my successful graduation and college perspectives—but this is where the dilemma comes in. And I know my problems aren’t as big as other people’s, ESPECIALLY not at this time in the world. I don’t mean to come off as insensitive, I’m just looking for life advice from whoever cares to read this post. 

The pros and cons of my two choices:

If I choose to stay home for college I’ll almost surely be less successful in my field and might have to pick a new one, I’ll be miserable living here, I’ll feel disappointed with myself for wasting my college years, and I’ll probably spend the rest of my life wondering what life could have been if I went to my top choice school. The plus side to going to college in-state is that I will avoid debt entirely and save a bit of money by living at home, and I can work less if I want to as a result. Keep in mind that my home situation is not good and I probably won’t be motivated anyway. Another con is that I don’t like socializing with people in my hometown (which I’d have to do if I stayed here) whereas my top choice school is in an out-of-state city that I’ve been to twice and both times I really loved the people there and felt like it was where I was meant to be bc I blended right in if that makes sense. 

If I go to my top choice school, located in my favorite city in the world, then I have to take out ~$20k in loans. If I can’t be successful in my field then that means suffering in debt forever (although ~$20k in debt is below the national average for debt holders). Con #2 of going to my top choice school is that I’ll probably have to work more than I do now, but I still don’t plan on working more than ~35 hours a week. I know a lot of full-time college students work more than that, so that con might not count for much and might even make me into a better/more humble person if I look at it from a positive perspective. Con #3 is that I’ll probably be living in a small apartment with atleast one roommate to save money on living expenses and I’m kind of worried about living on my own (which I know is inevitable, but it’s like my subconcious wants me to postpone it for as long as possible, and I’ve heard some adults say they wish they had lived at home longer). The prospect of sharing a bathroom and living space with a stranger kind of annoys me. I’m also scared that a landlord might take financial advantage of me or that my roommates will be awful and try to poison me or just hate me for no reason. Or that I’ll be kicked out for no reason. My family is insufferable, but I’m pretty sure that they wouldn’t kick me out.

(End of detailed pros and cons section)

Overall, the biggest flaw with going to my top school is that I am TERRIFIED of loans and student debt in general. That partially reflects on my fear of independence/adulthood, even although everyone tells me I’m mature/responsible and I’ve always been good with finances. I’m frugal and already have ~$8k saved + I’m also receiving a SUBSTANTIAL student aid package, the full total of the pell grant, and atleast one scholarship.

I’m scared of failing in a big new city, of ruining my life with debt before it even starts, and of the possibility that I’m not strong enough to survive on my own. On the other hand, I’m scared of staying in my hometown forever, of becoming like my family, and of wasting any potential I might have had in life.



Soooo, should I stay or should I go?

TLDR: Choose between my soul-sucking local uni (no debt) or my fabulous top choice uni (debt).

384,"So back in Spring 2016, my father who had a 30+ year career in Electrical Engineering (EE) got laid off and struggled to find work. He found out he was qualified to take a licensing exam to earn the title of Professional Engineer (a very respected title/license). He studied, took the exam and failed. In Spring 2018 he passed away after suffering from a years-long illness and by this time I had just started my Computer Engineering (CMPE) degree in college, and right before he passed away I promised to take the licensing exam.

Fast forward to the present, 2020, I am less than a year from graduating. I am 22 years old, an Honors student, 3.56 GPA, involved in student orgs, got 4 scholarships and an internship under my belt. I inform my mom that as a matter of fact, companies in the Electrical-Computer Engineering field don't care about the Professional Engineer license when making hiring or promotion decisions. I also told her that I didn't want to double major in Electrical Engineering (VERY similar degree,) because I'd be in school one more semester (tbh I just want to graduate and find work).

She jumped to conclusions out of nowhere questioning why I didn't want to take the Professional Engineer exam (even though I never said I didn't) and that she wasn't paying for my tuition so I could be lazy to opt out of doing an additional degree. She then threatened me that she'd withdraw tuition funds if I did any of that. And she demanded me to move forward to complete the additional (unnecessary) EE degree. I defended myself that she has no control over what degree I am studying and that it's an individual decision based on my own interests. I also argued with her that a second undergrad engineering degree would benefit little to nothing to my future professional career and that only having a work experience or an advanced graduate degree would help me.

I found it very unusually why she was demanding me to do all these things when she doesn't even have degree in STEM.

385,"So my roommate told me on Thursday that his coworker tested positive. He said he had only been in the same room as him once, but there still could have been a potential for infection. He told me that he was getting a test on Sunday (basically today now). In an abundance of caution - I've been going into my office for half days so I don't want to risk giving it to coworkers, and I've been spending afternoons with my boyfriend, who I also don't want to risk giving it to - I scheduled my own test and told my roommate and by BF that I was going to be self-quarantining. Everyone seemed to agree that it was a good idea. I planned on speaking to my boss about it late Sunday morning, just because I didn't want to ruin her long weekend. 

Saturday around 12:30 though, my roommate left. I figured he had to go into work or maybe I had misheard him and his test was actually that day, but he never ended up coming back until around 1am. I had been up with his dog, who was scared of the fireworks, so I was just getting into bed when I realized that someone else was there with him. My first reaction is to feel incredibly angry and frustrated that I haven't seen my boyfriend (or anyone, really) in three days so far (and had been planning to not see anyone for 14) because HE had been exposed, and yet all the sudden he's bringing intimate company over? 

I don't know how to address this. My roommate and I are close, and even if we were it's not like I can or even want to keep tabs on him. But at the same time, for the health and safety of myself and others around me, I feel like I deserve to be kept in the loop if the situation has become 'all clear.' I'm only assuming it is because my roommate is a pretty smart and considerate person usually, so I can't imagine him intentionally exposing someone like that unless he knew that it was safe, but people surprise you sometimes I suppose. 

Should I bring it up with him tomorrow? And if so, how? If I were to have a conversation with him about it. Would definitely want to go into it with an open mind not assuming the worst of him.",05Jul2020,1

388,"So, a month from now I've (27f) been taking therapy since I had a small breakdown. I have anxiety in so many levels and depression. 

Since the moment I started with this psychiatrist, I've had strong feelings. For example, today I was excited, relaxed, happy. And now I'm broken to tears, writing for advice. 

My boyfriend's been a rock to me. So supportive, so caring. Recently, he's had his own issues and I can't do the same he's been doing for me. His worries involve his dad's health and his financial status (darn you, covid). 

Tonight we had a stupid argument over videogames. No big deal, but I've been sensitive and this triggered his problems. I didn't want to bother him with my thing since I feel it's been enough about me; I feel I've stolen the spotlight since therapy started.

393,"(Warning, I’m on mobile so pls excuse any spelling mistakes)

So I am almost 19 and have always had some sort of thing for writing. I’ve never had a serious writing project, other from the ones I do for my college courses, but I digress. I had this idea about a year ago where a group of men, specifically from the southern u.s, are all of the sudden drugged. They all wake up in Yellowstone national park. There are 30 in total and they all are roughly the same age, nobody knows each other and nobody is from the same area. After they all wake up, they realize that their clothing has been replaced with clothing are from animal pelts. There is a single not in the middle of all of them that simply says “you may survive for as long as you can”. However, this isn’t just some mysterious survival book. 

(This book is actually pretty gruesome and gory in my head.) 

After about a week and a half of being stuck in the unforgiving terrain, they begin to feel as if they are constantly being stalked. Their main camp is set up in a valley that is surrounded by mountains, but from the tree line, the only thing they can sense is pure dread a times. 

After about a month, roughly half die from natural (some unnatural) causes. But, one group member seems to just disappear. Days go by and without any sign of him, they hear his voice calling from the tree line of the valley in the middle of the night, accompanied with the voice was the unmissable feeling of dread.

I don’t wanna keep describing the plot. 

My question is...After reading, do you think that this would make a good book? And do you think I should make this my first REAL writing project.",05Jul2020,1

I knew most of them wouldn’t make it but I was sure of 2 of my friends coming. I had been seeing them almost every weekend leading up to my party and reminded them the week before and they said they would come. My last reminder was on a Thursday since the party was Saturday everything seemed ok. Then came party day my invite said 4 it was already 4:35 and I just thought they were late or going to carpool together. I was just about to text when I decided to look on their social media one was content at home laying in bed and the other no where to be seen. By that time I figured they weren’t going to come. I played off the party with my family as if everything was ok but it hurt every time someone asked where my friends were at. My parents went to the extra mile of ordering food and also getting pizza for my friends. Idk what to do I can’t seem to sleep having this bad feeling of not being good enough to even sent a text saying they won’t be able to make it. I’ve tried texting them but have stopped myself from sending it. I don’t want them to feel uncomfortable or that I’m making a big deal out of the situation but they really did hurt my feelings.

My parents haven’t brought this up with me but I feel that offering a small amount as a thank you is polite and what I would do if the roles were reversed.

396,"To start off with, I'm 18 M (and I have a sister whos 16 F, but I won't mention her much) and I live in Australia.

My mum has not slept for 3 days straight out of drunkenness (i guess), she has also literally not stopped playing music loudly for that entire time and it's been driving both me and my sister insane because we can't sleep and it's just VERY annoying. I have tried to reason with her but that only makes her act more like an asshole (death threats to us, the old person who lives next door who has submitted noise complaints months ago, and screaming about how she pays the rent so we don't have a say, and recently screaming that it was her 49th birthday a week ago so she can do whatever she wants, the normal stuff for her when shes drunk which is normally once or twice a fortnight).

Shes never done it for this long though, in getting genuinely very concerned for her. Shes used a lot of drugs in the past (ahe smokes a lot of weed, and as you can tell drinks a lot, she has also done ice in the past, i'm unsure if shes done anything else but I think she probably has). I'm honestly concerned with that she might be back on it considering that not sleeping for 3 days is not normal at all.

Time and time again I have considered calling DHHS (Department of Human Health Services) which normally is what deals with taking children from irresponsible parents, but I have lost the guts to do it everytime she sobbers up and is a fairly nice person. Going to my dads (who has had a very shit past, abusing my mum in particular, which my mum likes to bring up VERY often accusing us of not doing anything to help even though I was like 11 and my sister 9 when they separated. However I think my dad has massively improved as a person and is so much nicer now) is not an option considering he is currently homeless.

I have no idea what to do to bring my mum to her senses, I don't want to do anything that would massively affect her long term as shes honestly a nice person when sober. But she can be batshit crazy when shes drunk which is often.

I don't know what to do, do I call the police and end up her getting arrested (from the weed if nothing else, my sister also smokes which will likely get her into shit as well)? Do I call DHHS and get me and my sister taken (my sister has said not to do it in the past, I don't feel like thats a decision I should make for her), do I just ride it out until god knows when I can leave at some point? I really have tried asking and suggesting for her to fix her shit, but she does not want to in the slightest and that just further angers her even more even when not drunk saying I can't tell her what to do and that she pays for the rent. I'm really stuck here, no solution seems to be a good one for everybody.",05Jul2020,1
397,"Background: I’m 19 yrs old

All my life, I never had a girlfriend. I only had “friends” but was never close to them. The people that were really my best friends were either gone because my parents didn’t like the idea of me having a best friend or they were people that lived in other parts of my city and because of it, we never got to communicate often.

Growing up, I was ugly and never had girls like me romantically nor sexually. Once I got out of high school, I had a glow up and started gaining more female friends.

Especially with the quarantine, my anxiety with how my future will look and how lonely it will be keeps getting g higher and higher. Since I was young, I knew that I will always be single forever and as I got older, I hated the fact that I was cursed by God to be unlovable. No matter how great I think I look from the glow up, I always feel like I’m still ugly. 

Everyone else in my life is getting into relationships and I’m the only one that’s not. It’s unfair. I cry every night hating that no matter who I like, no one ever ships me with my crush and thinks that I’m unshippable. Maybe I was cursed to be the ugliest person in the world. 

My parents are fake. They always say that I was cute growing up when in reality, I was constantly called ugly growing up. Every time I see my pictures from baby to high school, I always want to burn it as a way to hide how ugly I looked in the past. 

What am I suppose to do with myself? Am I suppose to life an empty life where money is the only source of happiness? 

If you need pictures of me to give me an honest opinion about my looks and whether I really am the ugliest person in the world and that I am undatable, private message me",05Jul2020,1
398,"Hi. I have a 12 year old pomeranian that was diagnosed with a tumor in his liver 6 months ago. The tumor was fully removed and the prognosis was deemed to be very good given that it was a single tumor that was removed before it spread. He was not put on chemo after the surgery.

This type of cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, has a 5% reoccurence rate are full removal apparently. Unfortunately he is one of the 5% because a new mass has appeared.

 The oncologist and surgeon I spoke to are basically telling me I have 2 choices. One is to proceed with palliative chemo, which simply slows down the growth of the tumor, or attempt a second surgery to fully remove the mass as that gets him a better chance of fighting off new growths.

His cancer isnt very aggresive and hasnt spread anywhere else, so he has a chance. He did amazing with the first surgery and recovered like it was nothing.

Unfortunately, because it grew back the doctors are throwing up their hands and telling me to flip a coin, despite a large majority of dogs getting the same successful surgery never getting cancer again.

Im leaning towards the surgery despite there being no guarantee because the recovery is quite short and he's healthy otherwise. He has no clinical signs and does his usual thing, walking everyday, eating, no pain.

On chemo only, the expected survival rate is 6 months, possibly more because his cancer isnt aggressive. 

Im very frustrated because I'm being told to basically flip a coin. My dog is healthy and I want to give him a second chance to fight this, but I feel like the doctors are telling me to just figure it out and not giving me an answer. 

Chemo on its own is essentially a death sentence statistically, but there would be no side effects.

Im leaning towards surgery and I'm going to get a third opinion from another oncologist soon because I keep getting told fuck all. 

With surgery and chemo after, as well as a major diet change and supplements, I think he has a genuine chance. Chemo is accepting that he wont win in my opinion, but I'm trying to keep an open mind.

I appreciate any responses and opinions. Thank you",05Jul2020,1

403,"Hej to my fellow swedes. I’m in a tricky situation right now and honestly I have no idea what to do. Probably this is just to vent out because I can’t stop crying.

My mother married a Swede last year, they had been in a long distance relationship for a couple of years and as soon as I finished secondary school in Argentina (where my mother and I come from) they married so me and my mother could move into Sweden.
He’s a really jealous man, many times before their marriage they argued over the phone, also when he came to visit us in Argentina and even so I once had to talk him down because of the verbal abuse towards my mother. 
Despite everything (she has a record of not really noticing when people treat her badly, which was what produced her awful marriage with my father, which only ended when she found out he cheated on her and also hit her) last year they married and she’s learning svenska ever since, leaving her home, work and whole life behind for this man. When they married I’m almost certain that they didn’t signed a premarital contract so in theory everything is 50/50, and he is a well settled man, lets just say he doesn’t suffer from lack of pengar.
I moved here on March, a few days before Corona exploded worldwide, so really it was a good timing as I have spent all of my time here learning the language. 

This night he argued with her, as he often does every 2/3 weeks, most of the time is because something goes wrong for him or he fights with his sons and of course takes that anger to her. I know this as I hear them every time, suffering from my room as I’m scared for her, not because he might get physical but because he can literally destroy her life, my future. Thanks to Covid crisis and my mother not being young she hasn’t been able to find a job, her english isn’t the best and her university degree isn’t worth anything as she doesn’t know the language, so she’s busting her ass day and night to learn this language and find a job.

So this night he was arguing with her and just treating her without any respect, I assume this is what you call psychological abuse, just ranting about south americans and many prejudices and so much hate. I can’t hold it any longer and then I hear that he insults me and calls me dirty, so I confront him. Long story short he’s shouting and insulting both of us and just saying that we are shit and demanding my mother to throw her ring and to give it to him (which she doesn’t do as marriage is something valuable to her, something serious and a compromise, which she even didn’t break now and even when my father was cheating on her). So he takes his ring and just twists it and breaks it, so he says that as soon as our country opens it’s borders he will kick us out and that he can’t do this anymore (even though my mother literally saved his life during the days in which he had corona, taking care of him, when we took him to the hospital the doctors even said they thought he was dead).

Now I’m lost, of course she’s a victim as she has LITERALLY never done anything remotely close to this, he has abused her psychologically in the house in front of his children and treating her without respect. She always shuts her mouth. Today, after he went to his room (he claims he wasn’t drunk, as he is most of the times these situations happen, which I have seen by myself in Argentina when he always tried  to hide the bottles or destroy them) I talked to her and she doesn’t want to do anything, let the day pass and just live on. I can’t stand this, he’s crazy.

I don’t know what to do, we depend on him in every sense (we live in his house, his money, everything, his country). Our country is literally shit and my mother is unemployed, barely speaks english, has a degree that isn’t worth anything here and in her fifties. I was planning on building a life here, study in a university, learn a language, be an European citizen, having a new family, know a different culture, but most specially, seeing my mother happy. 

Now We are lost, if she divorces him (which won’t happen, he would do it but probably wants her to ask it as he is a manipulating and lying person) we wouldn’t have anything, not even a country to return to, I put all my life in this bet (even leaving my life and girlfriend, which isn’t easy for anyone, specially a teenager).

It was starting to look up for me, but suddenly when summer break started over a month ago, they just started pushing me away.

Over discord, people stopped playing games with me in favor of their 3 different ‘e-girlfriends’ and whenever I tried to talk to them they just told me to go away and all I said was a greeting (for context I would text them asking what I did and they would say I didn’t do anything or that they weren’t mad). I did theatre in school and suddenly all of my really good friends from that department just stopped talking to me except a couple, but they never seem very interested by me.

In real life and in the first few months of quarantine people really liked hanging out with me, but suddenly I feel really alone and confused. Is it my fault, or are they just being dicks to me?

Then he kept trying to trick me out of the apartment by pretending to leave and when I didn't he tried to aggresivly open the door. My neighbours didn't help me and the police never caught him.

416,"My dog was a 10 year old border collie, I've always been super close to him and loved him with all my heart yet yelled at him regularly as he often barked a lot during the day and I'm incredibly sensitive to loud noises and it just drove me crazy

For the last 3 days he wasn't eating, kept throwing up and just wanted to sleep a lot, he was trying to go to the bathroom but couldn't so we just assumed he was constipated, he couldn't even straighten his back

friday night around 11pm I was downstairs and he was in his bed and he got out of bed and attempted to walk but his back legs just kept giving out from under him so I sat with him while my cousin came to take him to the emergency vets, again expecting it was just bad constipation

I told my sister to stroke him while I took a break cos I just ordered food and leaning over was hurting my back so I started eating my food while he stumbled into the living room to get his leash put on, had the normal conversation with my mum like everything was fine, I watched him climb into the car and went upstairs to play some video games

an hour or so later I messaged my mum asking what they were doing with him and that's when she told me they found out he had a bad hernia which is why he couldn't straighten his back and all they could do was put him to sleep as surgery would be incredibly extensive and would most definitely kill him due to his age

My heart stopped, my entire body went numb, I couldn't feel, I couldn't breathe, my entire world just ended right then, I thought he was taking a routine trip to the vet to get some medication and instead I had to face the fact that that was the last time I was ever going to see my dog

My mum asked if I wanted to use facetime to see him 1 last time but I couldn't bring myself to do it as I was hysterical and didn't want to see him scared in a vets, all I could think was how terrified he must be being around all those strangers somewhere new when all he seemed to want to do was lay in his bed

Now all I think is maybe I made a mistake not calling 1 last time, about how instead of thinking about eating my food and taking a break I should have considered the possibility it was something serious and that this vet trip could end in the worst news, I can't stop thinking about it, how scared he must have been, all the times I yell at him, the house is too quiet, I miss hearing him bark

I haven't been downstairs since friday as I can't bring myself to go there, looking at the bed he was asleep in just a couple of days ago, the toy I only just gave back to him after it being missing for 3 years and seeing him  get so excited playing with it and that was only a few weeks ago, 4 days ago everything was fine he was barking and playing like normal, eating and everything was fine, now he's gone

All I think of is the last time I heard him bark not knowing it was the last time I'd hear it and I probably yelled at him for it, the last time I got to pat his head, or kiss him, or cuddle him, or give him a treat, all I fee is guilt, maybe I could have done something to help, what if the vets lied to just get us out of their hair and there was more they could do they just didn't want to, how if I didn't let him run around all day he wouldn't have gotten the hernia, I used to smack his rear when he'd massively misbehave (not hard or anything) and all I can think of is what if I caused it? what if he had it all this time and every time I did that I was making it worse

I can't even bring myself to go downstairs, I have food in the fridge but the last time I was eating that food was while he was by my feet and I tried giving him some but he wouldn't take it, now I can't bring myself to look at it

I'd give literally fucking anything to have him back, to have him barking all day again, to be able to lay down and cuddle him, kiss him and reassure him everything is going to be alright and how sorry I am and how much I love him",05Jul2020,1

So, I hate parties and I'm so introverted that after spending a few hours doing social interactions(like you'd do during a party) I'm totally pumped out of energy mentally, this is very tiring for me in a very unpleasant way. These two things are my reasoning for not attending to parties. Ever. 

I also don't do that at all bcs of the people that surround me, a few of them used to be my good friends but when they decides to start partying A LOT and drink A FUCK TON of alcohol our ways naturally parted, I thought being myself would pay off, that's what happens in movies, right?

So I don't like leaving home at all at this point, I love playing video games and I believe I'd have the time of my life watching some weird, twisted and funny videos on watch2gether if I had right people to do this with

Okay it came out long sorry I feel like without explaining what's on my mind I won't get my point across. I expect to get ""video game happenings are the place to go"" advice which isn't that helpful because of my social anxiety and not enjoying socially active places that much, going to some video game happenings just isn't that appealing as I'd end up being a ghost and then leaving defeated.

The longer I live the more I start to understand how many things have to go right in order for two people to get along ACTUALLY really well, I feel like I'm so specific in many ways that finding even one person who'd actually like me is an insane challenge(I'm 18 and so far I only achieved losing 2 good candidates when they chose to party a lot with ppl I don't like) therefore finding a whole (small)group of people who'd get along with me and each other well enough to create meaningful relations appears to be a borderline impossible goal for me




Tbh I don't even know what I'm writing this for.. I guess I just wanted to let these thoughts go, it's not like there's one magical advice that'll change everything

To be clear, I don't hate myself for what I am and what I like, I actually kind of like myself, my humor especially. I only hate the fact that I can't find right people to have around which makes everything I like/would possibly enjoy kind of suck. Like watching weird funny videos, not fun alone. Editing videos of me playing with someone just for me and this person/group of friends to laugh at later, not fun when done alone and actually impossible. I could probably list a few more things but you get what I mean, I realize that I have no idea how much fun I could get out of life

Thanks for reading through all of this if you did, probably some mistakes and unclear thoughts but hey, that's me!",05Jul2020,1
418,"I was 12 when I met a girl online and we became great friends, I think she was 13 in the USA and I am in New Zealand.. over the course of about 2 more years we got pretty close and texted a lot over Skype about everything, sensitive topics or not.                          


She was very troubled, and suicidal. Me being so young I did not know how serious it was and didn't know how to help. So we just chatted often as normal.  


I believe I have an anxiety disorder, where I irrationally over think things and the thought of things being permanent scared me to a deep level when I was younger.  


I started to think we shouldn't be texting a lot about such sensitive things, because the conversations were permanently there and they were getting pretty dark about her cutting herself, etc. I got scared that this is all affecting me badly.  


I talked to my mother about it and I decided I would just gradually talk to her less, and it worked. As time went on we just ended up stopping talking altogether for a long time and I didn't really miss it. But then I decided to message her one day to see how she was doing, but she never replied, and so I tried a year later and again got nothing.  


Now, 6 years later from the start of it, I am 18. As I've gotten older I now have accounts on social medias, etc. So I decided to look her up, and she was in a seriously bad state during that time, I knew she was bad at the time but I didn't know it was *that* bad. All her activity pretty much ends in early 2017. I think I feel guilty that I stopped talking to her as she seriously needed help, but I was too young to see it and know how to help.  


So now to the advice part of this post.. I badly want to know what happened to her, but on the other hand I don't know if I want to know. I feel like the only way to find out is to try get back in contact with her but I don't think I want to do that.  


I know which town &amp; state she lived in so I guess I'm asking you guys if there are any ways I can try find out if she is still alive out there, without getting back in contact. If there isn't any ways then I will just forget about it until I either see she is active again or I decide to try reconnect with her.  


Thank you all so much to those who took the time to read and possibly try help me out.",05Jul2020,1
419,before covid happened I experienced my teacher touching my thigh when I was trying to get my essay reviewed. it scared me quite a bit since he's a 56 year old man and I'm 15 and cause he was one of the only teachers I was able to trust due to my bad mental health and social anxiety. it seems really minor but the next day at school I had a panic attack when I saw him and lately I've been scared of every single white old man. I can't tell if I'm being dramatic or if it genuinely impacted me that much. I have a lot of intrusive thoughts regarding what he would've tried to do to me if school was never cancelled and I end up having a panic attack every time. i think the thing that scares me the most is that 1st semester he didn't know my name and 2nd semester he quickly was involved in my academics. he didn't touch any other girls that day from what I saw and asked around about and I personally think he targeted me cause of my mental health which makes me weak and a target for any gross man like him. I don't know if my mind is taking it too out of hand or if it's something worth being constantly scared of?,05Jul2020,1

422,"Long story short – I work for a big U.K. supermarket a couple days a week. I also work another job, so all in all, 7 days. All in all, my supermarket job said they would reduce my hours to minimum once I started my new job (I can’t afford not to have both) but recently, 6 months later… exhaustion has truly hit me hard. I had a weekend being sick (COVID) and then two weekends unpaid which I asked for ages back. I spoke to my doctor about feeling burnout, anxious and tired. I was given a sick note for four weeks.

Two weeks ago, we had a new store manager start. I e-mailed the sick note and he asked me to come in. As my brother overdosed the same day, I said I can come on the weekdays after 6 because I am busy. He questioned this (assuming he was trying to catch me out for my other job) and I said it’s personal but I will be taking care of my brother – he and my parents have no relationship.

So, he says to come in to give a physical copy of sick note, which I did and instead… he ambushed me. He had all this paperwork set out in front of him, and REALLY started to intimidate me and attack me. 

‘How is being at home going to help your tiredness?’ ‘There’s something you’re hiding from me’. ‘How are you still tired if you had the past three weekends off?’ ‘It’s lockdown… why are you going to see your brother?’ He showed NO sympathy and got to the point that I started crying. He was repeatedly asking me ‘well WHY are you anxious for?’ ‘I am not understanding any of this because I really advocate for mental health and you’re not telling me something’ etc. 

I genuinely thought I was dropping my sick note off and he was going to ask me how I was, and that’s that. He REALLY has made me feel more distressed than I was prior to going in. I am really upset and angry. 

Is there any leg to stand on here or is what he did right in legal terms? Keep in mind, he had the paperwork ready, did a return to work, lol what… there was no notetaker, there was asking if I wanted someone there with me, he just started really, REALLY interrogating me and trying to catch me out. I genuinely saw no point in that conversation. I actually don’t feel comfortable working there now. He also wants me to come in a fortnight for another hour long chat… no way am I going.",05Jul2020,1
423,"So this is a complicated situation and needs a bit of background: My mom and stepdad (my grandparents daughter) was horribly abusive to me and I was taken out by age 13 to live full time with my Dad. 

My mom had a lot of mental health issues that where never treated even to this day as far as I know. But she always had a rocky relationship with my grandparents and told me even as a kid how awful they treated her. Up till I was 8 and she wouldnt let me see them I have never had a issue with them and have only happy memories but havent ever wanted to discount some of the stuff she said. 

Then once I was with my dad he wouldnt let me around them for reasons such as how horrible they treated him and his recollections of the treatment of my mom. It was also a risk as being my moms parents when my mom couldn't be near me for safety just made them having contact with me a no go. 

Recently they have gotten in contact with me on facebook for my 23rd Birthday. I am hesitant to see them to be honest and nervous. I dont know how to go about this as my family on my Dads side who I really against me talking to them saying they are dangrous from what they saw in the past during my custody battle and childhood when my Dad was around.

What would be the best way to go about this?",05Jul2020,1
424,"So, I had to go to court when I was like 12 because of some stuff that went on with my mom and dad (who had been separated for about 9 years previous) and so my siblings and I had to testify. We were living with our mother, and both our mom and dad were kinda using us as witnesses so they could have custody. Now I’m 16 and a lot of things that went on I don’t know about, and I know 16 isn’t all that mature or old and stuff, but I really want to know about what happened because it affects me even now. The judge told my parents that they couldn’t talk about the case with us until we were 18 (even tho we were in it) or the ruling. I really want to know what happened in that court because it was about a name change and I can’t really get a drivers license or job until I can change my name to the one I’m using now, but my dad said that he wouldn’t let me change it and he couldn’t tell me why he didn’t want me to because of the ruling the judge made. Is there any way for him to tell me without getting into legal trouble? The whole thing was really complicated and I WAS IN IT and I still can’t see any of the documents or be told about any of it and i just really need to know. Thank for any advice!",05Jul2020,1
425,"Hi, so just a short background; my gf and I met 5 years ago and we have been best friends for a long time and later we started dating. We are both very active and smart students with a lot of interests - she organises some big events, works in marketing, volunteers in tutoring... you get it. And all of that while studying.

In the past year or so, she started to feel burnt-out due to her numerous activities and responsibilities. As a solution to that, she quited the leading position and only participated in the activities she enjoyed.

Few months later, she started feeling ""not good enough"", ""useless"", and ""desperate to feel happy again"". I was there for her and I tried to make her feel better, which was somewhat working in the long run.

Now to recent stuff; her father commited a well-planned suicide the day she graduated high school a few weeks ago. Of course, she feels lost and sad, which is absolutely ok in my opinion. What I am more worried of is that she'll get stuck in the self-pity phase again for a long time. We have been moving to a flat recently, so there wasn't a lot of space to talk this through.

As her boyfriend, I am here to give her the emotional support, but we always fought the self-pity with logical arguments and positive views, which I feel is not an option right now. So my question is; what role should I play in this situation? I feel like I can do so much more than just give her a shoulder to cry on.

427,"I (20F) have a difficult family from mom side, my grandpap run away from home when my mom was 16 and my uncle 18 leaving my grandmother alone with two kids to support.
He just left, no note, nothing. When my mom was 25 she found him with another woman and daughter. 
My grandad tried to fake that he didnt know her.  Years later my grandad make peace with grandmother and return home (because he was broken, he has gambling problems). My aunt (daughter of other wife) is part of the family, i love her and my mom and grandmother also.
So when he return I was already 9 and didnt know him. When time he hurt my grandmother by accident but like any other 9 year old girl run to defend my grandmother (She was the One to raise me, my mom and dad worked a lot ) he started to yell and hited me because i was derespecting him on his house and didnt talked to me anymore. (Yes he didnt talked to me since i was 9 until now) so basically he didnt meant anything to me, because he pretends i dont exist.
Today (after 11 years) he send my mom a text saying that I was derespecting him by not talking to him...  And i Said that I didnt care and not going to start talk with him because he remember 11 years later!  (My mom and grandmother are supporting me and said that I can do what i think is rigth)

428,"So I (17F) just came out to my dad a few days ago. He's super supportive (I was kinda nervous but naw he do be the best) but he told me first that he'd handle telling my mom and then later that it might not be a good idea to come out to her at all because she might turn it into a whole Facebook virtue signaling ""My kid is gay and I accept her look at me yay!"" thing, but I feel like I should bc she's, ya know, my mom? 

She's not homophobic, so that's not the reason (I hope--I know some people are the types to be okay with it as long as its not their kid), but it feels weird to know my dad wants me to just not come out to her and then suddenly come home with a girlfriend or something? He literally said I shouldn't because ""she has a tendency to make things about herself.""

I mean he ain't wrong...She does. A lot. (And btw they have some marital issues outside of this mostly due to communication smh but that's a whole can of worms we won't get into right now.) It just feels wrong to me that he'd say it like that, or that he'd go back on the original plans. I know he just doesn't want me to be treated differently because of my sexuality, and she would probably do that, but still. If the advice side of reddit's taught me anything, it's that kids shouldn't be involved in their parents' issues, but in this regard (and others...) I feel like I am. And I'm having to choose between being able to go to college 100% out of the closet or continually keeping it from almost all of my family.

PLUS, if she *does* end up blasting every corner of Facebook with rainbow flags, that means I don't have to come out to any of my extended family myself. Improvise, adapt, overcome?",05Jul2020,1
429,"I used to be a daily Discord user. For those of you who don't know, Discord is a Chatting and Community App for Gamers but it's also used for other Things. You can join Servers and Private Messsge People and it can be a pretty good App.

I used to take part in Discussions, talk to people across the Globe and talk in many different Servers every Day. I was talking to people, sharing experiences and opinions, sharing thoughts, feelings and emotions, etc. every day. 

I ended up seriously trusting some of people and over the span of 2 Years I talked with a lot of people and joined and keft many Comunities and Servers. It hit me a few days ago that some if these people, who I have shared Information with, might use the information against me later in life.

This would be information like the Country I'm from, My full Name, My Parents Names, Pictures of Myself, My Friends or my Parents in their younger Years (none of the Pictures were Nude), Pictures of Places in my City or other Cities that I've been to. Even my School wich is well known and popular in my City.

Some people might even have Screenshots and Pictures of My Friend's or even My own Phone Number, My Friend's Faces and even their Names (from Dumb Screenshots and Pictures that I shouldn't have sent). 

I even remember sending a Picture of my ID (with everything but my Picture drawn over) because I thought it was cool to share news and stuff. (""Oh my God Dude look at this I just got some new ID isn't that cool?"" And ""Oh my God look at this Dude I found a old Picture od Me/ My Parents from like 10 Years ago isn't that cool?"" Was my Mentality at the Time.)

I used to think it's cool to send people hentai and other nsfw (not safe for work) Pictures online and I realised that everything I did was Stupid.

Untill a few Weeks ago I never cared about this but, as I mentioned, it suddently hit me that some people might do Harm with this information. I've spent the last weeks manually deleting Messages, doing nothing but Deleting Messages and trying to dig for information.

Due to the Nature of the App I might not have a lot of power to delete some of this Information as deleting my Account does not Delete every single Message that I have sent, it just changes my Tag to ""Deleted User#0000"". I managed to delete some of the Information from some of the Chats that I still had open but I might never have access to some of the Chats and I might never know if annyone kept those Chats open. I'm thinking that over the Years people won't return to these Chats and won't care but I can't count on that, not everyone moves on, not everyone find something else to do.

The funniest part is that I'm not someone who usually posts a lot on Social Media and never liked having Pictures of Myself made to the public. But I did use Discord to send people Pictures. I was really stupid...

I'm pretty scared, what if these people find something about me or even worse, my Parents and Friends, what if some of these people are disguised Criminals waiting for the right Moment? It keeps me up at night and I have lost my Sleeping and Eating habits. I'm constantly feeling Weak, Stressed and my Heart is Beating like the Engine of a Motorcycle. I don't even drink Water...

I've managed to get my Mind off of these things by going outside, hanging out with people and listening to Music but every time I get back home I'm remembered of the Countless Days I spent on my Couch or at my Desk sending people Messages. I'm a pretty young guy, I probably have like 60 Years left to live, what if someone ruins my life?

One thing that I could do is request my Data Package from Discord, it contains every single Message that I have ever sent (this would be over the Span of 2 Years and 3 Months) aswell as User ID's. I could spend the following 30 Days of my Life waiting for my Data Package to arrive in my E-mail and then try to backtrack some of these people to see if they are still active/ have any of my Information. I feel like these would be the most stressful 30 Days of my Life, I have Work to do... I have to study... I have exams...

Has annyone gone through this? Are there people who have experienced similar things? Any people who did stupid things when they were young? Any Help...? I really just need some Wise Words right now...

P.S. On a final note, I decided to be more careful with my Information from now on, especially with people that I do not know in real Life.

430,"My girlfriend (19) and her brother (18) have a bit of a rocky relationship with their adoptive parents. Things were bad enough for my girlfriend to leave home for a few months in our senior year of high school. She freezes up and can hardly get a word out, or even manage a nod when she is being lectured by her parents. I think she has some legitimate ptsd because I have been with her when she has experienced panic attacks from being picked apart by her parents for her wrongdoings. She uncontrollably fidgets with her hands which leads to her dragging her nails down her skin, and escalates to her losing sensation in her limbs. I pushed her to rebuild the relationship with her parents over the last year, and though she experienced all kinds of discomfort, she’s reached a pretty solid place with them and im proud of her for that. Her brother has also frayed relations with the parents, and I don’t believe he has tried to mend it. Recently, their parents decided to take a road trip down the coast and were gone for an extended weekend. In the span of this weekend, he attempts to buy nicotine and his seller puts it inside my girlfriend’s car mistaking it for his, putting her in the uncomfortable position to hand the vape over because she is very non confrontational. Then she has her friend over to sleep over (19). Apparently she had a bottle of wine in her bag which was left out in the living area. In the morning, her friend finds the bottle missing and the brother is not home. Her brother sells shitty flavored vodka on his public snapchat for everyone to see. I assume he licks from the safeways as we live in an affluent area that does not employ security. My girlfriend doesn’t vape anymore, nor does she keep alcohol or any other substances. In the evening when parents returned from their trip, i was at the house with my girlfriend until 11 o’clock no issues. Around ten minutes after I leave, the parents confront the brother over not doing his chores cleaning the downstairs, and are upset with him for neglecting to have any kind of relationship with them. He insists he did his chores, and decides to involve my girlfriend by telling the parents she had 5 people over with drugs and alcohol over the weekend. The parents call her over to demand a response, and my girlfriend is unable to say anything in response. The house has about 8-10 security cameras recording the inside rooms of the house. Instead of simply verifying the brother’s claims, they focus their attention to her. Her brother throwing her under the bus is completely unwarranted too, she has never ratted on anything he does. She offers him food and has recently given him rides home from work when he got his car taken away for other behavior issues. It’s just a really toxic environment that has taken extreme tolls on her mental health. When she vents to me I can’t help but try and fix her problems when she just wants to be heard, and I end up upsetting her more. It’s difficult for me to detach myself from the issue at hand because I feel like things are best addressed sooner than later. Any feedback or resources that I can pass along to her is really appreciated.",05Jul2020,1
431,"Let me start off by saying my sister were raised by atheist. We went to a christian school all through elementary cus it the best school in the area. I would beg my parents to go to church on Sundays with me cus I loved Jesus. They said no.

By 6th grade (moved to a different country) I was no longer christian. Then in high school, my parents started going to church and forced us all to attend as well. All of a sudden they did bible studies and yada yada. I hated the community and one of the pastors was very against gay rights. My mom is a bit controlling especially towards my sister whom she forced to go to church despite her being bullied there. I started pretending I was Buddhist. My mom said I was full of bull so I argued that I would stream gay porn on speakers at church if she forced us to continue going. So my parents were the only ones going to church from then on. 

After my college freshman year I moved back to my parents house(covid) and I bought this pendant with the devils mark. Very pretty, very gothic. My mom saw it and got mad. I told her I was not worshipping the devil and it shouldnt offend ppl cus its a symbol of human sin, it represents all of us cus technically we are sin, and it did not represent a hate group(KK..Naz..) I was not mocking Christianity but rather Christians who would get super offended by devil horns and a picture of the devil while going out there being racist and/or refusing to wear masks cus of their god given rights. Yet my mother was adamant about how I was representing Ted Bundy and all the evil murderers out there. I told her that the devil shouldnt be what justifies their actions, most were not devil worshippers, and redirecting the blame on the devil instead of their human will was ridiculous. She got mad and slammed her bedroom door. I just don't believe that the devil actually has powers over ppl and influences them? To be fair I also have a silver mother mary necklace my parents gave me as a gift that I have been wearing for over two years now cus its pretty and I like her symbolizing maternity and the good in humanity.

434,"So I'm here in the US and tonight we were shooting off fireworks. We had a wagon filled with water, and a garden hose ""just in case"".

A buddy of mine and I were dinking around with the water hose for a while when this other kid (19) pipes up about how much water we were using (we were spraying embers, I know it doesn't make sense, but they were shooting off the fireworks and we were bored). I told him not to worry about it. He responded with ""fine, you can pay the water bill then"". (We dont have a water bill at this house). 

I pointed out to the kid that we used less water than he did by filling up the wagon. 

Really it just was us going back and forth over this stupid water situation.

But it got to the point I sprayed him with it. Twice. Yup, instigator here. I wasn't looking for a fight, was just trying to show him that its ""just water"". In my own opinion, ""fuck off dude, leave it be""

He snapped, and promised to hit me with a hammer. Nope, he upgraded to the axe. So there he goes, disappearing around the corner on his way to get this axe.

In my head I'm thinking, holy shit thats a bit much. This kid WILL use it, that I'm sure. And I have a million thoughts running through my mind. Thoughts like ""I was enjoying this arguement about water way too fucking much"" ""shit is he really getting an axe"" ""oh fuck, I dont care how tiny he is, thats a fucking axe"" ""is this really necessary"" ""why the fuck you mad bro"".

So all thoughts running, I head over to this kid who is now carrying an axe. Said ""dude, it's just water, I'm gonna take that axe from you"" 

He responded with basically ""try me"". So I grabbed the axe, he did some weird spin behind me shit, and I hooked his foot and body slammed him on the ground. Cut his back up pretty bad. I didn't strike him

What makes me mad about this whole situation (this happened as well, I just didn't add it above). Is right before he decided to get the axe, he was making comments about me not having a job (My company is furloughed due to covid) and being a ""guest"" at their house. He lives at home with his parents. But I live there too... actually, I've known this family since the day  I was born and watched this kid from a baby to where he is now (age gap is only 7 years). In response to his first comment I told him he could ""talk"" when he gets a real job. He works on weekENDS only, part time, entry level. I don't usually jab low like that, but this kid was saying some stupid shit. So it went a bit further than just water. But it started at the water 

But im running this scenario over and over in my head, and I have two main conflicting thoughts.

1. He came at me with an AXE over bantering over WATER, fuck him.

2. God damn Im a piece of shit for pushing him so far. 

TL:DR Arguement over water usage went too far, 19 yo kid got mad, he grabbed an axe threatening to use it on me, I body slammed him into the ground. Now I don't know how I should feel about it.",05Jul2020,1

It's time I make a decision here and quit the job.. this is how I can move on and become better. I want to so badly. 

Through this job, I have accumulated many new skills and did a few different roles, more than enough to update my resume with. I just have no idea what I'd do next. I have a bit of experience in IT, I'd enjoy an IT role. 

I'm just so terrified of quitting and not being able to find a new job. I know it's the right thing to do I just can't bring myself to do it.",05Jul2020,1
442,"Hey everyone, I’ve been really confused lately on which direction to take my life and I’m just looking for some wise words to maybe help me make the right choice here. 


So for some context, I’ve lived in my home town for my whole life and it’s been great, I’ve got loads of friends and have good nights out (when the clubs reopen anyway) and used to have quite a reliable job for money. Recently however, my manager has been really messing me around and it’s came to my attention that I need to either transfer stores or just find a whole new job in general. So I’ve been browsing job sites and not really finding much.

Also, I started talking to someone a few months ago, and we basically became official like 2 weeks ago. She lives an hour away in a separate town, and I’ve been going down to stay with her a lot because she’s got her own place (I still live with parents, I’m 20).

One day she randomly came out saying that if I wanted to crash there with her, she’d be happy to split rent and I can stay up there. And even though we’ve only been talking a few months and official for a couple of weeks, I’ve been really thinking about doing it. Which would mean looking for a job up there or transferring to a store there from my current work.

I’m so stuck on whether I should try and move up there, get a job and be with her, considering it’s only an hour bus journey from my actual home. But it’s a big thing and I wouldn’t be able to see my friends as often and I don’t wanna lose them. But then at the same time I’ll be basically paying the same amount of rent that I am now, except I’ll be living with my girlfriend instead of my annoying parents. It’s just annoying that it’s not in my home town.


What do you guys think? Look for a job near home and stay at home or look for a job up there and move in with her?

444,"I’m pretty new to weed, I(18M) don’t do it often, but I did it two days prior to yesterday as well. 

Yesterday while at a friends house I started to smoke some weed. We were all passing it around until I pulled out my phone and realized I couldn’t see the screen. I blinked for awhile and I couldn’t see it, then suddenly I could feel every slight movement I did, and I could feel every piece of fiber I touched. I didn’t want to freak of them out so I didn’t say anything, but I was feeling paranoid because I think they could notice all my movements and awkwardness and panic and because I could feel the silence in between sentences like I notice when responses take awhile.

I walked in my mom's room today and she was crying her eyes out, she's is an emotional person but I've never seen her this sad and broken before. I kept asking her what's going on and what happened, she kept saying there's nothing, I kept insisting, she said that I'll ridicule it and I will think it's silly, until she finally said what it is.


She told me (m19) that my sisters (24) (20) don't love her or respect her. I asked why would she say that, she said they're always rude to her in front of their other people and alone, they always shout at her, never help her with chores (we live in the same house), and treat her like a maid, that they never care about she has to say and always ridicule her ideas and feelings. And only come to her if they need something, and if she ever criticises anything or doesn't do what they want, they'll get angry at her and insult her. She said my father enables this behaviour by tolerating it and always standing with my sisters when they argue.


Yesterday was the breaking point she said, we made my (24)sister a small graduation party at our house with close relatives and friends, my mom was setting it up for 5 days cleaning, organizing, decorating the house. Me,my father, my younger sister helped her a bit, but she did most the work. My sister (24) was out with her friends most of these days, and whenever she was home she criticised my moms work, and ordered her to keep changing stuff about it, she treated her like shit at the party and shouted at her in front if the guests. 


I asked her if she felt the same about me, she said she doesn't know how'd I act if I stopped needing her( when I move out) we don't interact much because I'm rarely home and I keep it civil when I am, but I don't think she thinks I love her, but I do, and I'm sure my sisters do too, but I don't know what to do about it, I have a decent relationship with my sisters but I'm not sure what to tell them or if they'll listen to me. my mom told me not to tell them anything, because she wants them to treat her right because they love her not because they feel guilty and she wants it to be genuine.",05Jul2020,1

Scared that I've got this wonderful guy and im gonna fuck it up, or that he's gonna fall out of love with me. That im not good enough for him. That im never gonna be good enough for anything, that im never gonna open my own bakery, that its gonna fail just like i fail at every thing else. That i just can't be bothered living anymore because there's so much uncertainty and everyday is the same fucking shit. That there's this cycle, you go to work to earn to feed yourself and you need that job. Every day is the same.

456,"Hi, to put this in context, I'm a university student who's trying to get over a breakup.

I've worked hard to keep myself busy over the past eight months, just focusing on my part-time job, hobbies (gymming, painting), studying and catching up with friends online and in person. I've become more secure with myself and more confident, and definitely more appreciative of what I have. Nothing drastic has changed since breaking up with my ex, but while I used to think that I 'didn't have enough friends' or 'never had anything meaningful to do', those thoughts really don't surface in my mind anymore because I've strengthened my relationships with those friends and hobbies by changing my habits and making time to connect with them more deeply. The same goes for my environment - while I never liked the university major I'm studying or the part-time job that's connected to it, I'm appreciative of the fact that I have a job and something meaningful to do outside of my social life / hobbies.

However, I think that I still have issues with social media comparisons. I think that my way of coping with the breakup, besides keeping myself busy and taking responsibility for adjusting my daily routine, was to hold onto my ex's online presence on Instagram, Facebook and so on. While I don't see him irl anymore (and don't wish to see him again anytime soon), I still finding myself looking at his pages and checking the comments on his posts, looking at his stories etc. to see who he's spending time with and what he's doing. It obviously has nothing to do with me and I know that I need to stop this habit. While I think that I've made a lot of progress, I'm probably still not completely over our breakup and sometimes, thinking of him will bring back emotions that are just a waste of my energy at this point. I also have mutual friends with my ex that I'm close to, so I know that his presence won't completely fade away - I'll hear news about him here and there.

So the main issue is that : I know that I need to get to the point where I hear news about him and just don't care about it at all, and don't have underlying hopes (of reconciliation etc). But I'm not sure if seeing him at group events and following his social media pages will help me get to this point, or just make it worse for me to move on.

Friends have really helped because I have a great support network and they understand what I'm going through, but I know that they aren't people that I can rely on completely; I have to find ways to get over the breakup myself. I've been hooking up with other people to satisfy sexual urges, but it's been hard to find people who want to commit to a long term relationship so far. I deleted Tinder after a month in, because it was starting to make me feel more unhappy than excited. Most Tinder users I match with aren't down for long term relationships. The same thing goes for when I meet people on nights out. Because it's summer right now, I can't meet people through clubs at universities, and there aren't a lot of extracurricular events (eg. Meetup groups) where I live that are popular with people my age. Of course, this could change once university starts again, but I just want to find ways to help myself cope with the breakup, and not have my ex's presence lingering over my head all the time (and meeting others over the summer could help with this).

The breakup was initiated by my ex, but both of us remained friends afterwards and still spent time with each other a few months after the breakup. While I'm not clear about the reasons we broke up, I know that I had a lot of insecurities and bad habits that I needed to break (in order to be happy with myself, let alone with another person). Since the breakup, I've had a lot of time to reflect and work on myself and I do think that I'm a stronger person for it. I'm happy that I've worked on myself but I still need to let go of the hope that I will reconcile with my ex (and get into a new relationship with him again). He's currently seeing someone new / has a new girlfriend, they met a month ago and she's been introduced to most of his friends and has been to a lot of places with him. I definitely don't want to be thinking of him especially now that he's moved on, and I need to move on too.

Sometimes I get depressed at night - my daily routine definitely stabilises my emotions in the day as it keeps me busy, but thinking about my past relationship still gives me the feels and makes me sad. I want to find better coping mechanisms to deal with this, because I don't want to rant to my friends about this. I've called them occasionally in the beginning to try to get over my ex, but I understand that our conversations can get heavy and repetitive and I don't want to do that anymore. I have monthly therapy sessions with my psychiatrist, but I only see her once a month as the fees are expensive. I need to find ways to cope on my own, without others' help.

457,"He was abroad for a while, and after he came back he fell into a major depression. He wanted to see me but due to varied circumstances I was unable to see him. He tried to call me but I was unable to answer the phone so I told him I would call him in a few days. He saw me posting on facebook and accused me of lying to him.

He then asked me to hang out. I agreed but, cancelled due to a miscarriage. He believed me at first but then saw me posting on snapchat where I was at my familys campground. He again accused me of lying and lashed out at me. I told him I couldn't believe what he said and to leave me alone. He actually accepted it when I told him to leave me alone which was about 3 weeks ago. Yesterday he hung himself.

I feel so bad because we've known each other for a while and I knew he had issues but I cut him off. I didn't want to speak to him but I didn't wish for his death. He was suicidal and attempted before and I knew this and I feel so guilty. How can I stop feeling this way?",05Jul2020,1
458,"I honestly don’t know at this point. I’m 15 year old girl and might have a pill addiction. I know it’s stupid to say I can stop when I want but I believe I can. Then again if I try to go for a while without taking any I know I’m going to. 

Let’s start from the beginning. So about a year and a half ago I tried weed for the first time. It was just me and my friend. He had done weed before from some of his other friends. He then got weed and asked me if I wanted to try it. So I did and enjoyed it. I started to do it a little but I didn’t want to get any so I just did it when he invited me over. I’m pretty aware of the health risks with this all I do loads of research to make sure I won’t have any health risks. So due to you smoking weed I talked to him about edibles because I could keep those for myself and just play them off as gummy bears. So I got some edibles and would do those a bit. I started to try other things to when I would run out. For example cough syrup but it tastes like shit so I wasn’t in to it. 

Here’s how I started to take pills. It started with me just trying it out. Wasn’t sure if I wanted to go down the path of pills. But then I started to take them like once a week. Then like 2 times a week. And so on until now I’m taking them like 4-6 times a week. I haven’t told my friends. I know my friends does pills but he doesn’t take then that much because he feels like crap after wards. But I I’ve never told anyone I take pills so much. I’m not going to go into what I take because I don’t want other people going down this path. But honestly do I tell my friends and have them help me get off them. Most of them don’t due any drugs and most of them don’t know I’ve ever even done drugs. So what should I do.",05Jul2020,1

460,"In February of 2018, I met someone who works for the same company. I hesitate to call him a coworker as at the time we were in completely different groups (he in sales and I in a support role). Essentially, my group is like consultants for his customers, and I host training classes for customers. That, in fact, was how we met; I hosted a training class for a group of his customers that he attended. I want to add that my group is a small one in which I am the only one who travels in the US and Canada to provide these training classes. 

Two weeks later, we met again at our company’s national conference. One night, he sought me out, and we had great conversation all night. It ended with us having sex, which then sparked a three month (long distance for the most part) relationship.

In those three months, I began slowly realizing that he was a liar. Ultimately, I found out he was in a serious relationship with a woman, and I was the woman with which he was cheating on her. 

I ended our affair with the request that he not contact me ever again. 

A few months after I ended things, he was promoted. In his higher position, he is able to request my group’s services and is likely to get that request granted. Over the past two years, he has frequently requested our services, full well knowing that I am the one that would come to provide training. I’ve always managed to avoid him when coming down to do my training.

Because of the events of 2020, I am no longer traveling, but only host online training classes. For months he had been requesting the training for a large customer in his area, but as luck would have it, everything happened and online training classes it was. After the training, he emailed me privately. On the surface it seems like a strictly professional email, but he ended it with, “Hope you’re well.” Considering that I requested no contact ever again, this email felt like a huge violation. This was two weeks ago.

I should add that since things ended, he has done things like look at my friends’ LinkedIn profiles to the point that I asked them to block him. 

I have been nothing but professional ever since I ended things. I don’t reach out to him unnecessarily (and never privately), I’ve never given the impression that I’m open to talking again, and, most importantly, I never told a single person that I work with. 

This last email really shook me. I feel that he is purposefully pushing boundaries either to rekindle something or to make me feel powerless as he knows I’m scared of being fired over what happened between us. 

I finally told an aunt what was going on, and she encouraged me to tell my boss. I’m very worried about going to HR because I don’t know if I’ll be fired for not reporting the relationship. I think even more so, I’m scared that my reputation will be ruined (my industry is male-dominated) if my boss thinks she can’t trust me to behave professionally around my colleagues and customers. 

I know I should report this, but I don’t want to lose my job or have this huge mistake become gossip in my company. A big part of me wants to keep ignoring him, but another part of me feels angry that I’m letting him continue to violate my boundaries. 

Please don’t judge me too harshly. This is the worst thing I’ve ever done, and I regret it every day.",05Jul2020,1

465,"We want to emigrate with my husband in 3-5 years, because we don’t feel like we belong where we currently are - Portugal, my husband’s native country. My native country is Poland and we are unsure if we want to live there either because of too conservative ideologies. We don’t know which country or area would be the good match for our lifestyle. We keep on looking but end up coming across some sort of deal breaker (for example we like Sweden but it turns out homeschooling is illegal there).

**So, about us:**

My husband is an accountant and I’m an artist and homemaker. I plan to be a stay-at-home mother when we have children. We are frugal, minimalists, into tiny houses. We just want to live a simple life, we don’t expect much, we don’t expect to be rich, live in a mansion, own luxurious goods etc. Just a modest family life, multiple kids.

**We need the potential country to meet these requirements:**

* Homeschooling is legal (and it is not extremely difficult to get permission for it, “technically legal but practically impossible”)
* A modest family could live off a single salary of an accountant (if childcare will keep me away from art)
* Liberal society, we do not tolerate racism, homophobia, transphobia etc. and we would feel terrible surrounded by bigoted people (and scared for our future children, who’s gender, sexual orientation etc. we don’t know yet).
* Not extremely hot climate (medical reasons), we don’t mind if it’s cold and snows a lot, just no extreme heat please.

**Bonus points, that would make it even better, but are not deal breakers:**

* Their native language is not extremely difficult to learn (or it’s English)
* Easy to immigrate for an EU citizen
* Not expensive to have a diet composed of mostly vegetables - we barely eat any meat so I don’t care how much it costs, it would be nice, however, if vegetarian options didn’t cost fortune.
* Free or affordable healthcare and education is amazing
* It is socially acceptable to be quiet and introverted

466,"Hi, I'm female (21) and I've fallen in love with an incel. I don't know where else to post this because for some reason it got banned in other subreddits.  
I met him through mutual friends last year. We ended up playing games together and talked regularly. It was fun and one night I confided in him about my views on women and society, views that had me shunned by our shared friends. This led to a long in-depth conversation about our political standpoints and beliefs. He ended up telling me he was a self-proclaimed incel. This surprised me. I have always had a profound interest in the incel community as I find myself agreeing with or at least sympathizing with their belief system. However, this man didn't seem like your typical, stereotype incel. He told me he was a virgin, involuntarily celibate, and had never been in a romantic relationship with a woman. Something that again, surprised me. He blamed it on his appearance, height, and general social awkwardness. I'll admit he isn't overly attractive by societal standards. But I was attracted to this man the moment I met him. He's very slim and slightly smaller than me, but I'm tall for a woman so this wasn't unusual. He is a redhead with very fair skin. But according to my friends, my taste in men is very lackluster. So perhaps he really is unattractive and I just can't tell. I've been known to date ""under my league"". I never believed these statements made by my friends, interpreting them as shallow and pathetic. Since when is dating a competition all about finding the most attractive match anyway? Although I have only been in 3 short term relationships, all of which failed and left me feeling hopeless. My first boyfriend moved out of state, the second started doing hard drugs, and the third cheated on me. I had never wanted to ""date around"", but it just happened that way. I assume purely because it's what I've seen on incel communities that this would make me ""used goods"" and unwanted by many men. But I have been talking to this man for over a year now and have never once felt objectified by him or offended by his views. We get along well and share hobbies and interests. We have gone out together one on one together to conventions and movies. I find myself wishing these outings were dates. But am too afraid to initiate any sort of romantic conversation. He has called me pretty/good-looking on a few occasions, all of which I have thanked him for. I once told him I thought he was handsome and he told me to stop lying. I was too shy to tell him I genuinely meant it, but now I wish I had. I find myself debating on texting this ""incel"" and just asking him straight out if he has romantic feelings for me. But I'm too pussy to do it. Is it possible for me to have a relationship with this person? Should I go for it? How should I approach the situation?

so i cut it off with scissors. it kept coming back so i kept snipping it off. i dont really know why i did it. i just did. its still here now and i dont quite know what it is but this isnt about that.

last year. i somehow got a small cut on my leg. so i grabbed the chunk of skin and attempted to cut through it. i ended up cutting a huge chunk of my skin off. i picked at it. cut more off until it got so bad i think my body just did a big fuck you. it scared over night and i just left it. i had picked, sliced up and mutilated my leg for about a month. 

about two weeks ago. i poked one of my small cuts on my knee with a sewing needle on accident. it developed a scab over night. and i kept picking at it. then i got frustrated. got a pair of scissors and cut a giant chunk of flesh off. ever since then i have been picking at it. ripping the new scabs off and any part of the wound i can find. it hurts. but i cant stop. a week ago i cut another chunk of flesh off. on my arm. i just did it. i dont know why.

i will say one thing. i do have ocd and i think this could maybe be linked with this. but i dont know. theres no suicidal intent behind it but i know i need to stop before i end up doing something i’ll regret.

I’m 16 and i didn’t quite know how to put what i’m asking into a question but here it goes. Please excuse the stupidity if any ... 

I live in the UK and things might be different to America or anywhere in many ways. So i have my mum dad and brother here. and that’s my immediate family. Extended family as my moms and dad side lives elsewhere in a different continent. And they are utterly dependent on us for money etc. and I have no connection with them or feel one.

In social media there’s people that hang out with cousins go to weddings etc. but i don’t even have 1 cousin here and my parents don’t have many friends either that come to our house and whatever, I kinda blame my parents for my social life being bad too because guess what i don’t have freinds either. My parents slipped away from their friends because they were jealous that’s a whole other story.

But yeah i feel so annoyed and bugged when i see other people with family I’ve barely been to a wedding my whole life. and Im a christian and church dosent help either you’d think everyone is united together but no, they been social distancing way before this pandemic started. I lie to people saying i have cousins or i’m at my cousins house, i dont even have cousins or even worse i don’t have friends it makes me feel worthless. Like i could imagine my 3 family members at my wedding so my dream is to marry into huge family so i never feel alone, sounds stupid but yeah i’m embarrassed.

488,"I have a best friend and at the beginning of this year, a lot of life change was happening so we decided to call eachother every week to check in and make sure all was good. We live in different cities now, but we've been good friends *for over 15 years.* 

Every now and then we'd miss a meeting, but there would always be correspondence on that. But sometime during the Quarantine, this friend's sister in law started living with him, and she and I have some romantic history. He knew that, and we had talked about it. He really cared for her and so did I, but we both knew it just didn't work out for her and I and it was fine. It was years ago and since then, her and I have stayed friends kinda...


Well again, sometime around the time of Quarantine, I was dming her and made a joke that really upset her, and I just kinda left that as it was cause imo what I said really was *not* a big controversial thing at *all*, so I just kinda left things there and didn't continue chatting. Didn't think it necessary keep the conversation going, and plus, she did some stuff that was really fucked up around that time that really screwed me over but I kinda let it all go and just blew it off. 

Well, coincidentally, that friend of mine, John, has basically completely ghosted me since. The thing I said was so small, I know it and of itself he wouldn't given a care about at all. But I mean, he has completely ghosted me since then. 

I don't know if this is a coincidence, but it's been around 4 months and he isnt responding to text, IG comments/dms, or FB dms. He's also still talking to other people online, and even posted a screenshot of him talking to another friend on a video call all over his sm lol like wtf. To be clear, I've only sent a total of 4 messages, between those platforms over the course of 4 months because I don't like to be pushy with people, but I can't help but think this is really, REALLY weird, and it would be shocking to me if he stopped talking to me without any message at all to begin with, let alone because of me upsetting his sister in law. But even more so, it would be shocking to me to just ghost me for no reason at all and those are the only two scenarios I can think of...

So, idk what to do about this. Because he's very much an outta-sight outta-mind person, and if I don't hit him up, hell just kinda vanish out of my life I think, but I really love the dude and don't know what my actions should be moving forward about this. Maybe something else I did bothered him but I can't recall anything between us cause our calls were so positively oriented every week... Should I just let it be? Maybe write him and actually send a serious inquiry about it all?

489,"TW : Sexual Abuse

I'm sorry for the wall of text. I can't sleep and I need to get this out.

So as the title says I have a problem. Probably several. I know this isn't right place to seek this kind of help and I do have a psychiatrist, I think I'm more curious if anyone else experiences this need to have these traumatic moments essentially on loop in my head.These events happened years ago and yet I can't seem to rid my head of them. It's almost like I feel the need to do it or else I can't sleep.

Abuse started when I was young and I never told anyone about it, never really dealt with it and just pacified myself into believing I was fine. In my early to mid 20s I really started exploring; drugs, risky sexual encounters and the likes because it felt different. I found that I was very much into BDSM and explored that community quite a bit and figured that this was a byproduct of my past abuse and accepted it.

A friend I had had told me about a website where she met her sugar daddies and how it was an easy way to make a few hundred bucks quickly and I'd been low for rent that month and figured what the hell. The man I ended up agreeing to meet seemed pretty normal over text; he'd insisted we meet for a meal first to see how we got along and then see how it went from there which I'd thought was thoughtful and obviously made me trust his intentions. We had sushi and talked about history and travelling we'd done or hoped to do in the future and I felt pretty at ease, though still quite nervous and shy. He said he found my shyness endearing. We go to his place and he has me sit on his couch next to him saying he wants to ask a few personal questions and that I could then do the same. 

I sit down and he inches forward with his arm around me and asks about my childhood. I say it was fine and shrugged, thinking it an odd question for what we'd intended to meet for but ignored it. He then started asking about how I experimented sexually as a child, if I'd had any incestuous relations, had ever seen my parents having sex...all these questions kind of at once and I'm sitting there frozen and feel his hand kind of reach down to above my breast, right above my heart and his eyes just fucking changed into this look I could only describe as primal. I couldn't move. He told me how exciting it was for him to feel my heart rate rise, asking if I was scared of him to which I replied ""kind of"". 

The rest you can probably make up in your head because all I remember are flashes where he kept making me look at him, at one point even holding my eyelids open until I started to push him off. It wasn't rape. I didn't say no. I didn't say anything or even really feel anything but I can't get his look out of my mind. He knew I'd been abused somehow and I've tried my whole life to figure out how and I remember a conversation with a man who frequented a BDSM club I'd sometimes attend once told me that I had a face that when I was in pain it would drive men crazy.

Fast forward a couple years and I'm with a guy I thought was a good person, he'd been a friend before and was known by some of my friends as a good person as well. One night after a party where we'd had some cocaine he comes back to my room and we start to talk about our lives, he opens up about his issues and I guess I felt at ease and I opened up to him about mine, telling him about the trauma I'd endured when I was about 8-10 years old and I got emotional recounting some of it. I looked up because he'd been silent that whole time and he just watched me cry for a minute then he asked me to tell him every single detail of the first time I'd been raped. I don't think it registered in my head at the time that this was bad and I was obviously not sober so I started to until I realized he'd inched his way closer and was starting to feel me up. I pulled away and told him the fuck off which made him put all his weight on me (he was a big guy) and covered my mouth so my roommates wouldn't hear me. He told me it would turn him on ""so fucking much"" to have me recount these rapes, while crying, while he fucked me. He absolutely did rape me. He even choked me out a few times and repeated this cycle for 2 days until he was satisfied that I understood that he was not a rapist or a bad person, that he was helping me. I never reported him and I never spoke of it or mentioned it to anyone.


Those two incidents made such an impact and now I'm stuck in this cycle where I feel I'm a survivor, I'm strong, all that bullshit, when really I'm not. I'm damaged, likely beyond repair, and can't stop thinking that maybe the reason I can't stop thinking about it and the reason I enjoy pain so much is because deep down it's just who I was and that I'm living a lie pretending to be a normal person. I feel like I betray all victims simply by existing because in reality I crave that pain.",05Jul2020,1
490,"There’s definitely been a good bit of overthinking on my part, but with emotions and sensitivity involved, it is something I think takes a lot of consideration.

We’ve been best friends for nearly 3 years now. Since the start of the year she has been increasingly asocial, and explained this to me as a general feeling of purposelessness, which had been compounded by the pandemic. I can’t text her currently (another story), so we email. As a way of trying to cheer her up, I’ll send her lots of memes, which are either funny, deliberately cringe, relate to her or us in some way etc. She seems to like these, especially the ones that relate to her or us. Her mood seemed to really improve when we began discussing living together next year, which is now all set, and all our parents are on board with it too.

In the past month, the replies have become more protracted, usually 10 or so days apart, although she said this was mainly because she was redecorating her house with her parents. Obviously this did not bother me, but I did wonder if perhaps this is being used as a blanket excuse. She said in her last email (a week ago) that she had argued with her dad and become quite upset, and that she was generally feeling stressed and tired, and that she didn’t often have the time to type out a lot for an email (our emails have become progressively longer).

I’m not sure if I’m doing the right thing generally. I do wonder if I am overwhelming her with the amount of memes I send her (usually an email every couple of days). Or that I write too much, although it is usually only slightly more or the same as what she has written. If she’s stressed, surely seeing so much would put her off due the effort needed to respond? I want to do everything to help her, but I realise that perhaps she only needs so much. 

I am also thinking of putting a short line about how much I love her (platonically, she said it in one of her last emails) in my next reply. Nothing too heavy or excessive, just a sign-off. I think it would be a nice touch, but I’m not sure if it might all seem too much considering the volume of emails I send her. I am going to try and keep my next reply as concise as possible.

495,"So a little background I have two older brothers 28 and 26 then there’s me (f) 20 and my sister 17. 
My mum always wanted a daughter so was over the moon when she had me. We had an ok childhood, (the standard ups and downs) if anything we were really lucky and got a lot to say we weren’t really bringing in a lot of money. 

As I got older, I’d say 14+ my friends started going out more, staying out late etc all with the consent from their parents. My mum was always super strict about what I could do- at first I thought it was just because I’m a female and she’s just trying to protect me but then I started finding out what my brothers were allowed to do at that age and I won’t lie I got very jealous. 

It started to affect our relationship as my friends were out enjoying their life and I was being told I had to be home almost 3 hours before them. I moved out 4 months before my 18th birthday and into a place with my (still) boyfriend. Moving out actually healed our relationship and we became close again. 

However, I haven’t lived at home now for over two years and when I tell my mum about things me and my   partner are doing with our lives, what we spent our money on etc etc she gets super judgemental and disagrees with my views and thinks it should of been done her way. 
For example just today she came round and saw my partner had bought a laptop. She’s not very good at hiding her expressions on her face and I could tell she wasn’t impressed. Side note: I complain a lot that we never have any money when in reality we do I just like to complain about it as what adults don’t! 
Anyway she then text me when she got home saying I still owed her money from something she had bought with one of her credit cards for me (I pay her monthly for it as I needed this item at the time and actually didn’t have the money.) and that if this money isn’t given to her by next month then she’ll also charge me extra.

This type of event happens every time she hears about something new we have. I feel she is very disappointed and doesn’t agree to anything I do. I know I’m only 20 and still have a lot to learn but I had a lot of growing up to do when I was younger so I’m already (a bit too) mature for my age and I know what I’m doing! My brothers never get disappointed looks or comments made about them and I feel its completely unfair being treat this way. I just really need to know if it’s just my mum or if other parents treat others this way? And some advice on how to deal with it would be great- I’ve been thinking to kind of shut her out from my finances and what’s going on in my life a little so she can see I can cope without her although I feel like this should’ve already been proved in the 2 years I haven’t been at home.

Any who. My bestfriend is pissed at me. Here’s what happened: 

Her father got sick a few weeks ago, He was gravely ill, and I was the first person she called. I immediately hopped out of bed and  ran out the door to get her to her father about an hour 1/2 away. During this time he continued to get better, however she kept in contact with her other friends about the progress of her father, and not me. I looked over this however bc she just had a crazy traumatic experience and there is absolutely no need to question how she handles her pain....
Still during this time, I cooked for her, let her stay with me, visited her miles away, and was continuously there for her. Anything she needed I was right there. 


The problem: She wanted to go out of town for the holidays, however due the virus, my family wasn’t into going, which made me not want to go. I did not feel like driving hours away, plus I had tons of homework to do &amp; She lashed out on me for not going. I felt bad and sent her $100 to enjoy herself. Hours later, she needs me to do another task for her, which I agree and I meet her to drop off her items. My other friend is in the car, she sees her and immediately blocks me.

508,"My carrier is EE, I recently sold my Samsung S8 For £80, the person who purchased it didn't ask if it was unlocked, so I didn't tell him (at this point I didn't know about having it unlocked), last night he messaged me asking if it's unlocked.

I assumed he ment about the carrier (is it with EE)

I advised him it was with EE.

He replied by saying he can't get into it as he is with GiffGaff.

I called EE, obtained the IMTI serial code and got it unlocked, I then sent him the instructions. Seems reasonabl

He has now told me that he is unable to follow the instructions because qoute ""he is no good with phones""

He is saying he wants to come over and to exchange the money for the phone. But I've already spent the cash and I really don't want to break out the bank for something that itn't technically my fault. What should I do?",05Jul2020,1
509,"Firstly, thank you for taking the time to read this post. The only person I have to fully vent to and to get advice from is my partner and I don’t want to be a burden on him entirely.

I’ve always had a rocky relationship with my parents. I was an unplanned child, born with a lifelong physical disability which is unpredictable and requires a lot of medication. I’ve always felt like a burden due to this, especially with my mother who had to drive me to appointments for a lot of my life. This isn’t the issue at hand, although we have had MANY arguments regarding the drugs I take, as they are aggressive and I struggle to live a normal life on these drugs alone.

Recently, my grandfathers’ partner who’s been a part of my life for most of my existence, is battling a second case of cancer. It has spread to multiple areas and we don’t have much time left. It’s been a hard few weeks as she has deteriorated rapidly, and all my family members have been visiting more frequently- in particular, my mother.

I don’t currently live with my mother due to our rocky relationship, and I have been living with my grandparents for a few years. I’ve asked my mother multiple times that when she visits the person in question, to let me know and I’ll get ready straight away and visit with her (my mother lives very close and it isn’t out of the way to pick me up)

I found out this week after asking multiple times about visiting that my mother has gone 4 times without me, and hasn’t called me to keep me in the loop regarding the condition of the family member. This means I’ve found out a lot of awful stuff from casual conversation and it’s been hard to process as it feels like I’ve been left out of the loop.  The person in question has now been moved into a hospice, so I no longer have a chance to see her again or to have a proper goodbye. I’m absolutely devastated by this news and I’ve been struggling to cope, and I’ve broken down in tears multiple times where I’ve been told by other family members to ‘don’t let it bother me’. This comes across to me as insensitive, and the only emotional support I’ve had is from my partner who’s currently living with us during COVID. 

I’m tired of being treated this way with my family, especially since my mother has called me lots over the past week about unimportant stuff (4 times in a single day as she couldn’t log into my Amazon account and she wanted me to fix it). It hurts me that I only get contacted for things like this rather than upsetting news. I feel isolated from my entire family during an emotional time where I need support the most.

It’s my birthday this week; and my parents have made little to no effort for my birthday. My father called today and asked if I wanted to do anything, but I currently don’t want to celebrate something as trivial as a birthday during this time, especially with how they treat me. I’m at the end of trying to stay civil in my family after all the issues. I told my father on the call about how I’m feeling, and his response was that everyone dies and if I cared enough I would have bought a taxi to see her. Firstly, the comment about everyone dying is insensitive and to suggest I get public transport when she’s immuno-compressed and at such a fragile state is just stupid and wreckless. I’m devastated that my family would treat me this way a day before my birthday.

So onto the advice- I’m moving an hour away in a few months with my partner. I’ve been thinking about separating myself from my parents for a while as the negative comments and atmosphere makes me miserable. I’m wanting to use this move as a way of bettering myself, and as a fresh start and I’m struggling to think of how I can do this. My family are very dramatic and I’ve always felt out of place during conflict. Would I be unreasonable for trying to separate myself from the family after all this? I’m never going to have the opportunity to say goodbye to my ill family member, and I don’t know how I can forgive that?

I’m so lost and I really need some clarity. Thank you for reading this",05Jul2020,1
511,"What is a healthy adult response to ""I think I'm becoming an extremist""?

I can't seek therapy partly because of COVID, and partly because of the ridiculous expense (Thanks America). 
I DO NOT want to tell my family.
So, what do I do?

Let me stress by saying I'm not some racist or anything. I don't hate a race or nationality. 
I hate what we, collectively meaning humanity, have become. I hate how it feels like everyone has either given up or misses the point. My ideology is simple. Things must change, and if governing bodies wont accept that, then they should be changed by force because everyone has a right to a good life. I want to have children one day and I dont want them to grow up in a world that's so full of this injustice and lies. Where people are so afraid of change or inconvenience that they turn to slobbering screaming tantrums.

I know these thoughts and feelings are typical. A disgruntlement with the way things are, an upset towards the system at large. Does it justify such a response? I'm beginning to feel it does. I've written long rambling speeches about love and acceptance. To push out those who would seek to harm you. But frustration still grows. 
By myself, I know I'm harmless mostly. I don't want to hurt anyone. But I'm so sick of doing nothing when the world could be better, should be better. Sick of seeing friends and family hurting because of an uncaring world.",05Jul2020,1

514,"I don't know is this format fits. if no let me know about it and I'll delete this post. I wanna just reveal my thoughts, emotions. I would be glad to hear any advice how to deal with that.
So... My problem is that I lost any hope in stable relationships and feel loss of myself. My heart is full of loneliness and  pain.
I'm a 24M with homosexual orientation.
One of my dreams is to make just a normal family  with kids. Family that will be full of love. I have had a several tries (more than 5) to make a normal stable relationships. First time I just was betrayed after year and half of ""relationships"". The second time was about the same but period was smaller (he betrayed me twice). The third guy just tried to touch my genitals already on the first date. etc. when communicating, they didn’t look any sexual preoccupied or abnormal. what lies in their heads, who knows. For dating, I used a regular application designed more for heterosexuals. Unfortunately, in my country you can’t just chat on the street or make friends, and then confess sympathy for the guy.  although a couple of times I confessed my sympathy for classmates (unsuccessfully, of course, but I did not get a negative in the form of name-calling or a fight).
The last straw of patience was the acquaintance, as it seemed to me, with a good young man (30M homosexual). 
we met on a dating site and initially he just wanted to chat. I took it normal, cause the fact that in moments of communication he seemed to me an intelligent and purposeful guy. at that time I was thinking about friendship and nothing more.  Once I said that he is a nice guy and It's pleased to spend time with him after that I gave him a chocolate. he didn't say any word that day about my confession (I didn’t count on anything, because he wanted to communicate, and also was not very interested in me, my hobbies, inner world. it was just a sign of sympathy). At the next meeting we joined hands thanks to his initiative.
We had a good time together (As I think), talked, walked by the sea.  there was a case when we held hands.  after about three weeks we kissed.  I was so glad that everything turned out to be mutual, that I was beside myself with happiness. On the same day we again went to a walk near the sea at night after his work. it was romantic we kissed. I think we didn't know each other enough, it was superficial communication, but the signs that he gave me seemed to me a hint of mutual relations. After some time he began to tell what excites him in me. after that he tried to get into my pants, but I didn’t understand his hints, only when he started to unfasten my pants, I stopped him and said that I didn’t want to switch to intimate relationships so quickly, since it had literally been several weeks and I would like to  get to know him better because I don't want to have casual sex.  in the end, he told me that he was not looking for a relationship and just wanted sex.  then I fell into a stupor.  I didn’t understand how a person can hold the other person’s hands romantically, kiss and yet only want just sex without any romantic relationships and obligations?  It turns out he also ""chatting"" with other guys at this time. he asked if I would stop talking to him but I don’t know what to do ... when we drove home he hugged me, but I was not comfortable after what happened. I feel myself just a piece of fresh meat. guys only see in me only a sexual partner and no one wanna see a soul. I can notice that I don’t look ""defiant"", I am an ordinary guy of a standard male appearance with normal male qualities such as masculinity but have much  body hair.  Why homosexuals don't need a relationship....

Unfortunately a lot of homosexuals just seeking sex or constant relationship which is based only on sex. 
I'm not a dumb, not ugly, not bad guy what's wrong with my dreams.
I'm just sick of it all. I feel myself so mad. I'm not fits to this world. I'm tired of this promiscuous sex in community (I don't know why they think that is normal), tired of ""open relationships"", poliamory (we have such a good word for it whore), tired of feeling myself like a fresh meat after another dating. This happens very rarely when people try to get to know you better and get closer, more often they just look for a body that fits their sexual needs.
I started to hate almost all about LGBT community. I started to hate and despise their attitude towards life.

I don't know what to do with this guy. I'm falling in deep depression. I'm feeling anxiety and fatal loneliness. Sometimes I wanna die due to lack of close relationships which heterosexuals more common have. What should I do for my mental health and relationships with other people. I notice some social maladjustment due to my inner feelings. So much pain inside.

I would very much like to hear that there are happy homosexual families with two loving fathers and children, in whom there is no place for eternal betrayal and the search for a third, and only harmony reigns.  Do I ask too much my Lord ...",05Jul2020,1
515,"In highschool, I was somewhat a loner, but I had hobbies, and was focused on my own things, and then I had a friend who liked how focused on myself I was and all. I was a tech geek, loved gadgets, programming and had a website. He knew and became friends because of this. I entered Computer Science in uni because of this passion of mine, he entered the same field because of me. That I showed him how cool it was.

Well, I fucked my life up in college because I never had freedom or was ""cool"" I fell into drugs and lost focus on studies. 

He joined me in the drugs but moderated it. Would hear out my ideas on random things and implement them, while I kept on fucking up my life.

Now I managed to finish school 3 years after he did (when we started together) and I'm just trying to keep my distance from him, while trying to understand myself and what I want out of life. I have some goals, but it's just been 3 months sober, so I'm not really working on them. I'm just trying to live a day at a time. And gradually doing what I can productively do. 

But the problem is he keeps messaging me to know what I'm up to and to just flaunt that he's doing all I would be doing if I didn't fuck up my life. ( Maybe that isn't his goal, but that's how it feels to me). It pains me tbh. I'm happy for him and all. But I feel talking to him and knowing all that is just toxic for me. 

I don't know how to explain the feeling. 

He got a job with a programming language we both used to diss, then now he's getting certifications I talked about getting back in the day. I hate that he does things I suggested or planned. And I'm probably just hating, but I'd like to not feel this way.

I can't successfully cut him off without it being obvious I'm cutting him off, but I don't like being friends with him anymore. I just don't know what's wrong with the relationship. 

That's how I feel, and I'd like some advice, please.",05Jul2020,1
516,"My father works in a franchise restaurant where someone who he works closely with (In the kitchen. Fuck.) has tested positive for COVID-19. He is going to work in one and a half hours and refuses to call in because ""his job will fire him for calling in with such short notice"". He has no confirmation as he admits, no one has ever said that. I'm just fucking flabbergasted that all those memes about ""The Lost Generation"" are coming to fruition with my father. He is going to work, in a restaurant, with a cough and flu symptoms where his buddy just tested positive.

I'm fairly sure his (franchise) restaurant will not fire him for doing this. They are the ones who notified him that a kitchen worker has tested positive for COVID and ""not to worry too much, because he hasn't been in to work for the past week"". This is red flags galore for me, being that I believe there is a 2-week window here, and ""a kitchen worker"" who ""hasn't worked for the past week"" only fits one person, my dad's buddy. Still, he is adamant that he will be fired as he claims his job ""won't care"".

517,"Hi. I (M 18) think I actually may have a problem. I don’t know if this is the right subreddit for this or not but fuck it. I tend to masterbate about 1-3 times a day. There’s never a day where I don’t masterbate and I very often do 3 times a day. 

In almost every single social situation (when I’m with m or f) I heavily debate asking them if they’d like to hook up. It’s so difficult not to that I’ve now developed a system. If I want to ask my friend to do that, I need to go jack off. Then if I still want to, then I seriously consider it. I’ve lost handfuls of really good friends due to my inability to control myself (especially drunk). I basically think about sex 80% of the time and I always think about hooking up with people. However, I lose this feeling for an hour or two after I jack off. It then quickly returns until I jack off again, and the cycle continues. 

I don’t know what to do. Is this something I should see a therapist about? How abnormal is this? I’m having trouble drawing a line between possible hookup candidate, or friend/good acquaintance.

522,"I used MANUKA honey and safflower oil. I applied the oil first followed with the honey. I used this as a mask at night after I washed my face with my usual face wash, and exfoliated with a liquid exfoliator even though it burned like hell.. I had to because of the scales on my face  (it basically spread on my entire face) left mask on for about an hour washed off with water. Afterwards I applied safflower oil along with liah yoos great barrier relief which also has safflower oil. I applied the MANUKA honey lightly on the spots that were itchy and raw and left over night. I’m on day two of doing that and my face is almost better!! My scales literally came off the next day on my jaw line and my eyes are healing very fast! The skin care line I use is KraveBeauty by liah yoo. I use literally everything lol. What made me have this horrible reaction I do believe was “peeling solution” by the ordinary. I reacted both times I used it and every time got worse so I’m guessing that was the culprit. I only recommend using manuka honey.

524,"I (25M) have been friends with him (26M) for ages, we currently live together, although that is likely to change in a month or two as I’ll probably be moving for work. I’m in a relationship with a girl I was introduced to by him, who he had been friends with for a while previously. 

My GF told me that he admitted to her he currently has at least one if not a couple of girls on the side, whilst he has been dating his current GF for about 7 years. She’s asked me not to say anything to him, as he obviously asked her not to share the information. He’s also never mentioned or even hinted at the situation to me, his brother, or any of our mutual friends (likely because he knows the response he would receive). 

I’m completely opposed to this and think a lot less of him as a result, to the point that I’ve obviously lost a great deal of respect for him as a person and am reevaluating my friendship with him. I don’t want to broach the subject with him as my GF explicitly asked me not to, which I respect. Equally, I’m coming to the conclusion of somewhat distancing myself as I don’t feel that a friendship to this level with someone who’s actions I’m morally opposed to is feasible. However, to do so without any explanation would seem somewhat callous in itself.

I don't know what i should be looking for or where i should start. First off im 22 in australia and ive been lost since the first time i was asked by my grade 3 teacher "" what would you like to be when you grow up"" i couln't give an answer then but the question has changed now to 'what can i do?' Uh also my life, like most of yours. Fucking Sucks but hey im still out here vibing. 

Up untill grade 5 it turns out i was blind not completely though just found out in 2017 that im legaly bilnd and will not be able to drive a car in the near future it could get worse, which it is. Fuck. Something about scaring that grew with my eye from a young age causing it to stretch untill it would rip and tear, myopic macular degeneration too whatever that means prolly some other shit that i dont care to remember. Thats the first Big ""fuck you!"" from life. 

l've lived on farms all my life moving every 2 years. Been to 14 different schools and got not a single friend that lasted more than those 2 years. Am i lonley? shit yeah i am and sometimes it gets worse but im used to it, i vibe that way you you know. Im very anti social to the point that even i know not having a single friend through out my life upto 22 is lame. Don't deny it its lame. I am completely able to talk if i need to but for the life of me im still unable to talk to anyone over discord or in game chat or on the phone, if it means trying to make friends theres no difference in me, if its not absolutely nessessary then i wont even try to talk which is a bad mindset. Im hoppless but thats on me.

My family has a bad history that didn't help much. my mother was a nice women. An Abusive Alcoholic that hated kids and wouln't be afriad to punch you straght in the face even as a young kid if you fucked up or made a mistake as kids do but she was a single parent for 99% of the time i dont blame her as my farther was never really there, still isn't, 2 months on 5-9 days off work, rince and repeat i guess his a workaholic. Anyway after being married for 5 weeks she comitted suicide in 2014 after i told her that dad had some kind of poronographic app on his phone 2 days after he left for work. I was 15 at the time. My Mistake she was in a good mood and didn't let anything show, she must have mistook what i said as 'Farther is cheating again'. He had chilldren with one women and broke up before he met my mother then cheated on her and had another kid with an asian women, which happend prior to this event and ill preference the word asian as this left a bad taste in my siblings mouths which ill get back to later on. {But ill just put this here so i won't trigger anyone, i ain't racist}. Anyway thats where i learnt an important life lesson all on my own 'Sometimes its better to tell a lie' just sometimes though. Im sure thing would have turned out differently though.

She was dead for 4 days just sitting on the couch but the way my family is so dejected it was more like living in a sharehouse with people who all hate each other. So we'd never talk, never look at each other. Nothing. And because of that it was too late to notice. On the 4th day 'Its monday, time for school'. There a note in place of where my bag usally is, written in a drunkidly manner it stated ""Blank, if i dont wake up tomorrow Help me if you can't call your farther"". All i could think was 'ahhhh 3 days late'. That 4th day was the youngest sisters birthday. upon 15 year old me calling the ambulance as i couldn't reach my farther i scrambled to make a birthday card for the youngest to soften the blow as best as i could. While doing that i found other suicidal notes more deranged with drunkin handwritting barely ledgeable at this point 'I wish all your dreams come true'. so i scanned though her pc and hardrive to finding what i was looking for the will. It was titled An 'OPEN ENDED LETTER TO ALL IT MAY CONSERN' i was afriad my farther may go to prison for what was in it so i moved it to my computer and haven't spoken to any one about that or the fact that i told my motther about the poronographic app on my farthers phone even now. Though now i know better that theres nothing incrimanating in it. Thats the Second Big ""fuck you!"" i got from life.

I wasn't able to shed a single tear untill about almost a month later when the music played as a send off for her funneral and haven't been able to cry since maybe a phsycological problem not sure. Since then we haven't moved and the house has only proceeded to fall apart. The youngstest sister hasnt been to school since grade 7 and is now suicidal and has made several atempts, my brother dropped out of school at grade 10 and they both refuse to get their licence, get a job, or go back to school. They've quite literaly been playing games like Fornite, pubg and watnot for 5 years and still today. 

I finished highschool but was never planning on going to do any more schooling, i hated it, but it wasn't that easy. i dropped out at year 11 to find work, only to be told when i applied to a work group, that i needed to be with centerlink and have a QCE for them to actrully help. So back to school, QCE get! Now its been an uphill battle with centerlink and work groups having to travel 2:30hours in and out of town not to mention that once i get picked up at 6am there are no busses back untill 5pm, thats all day in town all just for a 10 minute meeting. I have been to 5 different work groups including one that specialises with disabilities who have told me that they can't help me because of my contion that being legally blind. WTF. To me legaly blind means 'what can i do?' cause anything with machinery is a no go anything to do with computers or digital screens is and should be a no go but hell my doctor and my spectialist has to know in this generation everyones a gamer right? I have never been able to get work experience letalone a job and ive fucking tried for 5 years of going in handing resumes, applying online. Fucking nothing not even big macs or hungry jacks. I live 30 mins by car from town 2:30h by bus now i cant drive so public transport is all i got. Shit unemployment sucks just as much as being blind.

But something went right or maybe wrong? When i applied for disability support pension and then proceeded to wait 6 months as to get the corect medical records i had to go to brisbane. 6-or more hours travel. but i made it happen then got paid a total of $8555. big bucks! of couse i know if i told anyone in my familiy it would be hell, so no. That was in feb, been savin up, not that i know what for.

Back to my siblings, i've basicaly been spoon feeding both my siblings as they do nothing, run away from home or try to do somthing stupid because they have no one else to look out for them and if you haven't guessed there fucking lazy. Say i dont wash their clothes or dishes or make them food, tell them to bath they would then let the dishes and clothes pile up and just wear the same clothes for untill theres clean ones they wont eat anything proper and they wontdn't bathe. Of couse that was at the start its still bad they will only do the dishes if there is not a single clean one left same with clothes but their that lazy they will just start wearing the same clothes for several days before deciding to wash them, they also bathe at least once a day but the other once every 3 days. so this started when they where around 14 and 9 so do the math right now thats 20 and 15 and im still lookin after them and to top it off they hate my guts as siblings do so uh yep. 

My sibings have every god damned oppertunity that i don't and they choose to do absolutly nothing with it which kills me bros. I don't know what to do, im pretty sure any idears of rekindling this family is void as getting back to the word i preference that left a bad taste in my siblings mouths, my farther brought home his New asian girlfriend and her 6 year old son out of nowhere this at the start of this year which very quickly caused problems. The youngest slit her wrists again no biggy delt with this before know what to do solved it. my brother after this event smashes everything that the girldfriend brought here tv, phone, tablet, switch, cooking utensils. some more shit happens while my farther rushes home from work to help her move somwhere else. My siblins have settled down after 5-7 week with the girlfriend gone. Of couse im dreading the idear of christmas. Its gonna be hell.

Thats not the Final Big ""fuck you!"" from life im going to get im sure.

So yeah im sure someone has the exact answers im looking for. Not. Just give me some idear i've been shooting in the dark too long and im afraid that im gonna go blind and continue shooting in the dark till the day my stupid ass kicks the bucket. Feel free to roast me or just make fun of me im sure i'll get a few laughs at it while im here. If theres something that dosen't make sense, tell me. This is my first post as well as my first time trying to interact with people in a long time so theres bound to be some mistakes and things people don't get. Peace out!

TLDR: My life is ass, Im disabled, Need job, What CAN i even do for work, Don't know what im doing wrong, Don't know what am i doing right, Don't know if i should continue to live with my Siblingor not, Don't know what to do with my siblings, need friends, fuck idk hows your day?",05Jul2020,1
526,"warning; mentions of rape, child porn, and sexual assault..

i met him a few years ago but we started dating august 2019. there were signs this would happen from the get go. he was attracted to animals, kept his exes nudes from when they were minors (without their consent), was a porn addict (which lead him to cheat on me from december to february, and most likely even after Dday), he had been accused of raping his sister before middle school, he always seemed off. he creeped or annoyed most people out. was shunned by almost everyone. not to mention that he got severely emotionally abusive after i caught him, and had raped me throughout the entire relationship. (coercion and forcing someone to say yes is not consent.) 

i found out yesterday afternoon from two friends that he was in major trouble with the state because he, and 18 year old, had raped a 12 year old child. this is not even a month after i left him. i can imagine everything that happened so vividly. him either going to the store with or without her to get condoms, asking for a ride into town so he can assault this child, convincing her this was a good idea and leading her down under the bridge. it makes me genuinely sick to my stomach. ive been asking everyone if they know anything about the case, if he was arrested, if theyre pressing charges, everything. i had just gotten over him compltely, i never even thought of him until yesterday, and now i cant get it out of my head. im so glad i had gotten out of there. if i had stayed for even one more day who knows what kind of danger id be put in. and whats sad... he got with me qhen i had just turned 14 and he was 17. so she isnt the first child... nor will she be the last.

other people have told me to personally file a police report, but as any sex assault victim knows the police is the last place you go to for help and justice. so that is off the table. i just dont know how to deal with this, the images in my head. i couldnt sleep last night and when i did i was having nightmares about him.",05Jul2020,1
527,So during the beginning of this coronavirus thing our school sent us an email with info on applying for money for any expenses coronavirus caused eg working from home. Before this my laptop fell and the screen shattered in a lot of parts but it stayed glued on the lid or whatever so you could still use the laptop just lots of broken glass in the way. So I applied and attached a picture of the cost of laptop without a date or anything as proof of cost or whatever. I didn’t say I needed a new laptop I just said what happened to my laptop. So meanwhile I was using this laptop although it was very annoying to use. A few months pass without anything. They ask for receipt with date etc and I ignored it as I bought this laptop nearly 2 years ago. However later they approve it and I got the money. This was however after the work from home period and now I graduated. So I have this money for the laptop however I finished... I want your guys opinion if you think I should return this money (it’s I think from the coronavirus government relief money). Or should I just buy a laptop with it now? Thank you.,05Jul2020,1
528,"This all started more than a month ago when I had asked my friend a question on whatsapp and more than a week went by and he had not answered. He had read it and he had sent messages on a group chat with all of our friends during this time. There is this game we both play where it tells you when a friend of yours is online and playing. Whenever I was playing like almost every day I would see that he was online playing the game during this time where he had not answered. So he wasn't busy or anything, he was just ignoring me. 

I confronted him in a text about it asking him why he was ignoring my messages. He said he was busy so he couldn't reply even though the evidence was to the contrary. But I just left it and said ok then reply now. 

He still didn't reply after like 13 days during which he was still playing on the game for like every day and he sent messages on the group so I confronted him again and asked why he was dodging my messages. He again said he was busy but then I asked him if he was so busy then how could he send messages on the group and play the game like every day. He then got defensive and instead of addressing what I had just said he resorted to attacking me by saying why am I being so desperate and stalking him. I had just noticed he was online whenever I was playing, that's not stalking him. I pointed this out to him and said that he was changing the subject and dodging explaining how he was too busy to reply to a message but not busy enough to play games like every day and message on the group. He said just because someone doesn't reply immediately doesn't mean they are ignoring, yet it had been almost 2 weeks and he hadn't replied. And coincidently he only started replying once I called him out about it. He still hadn't addressed the point about him being able to play like every day but not being able to reply to a message. I pointed out to him that it had been almost 2 weeks and he hadn't responded and that if something looks suspicious then I'm going to point it out like how he was playing when he was supposedly ""busy"". He then just left the chat without saying anything. I thought he might have left by mistake since he didn't say anything so I added him back and asked why he left but he just rudely left again without bothering to say anything. Seems like he had a tantrum or something and just left or he couldn't respond so he just took the easy way out and left. The fact that he hadn't explained how he could play games like every day while still being ""busy"" pretty much confirmed that he wasn't busy, he was just lying. So not only was he avoiding me and ignoring me but he also lied to me. 

I left it after that and after about a month I messaged him again but he's still being childish and immature and ignoring me. He's still been playing and messaging on the group. So now I don't know what to do. I could use some advice. What would you do in my situation? What do you advise me to do?",05Jul2020,1

532,"So I usually don't post much on here and I need some help.   
My dad was married to someone else before he met my mum. The woman he was married to have a child (NOT his child) and he also did not formally adopt her. He divorced his wife after a few years (now over 30 years ago).   
So this is where my problem comes in. I have never met the daughter(let's call her S). Heck, I only found out about her existence a few years back. S now has a child of her own and both of them have been contacting me. First it was just S and now her child is contacting me too.   
I told my dad about it, but he doesn't want to talk to her (they had a huge fight apparently and stopped talking to another). It's been over 20 years since the last time they spoke to another and my dad does not see S as his daughter.  
I don't know what to do, because both S and the child have been making me feel incredibly guilty. Going as far as to call me their sister/ aunt, and making it seem like I am responsible for what happened. I don't see them as family, they are strangers to me and I don't have the desire to have them be more than that. But they make it seem like I abandoned them, which (if they really were my family), I would have never done.   
My mum says to just ignore it, so to avoid a fight with my dad (which is what happened the last time I brought up the subject).

533,"So I've been talking to this guy for a while and he lives about a hour and a half away from me. A couple of weeks ago I told him that I had feelings for him and he said he felt the same about me. We didnt come more than that until yesterday when I asked him if he still liked me.

 He said that long distance relationships hardly work out, and said something about bad experiences in the past. I asked a couple of my friends what I should do and they all gave me mixed replies, some told me to basically manipulate him (which of course I won't do, I never even considered it) and some to forget him and one told me to talk to him.

 I'm not ready to give up on him yet since I really really like him. I want to talk to him, but I really don't know how. I'm good with words when it comes to giving advice and listening to other people's problems but I'm completely useless when it comes to initiating a serious conversation, I don't know what to say or how to bring it up, what to ask him or how to ask him. I don't want to loose him and I know that Im being naive but I frankly can't care about that right now. I'm not a 100% sure that he still likes me but he said he did yesterday and he refused to say he didn't , I think he's scared or insecure or something along those lines.

538,"My goal here is to try and get an outsider's opinion about my relationship with alcohol. 

I'll start off by saying that alcoholism runs in my family, stemming from my mom's dad. My mom doesn't have addiction problems but her two siblings do. 

I started getting in trouble with alcohol in my early teens. I had daddy issues and was extremely rebellious. I got caught with booze a few times and from the get-go, my parents chided me about the alcoholic gene.

I've binged a handful of times and gotten blackout drunk but it really doesn't take much for me to get there. Sometimes it's happened because I'm really small and when I'm around normal-sized people, I forget that I can't hold as much as them. Sometimes it happened because I was intentionally trying to get shit-faced. 

My tolerance has built up a little and I can hold my alcohol without getting violently sick as easily. But that's probably not a good thing. 

When I turned 21, I wasn't really drinking frequently but I was in a bad relationship with a guy who enabled my drinking and pushed me to do drugs so I'd be ""easier to sleep with.""

So, my current status is I'll have 3-4 glasses of wine or a 2-3 seltzers about every other night. But since I moved in with my parents after I ended that bad relationship, my parents find this very problematic and they are very worried. They say something to me almost every time I drink about the alcoholic gene to the point that I want to hide my drinking. I'll honestly say I've overdone it a few times around them but I'll make the excuse for myself that I'm young and everyone does it.

Just this week,, I went two days with no alcohol, and then I caved and downed an entire bottle of wine. I paced myself but still woke up with a nasty hangover migraine. I guess what bothers me the most about that is that I hid it from my parents because I didn't want them to see me drinking.

I'm not entirely closed off to the idea that I've become an alcoholic but the more I hear my parents bring up the alcoholic gene, I ask myself, ""What if I DO have that gene and I AM addicted? If I am an alcoholic, then I can't stop, right?"" 

I feel like if I convince myself that I'm an alcoholic, then I'm giving in to the idea that I can't stop and I feel like I'm tricking myself into myself into thinking I can't not have a beer.

I know I've had problematic behavior with alcohol but I don't think that necessarily means I'm an alcoholic, I've just been immature and inexperienced with it. 

TL;DR parents bring up the alcoholic gene every time I drink and it's making me convince myself that I can't quit.",05Jul2020,1
539,"During the last few months in lockdown, I’ve realised a lot of the issues I’m currently facing come down to low self esteem. I’ve moved up in a job role and I feel like I’m not doing as well as I expected at it. Feeling a lot of self doubt and imposter syndrome. 

Around friends i feel very self conscious, like I’m irritating, loud, not funny or too keen. I feel like my friends get on better with my partner than with me, because I don’t have the same interests they do. I try hard to like those interests but I don’t want to invest my time in things I don’t naturally enjoy. 

I’ve also gained weight during lockdown, I’ve gone up two sizes and this is the heaviest I’ve been. I’m on a diet now and it’s easier than I expected but it’s definitely impacted how I feel about myself. 

Usually I’m a pretty confident person and quite self assured but I can’t think of how to get back to that right now. Has anyone been through something similar? What steps did you take?

I like random facts about my subjects but I haven't gotten in-depth of any subject so I don't think I can put something together from it I would love to do/start things which I have in my mind it's not that I don't have any interest or things which I like or goal or ambitions I want to learn a new language, learn a musical instrument, some skills which will help me in my career etc.  I want to do those things but I procrastinate too much or will lose focus after doing it for like 10min.

544,"I'm considering buying a 2011 Chevrolet impala lt. I'm weary of buying it since, I know it is common for a lot of gm cars to have many problems.  I've heard of different issues that people experience with this car specifically such as the transmission going out, rotor issues, check engine light and a list of other problems. 

But I've also heard of more positive experiences where people drive them up to 300k miles and only had to change oil and battery. The only reason I'm considering buying it is because it is in good condition and the engine sounds good, everything works to my knowledge right now. It is a used car with 154k miles on it and I feel like at that level of mileage it would have gone through at least half of all of its issues already, which means it was either fixed or has not yet had those issues and may never experience those problems.

It is to the point that we cannot do any activity without smoking.

547,"So over the past couple of months, I have been on a rather world opening journey towards self-improvement in my ego and confidence. This includes reading a lot of self-help books, getting deep into Buddhist philosophy, and making an active effort to reach stated goals. I think it's also important to mention that this period was predated by a good six-month period of heavy drinking in which I had serious suicidal idealization and my movement towards bettering myself was initiated by submitting myself into a treatment program. Thus, this lands myself to where I am now. 

During these past couple of months, I have been learning to let go of external sources that give value to my self in order to replace them with internal sources (e.g. intellectual curiosity). Through this program of self-help books and group therapy, one major lesson is to not invest more into a relationship than what others are investing (let's call this the ""investment rule""). And this past weekend or so has hit the head of this dilemma for me. 

Essentially, I have about three separate individuals that I considered ""close friends"".  People that I could rely on for support and just general companionship. People that I have known for years and have been in their weddings. I have noticed, however, that ever since I became of aware of the ""investment rule"" and drastically reduced my alcohol in-take, (1) I have always initiated every interaction and (2) any plans created to hangout have either led to them 'forgetting' or just plain ghosting. 

I have come to the realization that I need to ""let go"" of these relationships and lie the responsibility of action onto them. And if they refuse to put their investment into keeping a friendship, than they aren't worth as much value I place in them. 

The problem is that I am scared of doing so because I will essentially be cutting out everyone who is not family or mental health providers from my support system. I am an omnivert and I gain enjoyment out of having close social relationships. I am fearful that if I cut these individuals out, than I will have no one to go to for support. But I know this needs to occur because the constant let down from these ""friends"" hurts more than gaining companionship with myself. 

I was wanting to inquire about advice on things that I could do to (1) distract myself from letting go of these relationships and (2) prevent myself from becoming weak and initiating contact that will eventually not be reciprocated?",05Jul2020,1
548,"

First off, sorry for my formatting and spelling, I’m on mobile 

This is a throw away for obvious reasons,and names and certain details have been changed to protect me and my families privacy 

When I was younger, I was raped at a party when I was 14, I was a freshman and he was a senior,i tried talking to people about it, i told them my story and he told them his version of it, needless to say no one believed me cause his family played a large role in the community

I later found out i was pregnant (i knew it was his because i was a virgin before it happened) in which my parents shipped my off to my grandparents out of anger and told me they never wanted to see me again, basically spewing things about how I was a whore and I would burn in hell (I came from a very religious family) 

My grandparents supported me, my grandfather chose not to speak to me because of my pregnancy, he pretty much thought the same thing my parents did, but my grandma supported/took care of me, she taught me how to change diapers and even helped me set up the baby room, she wasn’t happy about any of it either, but I’ll never forget her saying “not even religion can stop me from loving you” 

Because of everything that happened I became extremely depressed and anxious and I don’t know what I would’ve done without that wonderful woman, she’s my own personal superhero 

Now it’s been a long long time since all of this has happened, my son Henry is now 17, he’s never met his dad for obvious reasons, now Henry has asked about his father a couple times which I always either brush off or just say things along the lines of ‘i wanted kids,he didn’t’ he’s also asked about his fathers name in which I told him his father wanted to remain unknown, I will never tell my son what happened, if I ever told him the truth it would shatter him 

He stopped asking about his father and I thought that was it, well without my knowledge he purchased one of those ancestry DNA things and ended up finding his father through the website, I didn’t find out about this till Henry confronted me saying that his father never even knew he existed, saying he was mad was an understatement, my son went off about how I denied him having a father, asking me why I lied about everything, and why I didn’t let him know about his half siblings (which I didn’t know existed up until that point) and I just didn’t know how to respond 

Apparently, he wants to be apart of Henry’s life, I told Henry absolutely not and he told me I lost the right to decide that when I lied and then he stormed off, in the end I confiscated all electronics to stop any communication between them

I don’t know what to do, or what to even tell him, should I just push back my trauma and let my son know his dad? Even if I could bring myself to let something like that happen, I fear that he would corrupt Henry

I’ve never been an incredibly emotional person but I do drive a lot and tend to think about the rough stuff during my commute. I know it’s good to cry sometimes to get through the emotional turmoil, but anytime I do get to that point I’ll cry for like five seconds or less then it’s like someone shuts off the emotion valve. It feels unhealthy. I know I need to get this out. But I can’t.

552,"So SOMEONE -- not sure who because I don't know the timeline, in an attempt to get me fired, hacked my laptop and passed it around at my new place of work. 

My new place of work, not knowing how to handle this situation, opted to monitor the situation and do nothing -- though they did apparently bluebug my phone to keep tabs on me. 

So.. fast forward a year an a half.. and I realize people are monitoring every little thing I do on my laptop at work (because my coworkers talk too much) INCLUDING, looking through the camera and watching me sleep. I think FOR THEM.. it's almost ""funny"" because I don't do anything illegal and I never really put anything ""dangerous"" on my laptop like CC info or private info, but AS I started to realize I WAS hacked (again.. my coworkers talk too much), I signed up for a credit monitoring service.. and all hell broke loose at work. 

They are terrified of their culpability/liability in this. They KNOW I know.. because, of course, I wrote about it to someone on my laptop. 

No one within the last 3 years had access to my laptop to upload any kind software, as far as I know. But it has become EXTREMELY apparent to me in the last few days.. that ANY device with an open bluetooth connection is a potential risk now, and UNFORTUNATELY I can not rule out the very REAL possibility that someone came to my home and hacked my bluetooth devices that way -- which is terrifying. 

I very much want to find out WHEN the hack happened so I can take it to the cops and have them do SOME sort of investigation, because this has caused me to buy a new phone, and new laptop, and ... basically I'm constantly second guessing what is and is not hackable in my home. 

Whatever the program is... it withstands a factory reset of my laptop. So I've turned it off and shoved it in a box for now. 

Who do I even contact to have them find such a thing? There's clearly something on there.. but I mean.. I ran Windows Defender etc.. and of course it found nothing. Of course the antivirus was useless. 

Is there ANYTHING I can do? Cause I don't want to constantly find out I'm hacked at work until they decide to cut me loose due to someone else being a dick. (Believe me... they considered it... my coworkers talk too much.)",05Jul2020,1
553,"Hello, after some scheduling difficulties, I finally managed to slot in time to remove my wisdom teeth this week (1 side first). However, now I am apprehensive about it.

1) I don't really have pain. I had pain when it was growing and wish I got them out before they grew in, but obviously it's too late for that. The wisdom teeth are well above the gums, but are likely only partially out since they don't look as tall as my molars. 

2)  Xrays show a tiny bit of overlap with my molars, and the angle is slight, not a whole lot. However, the dentists (I've only seen 2 as an adult from the same office, so I don't know if they're of a biased opinion or if most dentists would agree) keep pestering me to get them removed, especially since I want invisalign. I know that wisdom teeth are supposedly more likely to get infected, are hard to clean, and can threaten other teeth, but at this point it just seems preventive, not entirely necessary. 

3) Older family all say don't get it removed since I have no symptoms now. I previously blamed my lack of extraction on them, but now that it's up to me, I'm getting cold feet. Haha... Younger family (but older than me) say that I should just get it removed as an in case.

4) Already filled my prescriptions for pain and antibiotics for pre and post op. I haven't taken them yet. I don't feel good about canceling also because of this. Not sure what I can do about the medications (give them back for a refund? I doubt it).

Thoughts on about if I should still go ahead with this? My schedule for the rest of the year is relatively tight, so this summer is the only time I could get it done for possibly the next year or two, even.",05Jul2020,1

557,"I’ve been in a relationship for about a year with my current partner. We’ve been living together for about a month now. 

Genuinely for the last year, I have been head over heels in love with him. I truly do love him as a person and accept him for who he is. 

We don’t fight often. In fact in a year, we’ve only had one ‘fight’ where we are both getting a little intense (no physical but just elevated voices, definitely an equal 50/50 of us being douches). 

But, the things that have happened that we’re not good in our relationship all centers around disrespect and lack of caring/effort from him.

I’m going to try and summarize this. It hasn’t happened 10 times or anything, but about 3-4 instances of this has happened in a year. 

1) He called me a whore after finding out my body count. He wasn’t yelling but genuinely told me I was one.

2) He called me a whore again, while drunk at a Super Bowl party. However I was also a little drunk so reactions could have been gauged better 

3) I had a very very bad mental health day where I essentially broke down (these happen about once a year for me) and he kept telling me to stop crying because I had nothing to cry about. I went home because he was having a boys night &amp; I continued to break down until I broke my phone out of frustration (not good on me and I do not blame him for that). Later that night after I calmed down I apologized for being unable to tell him what I needed from him, but regardless I thought he could have handled me better. He then said that it was ‘just so annoying that I was that upset over nothing’ and then when I got extremely upset at that comment he said ‘I’m not worried about you leaving me, you’d never leave me’. 

4) One of his friends who I don’t care for much accused me of cheating on a vacation &amp; my boyfriend never even said anything to defend me. Same guy ended up talking crap about me in their guy group chat for something as simple as me giving him a slight attitude over text one day. 

5) This is what happened this week while we are on family vacation. I asked him not to get drunk the second day (I was ok with him drinking but tbh I wanted him to be not drunk just so everyone could see him for him and not drunk him). He decided to get drunk and then when I reminded him of this during the day, he continued to drink (seemed like him saying ‘fuck you’ to me). And lied about how drunk he was (to be fair he was drunk whilst saying that). 

Now, when we have conversations about these things. This is how I notice they usually go:
I will clearly and calmly communicate how I feel, why I feel it. And if I can, I say what I need him to do to make me feel better. He usually will not act the way I want him to (kinda blow it off, have slight attitude, etc, not be empathetic enough). Then we will talk about it a second or even third time until he gets it.

He has came a long way emotionally while being with me, but his lack of ‘getting it’ is what kills it most of the time. Makes me feel like I’m crazy or dumb.

So for all that, I just feel like I’m fed up with this behavior. I’ve told him KINDA but not all of this as these emotions have been stirring in me during this vacation. 

How do I communicate this to him? Should I just leave? I don’t want to. I want to work on this but I do not know how much work he’s willing to put in. 

Any help is appreciated",05Jul2020,1

559,"i realized that i mainly lie about my personal activities and liking of things. I lie because it literally makes me a better person. Not because of the public perception of me (one of the least things i worry about) but it seems like my brain tricks myself to be a genuine, loving, and a free person. Plus, I enact that lie later on (ex. lying about liking doja cat even if i never heard her songs, then listening and actually liking it later)

I never lied to the extent that it harms others (mentally or physically) but there’s always the saying that lying is a snowball effect and then suddenly your exposed and people are hurt.

560,"Ok so i'm from the UK and i graduated Uni 5 years ago feeling disappointed and angry because the degree classification I was awarded  was a 2.2. 

To be honest in my last year of uni i was struggling as a family member was very ill and my mental health was not in a great place. In hindsight i should have deferred my graduation but i just tried to work through it. The reason why i ended up getting a 2.2 was because i was very sure that i had done really well in my dissertation and was confident it would get a good grade. However, i ended up getting a far worse mark than i was expecting and it therefore kept me below the 2.1 threshold. At the time i appealed the mark but the ill family member unfortunately passed away and i just couldn't go through with the process. 

Since then it has been something i've been a bit embarrassed about but i suppose life has gone on. However, recently i befriended someone who now lectures in the subject i studied and i showed him my dissertation. He was absolutely shocked i got such a low mark and said it should have got a FIRST!!! So now I actually think all this time I might have been given the wrong mark for my degree. Does anyone think there is anything i can do? Presumably the uni will refuse to do anything as it was such a long time ago but if they have made an error then surely it should be sorted out?! It's meant that i haven't been able to apply for certain jobs and in some ways i do feel it's held me back....",05Jul2020,1

We’ve been working on improving our relationship for the past month so I was hoping that we would talk when I saw him yesterday (he doesn’t live with us).

Currently in year 11 in Australia, and I plan on attending med school in Australia starting 2022.

PROS: Take a gap year in 2022
✅ Get to likely travel and make travel films which is a passion of mine.
✅ Probably able to save up a bit of money
✅ Will be the same age as the year level entering med 2023 (youngest in the year atm)
✅ Get to have a year of freedom pretty much to do whatever I want

CONS: Take a gap year in 2022
❌ Graduate at 23 rather than 22 (waste a prime year of youth)
❌ May cost more money for travel etc.
❌ Might lose motivation during gap year
❌ Main thing is I lose the headstart of being a year younger than my year level.",05Jul2020,1

I’m also not nervous about getting COVID at my job because sometime during the last three months I was exposed to it and had no symptoms or complications. I’m not scared of the virus, but I’m scared of how my workplace is going to be so different when we get back. 

I work at a daycare and my boss told me I’ll be one of the teachers in charge of one of the groups of kids (she said aged anywhere from toddler to school age children). I’m not sure if I will have a teacher’s assistant with me, and before COVID I was never in charge of a classroom at this center before, I was simply an assistant or a floater (meaning I was put in whatever room they needed the most help with). I’m working Mon-Fri, 8 hours a day and I’m so nervous cause I’ve been so used to not having any responsibilities the last three months that I’m gonna get overwhelmed easily and panic. 

The rules are crazy and extensive rightfully so cause we have to avoid a pandemic while being in a closed environment with 50+ other adults and children. I’m worried I’m gonna mess up or do something “unsanitary” and put everyone at “jeopardy”. I’m worried I won’t be capable to lead a classroom on my own cause I never have before and my first shift is tomorrow morning and I don’t even know what age group I have, what the schedule looks like for the day, if I should have activities planned, if I will have another teacher or an assistant with me, etc. My boss reassured me and thinks I am highly capable of leading a classroom and assertive, but I just have no idea what to expect and wish she would at least tell me which age group I will have just so I’m somewhat prepared.",05Jul2020,1

578,"My old partner fell in love with someone over the internet and left me, we’re still pretty good friends and all but it feels weird. 

I don’t mind not being a couple but I’m really unused to change and this is affecting me in every way badly. A few years ago I had some pretty bad friends that gave me some trust issues and they’ve just come back full force, I’m so paranoid about everything and I am constantly miserable. I don’t know what to do about it anymore Ive tried for a month but it’s only gotten worse 

&amp;#x200B;

I know it isn’t how it is but I feel betrayed in an odd way, they were kind of the only person I trusted for years and we‘d almost been dating 3 years. Part of me feels like it is for nothing, that it has lead to nothing and I am convinced they are going to drift and drift until we aren’t friends anymore. Almost every friend I’ve made has ended up drifting or straight up leaving, it probably sounds dumb but this felt like the one time something would go ok, and it really hurts to know that opening up even when I was terrified of being hurt again just leads to it again and again 

They keep assuring me they won’t but I just can’t believe them. I used to able to kind of count on them but now I just feel like I have nobody, I have very few friends and I’m so anxious around people I find it hard to make and keep new friendships.   


I have had numerous issues with my body and the way I look in the past and it’s all just feeding into it, I don’t eat so I don’t have the energy to feel truly miserable, so I can sleep longer.   
This happening has just amplified every insecurity about myself and every negative feeling ten fold, I‘m desperate for it to be something I can change and fix so I can stop feeling awful but I don’t think it is, I’m worried there is nothing I can do and I just have to accept it.

&amp;#x200B;

I keep trying to open up but I feel like I’m being shut down or sidelined, they prefer to distract them-self instead of deal with things but I don’t think I can do that anymore, it’s just wearing me down having to internalise everything. It makes me so paranoid I cant even message without worrying that I’m knowingly being ignored or being annoying.

I’ve self harmed for a good 4 years now on and off but I think this is some of the worst thoughts I’ve ever had, I constantly have the urge to seriously physically injure myself and I follow through on the less extreme ones. I cut, bite, punch and sew my skin but it just doesn’t feel enough anymore and I don’t know what to do about it, it doesn’t make me calm like it used to it only lasts for a couple minutes. About two years ago I OD’d twice as an attempt, and I really think I don’t have long left, I constantly have this heavy pain in my chest that constricts my lungs, nothing I do helps it for longer than a few minutes- it always comes back and I just don’t know what to do about it anymore. I constantly fantasise about killing or seriously injuring myself, I began planning stuff and I just don’t care anymore. It feels like nobody else does and I just don’t have a reason to hold on anymore 

&amp;#x200B;

Most days I wake up in a bad mood and I just wait for myself to go to slep again, I started considering just knocking myself out so I don’t have to be conscious during the day because it’s so slow. Everyday blends together and my memory is getting worse and worse, I’m forgetting w lot of the last couple years and I can’t differentiate each day of the week from the other because I feel the same every day. No matter what I do I cannot make myself happy, on a good day I feel mediocre and it’s so boring, waking up and feeling like shit just makes me want to go to sleep again. A lot of the time my emotions do a complete 180 in a very short amount of time and I hate it, I can go from being hysterical to being fine in a minute with no inbetween, it’s an uncomfortably emotionless calm and it’s either that or a constant state of sadness or panic. When I do this I have very little memory of the events that led to it, what happened during and how it felt- I don’t know why this happens but I really don’t like chunks of my memory just disappearing like they do, I don’t know how to stop it either, is there even a way to stop it? It happens so abruptly I don’t even notice

Part of me wishes I could hate both of them but I just hate myself for not being good enough, it just makes me feel like shit and like I’ll never be good enough for anyone. I keep telling myself I’m going to be alone for the rest of my life, that I had the best thing I was ever going to get and I fucked it up.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m paranoid about everything I do and say to them, I constantly worry I’m being annoying or they’d rather be talking to someone else. Whenever they leave abruptly I get awful about it for a good few hours, I constantly worry about how I look and act, what I say or do or react, I’m so worried that if I do one thing wrong that’s it. They’re one of, if not my best friend, I‘m just so disappointed this happened and it’s turned out like this.

I also feel weirdly disconnected from reality, I often wake up from dreams and have to physically hurt myself to make sure I’m real, I kind of feel like they aren’t real? Like it’s some elaborate dream to cope, whenever they leave I don’t believe they were even there myself. When I’m extremely upset I also hear small and see small things, I kept on hearing the discord notification sound and light drums a couple days ago and my vision kept zooming in and out slightly

&amp;#x200B;

They said they’d try to get me help but I don’t know if I’m going to last that long or if I even want it, I seriously considered it last night and I just don’t know how to do this any longer. I can‘t if this is all it’s going to be. It’s been about a month now and it just keeps getting worse every week. I used to want to live to at least 18 but I just don’t want to do it anymore, I’m so tired and I just want peace from this constant drone. I feel like the only true calm I get is when I accept I am going to die, and start to plan for it, then I have something to look forward to instead of nothing.

I  am a 26 year old male currently living in Hammond, Indiana. I am  graduating from university with a BS in psychology and a minor in  sociology. I was planning to move to Peru and start traveling the world,  but it's impossible do to the current global situation. I wanted to  become a therapist at one point, but I don't believe in the current  field of psychology. Psilocybin mushrooms saved my life from depression  and I wanted to become a psilocybin-assisted therapist. However, the  laws have not progressed as rapidly as I had hoped and they've even been  put on hold due to the current crisis. I have dreams of starting a  career on youtube and gaining a following so that I can share my ideas  with people and hopefully make a big difference with my life. My family  is unsupportive of anything I want in life that doesn't include getting a  normal 9-5 job and just feeding myself until I die. I want more out of  this existence.

Does anyone have a  recommendation of a place I could move to and get a good start? I would  like to use my degree to help people, but I'm afraid only a bachelor's  in psychology won't find me anything. I would like to live in a state  like california, florida, or colorado. I want to be around people that  enjoy nature and try to be healthy. I have $4,000 but I don't have any  income. I have considered teaching english online to chinese children so  I could do that for a while until I find a different job, or youtube  takes off. Where is a good place to live in the US for me to find good  friends and live a peaceful life?

I  only have a month left in my apartment and I honestly have no idea what  I'm going to do or where I'm going to go. I don't have anyone in my  life that I trust to call and talk with for advice. I may be rambling  here because I haven't had many conversations with people over the past  few months and have a lot that I need to get out of my head. Thank you  for reading. I will reply to anyone and everyone who comments. Thank  you.",05Jul2020,1

587,"I’ve found a bag containing heroin and what I think is cocaine, their 13 and I only allow him to smoke weed. How can I go about talking to him/stopping him ? He’s high atm and I’m waiting for him to sober up, what should I say ? I’m not good with discussing stuff like this and I need advice asap. When he got home he was too high to take his coat off and was very disoriented he’s definitely under the influence of an opiate high (potentially heroin I’m guessing seeing as he had some in his bag)

Also why would he want to be doing such hard drugs ? I’ve found amphetamine vape juice on him before and he generally has no regard for danger, which is hard for me as I was the same and I know it will cost him soon.",05Jul2020,1
588,"So Idk how to start this. But my friend used to text first. But he only did that cuz he had a crush on me. But now that he doesn’t and we are just friends he will rarely if not ever text first. I’m always the one texting. I’m his friend and I like talking to him. 

Before I brought this up to him about this (which I’m glad I did) I had so many questions and thought he didn’t wanna talk to me, I was annoying to him, I don’t matter that much to him, he could care less about me. I thought much more and to the point i felt so annoyed and stressed and upset cuz I’m always starting every single convo. 

It’s exhausting. So I talked to him about it. Just to make sure where I stand with him. So I asked are we are friends. And he said “Yes. Why do you think we talk.” I said “because we are friends” but the factor is I’m always starting the convos.

And for the always initiating contact..I said “we are friends. But I always text you first” and he said “Ok and” apparently that didn’t matter to him. He said “it doesn’t mean anything”. I’m not sure what he meant by that. Yes it does. It shows the one sidedness. It still bothers me. 
I said  “It’s just. That I’m being realistic saying this. If I don’t text you there would be 2 months of no contact. You wouldn’t even text anything. Not trynna be rude or anything” and he said “Yea ik. I do that a lot” and i said I’m glad he’s aware. But I aksed is it to me only. And he said “Nah to a lot. 😂I be doing that to my bsf🤣” he fucking thinks it’s funny. It’s not. It’s very irritating. 

He says a excuse saying it’s cause he’s listening to music or playing games on his phone. 
I’m still annoyed. I was trying to be serious. I honestly don’t think he does that to anyone else. Only me.",05Jul2020,2

590,"Hi first of all, I won't kill myself but is something I can't get out of my head right now, seriously I just want to stop feeling so stressed.

I have less than a week to finish something. Is the third year I tried to succed at this project in my career. 3 years stuck in the same spot at university, wasting money that I don't have, and time that will never come back. And now I know that most probably I will fail again, and it's all my fault again. I'm from a third world country, so money is always something that keep me back, so it really is disappointing to do this to myself. Every year I'm excited to finish this and when the time for the final project arrives, I just stop going to classes. Even now that all I was meant to do was enter a zoom, I couldn't. I spent weeks and weeks wasting my time on social media, masturbating, watching netflix and playing videogames. I knew this was bad but couldn't stop, it's the third time and I still do the same thing. I feel like if I wanted to be a kid again with no responsabilities just enjoying the moment but I can't. The work of a few months in less than a week, it's impossible now. I don't know why I did this I know is bad but I really can't escape from that. I lost my job, my girlfriend, and now again I'm going to fail at the only thing that could make me succed in life.

I really don't know if someone could help me, I don't even see this as more as me being an idiot with no real problems so I got addicted to internet and ruined my own life. But maybe someone could give me a reply that at least makes me feel a little better or shows me other way to approach this situation.

I thought I liked her and told her that and she said she didnt feel the same. Jokingly I say okay how bout I flip a coin heads I win tails you lose thinking she would get  it and I flip a coin. It was a joke but after the coin flip she says I need chapstick and puts it on even after getting the joke. We kiss and then laugh it off saying it was a one time thing. A week goes by and yesterday I invited her to sit out in my front yard after fireworks because of the supposed lunar eclipse well we sat there for a few hours laying in a hammock i didnt think of it much and even though she played on me I didnt think much because we are best friends. Well she told me as she left she almost kissed me but was too chicken. I wont say that I dont wanna kiss her cause i do but last time we kissed I dint feel anything so I didnt think i like her.

598,"Hi all,

I guess I am just generally looking for advice. I am going to be a sophomore (19M) and with the current situation, my university is going to have hybrid classes with some classes in-person and some online. Because I grew up and live in the same city as my university, my parents want (forcing) me to live at home this fall (for health reasons?).

Although we haven’t had this conversation yet (between my parents and I), my siblings have told me that my parents had talked about it without me around and basically agreed I cannot return.

I am solely responsible for paying for both my tuition and housing, and am looking for advice for how to explain that I do not want to live at home. My parents are very closed minded and will definitely be angry, so I need solid arguments for why I should be able to live on campus.

I already have:

1. It’s my money, I can do what I want.
2. I don’t want to catch it at college and bring it home to my parents/siblings.

They’ll probably argue that they pay for my phone/insurance/car and I’m at a greater price risk of getting it while on campus, so I can’t do what I want, but it would be appreciated if you all could help me come up with more arguments to support my position. Thanks!",05Jul2020,1

So I'm generally down to earth and love helping others. Recently, I'm starting to notice that those I consider as 'friends' just seek out to me when they need something and completely abandon me after the deed is done. Even when I'm in dire need of their help they just easily shut me out. My best friend suggested that I cut ties with these people. The problem is no matter how hard I try to refrain from helping them, with just little persuasions, I succumb and do what they ask of me. I hate being a use and throw and I feel like a sore loser just thinking about how gullible I am.

601,"I just ended my junior year of high school. This embarrassing pic of me was spread (through text, never posted anywhere) through a lot of people 6-7 months ago, and people laughed at me. For some reason, in the moment or any time before social distancing really, I never really cared much about it. But when the virus came and shut everything down, I had a lot more free time to really dwell on shit. Even with online school closed, and the summer being open, I have a lot more time. It was during that period of time that what happened really started to hit me full force.

I had a talk with the asshole who took that pic, and verbally hounded him several times until he was able to get in his fat head that he did something wrong. According to him, it was nothing but a funny joke. And so he had long admitted the mistake he made.

Despite the closure, and despite standing up for myself (repeatedly), I still cringe at this event that happened. I still have one more year left. I feel as though people are going to remember that pic and remember that embarrassment, and I'm going to have a really bad rep senior year. This kind of stuff doesn't happen to anyone else, as everyone else at my school don't even know what hardship and suffering is like. They all live ""happy go lucky"" lives like nothing had ever happened.

Also, I've heard stories of college admissions and employment being affected all because of one pic, and thats what really haunts me too.

We have incredible chemistry together so I figured it would only be a matter of time before something happened between us but that time never came as he was pre-occupied pursuing an on again off again relationship with someone else, leaving me the unwitting third wheel in a love triangle.

It’s been really hard these last couple of years playing the role of the best friend when I want to be so much more. I wrote him a love note once when he was sick but chickened out at the last minute. I just never wanted to get in the way of things (he’s been crushing on this other girl pretty much as long as I’ve been crushing on him) and sometimes I worry that I may have missed the boat.

Due to COVID, we haven’t seen a whole lot of each other but we message and video chat constantly. Anytime I receive a notification with his name on it, I get butterflies in my stomach.

606,"I posted something on AITA, asking people if I was the asshole in the situation, when I had an argument with my boyfriend. It was pretty low for me to do that, since it wasn't really Serious to begin with, but I wanted to know if I was right or wrong. 

I received the veredict, I deleted the throwaway, the comments, the thread, etc. I could see that the description of the post was still there and that it wasn't deleted at all, this was when I looked it up on Google chrome. 

He would be pissed if I shared information about our arguments. 

I contacted the mods of the sub reddit, however, they said they couldn't do anything about it since you have to live with the veredict the people gave you.

It wasn't because I was the asshole or not, it was just because I just wanted to delete something that I didn't want there anymore.

I admit I was dumb on posting something there, but isn't someone on their right to want something deleted after they suggest it?

I am probably being paranoid here, since he probably won't find it if he simply looks it up on Reddit. But the fact that it's still there if you look it up on Google, really makes me worried even if it's almost impossible to simply find it.

Now I know that I should be careful of what I post.

609," Hi,

I had some pain in my back, so I went to my physician, and got some orders for X-Ray.

I called about five different imaging centers and asked them how much they would charge with my Aetna insurance. This particular imaging center told me that I would have to pay only $100, so I visited there on 6/8/2020, paid $100 when I arrived, and got the images taken.

However, I just received a letter from Aetna saying that the imaging center (Out of network service provider) billed $2,700 for the x-ray images. I was so shocked, so I went into the Aetna WebSite and checked the Explanation of Benefit (EOB), and it had $2,700 in the ""You may owe"" column.

Should I be concerned that the imaging center will actually bill me $2,700 for this?

Before I went to the imaging center, I sent them the x-ray orders from my physician and a copy of my insurance card, and they confirmed verbally that it would only cost me $100. I also have the receipt of $100 payment that day.

616,"I (15M) am not sure if I should ask out my crush (15F)

Hello everyone I’ll try to be as succinct as possible.

So basically the background is that I asked this girl who I didn’t know that well from school whether she liked me via snapchat and told her I liked her. I did this because I was quite confident that she liked me for many different reasons. She told me something along the lines of “I like you but I’m not ready for a relationship.” (Which is fair enough considering she didn’t really know me and we hadn’t talked irl)

We continued talking on snapchat and a few days ago she admitted that she had a huge crush on me in primary school (four years ago). I said same and we kinda laughed it off. We’ve been talking on snapchat quite generally and the convos haven’t been bad. She seems to like my personality and is getting to know me.

I’m now considering asking her out to like eat or something (it’s school holidays). Here are my four questions:

1. Should I ask her out to begin with?
2. If I ask her out, should I just frame it as something friendly or as a date?
3. Should I bring along friends and ask her to bring along friends?
4. Any ideas for activities we could do or should we just eat somewhere and just kinda walk around and chill?

Thanks everyone!

617,So theirs this female coworker. We both knew what we were doing since the beginning when both of us were catching feelings for each other and we both knew what would of happened if it didn’t work out. At this point we’re just cool but not sure if we’re friends because she told me “we can be cool at work but nothing beyond on that” and at this point we’re not talking. She did told me to back off and let my feeling fade away. It hard when her and I work together at the same time. I kinda want to make progress with her just because I do truly care about her and I grown attached to her son and it sucks not knowing I can hang out with the buddy. She did tell me that I add stress to her life but that’s because her baby daddy got involved in our relationship....so at this point I’m not sure if I should try anything like should i ask how her Fourth of July was ? I haven’t talked to her since Father’s Day. It sucks that whenever I do night shifts at work. She’s constantly on my mind and gives my anxiety every time I wake up thinking what if I did was wrong?

This issue has continued into my adulthood from my teenage years. I’ve lived with two long term boyfriends at this point, and her behaviour has caused serious problems in my relationships. She would call, text, send me pictures every day telling me how sad she feels without me and that I should ‘just come home’- I’m living in a condo about 25 minutes away from her trying to live a normal adult life. She calls me while I’m out with friends, asking me how much I’ve been drinking, where I’m going, who I’m with, the whole works. What’s worse, my brother still lives with her and he has started to develop her behaviours. Whenever I see him, he makes some sort of comment about how I’m ‘never around’ and that I ‘can’t just leave my family’. It’s really hard for me to process- I have this overwhelming feeling of guilt and I feel that I’ve done absolutely nothing wrong.

630,"I turned 20 on June 23 and am becoming very sad/hopeless about it. ( this is gonna be kinda ranty) I graduated hs a year late, so all my friends are 18 and I feel so old and scared, like I haven’t even lived yet?? Also, is it weird for a 20 year old to hang out w 18yr olds?? I spent my teen years holed up in my room due to mental illness, and regret it so much, I didn’t have time to be stupid or anything. My time has run out for stupid teen angst, sneaking out, parties etc. It sounds so dumb but it all kicked in when I saw that for the Harmony Korine movie “kids” they had an open casting call for anyone 13-19 and I was like oh ok this is what getting old feels like, I wouldn’t have been allowed because I’m too old. I feel like I should be doing something, like my time is running out, and I need to grow up and be an “adult” right now.  Did any of you go through something similar? How do I deal w this without feeling like I’m gonna turn to dusty old bones full of green dust? Sorry if this doesn’t make sense, I’m just feeling it all rn lmao",05Jul2020,2

My brother smells insanely strong of body odor and you can't stand 4 feet away from him without smelling him. He's repulsive. Now, I figured that the reason why my shirts were smelling like this was because he is wearing my shirts, and also because my parents were mixing our laundry. So I started doing my own.

634,"Every day for the last 3 months, since summer began have, for the most part, been unimportant, stagnant, and as same as the last. 

I just started college last year and am struggling to find out who I am after try-harding in easy high school academic courses (basically no important AP credits). I play video games, watch tv, and other meaningless activities that don't do anything in the long run. I have struggled to maintain a productive and reliable schedule. 

I haven't done much of anything meaningfully productive, exclusive of some small day projects, and feel that I have no ambition for the future. My first year of college, I didn't spark much of an interest in the classes and out of pure I-don't-know-what-now-ness have mentioned considering taking a gap year. I don't know how else I would progress myself other than work full-time during said gap year. I can easily imagine myself playing more video games, watching porn, watching tv, and working full-time on the side for the entirety of my gap year and not finding out what I might want to go back to school to study. 

I'm just not sure how to go about this, how to find out what I want to take classes in at college to get a degree in and find either a job related to my field or something completely different that I get into just because I have a college degree. 

People have mentioned learning a trade as well. I don't know what to do.

635,"My wife and I (both 45) have two daughters, 11 and 8. Generally speaking, our older daughter tends to gravitate to me while our younger daughter gravitates towards my wife. We've recently noticed a number of signs of adolescence in our older daughter, and we suspect her first period may be just around the corner.

Twice recently she's come to me with questions I was, frankly, unprepared to answer. The first was a general question about periods and the second was about some discharge she'd noticed one morning. I flubbed both times and gave a weak, ""Ask your mother"" response.

I was disappointed in myself, and it was clear she expected better, too. What can I do to prepare for the next time she has questions about puberty? What questions should I expect? What should I proactively discuss with her? I want to be there for her, but I'm feeling a little lost.",05Jul2020,4
636,"Yesterday my younger brother (13) randomly sent me a photo of a girl on WhatsApp. I didn’t recognise her because she had a filter on and I haven’t seen anyone but my family for over three months. I asked who it was and my brother just said ‘it’s your friends sister’ (friends sister is 14) I knew who she was I just didn’t recognise her immediately cause I’m not that close with her.

I asked him why he randomly sent me a photo of her and he kept changing his answer to ‘I wanted to see if you recognised her’ and ‘I just felt like it’ so I was like ‘uhh okay’ and then later that evening my brother sent me another photo of her and I asked why he did it and he said those same two excuses. 

I told him to stop because he hasn’t talked to my sisters friend and she has no idea who he is but he didn’t and kept sending pictures of her. I said it’s fucking creepy to send selfies of a stranger (cause that’s what they are) to someone who knows them and he insisted it wasn’t creepy because ‘he knows who she is’ they haven’t talked to each other before. It’s weird he’s sending innocent Instagram selfies of her to me. 

So I told my mum what he was doing and why it’s weird and she said ‘if you post pictures on Instagram, don’t be shocked if people go and share it’ (my mum sides with my brother about everything, she’s extremely bias towards him and ignores his wrong doings because she’s literally the embodiment of ‘Asian mum who prefers her son over her daughter(s) for no reason’ (is there an actual reason for this?) 

So I tried to break it down and explain again why it’s freaky to send random pictures of a person to someone they know and how, despite it not being a crime, it’s weird and can be interpreted the wrong way, she started shouting at me so I said ‘would you like it if I just sent a picture of your friends siblings to you for no reason?’ Just to explain my point of view and they both said ‘no’ but still insisted that this was different. It’s not different! 

I went to my sister because she has this scarce thing called common sense and told her what happened and she told my brother he was a freak and to stop it and he got mad and they started arguing and my mum blamed me. Today he brought it up again and I explained again why it’s weird and both still said I was trying to get on my sisters ‘good side’ and that I was wrong. (My sister likes me most by default lol)

Am I overreacting? Is this actually fine? How can I explain to my brother (not going to try and bother reasoning with my mum she doesn’t even believe in evolution) that it’s creepy to send pictures of my friends younger sister to me for no reason? Also should I tell my friends little sister about this? I doubt my brother could conflict any real harm to her, but still. What he’s doing is creepy and if I was in her shoes I’d want to know.

637,"Essentially my mom and sisters are going on a four day camping trip. I am invited. I asked my boss weeks in advance and he basically just left me on my own and there’s no way I’m gonna be able to trade four shifts. However I kinda want to quit my job. I’ve already hit my summer savings goal and it’s sucking the life force out of me. Additionally I have a volunteer opportunity now but the first meeting I had to reschedule and I’ll have to do that again if I go camping which I would feel bad about. If I don’t go camping I will be home with just my dad leaving me pretty big liberties (including my gf can come over which we haven’t been indoors in a while. )

Since then it has gotten way out of hand and I now feel there only thing I can do is to quit immediately.

I stated previously I was being bitched about by managers but I have found out now that my character was defamed and that’s why I was being treated so horridly. There was a miscommunication about a task I was to complete, which I carried out, but did so in the wrong place. When asked if I completed it I said that I had and so the manager told my boss that I was lying and proceeded to tell all managers that I am a liar, despite the fact I had carried it out just not in the place he had in mind. Even upon me explaining the situation, which was a simple miscommunication, he is still insisting that I’m a liar.

I’m not interested in giving 2 weeks notice to a company that thinks of me like that and would go out of their way to have everyone treat me badly as a result. I wouldn’t want to put myself through another 2 weeks being bullied by staff. I’m also not likely to get a good reference and I now have a second job I can work at instead. 

How would I go about quitting this way? Do I still need to write a resignation letter?",05Jul2020,2

Is there anything I can do to help him get better at social interaction and be able to get along with my parents. At the time that I’m writing this they just told him off for being supposedly rude for not saying thank you with a smile after leaving a family members house.

That was whatever and I accepted it because he’s been quite cold and rude to me recently as he’s made new friends which sucks because we used to be close but times change I guess. He texted me there and said “sorry man I couldn’t have you over, I could only have 10 people over because of Corona”. Despite there being a solid 15 people there. I’ve three ideas right now; 
1. Should I just leave it and move on.
2. Say “I could tell you didn’t want me there man, you’ve been different to me recently and if I’ve done something to you, I’m sorry”. 
3. Call him out for lying and being rude to me recently (bit dramatic but I’m a bit scatterbrained right now)

644,"I'm just your average person living in Canada. Middle class, parents are together, went to school, halfway through university, an average student, not to many friends but whatever, etc. But I've ran into a dilemma - trust issues that led to many other problems.

So I (20F) have come to a realization that I've been gas-lighted my whole life. Because of this, I have many unhealthy and may I say toxic habits/personality/behaviour that I am so desperately trying to fix before it costs me any more. Basically, I did not realize that my parents behaviour had such a huge impact on me and I am doing damage control on my life.

These unhealthy/toxic things that I am trying to unlearn come from my parents. As an adult, you start to realize that your parents were right about some things but not all things.

I don't trust people because one time they're on your side and next thing you know, they never actually cared about you.

I can't trust my father because he's unreasonable, controlling and narcissistic. I'm not close with my father at all but as a child I kept faking it just to stay out of trouble.

I can't trust my mom because she will not acknowledge how I feel and she will downplay my feelings as she usually does. She enables my dad's crazy behaviour and keeps saying I should just forgive my father because he doesn't know any better. I just feel mistreated, unheard and misunderstood. Even if I do forgive him, it doesn't do me any good staying around him. It also doesn't do me any good being told I should allow this type of behaviour towards me.

And I can't trust my friends because we're not that close, and they tend to brush it off by giving general and shallow advice to change the topic because I don't think they care. They say things like ""I'm sorry to hear that but I'm sure you'll be fine."" It seems like it's not genuine and they are downplaying how I feel and not acknowledging what I said.

And I can't trust people because I'm scared of being vulnerable.

For example, over the past 2 years, I've said no to all the guys that have asked me to date them (8 liked me, out of them 5 asked me out) and I said no to them because I need to learn to trust people but it's so hard. I also think I would be tempted to just drop all my baggage on them and I don't think that would be fair to them to be used like that.

I feel like I can't even be myself in this environment where I have to keep walking on eggshells all the time.

I never thought I'd say this because I'm a very positive person but sometimes I kind of want to disappear, and it's weird because I also don't want that. Like, I have goals and things I want to do in life but sometimes it seems so hopeless as if even if I do that, somehow I won't be satisfied and nothing good will come out of it and it won't solve my problems. I won't be understood and I'll have to continue swimming against the current and walk on eggshells just to please people.

I tried to make this as short as I could but here's a tl;dr anyway.

**tl;dr I don't trust people because one time you think they're on your side and next thing you know, they never actually cared about you.**

652,"no micro dosing involved, all tabs are/were paper

took my first tab of acid may 22 this year, got high but no visuals(hallucinations). took my second tab a little under a month later. my friends turned into aliens i saw symbols that seemed stamped on my eyes (copyrighting my eyes is what i call it). i saw heaven, dragons and god. my reflection (Elixabeth) stole my knees, i watched my face be unzipped, my face fell off 2x, my shoulders disappeared. the whole nine yards.

&amp;#x200B;

two ish weeks later i fucked up. I got an old old old tab and it did nothing but make me feel a little high. three hours later tab 2, peacock symbol. two hours later, fire symbol. 5 hours after that i took the tab with a skeleton hand, or as my narrator calls it, the hand of death. my pupils were huge af and i was acting a little off but since i didnt get visions i complained i didnt trip. my driving even got better DURING this trip!

this was 5-6 days before i moved. on the last day before i moved my stuff, day 6, i took another tab and i had about 3 bumps of molly via apple juice. once i got inside my body felt like it was burning slowly from the inside out. my stomach was twisting and turning but i was high as fuck. my body was on autopilot. i was trying to stop my head from spinning at 75 mph when all of a sudden i was sitting in the bathroom throwing up.i didnt throw up much kinda just one hurl and i was fine. i had a great trip, my senses were heightened, i drove great af once again, 8D audio almost literally made me nut, i saw a few things but it was mainly involving street/car lights. I, and someone we sold a tab to, both said it cause like extreme and legitimate happiness. i originally described it as ""having no pressure and feeling like a normal person"" which dissipated after like a two hour nap

but i smoked Tuesday, the day after the last tab, and i started having visions.i also experienced sleep paralysis for the first time since 2017 but consensus syas it may just be coincidence (i posted about this previously) its 7/3 and 12:50 and its went from only car lights/street lights to now the games im playing and any light that has a direct source.

653,"So I and my boyfriend, or rather ex-boyfriend of mine has been dating for the past 1 year. I am more of an extrovert and always express my emotions and feelings very freely, whereas he is very reserved and doesn't talk much about himself or how he feels because he doesn't see the need to do so. Both of us had a rough start as I wasn't as emotionally invested back then and he was sensitive. However, we worked through that and it became smooth sailing until CB (circuit breaker in Singapore, very similar to the Stay Home Period in other countries) happened. Because our love language is physical touch and word of affirmation, it was very hard to just make everything work via the Internet.

At first, we tried video calling. However, his phone was spoilt on the third week of CB. So we hardly communicate afterwards. All we did max was to send stickers on Telegram to show our replies, feeling very obligated to though. Then it became very weird as he became very cold to me, and I thought it was just him being very asshole. So I wanted to settle this on the first day of phase 2 to talk everything out with him. I went to his house, not notifying him. He was at a shock when he saw me and asked why I came. I said I wanted to talk about why he was behaving like this and second-guessed if he was losing feeling in the relationship. Hold and behold, he admitted he did realise he did on the second week of CB (circuit breaker in Singapore) and tried to work things out on his own part by calling but realise it doesn't work out on his part, so he gave up completely after trying for 2 weeks. He did not want to tell me as he was worried I would panic about this situation. I agreed to the break-up but broke down crying for hours in his arms. He tried comforting by hugging me, constantly wiping my tears away and telling me its not my fault. I really wanted this to work out so badly. We proceed to agree that we can continue being friends (however my friends disagree on this as they said lovers can never be friends again as it either means they either never loved you before or have not lost feelings at all). He then proceeds to try to give me his jacket that I loved so much, but couldn't find it, so he offered me a lot of other stuff that I like about his possessions. I did not understand why he did so and asked him why was he trying to give me something (because I assumed he felt guilty), but he just stopped and became quiet. Because of the awkward silence, I tried to make the situation more light-hearted by talking about other topics, we laughed and the rest of the times of that day were enjoyable. He then proceeded to send me home via cab as it was pretty late. However, we still subconsciously hold hands. I let go when I realised it as I knew it should have never happened. Then because we had to cross a longkang (drainage), he proceeded to reach his hands out to let me grip on. I questioned myself why he would do that. I went home and we still consistently text each other.

On the second day of the break-up, I dwelled into the situation again and pestered him to patch with me, because I really think this could work. However, he threatened to cut contact with me if I try to pursue the matter. Because to him, he really felt he has tried his part before and he feels that he doesn't think he can be getting the feelings back even if he tries again with me. He also feels like right now, being in a relationship isn't his priority as he is busy with uni registration. Then I told him that I'm going to back off from asking him back again because I would rather stay in contact.

Till today, we still text pretty consistently, but it is just 100% me maintaining the conversation as he really feels like he has nothing to say to me. I would really love to reignite the flames in this relationship. I know it will work out. His actions and his words are contradicting. I am just very confused about how can I make this workout. I feel that he is still unsure about getting into this again, as much as he enjoys my company and does not want me out of his life. I feel like he hasn't actually given many thoughts about whether he is willing to give me up completely. I do not want to bug him about this situation for the time being, but I’m just very anxious and confused about how I should let him really think about it thoroughly.

After all of these that have happened, I talked things out with him. He still believes he had completely lost feelings but is willing to try things out again for the next 3 weeks (bcos its been a week of trying tbh), then he said the only way he can try on his end is to go out with me. He feels that he has no motivation to pursue this aggressively. There is nothing I can do to make him more “motivated”, I can only advise him on how he can do things on his own end to be more motivated. However, he says he just wants to let nature take its course and see how this will end by the end of the month. If he can feel a little of his feelings coming back, then he’ll continue this rs, else we’ll end it cleanly.",05Jul2020,1

My ex gf gave police complaint on me that I'm harassing her since 9 months...
The truth is she cheated on me by loving other boy when she's already in love with me then I brokeup with her this was all happened 7 months back. Then I was in depression for more than 3 months.
Recently she texted me saying she was very happy when we were in relationship...she wanted to be happy with me again and I agreed. Then she asked my nude pics which we used to share when we were in relationship, we talked nicely for 1 week, she promised that she'll never cheat or she'll never leave me again, I truly loved her that's why i accepted again.

I don't know what happened to her, the next day she gave police complaint on me that I'm harassing her and blackmailing her that I'm misusing her nude pictures for past 9 months. Police called me and forced me to write an apology letter that I'll never try to contact her so that they won't file any FIR on me. I didn't do any mistake I never harassed or misused her pictures, I told the same with police but they didn't listen to me.

Even I showed them her recent messages as a proof but they said, my proof's are not valid as she was a girl. They made me accept that mistake was mine. They said just because the complaint was raised from a girl, i need to compromise even though the mistake was from her side. They warned me if I ever try to make contact with her again, they will file a case against me and they would put me in jail.

I didn't do any mistake..my only mistake was accepting her again..

663,"So,  I'm currently in the process of moving back into my house and doing a number of necessary home improvement projects. I've been staying at my mother's place since the lockdown was announced. It wouldn't take that much time to just put everything in the car and go back, but there are like 1,001 little additional things that I need to do in order to be ready to live there again after three months here. I'm basically driving an hour both ways on Saturdays and/or Sundays to work on the house. Between the drive, the workweek, and the hours of physical labor, by Sunday evening I am exhausted.

The catch is that my father keeps inviting me over to his place on the weekend. He is living with a woman who, although I like her a lot, I feel like in whose presence I have to be on my best behavior and have to play the ""guest."" By the time I get over there, I have been doing yard work, etc. for several hours already, and I just can't put myself into that mode. I want to crawl onto the couch and nap. And once dinner, etc. is over, I have to drive another hour to get back to my mother's place.

The second catch is that if my mother knew I was at my father's place, she would lose her mind. The excuse would be the pandemic, but the real reason is that they just hate each other and she's the type of person who expects everyone to act and think like her.

The last time I accepted a dinner invitation from my father, I told him that I could only stay an hour. They didn't even start preparing the food until the time when I said I had to leave. 

I know the obvious solution is just to pack my stuff and move back, but again, between work, etc., it's not that simple. And the requests for my presence are just drawing out the process, making me dread the weekend, contributing to my exhaustion, etc.",05Jul2020,2

665,"I struggled with ADHD growing up and in college but did not get treated b/c it was not something I could afford at the time. Now that I am paying around $1500 a month in premium health insurance (Kaiser), I decided to meet with a psychiatrist and get treated. Instead, the DR wants to prescribe me antidepressants despite me clearly telling him I am not depressed. 

I went to another psychiatrist and was prescribed Adderall. The medication works great and I manage side effects by staying hydrated, eating well, working out, and getting good sleep. However, I have been paying out of pocket. 

I tried seeing another doctor at Kaiser but this is the only one available. What can I do to move my prescription to Kaiser?",05Jul2020,1

668,"My grandma is in her death bed and she lives on the other side of the world. It pains me that her children are here in the US, but because of COVID-19 restrictions we won’t be able to be there for her when she dies. 

This has caused me to not want to talk to anyone but I am yearning the comfort of someone to be there for me. When I talk to my best friend about it, I feel like my emotions get minimized because she’ll go on about how she lost her grandma and her mom the same year and that I’ll be okay too. Idk. I just feel like the response I get from people are so shitty. 

My other support system is my bf. He hasn’t really lost anyone he’s been close to so I feel like he can’t relate to the pain and suffering I’m going through. Idk. It’s just hard to find comfort.

I never really found comfort from my family even though they’re also going through anticipatory grief. I come from an asian background so I feel like we weren’t raised to manage/ express our emotions in a healthy way.

672,"I have been in a relationship for the past 3 years. We are both 28 years old. The first 2.5 years were amazing. He spoiled me, did everything for myself and my child, we had nothing but lots of fun together. I trusted him 10000% and any time I needed him he was right there. Things were very serious between us and we began to talk of marriage and getting a place together. 
He grew up in a very different religious background than myself. I am a Christian and he is Muslim. He told me we would have to hide the fact that I have a son from a previous relationship from his parents....he would buy me a 10,000 ring if I would be okay with that. 
From that day forward, the relationship wasn’t the same. I didn’t want a marriage like that. I started giving him attitudes and hanging out with other people. I never cheated but I was starting to spend my time elsewhere. 
The first time he picked up on the differences we sat and had a long talk about everything that was bothering me and he promised to tell his parents that he was in a relationship, he wanted to marry me and he swore he would tell them about my son. I tried to believe him and we started looking at places together but there were no real moves made forward which definitely changed myself in the relationship. 
Despite alll of my attitudes and mood swings he still treated me and my son well. He was always there through everything. I did love him but his talks of the future and what we would have to hide definitely did bother me. 
BUTTTT.... 
For the last 3 weeks I found out he had a tracking and audio device placed under my cars. He has been tracking my cars continuously for the past couple of weeks. On top of that, he had his friend (who has guns, is a drug dealer and a shitty person all around) literally follow me to and from work and stalk me in front of my house. 
I had no idea any of this was going on until July 1st. I was hanging out with my friend. We met and I got in his car, when I came back to my own car my boyfriend and two of his friends (one being the stalker) were parked right next to my car. They exchanged words and eventually drove off (thank god) but then My friend and I decided to check my car for a tracker... we  looked under the car and found the device. 
My boyfriend and I stopped speaking to each other after that day and it lasted up until last night. 
He is really upset and hurt that he saw me with other guys and He admitted to having his friend follow me around and park around my house continuously because they wanted to check and see if I was cheating or not. 
I know I was wrong for hanging out with other guys behind his back but I think if anyone crossed any lines it’s him with all this crazy stalking shit. I am a mother and 90% of the time I have a little boy with me. I don’t need a dangerous person following me around and around my house! I am not okay with tracking and audio devices on my belongings! 
He wants to work things out. He wants me to change my phone number and try to work things out again. He promised to never do anything like that again but I can’t exactly trust that. He promised to be engaged by the end of the summer which would include that long awaited talk with his parents too. He has been in my sons life for the past 4 years and my son does miss him and ask for him. I definitely love him still but idk if I should go back.... 
What would you guys do in my situation?",05Jul2020,1
673,"I have a friend who has high functioning autism so for the most part hes like anyone else. The only thing that is really noticeable is his social skills can be lacking at times. I know him from school but over time we drifted apart, I think this was because I didn't really know how to deal with him at the time. Recently though I've been more open to him even inviting him to party's and such because he had seemed to become more mature socially. Through this he has met some of my other friends and they all seemed cool with each other. Over time I did realise that he hadn't really changed that much and now after thinking about it I'm probably just more tolerant of his flaws. 

The problem comes with my friends who don't know how to deal with him. They are all fairly reasonable people but after extended periods of time with him it is draining. He had been added to group chats we are all fairly active in but because of his constant stream of nonsense people ended up making other ones and it came to the point where they removed him. Now hes turned to me to ask to be put back. I'm not sure what to say to him. 

He doesn't seem to pick up on social ques and my friends just can't deal with it (which I don't blame them for). I do honestly like him but I feel bad outright telling him how it is considering he hasn't picked up on it yet. When I was younger I would just ghost him till the problem ""went away"" but over the years this keeps happening and I want to properly deal with it now. I feel bad just leaving him because he seems to trust me and I value the friendship but I also feel bad having my other friends involved. I don't want it to be like I have to constantly hide from him when leaving him out of things just so he doesn't find out. In a perfect world id like this to be resolved without anyone hating each other because I know there will probably be times that they will be together. Times like my birthday when I normally throw a big party. Luckily for now covid has delayed me dealing with this. Thanks.",05Jul2020,1

I move around a lot so I don’t own anything more than what fits in the average backpack. It’s difficult to find the money to buy myself new clothes either. I shop at thrift stores but even those have gotten on the expensive side. I cut my own hair and try to take care of my personal hygiene to the best of my abilities. But I feel I’ve grown to look exhausted and plain boring.

678,"I was in a relationship with him until he decided to break it off because of problems he was having with his ex. We decided to remain friends which was difficult for me but then we'd always end up going back to each other acting like we're in a relationship but without the label. 

He got drunk last night and called me telling me that he loves me, wants to be with me and he doesn't deserve me. He was saying that he's a piece of shit with the way he treated me and asking why do I still wait for him when I could have anyone I want. He then told me that he struggles to commit to me because he still wants vengeance against his ex. 

They were childhood friends and started dating when they were in university and was his first love. She then started using him to do all his assignments at university (only talk to him really when she needed help and would say stuff like if you're not helping me then what's the point of talking to you) and he was the reason she passed first year. But they ended up having a huge argument since she kept talking to other guys leading to their breakup. 

I found out when he broke up with me he was talking to her again (as friends) a bit before our breakup in November and she ended up telling him in January that she had failed second year of university and was asking him for help with assignments again. They then had another massive argument and since then they haven't spoken to each other. (this made me wonder is he still in love with her since he basically left me because of her)

He told me that when he first met me that he was just looking for revenge to hurt her as much as she hurt him. So he decided to download a dating app which is where he found his first victim, me. He ended up falling in love with me. And he told me last night when he was drunk that he feels he can't commit to me even though he truly loves me is because he feels guilt with how we started and that he has more feelings of wanting to hurt her back more than he loves me. He also said that he doesn't love her and wouldn't want to get back together with her. 

I told him he needs to talk to her for closure or go to a therapist as he had never actually spoken to anyone about this and never told her that he felt like she was using him. He said that because they'd known eachother since childhood it just felt like the biggest betrayal and he doesn't understand how she could do that to him. I don't really understand what's going on between them but he was asking me what would I do if they ended up getting back together even though he thinks they wouldn't. But I think how can you say you love me but then think that there's a possibility of getting back with her? I told him if he ever got back with her I'd leave his life because I just don't want to be friends with him if he has a new gf and chooses someone over me. 

I guess I just need advice on whether I'm being stupid and being played or if I should wait for him until he can heal after the hurt his ex caused him once he gets the closure or help that he needs. It's strange because it seems like he still is emotionally attached to her like in a toxic relationship but doesn't want to be with her. He kept saying things like he wishes that I was his first love, I'm the perfect girl and why does he still feel like he wants revenge with her when he has everything that he wants in me. It just seems like his emotional baggage is holding him back from us being in a relationship :/",05Jul2020,1

685,"I just turned 15 a few days ago and I thought that it would be about time to look into some careers for the future.  For a little bit of a background, I am 15 and am going into sophomore year this year. I have a 4.0 GPA and that's with all advanced classes which includes pre-calculus and chemistry. I'm also a competitive swimmer with multiple college offerings. Lastly, for the last few summers I've been working underneath my dad who is a manager at an Aerospace Engineering Workplace so I have some experience (-ish).

With that said, I'm looking for some careers to go into that pay well and are fun/interesting. I've been looking into jobs that do with space and architecture because they most interest me. However, most of the jobs that have to do with space are in low supply with a lot of competition for the place. With the same going for architecture. I think that i would have a good shot at getting a job with what my background is but I'm not so sure.

Schooling is also another factor, I have a good chance at getting a full ride to a college from what my coach and parents to me. For an astronomy related job the average schooling is anywhere from 4-6 years, but it's also rated one of the hardest courses in college to take. The same goes for architecture.

Finally salary wise, the base salary for each field has an opportunity to be in six figures. For astronomy its a little higher in the U.S. at $90,000-$141,000, For architecture it's $80,000-$121,000. (This might be a little off but its what i found for median salary's near me)

691,"As my title said, I'm genuinely unsure if I should keep trying to rebuild my relationship with my immediate family...

I feel like I should give some information first... both of my parents were abused by their respective parents and my father has Autism (which isn't an issue initally, I'm autistic as well.) My brother fell into hard right-wing groups as a kid and most family members who know him are genuinely concerned he's going to come out as a Nazi.As for myself, I have cPTSD / Autism, and I'm transgender as well. These are important.

My father has no empathy to the extreme. This is fine and well and I can understand, but it's mutated to the point of where he can't comprehend behaviors that deviate from his. The best, recurring example I can think of would be how harshly he belittles and gets upset with me for doing.. anything differently from him.He expresses no genuine interest in myself or his other kids as well. He offers me orange juice every morning. I hate orange juice. Every morning, I say no. Stuff like that. He's aware of my depression / Autism / cPTSD and yet to this date has made no effort to understand how it affects me and why I can't do certain tasks or talk to certain people. I don't think he even knows he's part of my trauma (used to beat me as a kid, belittles me to this day.). And he's still friends with the man that molested me for years.

As for being transgender.. he wants me to find a middle ground. He's not willing to try and understand what being transgender feels like for me or why I'm willing to ""inject drugs"". Every time I offer to show him research or anything like that, his response can basically be summed up as yes &gt; no &gt; I don't know &gt; you know how uncomfortable this makes me. This has been going on for years and more recently, has taken to telling me to ""pray the gay away"". This extends to other topics as well, politics being the most notable. In fact, his most common response will be something along the lines of, ""I see you've done your research but I haven't done my research - ergo, you are wrong.""

As for my brother, he's outright cruel. He reguarly beats and belittles our younger (autistic as well) brother. I have two scars on my body from him - the freshest one being from only last week when he gave me extremely bad burns. He doesn't care.He takes after our father in terms of caring for others, in fact. He simply doesn't. This extends to everyone around him as well and has told me he doesn't actually think other people are real.

Most recently, he's told me being LGBT is a mental illness or rooted in a porn addiction, as well as it being comparable to pedophilia. Take note, he's never spoken to another LGBT person (by admission) aside from me. Did I mention he's on his way to becoming an incel on top of being a fullblown Nazi? This isn't some liberal panic, I've seen Steam groups and Discord flags with the flag as an icon and have received.. ""memes"" from him that are ridiculously antisementic or misogynistic.

I want to repair my relationship with my father and mother (as hard as it is to do when still living with them... I've been unable to move out due to the pandemic). I know they have their struggles due to parental abuse as well but.. I honestly go back and forth from wondering if it's even worth it. Should I keep trying? Should I keep trying to get my father to understand and accept me? Should I even talk to my brother at this point? I don't want to be forced to choose between my family and my happiness but I honestly feel like it's coming down to that soon.

696,"For context, I am 18 years old, and am about to turn 19 in a few months. My Mom has always been extremely overprotective of me, which I always realized, but recently I’m starting to think it is very controlling and toxic. Here are a few things she does that make me feel as if I have absolutely no independence whatsoever. 

1.) When I’m out with a friend, she is constantly tracking me through an app on her phone, and will make me send pictures of where I am whenever I go to a new stop. She also sends me paragraphs of text messages claiming that she can’t track me and that I’m lying about where I am, when in reality she has no clue how to use technology. She constantly interrupts my activities with the tracking/messages, and if I don’t respond instantly, she threatens to take away my car privileges permanently. Her distrust for me makes no sense because I have NEVER done anything wrong. I have never snuck out or wrecked the car or broken a rule. I have always met her expectations, yet she still has no trust in me. When I went away to college it was even worse, and she would send me countless texts while I was in class to get me to respond to her. When I told her I was in class, she would sometimes accuse me of lying. 

2.) She discourages me from getting a job: Due to COVID, my college classes got moved online, so I’m planning on getting a job at home to gain some new independence. Unfortunately, everytime I mention working, my mom tells me it is pointless for me to work, and that I am ungrateful and selfish for seeking a job. She has also said hurtful things like “you’re too lazy to do a real job”, and she refuses to let me work anywhere else but a library that is 2 minutes away from our house. When I was making my resume, she barely helped me as if she was hoping it would be bad so I wouldn’t get hired. I don’t understand why someone would NOT want their child to contribute to society. I fear that she is teaching me to be helpless/co-dependent. 

3.) She prevents me from having a car/using a car. I got my license a LONG time ago, and my driving record is completely clean, however, my Mom refuses to let me drive ANYWHERE without telling her weeks in advance. I can’t drive down the road to get coffee, or drive to the store to go shopping. She makes me stay home all day and wait until she is able to take me. When I question her decision and tell her that I should be able to drive where I want, she says “I paid for this car, so you can’t take it anywhere unless I allow it.” So basically, I got a license for no reason and I am unable to learn how to be independent when running errands. 

4.) She shames me for wearing certain outfits. Yes, I love a scandalous outfit every now and then, but sometimes my Mom will get mad at me for wearing slightly short shorts. She’ll accuse me of going out to impress guys, and and claims that the only reason I want independence is so I can be a “hoe”. This again makes NO SENSE, because I have never been in a relationship before, and have NEVER insinuated that I am a flirty person. It’s like she has this image in her head of who I am, but I have no idea how she got it BECAUSE IT IS NOTHING LIKE ME.

So, those are some things I wanted to get off my chest. Am I overreacting, or is this behavior a little toxic? I’m not sure if her behavior is normal or not because the rest of my friends have absent parents who don’t really bud into their plans, so I have nobody to compare my situation too.",05Jul2020,1

698,"So, for context, I’m a 13 year old boy. My parents are ok most of the time, but lately, I feel like my dad’s been going crazy. He expects so much out of me and whenever I talk to me friends on the phone or ride my bike outside with them, he yells at me and says I’m wasting time. Before the quarantine, he hardly paid me any attention and was satisfied with the fact that I make perfect grades, score extremely well in competitions, and never ask for shit. He got me an iPad almost two years ago and it cost him $400, which is like pocket change for him. He has millions in the bank and owns lots of real estate. And when I mentioned that I needed a laptop for high school, he yelled and said that he bought me an iPad, which was two fucking years ago. This week, I didn’t attend any chess tournaments online because a) I hate chess and b) I FUCKING FORGOT. This morning, he yelled, hit me hard, and pulled my hair. I didn’t do anything, but felt like I should’ve. He’s never laid a finger on me since I was 8, and that was trivial because he slapped me hard enough to hurt, but didn’t go fucking berserk. I feel like I should’ve fought back and let him know that he’s being an ungrateful bastard. I’m taller than him, stronger than him, and more fit, so I could slap him around or at least defend myself. I want to know if I should fight back to show him that he can’t push me around whenever he feels like it. I do everything he fucking asks me to and this is what I get. I’m extremely patient, and I know when I’m getting a bad deal or if someone is bullshitting.

I met someone last year shes 20F she is an amazing person. Everything in my eyes from her is just great, yes I love her. I remember one day I asked her something and her answer wasn’t something I liked but I said everything was okay, I just went home. She messaged me on the drive home saying she’s scared she gonna lose me and that she fucked it all up. I thought it was kinda sweet and cute, and either way if she sent that or not I would’ve stuck around. So we got closer. 

I made mistakes I’m not perfect and I will continue to make them. But I will always try to change and be better mentally and physically for the people I love and care about. I fucked up bad and was selfish without knowing. She pointed it out, this was a long time ago. I felt super bad but she still acted the same way the next day all happy and giddy. But I tried to change I told her I’m sorry. Weirdly enough I hate the word sorry it’s just a word and doesn’t have any meaning I think actions show that your sorry in a way. But I said sorry that day cause I was scared so scared to lose her. 

I’m not scared to lose my friends or whatever seriously but this girl I don’t want to lose her. 
Recently she’s been distant a lot recently she apologized and told me she promises to hang out this current week and we haven’t talked for like a week. She promised me she was gonna hang out this week. She didn’t mention it and I messaged her four seperated times on four days. No reply. She usually replies to me, I was thinking of messaging her asking if everything was okay. But idk if I should at the same time. 
I don’t want to bother her so I don’t want to message her anymore. And these messages weren’t like hey wanna hang out the messages were just asking how her brother party went, and random question we usually ask each other. 
She wanted to make the same schedule for classes for our college so July 14th is when I’m gonna see her again. And July 12th is her birthday I already got her gift. 

I miss her. She told me she feels really bad for being distant but she’s with her family and working a lot, doesn’t have the time, so I don’t want to seem like a bother or try to force anything.

He's always said that its my body so obvi he's got no say in what i do but his preference might not change. He just doesnt see most, especially facial piercings attractive.

702," 

So my girlfriend is second generation Chinese-american and we've been dating for the past 6 months. However, her parents are very keen for her to date within race and want her to date chinese. She and i have great chemistry and we really get along with eachother but she recently has told her mom about us dating and she's was quick to shrug the relationship off and didn't take it seriously at all. The problem is that my ethnicity is Indian but second gen US. Yesterday my girlfriend briefly mentioned me and her mom asked about my race. The moment she told her my face she instantly told her to just be friends with me and to date chinese.

I was thinking of things I can do to help out the situation, I instantly know that her mom has a very stereotypical view of me and although that is very unfair I do accept that it's probably inevitable and that i'd have to meet her in person.

I've been thinking of ways to perhaps land a good interpretation such as learning the culture and manners, mandarin so I can communicate with the family, showing respect as I know the culture is very keen on that and that I can take good care of their daughter and provide financial stability for her and for the family. It seems incredibly hard but i'm quite determined to do it.

Though the reason i'm posting is to figure out if this is a good plan of action or if i'm missing something here. I've asked a few people around and including my girlfriend what I should do to win approval and seem to have reached that. One of my friends recommended me giving her parents a gift when I first meet them but this could go either way in my opinion. I know for a fact that her family gave a lot of shade to my girlfriend's father who is divorced over how he lost his body shape and for his appearance so I imagine i'd be subjected to that in a more intense way.",05Jul2020,1

At the moment I just had lunch and am having a slight stomach ache, and resisting the urge to just dm one of my friends just to say ""bae come over"" just to keep me company until the pain goes away (for reference, I currently live alone in an apartment).

My dad has always been verbally abusive to everyone, especially to his family. He constantly yells, calls people names, aggressive when he talks, just all around negative a lot of the time.

Anyway today was my moms birthday and we were going to the lake and we were pulling out of a gas station and he started yelling at my mom over the fact that she lets someone back out of a parking spot before her. I was like wtf stop yelling it’s not a big deal and then he exploded. He started yelling at me for not respecting him and telling me it’s none of my business.

He starts throwing a tantrum and yells at my mom to take him home Bc now he doesn’t want to go. He tries to yank the keys out of the ignition while she’s driving. He keeps yelling at me calling me disrespectful and all these names and I just can’t put up with it so I stand my ground.

At this point we’re going back and forth, he’s telling me shit like I’m a shithead and I’m in the wrong etc. I just can’t put up with the constant yelling and negativity. He’s been this way since I was a little kid and we’ve been through situations like this a million times. It gets so heated to the point where he’s telling me I bounce around in college too much and need to give up. He is screaming his head off. Then I start attacking him about how he wouldn’t know Bc he never went to college etc.

I don’t respect this man. He never admits wrong doing and deflects blame on anyone else. He’s telling me that I can’t criticize him unless I’m perfect and putting words in my mouth. I never said I don’t have my own problems.

I used to have anger issues and would throw things around my room when I was younger. But I grew up. I changed. He doesn’t change. He never will.
Now my mom is also blaming me for not just letting it go. But I can’t just sit there with him insulting me and yelling the entire time. He gets away with everything he does to us.

We finally get home and he starts trying to tell me that I don’t care about mom to which I say that if he cared he wouldn’t have done all this and just gone on the boat instead of throwing a fit and demanded to be brought home. That’s when he says alright let’s go.

My poor mom is stuck in the car with this and idk what to do. I feel like a piece of shit. My mom started crying Bc and she left alone. I’ve been crying in my room for a half hour.

I just can’t deal with this anymore. It’s everyday. The yelling and screaming and verbal abuse. He has no consequences for his actions. He’s been doing this for 20 plus years. Idk what to do",05Jul2020,15

719,"Sorry for the formatting, I’m on mobile right now.

This year I was in grade 11 and decided to get my shit together, so I studied hard in all my subjects and got good grades, until quarantine happened. 

The switch to online schooling would be hard enough on it’s own, but due to all the schools in my area using the same platform, many people weren’t able to access the app we use for school due to an overwhelming amount of people trying to use it at once. I wasn’t able to use it for a month, from the second week of March to the second week of April. 

When I was able to use it, I was incredibly behind and worked my hardest to catch up until May started, when I closed the app and refused to open it until June. The thought of opening the app gave me so much anxiety I would regularly dry heave at the thought of it, and since I was fasting for a month, I focused my attention on other things.

I’m not going to lie and act like that was the only reason, but other than my anxiety I was also procrastinating and, looking back on it now, I should’ve just sucked it up and started then. 

I only started doing my work the week before it was due in June, and although I finished the majority of my work, I know my averages are gonna drop a lot.

My parents and siblings are saying that I ruined my future and that I closed off a ton of opportunities I would’ve gotten otherwise from doing early applications in America (I’m Canadian). 

I’m still studying for the SAT, but I don’t know when I’ll write it due to Corona, and if my highschool GPA so far screwed me over. I calculated that the lowest my average for this year can be a 75%  which is a B in Canada, but I’m also not sure if they’ll count it as a B in America since I know the grading system is different there. I’m also redoing a course right now in summer school to get a better mark but I’m not sure if that’s gonna change my GPA when I send my transcript over.

So Reddit, did I ruin my future?",05Jul2020,3

722,"Hi guys. So, this thing has been bothering me ever since whether is it just me or can someone relate.

It goes like this. I suffered depression for a huge and delicate part of my life i.e. from 4th to 9th. It hasn’t been easy and I have self-harmed myself a couple of times. It took me long time to get over depression. During this period my grades had dropped down really low. No matter how hard I tried, I just couldn’t get enough marks in my exams. After 9th, I met a few amazing people in my life, including my girlfriend, that made me realize there’s more to life. 

I felt a lot more positive and felt free to express myself. I eventually caught up with my class and almost every time ranked in the top 5 of my class. 

Turns out my mother was never happy. She doesn’t realize how hard I worked for this. She just isn’t happy with my grades. Last year (I’m 15 now) I barely missed the first spot in class by 6 marks and that became a topic for criticism for her. I naturally don’t have a very impressive handwriting. She started criticizing me and told, “Maybe if you had a better handwriting, I wouldn’t have to be embarrassed in front of your class teacher”. On the other hand my teacher was proud of me by the progress I had made.

Every now and then, we keep having class tests and I at least top the class in 2-3 subjects. Still she has to criticize me, “Why didn’t you come first in class?”

Once I ended up coming on the 11th rank in my class and I didn’t get my 2 meals. I never felt appreciated with my mom. 

I just dunno what to do. Any advice would be appreciated.",05Jul2020,1

She luckily has a place in her city where she could stay if they go trough with it, but is not sure how permanent the solution is. Unfortunately she lives a two hour drive from her family so she couldnt just stay with a grandparent or something.

725,"So long story short-
My sister is currently trying to divorce this piece of shit who has napoleon complex. During my sister’s entire pregnancy, he didn’t provide or help out in ANY sort of way. This was all going down during quarantine, and during the peak of covid, he would endlessly try to meet up with her in our home. To add onto his complete disregard for both the mom and baby’s safety, during the birth, he nearly forced his way into the hospital but ultimately could not get in. The restrictions due to covid clearly state that only ONE person can be with the mom. Also, NO other people besides the parents can meet a newborn immediately after, with covid SOCIAL DISTANCING requirements on top of that. The fucker called my sister RIGHT after giving birth and demanded that he and his uncle are coming to our house to see the baby. This caused a severe contraction and she was put on more drugs. Fast forward to today- the baby’s father comes every weekend to watch her for nearly 5 hours each day. 

Today, not even 2 full weeks since the baby’s birth, he is ENDLESSLY demanding to take the newborn to the park. You have to understand how the fuck I’m feeling at this point, right? Oh by the way, he’s a doctor. A doctor who can give fuck all about covid restrictions, trying to take a 1 1/2 week old newborn to a public space. My father is nearly at his tipping point, and obviously I don’t want that to happen. Hurting him ultimately hurts us and my sister’s case more. I’m the youngest in my family, and I feel useless just listening to all the shit that goes on these days. He will never, EVER lose an argument; he doesn’t fucking stop talking. When my sister’s trying to eat, he’ll bring some shit up. She clearly tells him that she is eating and not to talk to her. Due to his stubbornness, I hear this about 5-10 times. I want to yell in his face so fucking bad, but don’t know if that’s the right thing. Feels good to at least type it out, because I haven’t talked to anybody about it this much. Any advice would be great.

726,"TLDR: Ex-BFF who strung me along as her #2 asked me to talk for closure after she blew up at me and I had to block her. My dumbass accepted and I’m very worried. I don’t know what to do.

I had an on-off series of romantic times with my best friend during and after HighSchool. We never actually did anything other than the “oh, I like you. NO I like you! But right now isn’t the right time” bullshit, and I eventually realized I was just being stung along as either a backup or the “always be there under my thumb” guy, so I asked for time away. She blew up at me and called me every name in the book, so I blocked her and moved on. However, whenever I think of her (which I try not to do) I get a feeling of spite. 

This all leads to today, my parents and I took a road trip to visit my grandparents in my hometown (where we both grew up). Trust me, I know it was a bad idea with COVID but I was forced into it. She happens to see my mother in a store, and messaged me on an old number that she had that I didn’t think to block. I thought I would make small talk for the sake of politeness, but I fucked up there. 

She sent me an invitation to come over and talk about everything that’s happened. Maybe have some closure and move on with our lives, and hopefully be friends again.

729,"There has to be a lot of context for anything to make sense so I guess I'll start with my situation. Im 15 and I live with my mom, her sister, my step dad, and my adopted 9 year old sister. I guess I should mention I'm also adopted but it doesnt matter too much. My sister was supposedly abused for the first two years of her life and was taken in by some loose family until she could find a new home. About 4 years ago, we adopted her because I was only child and I wanted a sibling. 

We got in touch with that far family I mentioned and we found out there was a whole group of children that needed to be adopted so, my mom being the way she is, took the one who recieved the most abuse, that being my current sister. I must note that the family who was involved with the adoptive process seemed extremely manipulative with the whole thing and ensured that we got her specifically which leads me to believe that the extent of her abuse was exaggerated, which sounds messed up for me to say but I don't act on that assumption, I just thought it was pertinent. 

But after we got her, she was okay for awhile and went into a couple of fits, which usually involved crying but sometimes they got extremely violent. About a year after we got her we gave her back because we couldn't deal with those fits, they just got too much to deal with every week. We got rid of a lot of her stuff but after a while, about 10 months my mom wanted to give her a second try, and because shes the head of the house no one opposed her. 

We got her to settle in again and the fits weren't as bad or as constant, but she still was snarky and didn't learn what was good or bad despite my moms constant attempts at teaching her. Recently for the past few months, shes been going into those fits again. But shes more manipulative and even more violent, saying things that really shouldn't be said from someone her age. She keeps emotionally, physically, and verbally hurting anyone she can when shes in those fits and it takes its toll on my mom the most. 

My dad cant stand to watch her be hurt by that because my mom is very compassionate and I understand that. My aunt doesn't want her here and neither does my dad, and honestly I dont either, but I know my mom would be devistated if we gave her back. I know my mom and I truly feel like if she cant take care if her, then no one can. That sounds pretty bad but I'm sure everyone feels that way about their mom. My mom is a very soft person and only gets strict whenever my sister acts up, but even then I can hear her voice break because she doesn't like to be harsh. 

What am I supposed to do? I know I can do something to help, I watch my sister during the day and constantly entertain her but it doesn't have any effect because she still acts up. I feel terrible because either way, my moms going to be hurt and I do feel like the right thing is to give her back but even then I'm not sure if thats right. 

Should I encourage her to keep trying? Should I try harder to be nicer to my sister? I don't know if theres any possible positive outcome to this situation. Even if she gets violent, I still care for my sister. Its so frustrating to see her do this and get gerself in these positions, and its even more frustrating to see my mom open up to her right after these tantrums.

On our last phone call, i was basically explaining how i felt, just saying everything that was on my mind and i noticed she was very silent. When i asked her what she was doing she said she was looking at memes. Now back to the current situation, i feel as though she still doesnt care because when i asked her if i never texted her what she wouldve done, she said it is what it is, so even though she said she wanted closure she wouldnt have done anything to achieve it. And when i responded with i want closure, she said she doesnt know how to give it to me. Im sorry this post was so long and thank you if  you read it all, im just confused about the situation and just dont know how to go about it anymore.",05Jul2020,1

739,"I think I am a compulsive liar and I can't stop.

I've literally never told anyone about this. Every time I feel like someone won't like the truth I lie about it. I lie to everyone about everything, even tiny little things that don't matter. I'll just add a little flair to everything I say by twisting the truth a little. I do it almost every single time I speak. I hate that I do it but I can’t seem to stop. 

I lie to my friends and family about my others friends, past experiences, everything you can think of. I don't know what to do and I can't go on much longer.

I don't know if this is some crazy medical condition, whatever it is I just want it to stop. I recently got in DEEP trouble for sneaking out (still a little bit grounded) and I guess I realized that I want to learn to be really forthcoming. I have a friend that is super blunt and I think it is a very admirable quality. 

Next year I plan to attend college and major in biology with a premed focus, and I know that as a doctor, lies can cost people’s lives. I want to kick this bad habit but I can't stop and I don't know what to do.

So I guess my questions are: 

How can I stop lying/the urge to lie? Is there an underlying issue with me I’m not seeing?

741,"Hi! I want to keep this somewhat short and to the point, but I will he happy to answer any additional questions in the comments? 

I am 26M, single living near Jacksonville, FL. I have another 2 years until I earn my Masters. My parents are dead but my grandparents are 86/87 and I would not move anywhere until they are gone as I want to be around to take care of them should it be needed. 

However, once I have my Masters Degree and my grandparents join the flipside, I want to venture out and move to a completely new city and embark on a new adventure. Most of my family is gone and I have some good friends here but I don't want to be the guy who never left his hometown. My life has been pretty boring (not depressing or anything, I am happy but life has just been boring). I want the adventure of going somewhere new, experiencing a new city and establishing myself there. 

I keep looking at condos in random cities and doing research in the cities that I find interesting but since I am several years out from pulling the trigger on this move (and who knows where I will be in life when it gets there?) I would be thrilled to have this community suggest some places worth looking into.

Here is some additional info: 

- I work in governmental operations and would like to stay in a related industry. 

- I have been described as an ""old sould"" and introvert. Clubs and bars and trendy shops are not too important to me despite being 26. However, If I am still single I would like to go somewhere with a lively enough dating scene. 

- Looking for a low or average cost of living place. I have full equity in a 180k condo I would be selling and have decent savings, but I am not looking for a very expensive place. 

- being a floridian, I have never lived in or driven in a snowy/cold place but would be up for any climate. 

- I would want a place that has a more laid back attitude ( I visit family in NYC and could not deal with that pace) while still having convenience nearby.

- I am liking the idea of living in a nice condo right in a city. I feel like that would be really cool but is not a must. 

So far I have looked at Phoenix and Columbus.

But I live here alone, so it would be kind of weird for me to be renting a house for one person and three cats lol.

743,"I (26 M) met this girl (25 F) 1 year back. Both pursuing professional course. 

I initially had crush on her then I confessed then she started developing feelings for me as well. 

Now, at present, she went to her home town because of COVID-19 situation.I guess she started thinking about her future. As it would be easier to get over each other right now than to hold on now and get hurt more in the future. 

We still have this intercaste marriage issue in our country where our parents and grand parents still think it's better to marry within the caste so that our life will be easier in terms of religion, rituals, food habits and all.

But the issue is, I am not certain about the future which makes her more uncertain about it. I think that if I am financially stable then there won't be any issue with this intercaste marriage thing. So, hopefully I can finish this professional course ASAP and start earning. Until then I will be uncertain but I don't want her to feel bad about us being in a relationship right now. 

There is no pressure of marriage for both of us as we both are studying and our respective parents don't know about the other.

TL; DR 

The girl I like is not sure if we will get to marry so she wants to stop talking to me all together but is having hard time doing that.

What should I do? How can I make her understand? Should I leave her so she doesn't have to bear the hurt that she is feeling because of the uncertainty that she facing right now, will it help, I mean in the long run, even if I don't like this option?",05Jul2020,2

I am currently in a college off-campus house in New Jersey with 5 people. Only four of us are ""legal tenants"" on the lease, while I am the 5th tenant and agreed to share one of my friends' rooms until my graduation in January. Last year, I was a legal tenant in the same property and my landlord is holding my $1000 security deposit hostage from that old lease (almost 50 days past due at this point). He seems to have gone MIA during COVID.

I decided that I will be backing out of my living situation and stop paying my roommate half of his rent to live there illegally because I can't stomach the money going to our sketchy landlord who is alive enough to deposit monthly rent checks but not enough to return my calls about the security deposit. How do I go about backing out of this informal illegal tenant situation without burning bridges with all of my roommates? I am not legally liable for anything here as Im not on the lease, but my roommates do not sympathize with my reason for backing out, accusing me of ""screwing them over"" because of the rent I would be offsetting.

751,"Hi all,

This has been worrying me for a while now, and I want to do if I legitimately have a concern or I'm overthinking. I'd really appreciate any insights. Last week my apartment was having a A/C problems in that the ""pan"" (part that contains water build up) was leaking. The management came over (NOT an AC expert) and used Henry's Wet Patch...which is basically asphalt mixture that you would use to patch roofs. It STANK for a day then the smell went away. After, I looked up the health effects of asphalt and as you can guess...its not good. There are definitely carcinogenic compounds. I went so far to look up the MSDS safety form for the product.

I am concerned that since this mixture is right under the AC vent, my cats  and I are going to get low doses of harmful chemicals blowing through my apartment all the time. But maybe since the stuff is dry now, there's no real risk at all?

I'm considering making it an issue and asking management to replace the unit...which would be $$$ for them and cause an argument....but me and my cats health is above all. Do you all think I should be concerned or is this something I should pursue? Below is a link of the patched up A/C unit shortly after the tar was applied.

756,"So I’m going to start by saying I don’t have a lot of friends. Honestly there is probably about 10 people I actually consider friends. This is about one of my friends, we will call her Lore. 

At the beginning of this school year I had a huge crush on her, and basically everyone knew it. We had a couple classes together but in computer tech (it was a pretty hard class, the teacher sucked) I would help her a lot because I was good at it.

About 1/3 of the way through the year I stopped liking her and we became decent friends.

We started basically snapping back and forth, kinda just talking but as friends. We started to become closer friends the first time I helped her study for a biology test. It then became a thing where before every bio test we would FaceTime her and I would go over the chapter. But before a biology test she would talk to me more, the conversations felt more real.

Before Corona came and screwed every up we would also play game pigeon games a lot in class, especially in health which we had together. (Our school is like 90% on IPads so it wasn’t to crazy). And then when Corona canceled school we started talking a lot more during quarantine, and it would basically be me teaching her bio now. 

Then when school got out... the only way I could really get her to have a conversation with me it felt like was to tell her about some drama with another friend (doesn’t live in the States). It just ya...

We’ve hung out before in a group of friends at the beach or someone house. And someone else from the friend group I believe told her that I liked her and now she won’t talk to me.

But this entire thing just feels like I’m fighting to be her friend. But we also are super good friends and I’m just sick of it and I really don’t know what to do anymore.

He is a PhD candidate in computer science. 26yo international student. 6,000 miles from home.  Lived in US about 2 years now.


He doesn’t want to leave the house, ever. I just chalked it up to his research paper due date being last week. But nothing gets him out of the house, even now. I wanted to drive around and see fireworks last night but he wouldn’t go. For my bday he just wanted to cuddle. If we do manage to go out it’s for 15 mins or less. 

I am always outside, running on trails, riding bikes, or taking drives. Nothing risky COVID wise. He hasn’t gone outside with me after the first 3 dates. 

Ive noticed two strange things. He tends to chant before we go outside (he is Buddhist) and he is very secretive about his life. When I ask “why did you get into CS” he won’t even tell me, like he is nervous to say it. 

I can’t tell if he is scared to go outside or depressed. I can’t tell if he is not interested in certain conversations or if he is scared of saying something wrong. 

I’ve never hung out with an introvert who wasn’t OK with going outside when there are no crowds. Also I’ve never dated a person in STEM so I don’t know if this is what the typical  “engineer” type is like lol.

762,"So I have been living with my childhood friend and boyfriend for about 10 months now. She presents as very depressed; Avoids responsibility, can't hold down a job, doesn't pay bills, and hardly cleans after herself... the list is ongoing. She owes lots of money in bills etc...

However, the part I find the most frustrating is the way she comes into the room I share with my boyfriend and takes things such as towels, hairbrushes, phone chargers, deodorant, and beauty products. Things disappear and we ask her where they have gone and she says she doesn't know but always seems suspiciously kinda defensive and nervous when we ask her, which could just be her realizing she has a problem and feeling insecure. We have gone into her room when shes been out and fished out our things that have been stashed away in drawers. My boyfriend found his Bluetooth speaker in there which we had been looking for for months and we had asked her about it a few times and she said she didn't know. She has also taken lots of my underwear and socks and his socks.

She has stolen from another friend of mine who she used to live with. She even told me she found a big bag of her clothes in the cupboard and assumed they were things she didn't want and went through it and helped herself to stuff in there basically. Which I think is weird because it's not up to her to decide if someone's stuff is stuff they want or not. I also actually remember her stealing like two items of clothing from me as a teenager and she stole my mum's ring. I kinda forgot about it though because she's a good friend in other respects. Our mums are friends and her mum told my mum that she stole a lot from her as well and it drove her mad.

So I am wondering if this is part of her depression, maybe she intends to just borrow things and forgets to put them back. However, shes has taken whole packets of my make up wipes and cotton pads into her room and used up the whole packet, I know this as I lose them and just find the empty packet on the floor of her room. Which seems like intentional stealing to me.

I am wondering if this is kleptomania, although she doesn't steal from shops. I have found random things of mine I don't think she would even use in her room like books that I know she would have no interest in. She also has a LOT of stuff, like she is almost hoarding a bit.

I want to say something but anytime I have tried to talk to her about other things she gets very defensive and upset. I know she was getting phone therapy after a bad self-harming incident where she ended up in the hospital, she rejected the phone therapy though because she wanted a face to face one but phone therapy was the only option because of COVID.

After our tenancy is up in a few months my boyfriend and I are moving somewhere without her as I have found it too stressful living with her the past year. I kinda feel like I want to speak to her about getting some psychological help before she tries to flatshare again but I don't know how I would go about it.

Any advice would be much appreciated, even if you know someone with a similar case.",05Jul2020,2

765,"I should preface this by saying that I'm a teenager and I've really only had one serious relationship, with the ex in question. He broke up with me because he felt that dating in high school wasn't what God wanted for him (yes, he is (was?) very religious). We had a really rocky break-up because both of us still wanted to be together, and we went on dates for months while broken up to try and 'make things work.' Most of this was orchestrated by me but I felt it was kind of my job because I hadn't been Christian enough and because he had liked me long before we started dating and therefore was insecure about my feelings for him. I guess I felt showing how much effort I was willing to put in would show him I truly did love him. 
He finally broke it off for good for good when I told him I had gotten drunk for the first time in my life. That was too against what he was comfortable with and he told me I wasn't the person he thought he was. 
We didn't talk much for a long time and I felt as though I was moving on, but he's recently come back into my life and he's very different. He's okay with drinking and much less religious now, though I'm worried he's not being authentic to himself. My feelings for him are still very much there and though I'm not sure if his are, I have a feeling (for example he put his arm around me recently when I was cold, and he's not really a player type so he doesn't take that kind of 'touch' lightly). 
Anyway, since he's changed and the reasons for our break-up don't seem to have much bearing on him anymore, would it be smart to try again?

But i have always noticed that T is quite shy and avoids conflict. He likes to be in his place reading a book or studying. But he has always been a target for bullying as some of the older guys picked on him. R and I tried our best to protect him as he is our best friend after all. But he takes it like if it isn't a big deal. The bullies call him bad names everyday and we tried to stop it by contacting our school stuff but unfortunately they don't do much aside from some occasional scolding.

I have been told by R that he finds T crying sometimes and when he asks him what is going on he always tries to hide it. This makes me really worried, especially when i heard that in the village where he lives there aren't kids with his age so he hangs out with guys who are 18 or older and they also bully and call him names but he keeps hanging out with them because he doesn't want to be alone.

So one of them just sent me a vid of him at a bar, more like a night club I suppose I really don’t know what they’re called, with a lady pole dancing and all these people hooking up on weeds and stuff.

I didn’t go with him or his friend group of course since we don’t have that kind of relationship. We went to college together and often have some League gaming time with each other. So I’m kinda happy he thought about me while he was there.

Which led me to thinking that, am I missing out on life? Am I supposed to get drunk and go to clubs and do drugs (at least once ?) at my age (I’m in my twenties) ? Being introvert as I am I don’t really have a night club friend group to go with. But I have this notion that living is to experience. Am I missing out on too much? Are spending time going to these clubs that much fun ?

Yesterday,me and a group of friends bought alcohol and headed to the beach.The night was great,but I got drunk.As a result,my best friend and my girlfriend had to babysit me for 2 hours as I gradually puked it out.The experience was terrible,it is my first time ever getting drunk

Obviously I felt bad for ""ruining the night"" even though another girl in my group was in a pretty bad state as well,and I acknowledge this is something that happens to basically everyone at one part of their lives

I've learned my fault,I now know my limits.HOWEVER,my girlfriend is having a very difficult time at home because her grandmother is very ill.She came to have fun and forget it all,and had to babysit my drunk ass.

I feel guilt.I know its been tough for her and now she had to bear the burden of my own wrongdoing,in addition to her own problems.I called her up to apologize,she seemed fine,very tired but she told me not to worry about it

782,"I'm an \[18F\]. Today we got important high school results and it turns out that my s/o failed while I didn't. This all goes back to earlier in the year when I was reassuring my s/o that everything was going to be fine I slipped in an assurance of some information about being able to switch subjects. This turned out to be misinformation and it ruined a good chance at getting my s/o's grades back up.

This was the start of the year. After this my s.o still managed to keep going and I tried to be there for in every way. My s/o ended up getting accepted into a good college and things were looking up. Then corona hit and our final exams got cancelled which meant the future was highly dependent on results that were based on submitting school work and not attending exams, which caused a lot of panic. After a lot of thinking I was very certain my s/o would at least pass. But my s/o ended up not passing. If my s/o had been able to switch then it is very likely they would have gotten a high score.

This all wouldn't have happened if I hadn't given misinformation in the first place. At the time it didn't even feel like a big deal because I was trying to make my s/o feel better and I thought my s/o would confirm it with the teachers anyway but my s/o trusted my words and it ended up ruining a good chance at graduating with good grades. All of this could have been prevented if I had only been more careful with my words back then.

It is also important to note that this is especially devastating because my partner has had to go through a lot over the past 10 years and this really turned out to be a disaster. There are a lot of other horrible mistakes I've made that they somehow managed to forgive me for even though usually partners wouldn't(not talking about infidelity, I didn't cheat). They don't wish to speak to me for a while now because they don't want to be around anyone. I may have to wait months before ever speaking to them again. I suppose this is only fair.

I can't stress enough how much I care about my s/o and love them and that I never meant for any of this to happen. I only wanted to help. But it all went wrong. I wish I could go back in time and change all of this. I also can't stress enough the intense impact of this because I cannot give away too many details.

I don't know how to go on from this. I really messed up hard. None of this is an over-exaggeration. Any advice with dealing with intense guilt would be great.",05Jul2020,1
784,"(I apologize in advance for the wall of text. TLDR at end)

 So I(19F) have been friends with S(18F) for 5 years now. We met at a treatment center for eating disorders. S was 12 at the time and I was 14. We continued our friendship post treatment (however she lives about an hour from me so our relationship has been long distance since then; we've only met in person twice over the years). Neither of us stuck to recovery and (common with eating disordered people) we even supported/competed with each other. Both us still struggle between relapse and recovery (she has been more committed to recovery than me, I'll admit) and when relapse happens, we, ""support"" each other, but really it's just another competition. I hate that I do this and I take full responsibility of how wrong it is. 

Anyway, when I was 16 and she was 14, we dated for 6 months (I'd always been attracted to her, but kept the feelings to myself until she said she was attracted to me as well). I broke off the relationship because I felt that it wasn't healthy (both of us were relapsing at the time). We've remained friends since then (but we both still struggled with feelings for a long time). However, I've tried to cut off contact because I know this relationship isn't healthy. During one of these no-contact times, she was sexually assaulted twice in one month by two different males and became pregnant as a result of the second time (she was 16 at this time). I felt terrible and offered to help her financially (she respectfully declined). She decided to keep it and is now the mother of a beautiful baby boy.

 Since then, she has gotten together and broken up with the father of her child/rapist, P (19M) 3 times. He has also cheated on her twice and is verbally abusive as well. I've tried to encourage her to stop seeing him and seek help for her assault but she won't hear of it. She's also gotten kicked out of her parents' house, started doing drugs and relapsed into her eating disorder. However, very recently she has resumed recovery and gained much needed weight, stopped doing drugs and moved back into her parents' house. 

Still, I feel like the only time we ever talk is when she has nobody else or she wants to brag about how sick she is. On the other hand, I am still relapsing and I do drugs recreationally. Not only do I feel this relationship is toxic because I could be detrimental to her recovery, I feel like I'm being used. How do I handle this relationship? Should I even continue it? 

TLDR: I met a girl, we became friends, we dated and broke up, now I feel the relationship has become toxic. What do I do

Plus, she was actually showing interest because she was the one to ask for my snap, and she started.many conversations out of the several ones we had  as well!


 I can confirm she was a real girl and not a pretender because she did show a live pic of hers but one night in the middle of a conversation, she just stopped replying. She was opening my messages but didn't reply, and then I just turned my phone off and went to bed. The next morning I opened my phone back up, turned my mobile data on to see if she replied or not but I didn't get any message.

 HOWEVER, I could see a notification of her typing. The typing lasted long as if she was gonna type a paragraph. So I went online, and then she stopped typing. I was like, ""hey, were you typing something?' after a few minutes of not receiving any message and guess what? She opened that too and didn't reply.

804,"So this is going to be hard for me becase I actually have almost never posted anything online but here it goes.

So there is this girl that moved into my (shared-) flat some time ago and at first everything was ok. She had a boyfriend who was the reason she wanted to move into the country in the first place. From what she told me she had a trobled past being absed by men and growing up without a father. Her familly was also not rich and lived in a rather poor neighborhood so she decided to move from North America to Europe. I myself (also not being native to the contry) come from Eastern Europe and because of that  also face multiple challenges trying to live here. My past with people (and especially women) was also rather unpleasant and has unfortnatelly given me a grim outlook on life and dating. So after some time and a few problems she returned after spending Christmas with her family and I learned her boyfriend had decided to break up with her. She was now stuck living in a foreign country without purpose and was feeling pretty depressed. I being an idiot started feeling bad for her and tried to cheer her up and offered her food and even decided to talk to my boss about hiring her so she could afford the rent. Needless to say things didn't go  so well after that. I started getting feelings for her but from the onset it was clear it wasn't mutual. Still I wasn't that invested so it wasn't that much of a problem. When the trouble really started was when she decided to use online dating as a coping mechanism to forget her ex. She was constantly on her phone texting random dudes (and talking to me about it) and even found one she started sleeping with. She started spending a  lot of her money on going out with him. I was already getting a bad vibe because she was still complaining to me about her ex and how she was so poor and considering my own problems I was really not feeling like being someone's emotional tampon. Fast forward a bit and the talks we had started including the guy she was currently sleeping with. Now things hit a wall when all of us flatmates  started going out and spending time together and I got the obvious impression that she was not really interested in having any type of a friendship ( Not really talking to me unless in a group, not asking much about my life and not responding to messages unless when she was comming home after sex with her fb). I had already written her off as a friend and after having a few arguments over her behaviour we started avoiding each other in awkward silence. Now she was layed off because of corona and at least I thougt we had established that it was for the best that she find a different job. A few days ago I learned that because she couldn't pay her rent or find anything else to work she had texted my boss if she could come again. This is primarelly why I am writing this wall of text. I told her that she should have told me about it and she said it was none of my business. Now considering I am a long term employee at the company and I was the one recomending her to the boss in the first place (and could also ask him to not rehire her), that really struck a nerve. We had an argument and I told her I do not care about her past troubles and that I wasn't going to put up with her shit (not giving a shit about my life) and then have her tell me to just suck it up when she needed money. Unfortunatelly being stuck in a flat with her and people who find her fun to be around leaves me in a very weird situation right now. What are your opinions?

(Edit 1: added more paragraph spaces)

Players in this story:
My mother = M
My father = F
My sister = S
&amp; Me

Backgroud:
My(23F) parents are high school ""sweethearts"". F is also 7 years older than M. They had me when she was 16. Fast forward a few years later, F asked M to marry him. Despite the fact that M worked and looked after me mostly by herself with him hardly contributing to my care, she said yes. M worked and studied while looking after me and ended up with a good degree and a good job as an ""essential worker"" in the healthcare department, she also worked on bettering her qualification and he often got angry at this saying she acts like a ""professor with all her degrees, certificates and diplomas."" M also contributes alot financially to the relationship and everything else, often splurging on gifts for him and us(the children). F has a good job himself, also as an ""essential worker"" just in the correctional facility department, however he doesn't like spending money on anything but himself.

The relationship wasn't that great and I remember multiple times M took me and we moved in with my grandparents when they split temporarily. As I got older I realised this was because F got caught MULTIPLE times cheating and would always play dumb and act like it never happened. For some reason, after he sweet talks M and pretends to be a good husband for a few days, she always forgave him and moved on, then he would start ignoring her, disappearing at night, etc. But she kept quiet and lived with it.

When I was 11 M fell pregnant with S, F did not want the baby and often said ""this is not my child"". M was very depressed during the pregnancy. Towards the end of my high school career, M decided to buy a house but needed F signature and he refused to sign until his own mother gave her approval. Everything went through and we moved into the new house with baby S. Keep in mind, M pays for everything, the bond, utilities and groceries. F lives there too but whenever he is asked to contribute he says he has no money (WHERES IT GOING TO I WONDER?!). A few months later and F is caught cheating AGAIN. At this point I'm so done with this shit cycle and I'm like bruh??? M does nothing, gets sweet talked, forgives him and moves on. Things go back to normal and he pretends to be the good husband.

More Recent events:
I recently got married and moved out. Shortly after, while I'm visiting for the holidays, F gets caught cheating again, M comes to me to clarify she is seeing the messages on his phone correctly because he is accusing her of being a mad woman. I read through messages of him with THE SAME MISTRESS FROM THE LAST TIME and they were reminiscing on their sexual activities and looking forward to their next meet up. Anyways after I confirmed that M did infact see what she thinks she saw. F denies everything infront of me and says we're making up stories and that he is just friends with the mistress. M decides she's had enough and files for divorce. F tries to sweet talk her and it doesn't work this time so he gets upset and refuses to leave the house. Saying they will not get a divorce and he's going to drag the whole thing as long as possible. He does this by deciding to fight for custody of S even tho he didn't even want her to begin with. This will involve social services and according to the advice of my M's lawyer, means the divorce will be drawn out for another few years considering the corona lockdown restrictions.

I have learned that F has started manipulating S(11F) and gaslighting M. Telling S things like M has many men and sleeps around and that shes the reason they are getting a divorce. M keeps quiet because if she speaks up he then accuses her of being mad and imagining his affairs and that he just has friends and shes overthinking everything (despite being caught multiple times by different people, he still denies it). F has also been encouraging bad behaviour from S, for example letting her get away with wrong things and encouraging her to steal, if she ""wants something she should just take it without asking"". So S feels that M is wrong if she disciplines her for doing something wrong. F has also got into the habit of cornering M with S and they both start attacking M about all the ""men"" she has. He does not do this when I am around as he knows I don't keep quiet. They only corner M when I am not there, which happens alot now since I've moved out. F also always tries to be the ""good"" parent to S, never disciplining her and just ignoring M when she brings up something wrong S has done. He has also started telling S that M doesn't love her and she only loves me, and has also told S not to talk to me when I video call them (I live 2 hours away and video call them everyday) because she would be irritating me and M as we don't love her. I always tell both M and S I love them regularly.

I have also come to learn that there have been multiple instances where F has pulled a gun and a knife on M and threatened to kill her. She takes this as a 'joke' and refuses to report it saying he wasnt being serious. Even though she had a breakdown when he held a knife to her neck infront of his friends, they still took it as a joke. (This shocked me as he has never been so openly aggressive except for the time he gave me a blue eye for sneaking out to see my boyfriend, I was 18, but that's another story). I have told M multiple times I am concerned for their safety and to please tell her lawyer about these things but nothing has happened yet. I can't really go and report this as he has friends EVERYWHERE.

F has a good standing in the community and everyone thinks he is the perfect husband. My parents often get compliments about their ""perfect family"" as they pretend to be normal out in public. F often uses his 'status' and how highly people regard him whenever theres any sort of argument with him. His answer for literally everything is that he is ""a highly respected man"" and that we just don't respect him which makes no sense.

Anyways, I'm deeply concerned with M and S mental health as M has contacted me a few times on bad days feeling suicidal and assuring me that she knows I'll take good care of S. And S has also been acting out and has really bad mood swings, she also blatantly lies about everything for NO REASON and gets aggressive when shes called out for lying. M has tried taking S to a psychologist just to talk about her feelings. That didn't work as S just literally lied about everything to the psychologist for no reason????

I would like any advice on how to help my mother and sister deal with my father, I feel alot of stress and weight on my shoulders as I feel like they're in a very toxic environment, with F trying to turn S against M just to spite her because of the divorce.

I also stopped sending posts after a week. I was getting over that slowly started healthy routine focusing on work. After a month (feels like a year) she posted photo and I'm back to square one. 

I just want to get over that feeling every time I see her photo or context, just erase that pain every fucking time I see my friend. I just want her friendship. I am always worried she is upset with me. 

Will this feeling ever go ...",05Jul2020,1
813,"I was taken away from my mom and dad when I was 18months old. I have lived my my dad's mom and step dad ever since and I'm not sure what to do anymore.

It started when I was about 9 when I was first hit. Hard. Across the face. This was because I have had an attitude and struggle to stay calm so I shout a lot (its gotten better over the years). Although since I didn't do anything, just ran to my room and cried, that they knew I wouldn't do anything.

Over the years (I'm now a teenager) it's gotten worse I've had my head slammed against walls, cupboards even the floor. I also get pinned to the floor by my step grandad while he has shouted in my face while I kick and scream trying to get help. Dragged upstairs by my hair and I'm not allowed privacy they will walk in at anytime and I have to scream at them to get out, to which I get in trouble with.

When I get angry I have resulted to be violet (I hate it) so instead of hurting people I'll cut or stab furniture. I feel like I'm going crazy. 

I have told my friends especially a friend that was abused by her parents and she has told me not to run away again (I've ran away twice before) because it'll get worse. I have also told my parents my mom's pissed at my guardians especially my step grandad as in her words 'How dare he lay a hand on my daughter when he isn't even blood'. My dad just says I'm lying.

My mom has now said she is going to talk to her social worker and is going to get a court order to get custody of me. Idk am I in an abusive relationship?

Edit:I'm a 13 female-male person so I would still have to live with them for a while. I'm not allowed to suggest that I want to go talk to someone or they get angry. I'm so sorry for piling my problems onto you. They have also been careful and I've only had bruises a few times but mainly only have red marks for a few hours. I've have also had 2 mental breakdowns 1 in class (the teachers don't know what's going on) and 1 yesterday while with my mum and that's the reason she's doing this",05Jul2020,1
814,"I [20M] have been seeing this girl [20F] for a little over 2 months at this point and things are going great. However, last night she revealed to me that a few days ago she was raped by a guy her roommate brought over. I, never having being put in this situation, didn’t know how to respond besides telling her I’m so sorry that it happened, not to blame herself, and that I’m here for her. It honestly killed me so much when she told me, I’ve never felt such an awful feeling go through my body, and I’ve never felt more helpless, that I couldn’t help her then and that I can’t now either. I want to do whatever I can to show how much I care about her. As fucked up as it is, she said it’s not the first time she’s gone through this, and she seems to be handling it quite well (huge props to her, not sure how that’s even possible) but I want to do absolutely anything I can to help. I was thinking about buying some flowers and a card to write some nice stuff on, but I’m more than open to any ideas that you guys think will work. If you guys think gifts are not the way to go, definitely don’t hesitate to let me know either, I’m willing to do anything.",05Jul2020,1
815,"I'm attending pre med school this autumn and I'm stuck between choosing a Macbook and a Surface pro for studies. If I were to choose a Macbook I would go for the Macbook pro 13 inch 2020 model and if I would go for the Surface pro I would go for the Surface pro 7. The reason why I would want a Surface pro is because it has a touchscreen and pen feature, but I'm not sure drawing/writing is that important when studying medicine. I know that Macbooks are good for studies in general, but they don't have a touchscreen.  So my question is this: are touchscreens useful in medical studies?

816,"I'm (22) a pretty lonely person. But about half a year ago I made a good friend. The only problem is that we had very little time together because they had to go back to their home country (which is about as far away from here as possible). Our friendship grew mostly online. We called once or twice but I hate calling to be honest and didn't do it much. We obviously had feeling for each other and admitted this even, but also obviously they couldn't lead anywhere for the foreseeable future. Not a problem, we were still really close and shared most of our lives with each other just for the fun of talking. 

But I've been struggling with it as well. All of my feelings towards ethics person were intense. It was very new to have a crush, a friend, a close friend, someone who'd listen to me and be there if I needed someone. All of it was very new and my stupid ass can't really deal with it easily. And honestly there were also some things that they had done were genuinely bothering me. And obviously this all played out during the pandemic so we had a lot of time on our hands to talk, and also a strong urge to do so because we weren't seeing many people in real life.

For a week now I've had summer break. My life has gotten a lot less eventful. I'm also starting to enjoy things less and less because idk, they don't feel very rewarding anymore... I've got less and less to talk about and less and less interest in their life or really any person's life. Maybe some temporary depression is kicking in but idk. 

The problem this creates is that I don't feel such an urge to talk to my best friend anymore. On top of that I was reading some reddit posts about getting too close too quickly in friendships (which definitely happened in our case) and I read a line here and there about long distance friendships or having feelings in friendships and how it's all pretty grim... I've stopped wanting to share, ask questions, I'm basically retreating back into my shell which this friend helped me get out of. Not only does it feel bad for me, it also feels bad towards them because I feel like I've stopped caring... Or did I ever really care at all? On one hand I'm kind of glad they're not on my mind 24/7 anymore but on the other hand, now I feel cold and distant and isolated...

I don't really know what I'm asking advice on... Maybe it's about how I should go on in this, if I should be worried about myself for this, if this means our friendship is over forever... I just don't know and I only care about it because I feel like I have to, not because I feel it from within...",05Jul2020,1

818,"hello. so recently i told my mom i want to start fasting ( no eating only drinking a lot of water ) since i don’t like my body shape and want to lose weight. she was fine with it, fully supportive. but my sister texted me if i wanted her food and at that time she didn’t know i want to go on a diet so i told her no thanks i’m trying to go on a diet and your not helping by asking me if i want food. she made me go downstairs and then said i don’t need to fast, that i had an hourglass shape and i was good the way i was. i told her that i don’t like myself right now and i want to change for the better. she then told me that the body shape i want to have, isn’t going to happen through fasting ( i want to fast anyway and she doesn’t even know the body shape i want, she just assumed. ). i went upstairs after she made me eat her food and told her that i’ll just start fasting tomorrow since she made me eat her food. she told me that she doesn’t like me not eating and said “i only eat when you eat” and “ if your not going to eat than i’m not as well.” and now i’m scared to fast because she’s not the happiest and i hate when she doesn’t eat because she forces herself to not eat and when she’s hungry she just sleeps which isn’t good at all since her sleeping schedule is fucked up and sleeping when your hungry is fucking it up more. plus she always tells me that she is always thinking about wanting to die and a while ago she told me that her life depends on me so i’ve always been protective of her. so, i want to fast so i can become healthier and better about myself but my sister isn’t going to be eating when i am on the diet ( she doesn’t drink a lot of water i usually make her drink. ) i don’t know what to do.",05Jul2020,1
819,"I (25M) am a young professional from Boston area who has moved back to his parents’ house during covid.  I’ve always wanted to adventure and live somewhere warmer than MA for a period of time and this seems like the best opportunity yet timing wise with covid and the fact my work’s office is closed probably into the winter or beyond.  I don’t mind being alone and will look to either sublet a month or two with one roommate or just rent an Airbnb myself monthly depending on the city/options.  

As stated in the title, golf and fitness are of paramount importance to me, but a younger crowd in the area would be of secondary importance as well (I’m an introvert but force myself out of my shell here and there - don’t mind being alone/independent).  I make decent money for my age I think ($85k) and am now debt free and investing, so financially I have few limitations on reasonably affordable places (I had previously been paying downtown prices in Boston, so I think that’s pretty expensive relative to other places).

Ideas I had initially were Florida or Arizona but those seem to be slammed by covid.  (South)West is more and more appealing just b/c of the dry heat (I love the heat and thrive in it) and the time difference would allow me to get out of work early afternoon and have time to my golf, workout, and anything else of interest/hobbies.

820,"Lately, my dad has been acting differently.
He's gone back to drinking,
He and my mom get into a lot of arguments,
He's booked an appointment for a $500 tattoo with money we barely even have  (his first btw),
He's bought another car (we had 4 already),
He's secretly talking to women (I found out 2 days ago).

I feel terrible, I don't know how terrible what he is feeling must feel but seeing it all laid out hurts so much. 
I didn't realize it at first until literally this moment and I have no idea what to do, I just straight up asked him if he was having a midlife crisis when he told me about the appointment for the tattoo and he laughed it off. He's only 45, so young. I'm about to be 20, so I came into his life when he was pretty young. I wonder if he's just trying to live what he missed out on, I'm truly trying to understand but I can't keep doing this and watching him make these bad choices. 
(Tattoo isn't a bad choice, lacking money to do so is though)

Anyways, are there any other dad's here who went through their own midlife thing? What happened to you, did you get help? What did you wish you were told?  How can I help him?

822,"For privacy reasons I'm not going to say when or where he is deployed. All I am going to say is that he is suffering from mental health issues.

My fiance(24) left for deployment a while back. He has depression after the death of his mother and doesn't know how to cope with it. He's the type where he doesn't want to burden others with his problems so it takes a lot for him to open up to other people, including therapists. His family dealt with alot of substance abuse and can't stand the idea of taking prescriptions for his depression. He is really stubborn about this. 

He cries every night due to flashbacks and reminiscing the past. He has lots of ghosts and regrets. And he doesnt know how to forgive himself or let them go.

You see, hes had history of being unable to hold down a job. This caused him to lose his sense of self worth and masculinity as I had to be the bread winner and support us both. I've always been very supportive in his mental health. Being patient with him and comforting him when he has a depressive episode. He took on the deployment to finally be able to make enough money to take care of me. I wouldn't have to pay for rent. We could finally start saving money after living pay check to paycheck and having no money left over to even enjoy a simple snack at the grocery store. He left to serve his country just so I wouldn't have to struggle anymore. 

The military is now catching on to his depression. He's seen the therapist and Chaplin a few times but the fix has only been temporary. Now they are going to do a health exam and he doesn't know if he should lie about his depression and risk getting caught and getting into huge trouble. Or if he should be honest but get sent home and not be able to make money to take care of us. Luckily, we have no kids. 

If he does decide to lie, he's still going to suffer from depression and risk getting caught. 

But if he tells the truth, he will be sent home. 

I just know that if he does decide to get sent home, he will hold this against himself for a long time. He would feel like even more of a failure. 

I want to support him in his mental health. And I would understand and continue to fully support us both if he does come back. But he's also made so much personal and financial growth in this deployment that I also don't want him to have done it for nothing. He wants to stay. But also might need to leave. 

He is so torn on this. And I apologize if some things don't make sense or because of my grammar, I am typing quickly so that I can get some insight as soon as possible. 

Thank you!",05Jul2020,1
824,"This is long but it will paint a picture for what we’re dealing with. People involved. Me (21F), my mum (40sF), and my stepdad (50sM).

So over the last month and a half the news and social media had things related to Black Lives Matter and Pride Month. We live in the UK, so the BLM movement wasn’t as strong but there were still some peaceful protests and stuff. Now I support BLM and the LGBTQ+ community, so I’ve been sharing things on Twitter and other social media platforms. I have however stayed away from the topic when it came to my parents. 

Until a few weeks ago. My parents were having a conversation about the BLM movement and how “those *awful word* are asking for too much”. I was sick of hearing them be racist and told them that they need to peacefully protest because they are being mistreated by the people who are meant to protect them (I wanted to approach from an educational standpoint first). Their excuse was that they had it worse sixty years ago and that they should be lucky. We went back and forward with me educating and them being racist until my mum told me to stop. I was annoyed because I never thought my parents were like that and went to my room.

The next day I was in the living room with my stepdad and the news showed a protest. He was set off again and basically went on about the stuff he said yesterday, except without my mum there to mediate the debate. At that point I was pissed and we were both arguing for half an hour. Not shouting, but it was a heated debate. He ended it by saying that I’m brainwashed by the media and I should know better because I’m a qualified journalist. Then said “guess I’m not gonna get you to change your mind” and I said “I’ll just leave you with your opinion and I’ll stick to mine”. My mum got home and we dropped it.

Then a week ago something came up. My stepdad was joking about something being gay (can’t remember what) and I said that there’s nothing wrong with that. He went on to say that “it’s Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve” and that annoyed me (he’s not even Christian or heavily follows that stuff). I followed it with “So your basing your opinion on a book about an invisible man that probably doesn’t exist?” My mum (who’s homophobic but isn’t as vocal) told me to stop again and that was that.

Since then my stepdad haven’t been talking to me the same way we used to. We used to casually get along as we had the same thoughts on stuff in the home. Now I’m lucky to get one word answers when I saw hello. What can I do about the situation?",05Jul2020,3
825,"How do I pick up and move somewhere when I am starting from step 0 - no money, no car that is legally mine, no place to go, no material posessions worth any significant value aside from my books and other things that fill my bedroom, no family on the other side of the country or state or world to go to.

I have wanted to move away for a while but have always been so daunted by the idea of actuallly achieving this because there are so many steps in the way - steps I can’t even identify. 

I feel like if people who have done this before were to give me a step by step guide, how much they saved before they felt comfortable leaving, etc etc, and had step by step goals to get through it would feel a lot more manageable. 

And before anyone gets into the you need to be in good company with yourself or else you will just bring your problems with you talk - i am actively working on these problems, therapy and the works. 

But i think it would be very good for me to move. I am born and raised in New York and feeling stagnant and stuck here. I think a change of scenery and being in nature would be good for me.

I appreciate any and all advice! 

(Also if anyone has suggestions of where to go ill take them! I am a very friendly person and would love a place where I can feel a sense of community. But I am also gay and unfortunately that plays a part - wanting to feel safe and like I can find a queer community there is also important to me).",05Jul2020,1
827,"Hey guys, long time lurker, first time poster here. English is not my first language so please don´t get upset over grammar/ spelling errors.

I´m in a kind of difficult situation.

So my bf (22) and I(21) have been quarantining together from March until end of June (In a relationship for about a year now). Now because of exams I had to go back home (approximately 300 km away). My exams last until end of July whilst his only start at the end of July. Now I´m quite bad at being apart for so long, but I feel like one and a half months is quite a long time to be apart. So I asked him whether is was okay, if he took the time he has now to study up for his exams and I could go back to his place after my exams are done. Initially we said we´d wait and discuss this again mid July. Yesterday he texted me to tell me that beginning of August would work out for him, if I could give him like 8 hrs per day to do his stuff – which I´m completely fine with and offered even before he brought it up.

Later that day I wanted to book a train ticket to get it as cheap as possible and when we approached the subject he firstly said he is torn because he enjoys his time without me lots, but he also likes me. Which kinda hurt me a lot, because in previous fights he sometimes made me feel very unwelcomed in his home. Then he asked if I could look up the train prices for a week later which only fueled my disappointment. I replied he should just pick a date and I´d get a ticket, because this was very upsetting to me, but I didn´t want to make a big fuss, because he has exams and I wanted to support him even though I think it was a really long time (first time in a year we wouldn´t see each other for this long). His answer was, that I shouldn´t make him choose on his own, because he wanted my opinion on the subject (which I told him before, that I wanted to meet as soon as possible). Having three exams the upcoming week I told him, this was exhausting me and I needed the energy to study for those exams and hung up the phone.

Later that day I wrote him to have fun when going to his friend’s house and he asked if I actually meant it of if it was sarcasm. To which I replied, that I was in fact wishing him fun, but he really upset me before. He replied that, I could come a day later than I wanted to come if I feel like it and to not feel like I pushed him towards this decision and that he felt not comfortable with me not want to make a decision and that he felt upset and mad, because he could only choose wrong (kinda right because at this point I felt like every option sucked, going early sucked because he didn´t really want is and going later sucked because well it´s a long time). So I told him exactly this and said I´d rather not choose than feel bad about my choice, because it would ultimately hurt me either way. He answered that just because people have differing opinions one doesn´t necessarily need to be wrong and if he wouldn´t make a choice no one would in general (not true). And if he´d just make decisions I´d complain after a few weeks because I had no voice. I told him not to generalize everything just because of this one incident and that now I feel like no option is okay because of him and that I felt like doing everything wrong. To which he replied I made his life quite hard and that he wasn´t generalizing, but rather that he worried about it coming to this. When I replied that I felt like I was a disturbance when coming earlier and that I wouldn´t want to impose myself on him and so this was not a regular thing, he told me he was at his friend house. About 6 and ½ hours later he wrote me he was home and I just said ok, quite mad at this point, because not only did he push the topic on me when I told him I needed to stuy, but then in the middle of it he basically left me to have fun with his friends and made me feel quite unimportant to him.

So today in the noon he sent me a long text telling me how I was wrong for taking me insecurities out on him yesterday and normally he´d try to help me but yesterday I twisted his words into thinking my opinion was wrong. Yesterday I supposedly told him I was insecure (never happened never even used the word insecure once until this message) and that was why I didn´t want to decide, not only that but I didn´t even wanted to have an opinion to which I apparently “confessed” by chat. (I actually only wanted to not decide my opinion thought this was that I wanted to meet up as soon as possible). Afterwards I “shut down” in his words and told him to decide and that the situation sucked so he had three options left. 1. Not deciding like me, which wouldn´t help anyone. 2. Making a decision in my favor and having to calm me down, because I´d feel like I pushed him to make that choice and 3. Making the choice in his favor and having to hear from me he wouldn´t care about me (also not true, happened before and yes I was sad but it was okay in the end). So he could only make a wrong choice here. In the end he repeated that he knew I was insecure, but it was not okay to make him feel bad because of it.

I replied that I was not insecure, he told me that coming earlier was not really what he wanted and made me feel really bad about want it, so I chose to not make a decision and because I really didn´t have time to deal with this. Furthermore he just up and left me in the middle of the conversation to have fun with his friend and that I was upset over this.

He replied that he didn´t want to make me feel bad about coming earlier and didn´t even know how I got that feeling and once I´m feeling like this he couldn´t do anything to change my mind. I didn´t have to take my mood out on him. I reportedly told him I was insecure yesterday and was scared of pressuring him and he was mad because when I realized that being apart for a few more days (a week) I showed him that I didn´t like it and that it was really unnecessary. When he came home he saw, that I had a friend over and we drank some alcohol and because I posted this on WhatsApp storys he thought I wanted to be left alone, because I know he doesn´t like it when I drink when we fight (worth mentioning I had this friend over to cheer me up and like 3-4 hours later than when he left me alone). At the end he told me he didn´t engage any kind of conversation before going to his friends´.

My reply was that in telling me he wanted more alone time even after being apart for more than a month or that it didn´t even seemed to bother him to postpone the meetup even more, he made me feel unwanted and unloved and that his messaged made me feel like I´m behaving unacceptably and “take my insecurities out on him”. I asked what I took out on him except not wanting to make a choice. And yes I had some alcohol yesterday, but only because he already ruined this day to study, because I couldn’t concentrate anymore and I wanted to have some fun too after he left me sitting there. I told him the storys I posted weren´t meant for him but rather taking funny pictures with friends.

His reply was that he enjoyed being with me but also need his alone time and he doesn´t have a “free week” after his exams like me (also not really true the original idea was to come to him 3days after my last exam), instead he tries to find some alone time whilst already studying for his exams. I always offered him some time for himself when I was there and he didn´t even demand some alone time outside his exams and he just asked how one more week would sound to me (also not true, he just asked train ticket prices for a week later). I can´t tell him to take some alone time and when he wants some time for himself to make such a big fuss about it and he didn´t even aks me for alone time, because I could come before his last exam. I apparently was rude to him to make this decision alone and he didn´t even stopped the conversation, because I did that on the phone (before the whole texting). I also knew in advance, that he wanted to visit his friend and he couldn´t know I wanted to talk about it. And as I never post WhatsApp storys it naturally was intended for him to see (not true I mostly post on Instagram but sometimes on WhatsApp too.

Then I asked if he seriously thought that he wouldn´t find any time for himself in the 5-6 Weeks we wouldn´t see each other and that it seemed like bullshit to me, because he had this whole month without exams and that his whole message sounded to me like he would like to postpone the meeting even more. My offer for him to have some alone time also was for the time we were being together in a room 24/7 and not after weeks of not seeing each other and I wouldn´t be happy not seeing my bf for such a long time and if we applied this to a year I´d be more single than in a relationship. I also asked why he never took me up on my offer when I was with him and now he makes me feel bad for this. If that was really what he wanted than I´d rather be friends with benefits with him and look for someone who wanted me by his/her side as much as I wanted them. I believe he could have alone time if he wanted to because it´s not like he´s studying all day now, he´s just have to watch a little less youtube (to be fair he isn´t laying around all day but sometime 3-4 hours at a time). I asked him if he felt like this made me feel good about coming to visit him at all and that he made me feel like I was unreasonable and that my feeling of not being wanted was just made up in my mind. I felt like it was not at all okay to just leave me hanging when at his friends´ and that I didn´t even know what time it was.

He only wrote he could fool himself if he wanted to and that he couldn´t help me and I better start studying before I blame him for failing my exams too,

To which I replied he didn´t want to help me and if he really thought I would be calm enough to study.

At the end he told me it was another sunny Sunday where you could choose to be productive and enjoy the sun or spent his time on something unnecessary, because I was starting to be unreasonable, when he asked what the train tickets a week later would be.

I replied out of anger then go look for someone else. An hour later I wrote: After you didn´t want to say anything for the last hour or try to mend things I can´t afford to “sacrifice” this much time and energy anymore. It´s been over 24 hrs since I could actually concentrate on my studies and if he wanted to apologize he could do that, otherwise I wouldn´t care until my exams are over. This he read and was online multiple times since then, but didn´t reply anything.

Tl;dr: My boyfriend and I had a massive fight in which he made me feel unlove, unwanted and unreasonable multiple times. When told about this he denied making me feel bad or didn´t understand why I felt bad.

I´m thinking about wanting a break because this is really getting to me and I can´t  afford to fail my exams over this. Am I the asshole? What would you guys do, please help?",05Jul2020,1

Hi redditors. I am just gonba cut right to the chase. In September 2019 my then girlfriend broke up with me. I guess i should have seen it coming. She was less interested in me and always wanted to go sleep alone, but she always just said it was because she was tired. Her reasoning behing the break up was just that she didn’t love me anymore, but she frenquently talked about missing the tingling sensation of having sex with someone new and that she like the idea of ons.. 

Since then i have been stuggling with nightmares, depression and panic attacks. It took 4 months for the mayority of this to stop but they tend to happen now and then. I am now having a lot of trust issues and just recently i realized that the reason i look so down on ons is because of her, before i just didn’t care. 

So what should i do now? I tried deleting my social media just now over the weekend to isolate myself from everyone talking about sex, but its just lonely. What should i do? Should i go to therapy to start trusting girls again? Should i just let it heal?

834,"So long story short - 
My dad and step mom are visiting from Texas. They do every year for a week during July 4th. They always stay on an island that is 3 hours away from me, I’ve always gone to stay with them for the whole week. Even if it required me taking time off from work. (I’ve been a SAHM since May 2019) it’s not an easy trip bc I have to pack so much, especially for the kids and the ferry/traffic. But I don’t mind too much bc it’s like a mini vacation for me, plus I get to see most of my family. 
Side note- they have NEVER come to where I live to just to visit me, even after my son was born and I told them they should come. They always fly in to go stay on the island; and expect me to come to them. 
Anyways - they decided to come this year, even with the pandemic going on. When they told me they were coming, I asked them to think about staying closer to me so I don’t have to stay overnight bc I’m not comfortable with close contact. They’re response “we will see how it goes” 
Basically, they kept to their original plan and went to the island. Of course, they have been pressuring me to come stay with them even tho I have voiced how I feel about it. And my dad repeatedly saying, “just admit you don’t want to see us, I don’t know why you’re using social distancing as an excuse.” And now I’m just offended that he keeps saying that to me, and making me feel bad about my decision to social distance. 
I thought my dad and I had a really great relationship. I thought he respected me as a person and an adult, and wouldn’t put me in a situation like this. 
But does anyone have any advice or opinions? I don’t think I’m in the wrong, but I’m not sure how to handle my dad.",05Jul2020,1
835,"Hi 34 yo successful lesbian Latina here, stuck on my lesbian best friend for over a year now.

We’ve been friends for a while now and last year we decided to start dating, we had an amazing time. Then she decided she needed space to process both her divorce and her recent breakup. She has been very busy with her masters program and I didn’t get to see or spend much time with her.
Its been 10 months now and though she finished school and we have been spending a lot of time together, as friends, I’m starting to question if we will ever date again.

838,"I'm having a moment of panic. I made this account because I'm shaking and need help but I'm very alone in this situation as to only one other person knows and we dont talk anymore. 

 How do I stop feeling gross and like it was my fault.. I was molested growing up. My story might have repeated for years but i dont know if they're as similar.
 
Back story: 
I was 5 when it started and my mom started dating this new guy who immediately was moved in and became part of the family. He did what most monsters do and he started with giving me extra snacks, letting me stay up late, or allowing me to play video games. My mother was smitten by him and to the naked eye they looked good together. Normal..  When he decided to be bolder he gave me lay down hugs and wrestle fights. Then it turned into him doing things. Coming into my room to say ""goodnight""...and staying.. Years past in silence because I thought it was normal. Until I went to a friends house and their father came to say goodnight. I stayed silent and started thinking why is everything so different? I wanted to ask but it was my first sleep over and I was 10 so idk. At 12 I recieved an IPod and could go on the internet for the first time. I started searching and searching only to find I was being abused and didnt even know.. overwhelmed with disgust and frustration I ran to my mother. She was with my aunt and I broke down telling them. I was not ready for their answer. They called me a liar and eventually told me I was the one instigating it. That I wanted it. I continued to suffer in silence anytime I was around him. Knowing he knew he could get away with it and I no place to run. Ever since then I believed it that I was a disgusting whore child leading on a grown man for my own gain.. 

Also my mother was abused as well this is the only reason I dont hold her entirely accountable. I believe years of rape and conditioning can do this to people. I however didnt know until one drunken night she doesn't really remember. 

I'm shaking because they moved downstairs in my apartment complex without saying anything. My mom invites me over now that they're all moved in, and I go because it's my mom and we're getting older with less time on this earth. He isn't just a child predator he just is a monster because even as a grown women he still does the small queues like holding my hip randomly , placing his hands on my shoulders for long times randomly, trying to give me extra things, or looking at me like I was prey. His eyes make me feel disgusting. I want it to stop.. I feel like I'm drowning. When he gives me things he makes me feel like I owe him something more. Hes ruined me to a point I dont accept anything from anyone in fear of what I owe. He sexualized debt with interest.. 

HOW DO I MAKE IT STOP ?! This is serious question because I cant handle this overload of emotions and memories. I feel like puking.",05Jul2020,26

 Things like I have a very short attention span, I have a very hard time socializing with other people for no apparent reason. I have small outbursts of going manic and turning situations into way bigger things than they are before I start crying my eyes about over said situation.

844,"Hello! First of all I’d like to apologize for any mistakes since English is my second language. However I’m desperate for any advice I could get. 
I’ve been friends with this girl for a few years. She is very sweet, but just as toxic. Whenever we have an argument or any minor inconvenience happening she’d blame me, take my words and turn them against me (even tho it never makes sense). After a while she “apologizes” aka tell me how bad I made her feel, mention that she was on her period, had a bad day ect. She is draining me mentally. She is also extremely competitive so when I get a compliment from a stranger or someone comes to me and asks for my number she almost gets offended and says something like “oh that’s because you are prettier than me” or “i wish people would come to me as well”, anything between those lines although she is very attractive and does get complimented as well. On the other hand she does have mental health issues which she uses against me. I do understand that it is hard for her and I’m trying to be there for her but at some point it felt like I’m giving away my own happiness in order to be there for her. She has also overstepped my boundaries on a few occasions, but what worries me is that she has grown to adopt my behavior and copy a lot of the things I do. If I do my makeup a certain way she’d do the same thing. Whenever I get a new hobby she would start doing it to, but try and do it better therefore turn it into a competition which just ruins it for me. Her major mood swings and opinion changes do sometimes make me nervous. I really don’t want to be a part of this “friendship anymore”.
I will see her for another 2 years, because she has the same major as I do, which is a reason I do not want any drama or anything like that. I also don’t want to leave her alone in her situation, but I really can’t take this anymore. So if you have any advice for me I’d be more than grateful. Thank you for reading this :)",05Jul2020,1

I'm the ""only child"", parents were divorcing for 3 years and decided to get back to biological mom when I was around 13. Dad had already gotten the other woman pregnant at this point, and this woman was an angel to me compared to the cruelty of my mother. But idiot dad decided to return,

I'd really like at least say hi to my sister, but I know she might not like that and complain to her mom. We hanged around 10 times just me and dad after her school and my workday. I feel very ashamed, you know a kid that don't understand much and we're at a restaurant and I can't even eat because I'm thrashed in the table, staying asleep, drinking ""hidden liquor"" etc, I was drugged the whole time because I couldn't comprehend or accept I have a genuine sibling.

As stupid as it sounds, every single time that I wake up in the morning I feel so upset that I survived the night. I want nothing more right now than to be able to sleep and just never have to wake up or have priorities ever again, but I don’t even know why this is happening to me. 

I no longer enjoy the things I used to. There’s a show I’m watching right now that I love and can’t wait to finish, but I don’t have the energy to pick up my phone to watch it so that I can get a good laugh in for the day. I want to learn how to draw or refresh my language skills, but I can’t bring myself to do any of it. I’m not allowed to go outside and get fresh air after I was caught trying to run away, so I’m stuck inside all day staring at the four walls or the insides of my eyelids. I notice these feelings in myself, but it takes energy out of me to even look in the mirror and smile. I try so hard, but I just can’t seem to do it anymore.

My mind will never just shut up and let me have a moment of peace. My back always hurts. When I try to get up and exercise or stretch to wake myself up I’m too exhausted to do it, so I sit back down. It’s agonizing, so I just sleep to avoid it all. I can’t bring myself to do absolutely anything anymore and it’s ruining my life. I want to have energy and I want to feel alive again, but I just feel like a walking corpse that’ll meet their dead soon enough.

Maybe it’s depression, but I’m not allowed to go to therapy.

Maybe it’s my weight, but I’m not allowed to eat healthily.

857,"While it's not really making me crazy, as in, toxic, terrible family, I feel the following thing: the more other people control my life, the less control I feel over it and it wrecks everything.

Why?

First because we're now living at a vacation house for the summer. (I know it's privilege, I'm sorry) My grandma comes live with us too. 

While at our normal house I can retreat in my bedroom after dinner and wind down in peace until I go to sleep at a reasonable hour, here we have less rooms so we just spend the time together. 

If I go to sleep early and wake up early I will meet my grandma in the morning. If I stay up later than my sibling, (who goes to sleep late enough), my mood exponentially drops starting from midnight and ending late late late. (Like, I start being sad with virtually any of my worries and kind of depressed) (interestingly, it's also probably the only time of the day that I have to cry because it's the only time that I have for myself)

I've been trying to finish school (a thesis) and the less control I have the more background or frontground anxiety I have, worries, like thought like is someone entering the room, I'm hungry but we only have lunch later because we only have it together, or I want to cook my own meal or cook for everyone but my grandma is watching every step, making comments, giving help. Or I take a shower and get lots of comments about my hair, which they know very well I don't like.

One of the things that I found recently that helps me get out of my head is baking/cooking recipes, but only if I can do it on my own. There's really no way to do it here.

I feel stuck; I feel stuck and like I'm losing control. Last year was the worst year of my life, and the summer likewise. I had been sort of finding things a bit better but now that I'm here... it's not like everything is terribly terrible again, but it's like the control is slipping away a lot.

I want to keep working so I can finish school. I want to take control of my life, but all of this messes with my head.

**How do I recover a feeling of control over my life, when everything is changing it? No time for myself, mealtimes are ruled by someone else, when I work well only when I feel I am alone** (like everyone is sleeping or outside, and they won't just wake up the moment I get up, like my mom does - but now she's working so she mostly doesn't affect my daily schedule) ** How do I find time for myself when my grandma is up in the morning and my brother at night?

858,"Hi redditors,

Every day I try my best in task-management, having journals for food, planning and other daily activities. 

I end up with more tasks and less done every single day. The constant administration of my system takes time, too.

This is very depressing and I feel overwhelmed and stupid.

Most of my 'free' time on week-ends or evenings gets wasted on 'friends' and 'family', who need me 'really quick'. If I don't do it or don't meet them, I'm pretty lonely most of the time. Also from family side, I get huge amounts of harrassement in the form of semi-public humiliation, direct threats or indirect offenses behind my back.

Really enjoyable, as I never am able to do my stuff at all. My life is a big mess and I'd like to live clean and healthy. I must come over like a complete wreck though. Of course, I also cannot tell anyone anything bad - or else I'd be the bad one.

I do not sweat much and I keep my armpits shaved. I've tried several different deodorants, including Old Spice and prescription strength and I still notice I have almost like a weed scent in my underarms in the middle of the day which deodorants don't mask well.

860,"Last night was the 4th, obviously, and I had to work... but my best friend went out and was drinking and shit and she's usually pretty good at making sure I know she's safe bc we both worry about each other. Well, last night I suddenly stopped hearing from her and I decided to wait it out for over an hour and not bug her bc I didn't wanna seem annoying or anything but I got really worried so I texted my other friend to see what to do... 

my other friend told me to just text her to ease my mind and just said she could have forgotten bc she had been drinking and all. As I was about to text her, she texted me and I guess she'd been off with her FWB and HIS best friend was in the literal same position as me thinking the worst and she texted me as if nothing happened and I basically was like ""bruh I thought u died""... and I've never actually met this guy before but I guess he had her phone and he FACETIME me off her phone at like 1AM just drunken talking to me about what they were doing and I was like uhhhh wtf... and basically I was like ok glad you're safe let me know when you get to wherever you're gonna be for the night which she did... 

and idk I guess I'm still kinda upset about it bc I was gonna wait to see if she'd say anything about to me today and maybe apologize or something, but she just texted me as if nothing happened again so I'm not sure if I'm in the wrong to be upset about this? I'm typically a pretty laid-back person but I do overthink and worry and she and I are super close so I'm just a little hurt my feelings weren't really being considered as much in my opinion so I just wanted to get some unbiased input about it just to see if I should just let myself cool off for a bit until I'm ""over it"" or if I should wait until she gets the idea? 

My other friend I talked to agreed that she should've at least said what was up just so I didn't worry about not hearing from her in a bit so I just don't wanna hold a little grudge if it's not necessary. To me, if you have to tell someone you're upset about something bc they assume you're not that's kinda counterproductive bc I feel it goes to show how much they actually consider how you may feel. 


but yeah I understand I could be overracting and all but there is a lot going on in my personal life right now that she is more than aware of it all so I am a little sensitive right now and she knows that. so I'm self aware enough to question if I'm overreacting but I'm just not sure if what I'm feeling is valid and if I should just get over it and let it go.

861,"So, my cousin, we'll call her Dee, is an addict and has been for \~25 years. 

She'll be 41 in a few weeks. Every time anyone tries to help her (give her money, buy her groceries, let her move in as long as she needs or just put her up for a few nights) she s\*\*\*\* all over them. 

We have a very large family and she's screwed us all over MULTIPLE times.   
We've tried putting her into rehab (after she begged us to) a dozen times this year alone. Each time she'd go and stay long enough for us to be out a few hundred dollars and then take off. If we let her stay for a couple of nights or move in, she'll steal groceries and anything of value then disappear for a while. 

Two days ago, she shows up at my house. Pounding on my door. Apparently her husband had tried to kill her and she didn't have anywhere else to go. He'd threatened to kill several family members if he couldn't get to her. So of course she comes to a house that he knows the address of because she's brought him over here when they were both strung out on SEVERAL occasions. 

Now my house is rent to own. I have approx. $9000 left to pay off. The ""Christian"" organization that I rent from love to steal and cheat people. So the closer I get to paying off the house the closer they look for even a minor infraction on our contract so they can evict me and re-rent the house to someone else. 

One of the conditions of my contract is that we can't allow anyone to move into my home. Not without their permission and a background check. (Which Dee will definitely not be allowed with her background) 

She brought all her stuff with her, so they can say that's proof that she's living here and not just staying for a few nights. 

Not even her own parents will take her in for just a night or two. The whole family is aware that the longer she's here the more at risk we are of being evicted. And they won't even help find a housing program or anything for her.

 On top of the fact that her husband has found out that she is definitely staying with us, she's yells and screams in her sleep. Whines if there's any noise whatsoever in the house while she's trying to sleep (which is about 20 hours a day, on the couch) She only gets up to eat about 3 days worth of food and smoke. 

Ever since she showed up my dogs have been on edge and showing continuous signs of stress and anxiety. They're pacing, shaking, panting excessively, and puking everywhere. I'm worried that their bodies will give out from the stress. 

But Dee supposedly has nowhere to go. Apparently she's cut all ties with her druggie buddies and even her straight-laced friend since childhood won't or can't help her. And all of the family is acting as if it's solely our responsibility to help her and let her live with us and if we send her away then we're the assholes.

They don't offer any help but practically demand we keep them updated all throughout the day. 

The week's worth of groceries we just bought on Friday...already gone.

I don't know what else to do. She refuses to go to any of the housing programs or rehabs. Or the mental health ward to get back on her bipolar meds. 

It seems like the only thing we can do is kick her out. But it feels kind of shitty. Especially when the family is treating us like we're complete scum for even thinking about it.

Honestly, I don’t know what I posted to piss off the Russians lol but so far I have changed every single password and set up two-way authentication on every account that is able to do so. I’m very diligent with links I click, sites I visit, etc so I’m not really sure how this happened. Despite changing all my passwords, I still keep getting these notifications. I’m starting to get kind of paranoid and was wondering if there is any way to stop it or if I just gotta keep doing what I’m already doing.",05Jul2020,1
864,"So I have been in a relationship with my girlfriend for about 5 years. I finished high school before her and continued on to earn a bachelor's degree at a school away from home. She has decided to pursue her bachelor's degree at a completely different school. I see her every other weekend. At this point I feel like I am giving so much more into this relationship like she is. I potentially have a very enticing job offer quite a ways away from home and she seems to have no interest in moving, even temporarily (a year or two). In addition, few of our beliefs seem to align. I feel like I have given so much for her to be happy the last few years and I get little back. I let her walk all over me, and if I try to stand up to her she throws a tantrum and makes me feel horrible. I'm almost scared to say what I think about things or show any emotion. What should I do? I love her so much, but am I making a mistake by staying with her? How much should I be giving up to her at the expense of my happiness.",05Jul2020,1
865,"Bullet points:
*My boss is horrible at communication verbally and in written form.
*He sent an email stating that we could choose a shift for the holiday or let him know we are working our normal shift. I sent one a month and a half in advance stating normal shift.
*I go to work on the mentioned holiday for my normal shift. I get an email asking why I am working when I was keyed off and that I should be helping another team. That has NEVER been a thing in the almost five years I've been working. If you come in and it's not your regular day to work, you go help somewhere else. Not only that, I just sank $450 in my car and had an unexpected vet bill for $351 to help my son's cat, not to mention working from home and waking up to no power meant I lost an 8hr shift - this is twice than I make in a week's worth of work. I don't have money leftover because I'm trying to pay off my car and my college tuition since I graduated in 2007. I need to pick up any and every hour I can - we had double pay AND an incentive for working 2 hr chunks. I would be an absolute idiot for NOT going in.
*I put in a LOT of hours to help other teams I'm qualified for - multiple weeks at a time. I've always been one to help where needed and pride myself on being a team player. Secondly, I've never whined, complained, or tried to be sneaky and stay in my home team when I clock in for extra hours unless it's been discussed previously. I let other teammates who only have our skillset that there are extra hours before I pick them up to be fair - I have worked on emails, fraud and casework. Two people on our team were on phones/sales before they joined our team.

So, I'm frustrated. In the same email, he told me 'we need to talk about communication"". He consistently talks to me like I'm a child and I'm at the point where I'm going to lay out everything on the table (including hurting his feelings, which I don't ever do) and quit.

Its stressing me out. Covid needs to stop being an excuse for people at my job to freak out, lash out and make others feel like shit. This has been going on since March. I honestly don't have any sympathy for people who continue to have their regular jobs and can work from home, get paid and keep their bills paid - I'm doing what I need to do and remain positive.

I love my job and what I do. I also feel like he's holding me back on purpose because I WANT to be in a leadership role. I was bypassed yet AGAIN for helping with training or transition and that really upset me. I have the skills to be leadership and have worked retail since I was 17. 

At this point, I don't know what to do. The threats are really getting to me as well as him telling me OTHER teammates are telling him things AND telling me who said it. That is the first rule of management - you keep info confidential and protect the person saying it while delivering it honestly to the person or people affected. We have a posted open door policy. I don't trust him at all now and certainly not telling all my business or asking for SHIT including time off and making sure my appointments are on days I have off or I'm not going. I don't know what of my grievances he's told other people.

Its causing animosity amongst teammates and I stopped trusting him after a 94min touchbase where he was telling me I was distant and someone told him I was doing activities that weren't work related. At that time, I told him I didnt appreciate people starting fights and talking about me and that I stare at my screens and constantly monitor things plus answering leadership right away. There are many conversations I choose to not be a part of, simply because I'm an activist and what I could say could be twisted and an HR situation or me losing my job. So I don't speak on it. I choose to be professional or silly in the right moments. Saturdays are the right day to be silly. All other days are to set up Saturday to be easy unless something breaks.

To give further clarity - I was written up over talking about another company to a team I used to work with. Learned quickly that 'friendly' conversation and even making friends at work was super dangerous and I needed to keep myself under the radar. My write up expired in May. I have friends that used to work at my job that I chat with, but I am a recluse and haven't HAD trustworthy friends in any part of my life or career...so I don't know how to socialize as an adult.

One of my good friends died due to an overdose in May as well. We were to have a team meetup so everyone could see faces and hang out. I didn't go because I was a blubbering mess and the funeral was the same day. I only went to the reception and not the gravesite because I couldn't function and only two people wore masks. I didnt want to be a buzzkill and bring everyone down so I stayed home after going to the funeral.

There has been a lot of what I have going on I've said a small bit about, not going into details or trying to come off as needing attention. Back in March, I had someone I thought was a friend (and a teammate at that) tell me that I have to figure things out for myself and not to post things complaining or asking for advice because others are going through their own stuff.

They were not responded to and removed. That's not a friend. The exact opposite happened with my whole team and why the distant convo came up - because I wasn't reaching out or talking about things and keeping things to myself. I grew up with ""be quiet unless your ass is on fire or you have something thought provoking to say"" and I also have the ""don't focus on your own shit, do for others"" so I don't linger on things or fall into depression over it. It's a hard habit to break and really hard for me to be selfish - and her comment on my post made me cry in anger. The one time I asked for legit help, I got shoved into a corner and told to be quiet.

So, even tough love or advice on this would be appreciated. I'm actually scared to quit because I won't be making what I make elsewhere and I can't just up and move. Plus the fact my job has the best insurance. There are other factors about my job I can't share with the public, but its causing me to rethink finances whether I stay or leave and have a budget for everything to be paid up and extended until September 2020.",05Jul2020,1

870,"I (28F) actually began working at this place in 2016 and despite a toxic office work environment, I had truly loved my job. I had to leave on maternity leave in October 2018, but the whole pregnancy it was planned for me to go back part-time; but a week before my start-back date they told me they no longer had a part-time position open for me (it was transferred to a different department) and that I could come back full-time or nothing. I refused the full-time position due to it being against our wishes (we wanted one of us to be the primary raiser of our child vs full-time child care. Not that we have anything against it, it just wasn't for us) so I stayed on FMLA an additional 4 weeks with no pay, waiting for a position to open and it didn't. I then transfered to a different county building  for a part-time position.


Long story short, those who watched my son as a worked slowly fizzled out. The nanny quit, my friend became a SAHM so she had 3 of her own children  to watch, my sister-in- law's schedule changed, and unfortunately last August my mom passed away. Shortly after, my husband got a new and wonderful job that he worked so hard for, so all of my child care options disappeared. I was close to putting my two-weeks notice in, when my Father-in-law stepped up to take care of my son while I was working and things went wonderfully!


4 months ago, a part-time postion opened up at my previous place of employment and I jumped at it! For the past 3 months have gone swimmingly, and I was happy knowing my son was safely watched and not at risk during this pandemic. But this is were the unfortunate part has come in.
My FIL now has to get neck surgery August 10th, and I have no one to watch my son in the mean time, or permanently in case he's not well enough to come back. I dont get FMLA or sick leave from my work being part-time. There are no childcare facilities offering part-time care during the pandemic, and the full time daycares have waitlists and cost more than I make. We would also be exposing him to NEW germs as well as COVID, when we make enough money for me to stay home. 


We have weighed our options over the past week and have decided that me staying home would be our best bet. I'm just feeling so much guilt for possibly dissapointing supervisors who liked me enough to bring me back the second an opportunity arose. There is no where for me to grow there in a career, and tbh its not a place I can see myself for the rest of my life anyway. I feel guilty, and I want to leave in a way that they can't say anything negative for when I have to put them as a reference on my resume. The decision has been made, I just need a graceful way to go about it essentially. Any advice would be gratefully appreciated.

878,"So my girlfriend and I broke up about 4 days ago and my reaction to it has been all over the place. Half the day I want to tell her I’ve been miserable without her and I miss her, and the other half is spent thinking I’m better off and I don’t want to see her again. I don’t really know what to do. But I loved her so much to the point where I don’t find anybody else to be a match for me or even attractive. I really fought hard to keep our relationship going because we loved each other. She would tell me all these great things such as how much she loved me and how badly she wanted to be with me forever. I promise from the bottom of my heart that it was genuine, and let’s not argue if it is or isn’t let’s just assume it is for the sake of my question. Then all of a sudden she just doesn’t love me anymore, something about that seems weird to me. I think maybe this had to do with her being  stressed out and scared lately and she said things she didn’t truly mean. I don’t know fully, but it seems that way. The way that she has been treating me during and after the breakup kind of hints toward me eventually getting a random text from her saying she misses me. I was an amazing boyfriend to her and our relationship was the greatest thing that ever happened to me, and I treated it as such. She has had past boyfriends cheat on her and be controlling. I don’t want to sound arrogant or cocky, but I was the best boyfriend she ever had and one of the best things that ever happened to her, I showed that everyday. I think she realizes that already and will realize it more and more the longer we aren’t together. So I don’t know what to do, I really want to just tell her I miss her. But at the same time I think there’s a valid reason not to be together, she was hardly ever available and she started putting in little effort in our relationship. But we talked about all of those things a few days before we broke up and we figured it out, we just started to fix those things together. I told myself if I still really miss her and feel the same way about her around late August and September I will tell her that I really miss her and confess how I’ve been feeling. Unless something crazy happens before then. I feel like if I still feel the same way after that long then I need to tell her how I feel.

We divorced around 2 years ago, it was a healthy split if there is one, we have a 4 year old daughter so we managed to keep things civil. She started dating a new guy about a year ago and things between them seemed pretty serious from what she told me.

I was dropping my daughter off pretty late last week, and I brought her in to put her to bed. This is a normal thing when I have to bring her back late, I just tuck her in and then leave.

After we put her to bed, I was about to leave, having a casual chat with my ex and then it just happened. I can't really explain why I kissed her, we'd been getting on fine being apart for 2 years, but it happened.

Afterwords, she told me she felt terrible, she didn't want to tell him, but she didn't regret it. To be honest I didn't regret it either, but I feel bad that I did that to him and put her in that situation. I'm not really sure what to do now, I haven't really spoken with her since that night and I feel like he should know. I would want to know if it happened to me.

Obviously I can't make her tell him, and their relationship shouldn't be my business, but I'm not sure what the right thing to do is.

889,"We are a friend group consisting of six teenage girls. The five of us Nicole (17F), Nancy (16F), Ivy (17F), Alexa (17F) and Tiffany (17F) are very concerned about the sixth friend’s Jennifer’s (17F) recent behavior. We wrote this post together as a group. All the names have obviously been changed for the purpose of this story. Also, English is a second/third language for all of us, so please excuse any grammar or punctuation mistakes! The TL;DR is at the the bottom of the post!

We have all been friends for at least four years. We were all in the same middle school. Some of us have known each other longer but we’ve only been a friend group officially for around 4 years. We used to be really close. Of course we had our ups and downs but nothing too major. Usually, we help one another by talking about it or doing different things to get the person’s mind off all the stressful stuff. But with Jennifer’s current state, that won’t be enough.

After graduating from middle school, our friend group started to divide a bit due to people going to different schools. Four of us Jennifer, Nicole, Nancy and Tiffany go to the same school, while Ivy and Alexa go to different ones. We have still managed to spend some time together and meet up during the weekends or holidays. Please keep this information in mind, it will be important later! But now it’s summer break and we have had more time to hang out together and talk. We were all hanging out one day without Jennifer (because she was somewhere else that day) when suddenly Tiffany brought up that she had been having a lot of trouble with Jennifer recently. She didn’t want to talk behind her back but was really worried about Jennifer’s mental state and well-being. She told us that often after we had all hung out together, Jennifer would start talking shit about all of us when it was just the two of them. She would complain about stuff like personality, opinions, our interests and different topics we often talk about. Tiffany was really distraught because she felt bad about keeping it a secret from the rest of us but now also because she just revealed stuff about Jennifer behind her back. She explained that she had tried talking to her about it and even suggested her to stop but Jennifer just got offended and brushed her off. We were all extremely shocked, but we weren’t just shocked because Jennifer had been talking shit but also because she had been doing it to all of us. Basically, she had been talking shit to all of us about everyone else. We all had the same experience. We didn’t know what to do. At first, none of us had told each other because we were kinda scared to oppose her opinions or tell anyone else. “But why would you be scared of one teenage girl and her opinions?” you might ask. Well my dear friend, that’s because she’s extremely sensitive and has even seemed suicidal at times. She constantly “jokes” about ending her own life whenever she’s feeling down. She also often quite unstable and anxious, we have of course tried to suggest getting professional help and tried to support her the best we can but nothing helps. She just gets mad at us and asks stuff like, “So my problems mean nothing to you? You want me to pay someone so I can talk to them because my own friends won’t even do that for me?”. Obviously, we would love to help her and listen to all her problems but we’re just a bunch of teenage girls with no actual knowledge in psychology. Also, constantly listening to her problems with no actual solution can be quite draining when you also have your own problems to worry about. Sometimes, Jennifer just treats us like unpaid therapists but of course has no time to listen to our problems. But this hasn’t always been the case. She used to be the sweetest person ever and would always listen to and care about our problems, but something has sadly changed. Jennifer also has some troubles home like her brother (15M) is often violent towards her and her parents don’t seem to care. She also usually does the majority of the housework in their house but never gets any appreciation for it.

After all of this came out, we started sharing more stories about her and what she had said about us. We’ll share some of those with you right now.

Let’s start with Nicole (17F) and Ivy (17F). Why am I putting these two together and not individually like everyone else? You should ask Jennifer. For some reason, whenever she has a problem with one of these girls, she always blames BOTH of them. They are very close to each other and are usually spending time together but they are still very different people! Sometimes, when one of them says something she doesn’t like, she blames both of them. She calls them both stupid (because their grades aren’t always the best), alcoholics (because they had a few drink when we had a sleepover once??) and of course insults the fact that they aren’t “individuals” just because they spend the most time together. Ivy also received a little more of the “idiot” insults because apparently her language skills aren’t good enough? She’s originally from a different country than us and her mother tongue isn’t the same ours, so she often accidentally says things wrong or forgets words. But she can speak THREE different languages fluently, while Jennifer can only speak ONE (she can’t even speak English that well).

Next we have Nancy (16F). Nancy is a very artistic person and her drawing skills are honestly amazing. This has always caused jealousy for Jennifer. Nancy is also good at school and gets quite good grades. Nancy’s and Jennifer’s grades are usually on the same level but Jennifer is still somehow mad? She often says stuff like: “She thinks she’s so perfect. She thinks she know everything but obviously she doesn’t. She’s has no idea how to communicate with people and is obviously so pretentious. She probably thinks she’s some saint or something!”. We of course disagree with this.

Then we have Alexa (17F). Alexa probably has the best grades in our friend group, she’s also very athletic and fit. Jennifer is obviously jealous about the good grades saying stuff like: “She doesn’t even have to do anything to succeed. She just shows up and is immediately perfect, unlike the rest of us normal people!”. Jennifer is also jealous about how fit Alexa is. Alexa trains multiple times a week and is in very fit condition due to it, while Jennifer is overweight. Not badly overweight but still overweight. We are all smaller than her and that doesn’t bother us at all, but she often gives us mean comments about it. We can’t talk about eating or exercising at all or she we’ll get upset. Most of these comments are targeted at Alexa.

Lastly, we have Tiffany (17F). The most important thing to know about Tiffany is that she has health problems. Her immune system is very broken and she gets sick extremely easily. Due to this, she misses school a lot, basically once a month. Jennifer calls her lazy, pathetic and rude for this. She also often shames Tiffany for staying home with stuff like: “I feel so lonely without you. None of the other friends care about me. Why do you have to always abandon me like this?”. This is very upsetting for Tiffany because she’s very anxious and has even suffered from quite severe anxiety. but the most recent problem arose when she started working out to improve her health. Her main goal wasn’t obviously to loose weight. Her body is a little curvy but still pretty thin and she is happy with it. but Jennifer was pissed because she should be the one that’s most uncomfortable with her own body, but she also doesn’t want to do anything to “fix” it. Like eating healthier and exercising.

Jennifer has also been rude to us as a group. She often gets pissed when we talk about certain topics but won’t say anything when we’re together. Instead, she will complain to one of us privately afterwards. We tried making a list of these topics so we could maybe avoid them for awhile until things cool down, but the list ended up being over twenty things long, This list included stuff like boys (and just overall dating, not all of us are completely straight lmao), makeup, exercising, alcohol etc. And a lot of these are really common and normal topics for teenage girls.

We also have a habit in our group where we joke about each other or jokingly “insult” each other. No one else has had a problem with this except her. We tried to avoid doing this with her but she still did it to us. Also, usually you can tell if something’s a joke or you could simply say if something is too insulting/serious. We usually take that very seriously.

But the worst part is something we found out recently. We found out just how manipulative and controlling she really is. Isn’t it nice to receive a heartfelt message from your friend talking about how important you are to them? But what if that message was copy pasted and send to all their friends? How would you feel? Well, we all felt quite shitty. She also constantly told each of us in different ways that we were her “best” or “only real” friend. To ALL of us. It’s just all honestly feels like a sick social experiment.

But obviously, we need your advice. The things we have told obviously might seem terrible but she hasn’t always been like this. This all only started about 1 - 1 1/2 years ago. We want to talk to her about it because it would be stupid not to. We could try to act like nothing has happened and hope she stops but eventually someone will snap and spill everything. We could also just ditch her and abandon her as a friend but that could bring a lot of problems. Like we said previously, four of us go to the same school, including Jennifer. If we just abandon her, it would be really awkward during school and she could even start spreading rumors about us. And of course, she’s has been our friend for 4 years so it would feel very wrong to just suddenly abandon her like that. So, we want to talk to her. But how? We’re scared that we will intimidate her and maybe even drive her to suicide. We want to somehow express our feelings and make her understand that we don’t hate her. We just feel extremely hurt and worried about her. Obviously, behavior like this speaks about very low self-esteem and bad mental health. We just really want to help her.

TL;DR: Friend seems abusive and basically bullies other friends. The friends are trying to figure out how to make her stop without upsetting her and bringing out her suicidal tendencies.

896,"Hi everyone. So today while I was working, I saw a piece of paper tucked away on the desk with some strange writings on it. And with curiosity, I took a look at it. And boy am I “amused” 

So on the piece of paper, on the left side there’s time stamps, and on the right side are paragraphs. What it is specifically is that, this coworker of mine, he secretly recorded and wrote down EVERY single little details of interactions between me and him that apparently made him “unhappy” like literally everything, and it’s already a page and a half long just for the things that happened on the past couple of days. It’s basically like a “bad employee” report for me. And what’s shocking is that he has been acting cool with even until the last time I saw him. I honestly had no idea what a crazy lying little sh** he is. I mean it’s also very creepy and uncomfortable. Like what the heck?! He even recorded our conversations down almost word by word. And tried to antagonize me as much as possible. Of course he did not write down some of the bad behaviors that he had towards me. 

And some of the things that he wrote down are obviously trying to make me sound bad when it’s really just nothing at all. 

Just wondering what do you guys think? Is there anything I should do? Of course I will avoid contact with him as much as possible now. But should I write anything on the paper also? God I am so creeped out and disgusted. Help lol! Now I feel like there’s a pair of eyes on me every second. This little pathetic and delusional game of his needs to be stopped?",05Jul2020,6
897,"What are some things I could say to I win my parent’s support for my decision to move out?

A continuation of my previous posts, I’m trying to brainstorm ways to convince my parents to support me on my decision to stay behind as they decide to move out.

Long story short is that I’m 18 and my parents are wanting to move within an undesignated amount of time. They’re wanting to move back to their old hometown (which is across the state) where their biological kids (older sisters) still currently live and kids of their own. I don’t want to move because I’ve built a life, per say, here. With friends, a job, connections, and just familiarity with the city. Another major contributing factor is that I was wanting to move out fairly soon anyways so I don’t have to live with my parents and the toxic environment. 

To my parents, family is number one and as far as I know, they don’t really comprehend how much I dislike living at home, and if I expressed my opinions, they’d think I’m being disrespectful and won’t understand my reasoning. I’ve never had a compatible relationship with them due to the stark differences in our personality. 

I need a convincing argument to win my parent’s support on my decision. My mom is rather a petty person in nature so if things go sour she would not offer a helping hand in the tiniest thing. I’d also be viewed as the “prodigal son” like how two of my older brothers have been perceived by the rest of the family. That’s why I need to win their support, so if I do need their assistance, they’d likely to help, and my relationship with the extended family is not marred. 

To my parents who think family is everything, how could I sway them in supporting my decision to stay behind and complete my education in the city I grew up in?

So here’s my dilemma before we start I’ll give them back story I work at a Fancy restaurant making good money , enough to pay my rent myself  though my place is  a one bedroom apartment but still and I work with all great people a couple weeks ago , one of my coworkers let’s call her bell . Was leaving to go to a new job in a week or so  and she asked me out since I don’t get a lot of action  I was taken a back and said yes . The first date went pretty good we talked had coffee and nothing happened just hand holding and stuff . We went on a second date and this is where stuff went down hill , she invited me back to her place which I decided to go to 

We get into her Apartment and I start to see pictures around the place of this guy who I never met before  I asked her about it and I was like is this “your brother or something “ bell got really quiet and said “well that’s me “ I was shocked to say the least since I didn’t know that about her but apparently she told a couple people from work they just never told me . We had ice cream and watched a movie during the movie bell was kissing my neck and get my pants off , and my dick is not hard at all she gets my pants off and see’s this .
she try’s to give me a blowjob but it isn’t working . It was really embarrassing and emasculate. I was like I am going to go home and she kinda looked at me like like yeah fuck you.  I texted her the next morning and I said I don’t think it’s going to work out because physical Attraction is a big thing for me in a relationship but I told her she was nice and that it was a fun time  and well she was blowing up my phone like crazy and Calling me transphobic and that I hate all women etc. when I returned to work I was going as my Business as usual as my manger told me to get  something from the Freezer box’s and shit and I was doing that when bell come in and was trying to start Shit with me I was backing off and telling her to stop  When she started hitting me I don’t know what happened but I lost control and pushed her really hard   Sending her back and Into a railing which broke and her arm got cut and she got up and walked out , I was Continuing doing my job until The manager come running behind me and we need to talk The manager with fear in his eyes ( He was already. Worry since corporate was there )  . 

I walk into the office there she is with the district manager and a guy from corporate, They asked her to leave the room . They asked Did you push down bell? I was like yes and I explain my side of the story. They looked at me and said She was saying you did it because she is trans and it was a hate  crime if I did . I said I Didn’t and  called her back in . she explains that I did do it to her because she was trans  and that if I deserve to be fired and That if management didn’t she would go to the news and Shit Natural this would be a big deal for us and they decided to give me A suspension Because they were investigating 


I am really upset and I don’t want to lose my job  or Having people think I’m against trans people or anyone for that matter , what do you think I should do?

900,"I was always somewhat of an extroverted introvert. I prefer to be alone for most things, like shopping or errands or whatever..and need a lot of alone time at home, but once I am in the mood to be around people, I totally blossom and have been known to be funny and the life of the party. 

I am 22 and that's obviously super young. As a kid, I always socialized with my peers and even though I was shy at times, was super into social circles and groups. Then I moved to Europe and everything changed for me. I didn't speak the language in the country I moved to, and went to school having no friends. 

Once I became fluent I made some friends at high school, some of which I still talk to til this day, but I always watched those friends have big big groups of friends and be part of a community, while I just had my one or two 1:1 friendships. 

I thought this would change when I went off to uni, and I moved to the capital city in the country and figured I would somehow find myself a community or large group of friends to be a part of. I always imagined going to parties and meeting lots of people and being known in these circles, but this never happened. I have 4 really good friends...they mean the absolute world to me and are amazing. However, it kinda sucks because we have 1:1 friendships. So basically if I wanna hang out, it's just us two at a cafe talking for a few hours and that's it. If they invite me to birthday parties or whatever, I meet their friends and have a nice time, but those people still remain THEIR friends and not much happens from there. I can't even have my own birthday party, because inviting friends of friends would be weird. It makes me feel pathetic and makes me sad to think I won't even have 10 people to invite to my wedding. 

My boyfriend is a part of this really huge community of people who know people and all that. I envy him
A lot and am happy when he gets to hang out with his friends, but I wished I had that too and feel like I am wasting my years not really socializing at all. People here are really uptight and like to stick to their circles, even if those circles are 100 people...101 isn't welcome. And my bfs closest friends like me a lot, but anything outside of that is not possible and won't happen because this community is so set in their ways. It sucks. And I don't know what to do.

904,"I, a 14 year old girl, have been hearing voices in my head for 3 years. It all started when I left my mother's house, I was in total isolation for 3 months because my family didn't think I was fit to go to school. {I was extremely depressed, and aggressive. Usually towards women because of my mother's abuse.} 

While in isolation, I started to hear voices in my head. At first I just ignored it but it became more constant, they never told me to do anything threatening or dangerous just spoke to me. 

Then I started to see a girl I call Astria. She's like a make believe friend but I can feel her and hear her, usually she appears when I really need someone or just wants to talk. So I think it's her voice I'm hearing, an example of her appearing from nothing :

I was being bullied, by my old friends and just remember sitting down and starting to cry. They were telling me to go and kms, stuff of that nature, I felt her arms wrap around me and beg me not too.

However, I am not old enough to get a tattoo without the consent of my parents. I’ve talked about getting one with my mother, and she says she would not allow me getting one, because she is afraid I may regret getting it in the future.

Of course I’ve considered the fact that I may regret this tattoo later on. But, I find this idea very meaningful and just a beautiful tattoo overall. I’m absolutely in love with this idea, and like I’ve mentioned it’s been something I’ve wanted for years now. I do not see any reason in my future I may regret getting this tattoo, and if for some reason I did, I know I could alter it to suit my wants later in life.

I would like some advice on whether or not I should further pursue this tattoo, whether or not I should attempt to convince my mom. Or, if it would be better for me to wait years more. 

If some people who got tattoos when they were young as well, or have tattoo stories to share, that’d help tremendously!

Half of the time it ends with my sister and I running around the neighbourhood and finding him and the other half is one of our nice neighbours bringing him to our doorstep.

916,"I (29M) applied for Graduation (Bachelor of General Studies in Education) of October 2020 in the middle of June, only to be notified just a couple days ago that I do not have enough Upper Division credits to graduate. Haven't been able to sleep well the last few nights from constantly reviewing the mistakes I made and what course of actions I could have taken to prevent today's scenario (I just need 1 course, 3 credits, to graduate).  As you may be aware, graduation and convocation only happens in June and October of each year, which means I can't graduate for another year now...

I am wondering what you would do if you were in my shoes or if you have been in my shoes? I know one of the most obvious options is to try and find another full-time job as quickly as possible, yes, I have sent out some resumes but so far no luck.

917,"I'm looking for more perspective on the situation since I don't know if my mom is taking my side because I'm her daughter or not.
Me and Annie (fake name) have been friends for a year and a half, since freshman year of high school. I'm sixteen, going in seventeen, and I went off to online school last year, transferring in the middle of the year. We kept in contact over Instagram and Discord.

Basically... I have another friend that's rubbed off me a lot, named Amanda (also fake name). Amanda is in a very bad mental place because if her home situation. Her father is a drunk and rarely works, although she's told me recently that he's been stepping it up lately and that their relationship is getting better, and her mom is overly religious to the point of suffocation and oppression. Her hobbies are constantly criticized, so are her choices and style of wear, and personality. Her mother has a habit of putting them in difficult situations, as her naivety and ignorance will enable any scummy pastor to feed her lies with the guarantee that she will believe them. Amanda's coping better than I would have expected, although it can be draining to me to be around her sometimes because of her pessimistic nature. Nevertheless, I love her for who she is and recognize that her issues aren't her fault. It's just the way she is. God knows I can be just as insufferable too at times.

I bring this up, however, because one of her coping mechanisms dark humor, particularly death and suicide. Nothing graphic; just phrases like ""I'd rather die than go to Mrs. Dian's biology class"" and ""I'm so tired I want to die"". Mostly Gen Z humor. Perhaps it doesn't make it right, but it's her humor, and I licked it up pretty quickly. There is unfortunately an appeal in being dark or emo. Back when I was in public school, it was mostly a cry for help, as my school life was extremely stressful, and mental health was never taken seriously by the councilors. There was also a teacher in my freshman hear from Romania that made our freshman year absolutely hell with her teaching style and her various complicated projects, of which she assigned often and never gave enough time for completion. Under those circumstances, (my school was also very demanding, and liked to pressure us into stressful classes as a novel sacrifice for our ""future education in colleges and careers"") I suppose it is no wonder I ended up picking up so much dark language from her. It was whatever. It was our thing, our little inside joke, and it was fine. 

Later on, in freshman year, we added Annie to our group. Annie is... Strong, and has a good head on her shoulders. But she is also very insecure, in her art, her self esteem, and in her socialization. I never understood why this was. I don't expect you guys to understand, as none of you have met her, but she was always very bright, and very peppy. It was as if she could fit anywhere she wanted. She was very motherly in her demeanor despite her vulgar nature and her large inappropriate vocabulary. She was great. I valued her friendship.

Annie never expressed discomfort when I and Amanda made our dark jokes in front of her. We used to sit together at lunch; Annie, Amanda and me, and she never even so much as flinched when I and Amanda did our regular handgun greetings, or the occasions when Amanda would say something self derivative and I would point a finger gib at her, and vice versa. (I understand this can be seen as a threat, as I once almost got in trouble for it a teacher, but the has always been a mutual inside joke between me and Amanda. No one else seemed to mind, and we had a habit of pointing a finger at the other, and when that person reciprocated, point both hands at the other, and watch them reciprocate. It was a fun game.) We would often say ""We were so tired we wanted to die"" or ""I'd rather die than go to Mr. James's English lesson"". School was... Very stressful. Annie never batted an eye. She would never join in, but she never said anything in offense to it. She often talked with her other friends around the table, even when I and Amanda were talking about other things and or topics, and while we would interact, Annie always seemed a lot closer to Amanda than me.

Fast forward to two months ago. I'm in online school now and log into a public discord call on Annie's server of which she invited me to before I left. I just got a new MacBook Air, one that my dad bought me as a gift for getting A's and B's on my final grades on my school report cards, as well as a new piece of equipment to make online school easier, as my old laptop was six years old and prone to crashing and lagging. Apple isn't exactly known for their easy ways to create a new Apple ID, it's one AM, I just got back from a. Long joyride to the river and the next city over that I went with my family, and I'm exhausted. Not in a bad mood, just frustrated.

I go on the call and ask Annie if she knows how to make an apple ID. She immediately snaps at me that she doesn't know anything about apple or how it works, and why I'm asking her. I'm put off by this, and drop the subject. 

The rest of her friends online are already acting pretty emo, and I decide to make a joke as I continue attempting to make my new apple ID. I make an offhand joking comment about how ""I would rather die and have my body parts dispersed around the world than deal with this computer."" Or it might have been ""I'd rather kill myself"", I'm not sure. The sentiment is the same. The others in the call laugh it off and continue with their day, up until Annie goes off the call and into the mod channel, taking her other moderator friend with her. They leave me alone with another male moderator who's making pretty tasteless nice guy jokes. We open discussion on society's decline and sprinkle a few history lessons and offhand comments about how America's government is obviously corrupt, as well as some plane facts in there to spice the conversation up. We actually get along pretty well. In the end, Annie's mod friend comes back, but she doesn't.

Cut to two weeks later. after begging my parents for years, my mom and dad finally give in and adopt a tiny, grew and white kitten of which we initially thought was a girl but discovered to be a boy after a visit to the vet. I sent her a picture over Instagram, intending to share my excitement with her.

Instead, it turns into an interrogation. 

She asks me very bluntly and rudely if I impulse bought a cat. No, that's irresponsible. We had been planning his arrival for two months. She asks if we have the money to take care of a cat. I say we've been saving up for emergencies. She asks if we have all of the supplies to care for the little kitten. I say we bought our stuff IN ADVANCE already. 

I try to keep my cool during her questions, as her criticism isn't welcome exactly, but maybe she might have a point, and I like to think of myself as very open to criticism.

She brings up my runaway cat.

She ran away six years ago. I mentally blocked off her memory as to not waste time grieving for her, but it didn't really work. I felt very guilty for her disappearance, as I wasn't the best cat owner to her when we had her (I was also 10🙃). She starts spouting that it's against a cat's nature to run away from a place they feel safe in and that she was concerned I wasn't responsible enough to take care of another living being.

And then she mentions the MacBook joke. This is where I get angry.

She says that she doesn't think that someone who would rather die than deal with their new computer probably wasn't very responsible.

She says that the joke was disrespectful to people with depression and suicidal thoughts and brings up her attempt at middle school, where she tried to hang herself in the girl's bathroom and almost killed herself. She mentions that she had a bruise on her neck afterward. She tells me ""What the fuck, OP?""

And here's the thing. I get where she's coming from. I would happily stop making death jokes if it makes her uncomfortable. But I can't read fucking minds, Annie. You want me to stop? Tell me you feel uncomfortable in the first place. How am I supposed to know it made you uncomfortable?

Additionally, I've had my own experience with suicide, although it wasn't as extreme as Annie's. I come off as very neurotypical since I'm very peppy with friends, but two weeks before leaving for online school I had a silent mental breakdown and seriously contemplated suicide. My whole family was leaving to go run some errands and I was going to be left home alone, and there was a bottle of pills on my dresser I use to deal with cramps during shark week. A WHOLE bottle of ibuprofen. It probably wouldn't have killed me. I know this because I googled it, half wanting to know so I wouldn't attempt, and the other in anticipation TO attempt. It maybe wouldn't have killed me, but it would have seriously messed up my organs. I told my mother about it, of who then proceeded to freak out, tell me that kids like me (suicidal kids) get locked up and monitored twenty-four seven in an attempt to scare me into not committing suicide I think? And drag me to her errands with her. She also told my dad without my consent. After that I refused to tell my mother if I had another suicidal urge again, of which I had two days later, and then two weeks after that as well. We've since discussed it together after I yelled at her for not getting me a therapist and responding the way that she did (don't be like my mom, kids. I've been approached by suicidal friends before and I did leagues better than she did talking to them about it, smh) and have resolved the issue. I can now MAYBE say that I would approach my mom about it if I get a suicidal urge again. 

I tried to explain this to Annie, but she shit me down and told me not to message her ever again. I told her to stay ignorant then, blocked her, and then went to cry to my mom about it.

Honestly, I've posted this on a discord server and they told me I wasn't in the wrong. They said that she shouldn't have gotten mad at me for not knowing she wasn't comfortable with the jokes because I can't read minds? My mother said that I wasn't in the wrong either, but honestly, I don't... Feel right. I feel like those people were biased because they knew me in passing or like, actually gave birth to me lmao. This has been brought up again because Amanda told me that Annie told her that I was ""canceled"" when Amanda asked why she wasn't active in the group chat anymore and Annie told me about it two days ago.

Idk. I feel like Annie shouldn't have blown up at me for not being able to discern for myself that she was uncomfortable with my jokes, as she showed no outward reaction to them ever, and is still friends with Amanda, who is a gold mine of death and suicide jokes. It felt as if she invalidated my experience with suicide by calling it ""not a real attempt"" when I tried to explain it. What, would she rather my family have found me dying after going to a party and work respectively or dead for me to earn the right to say death jokes? 

Am I an asshole for not apologizing in the situation?",05Jul2020,0
918,"Hello, so I dated this wonderful guy about ten months ago for a few months. Our chemistry was extraordinary and I felt myself falling for him. Let’s call him Bob. But he ended up ghosting me for a few weeks as he got into an exclusive relationship and then began “hovering me”. Bob kept fortnight tabs on me from December-February by sending me tweets, replying to my stories, etc.

Pre hovering period, I was broken-hearted from this situation and brooded for the entire month of November to the week before Christmas. Then I picked myself up and began to recover, vented a lot to my then-close friend and got involved more in my school. I felt okay for a solid month and even accepted the situation. I even felt happy for Bob’s new relationship at one point in time, as I felt we were somewhat friends outside of romance. 

Then, it happened. HIS relationship breakup. Thus, his come back shifted into full speed. Bob began texting me again through a month’s span and I ignore the initial four texts. Didn’t respond or gave dry replies. The fifth time he texted, I engaged and agreed to meet up. It turned into a hookup and I thought that’d be it. I didn’t initially feel the attachment growing back.

Wrong.

We hooked up a few times after that. Each time it’s like I relapsed more and more, promising myself I wouldn’t like him again, and it’s like I’m back at phase one minus the heartbreak of us not working out. It’s like that “recovery” period meant nothing. Stupid me.

I can’t get him out of my mind for nothing. I go out with my friends for distraction and come back to him on my mind. It’s like an obsession. I need help getting him out of my mind completely as I accepted we’re not going to get back together romantically. I’ve muted his stories to try to detox myself, but it’s been three weeks and I still feel the same. Like nothing’s working. Help!",05Jul2020,2

I haven’t heard from him today and starting to worry he is ghosting next. Which is so weird since we both had a good day. This is the first guy I’ve talked to sense my breakup and it will be hard if he just ghosted me. Makes me what to give up on dating because I never get the guy.",05Jul2020,3
921,"So, here’s the thing. I’m (20F) studying in university and there is this teacher (Male, about 60 years old, I’m not sure but he’s old), since the start i was one of the kids that go to school early so he’d pick me to go make him tea in the teachers’ lounge for him and other teachers. I thought he was nice so I was nice back, since I’m a student. At first he kept telling me stories about how his son is in his senior year at another college and he has asked a lot of students in classed he had taught to come over his house and eat with his son (kinda like to matchmake). I didn’t say anything about it, I just smiled and ignored what he said because I’m always kinda suspicious at everything, he “likes” me and remembers my face and name, I thought I was teacher’s favourite pet. After the subject was done and we prepare for exams, one day he saw me at the school campus and called me to his spot, saying if I need help on the exam I can call him and ask and he’ll answer it. I later told my friend about it and I was uncertain because if I do that it’s not ethical and I’d feel like I owe him, but she-my friend told me to do so because “it costs nothing”. Then I texted him and asked for “tips” on the exam, I texted. And then he proceeded to video call me (I turned off the camera of my side) and he’d tell me what questions are possible to appear in the exams, not the exact question, just what could be in it (btw none of the things he told me appear in the exam). He’d call me a few times (always video call) before the exam to give me tips.
The exam came and as I’ve just stated, none of the questions appeared in my exam, but he was the teacher that was in the room while the class did the exam. After the exam I drove home immediately and suddenly he called me to ask if I wanted to have lunch with him. I said I’m already home so he kinda laughed and said “maybe another time”. I sensed something suspicious and texted my friend, she said “Wasn’t there a rumour spread around students about a teacher that molested or harass female students in the campus?”. I was shocked so I immediately asked a girl I know from a year above me because the rumour started from her year. She said she knew the name of the teacher and when she sent me the name I was shocked because it was THE teacher that “likes” me. I guess there was just no real proof so no one could kick him out of school or sue him for it. She then told me just keep being polite to him, ignore him if possible but be careful or he might fail you and you’ll have to study the subject again (he’ll still teach it). 
It was a week until just this Friday, I finished another exam for another subject and got out of the classroom, I opened my phone and saw a missed call from him. I showed it to my friend and she told me to ignore it, I did as she say.
Just today at around 8:30pm I opened my phone while at home (my phone is always on ‘do not disturb’ mode so i dont get notifications of calls) and saw another missed call from him just a few minutes ago, I kinda panicked.
But the high point of this was that just an hour ago, at around half past THREE IN THE MORNING, I saw another missed call from him before I go to sleep. I absolutely went in panic mode and asked my friend, I didn’t know what to do. What kind of teacher called their female student at 3am? My friend told me to tell my dad to deal with this because he knows a few powerful people, and my other friend told me to either go to my university’s supervisor or the head of the school board to report this. I don’t want to cause a scene and make the problem bigger than it is  because there’s no real proof and I actually did ask him for the tips for the exams, though he was the one to offer it first, I still made a mistake. I don’t know what to do and the day the girl confirmed the rumour to me that it was true, I actually called my friend at 3am crying because I felt unsafe. Now it’s the same but I’m seeking advice, should I keep ignoring it or should I tell someone? I feel unsafe and scared walking in my own university. Please be kind while giving advices.",05Jul2020,2
922,"I have this female friend, we’re in a pretty small friend group. I haven’t been around them much due to depression and anxiety issues, from the looks of it there has been ups and downs within the friend group but I would never have suspect one of my friends saying they’re gonna drop my female friend from the group, I even asked if it was a joke and he said no. This morning I told her about it and she told me she already knows about that but she worries about it everday and telling her that it wasn’t a joke just made it worse I guess. So much has happened while I was gone recuperating and I think my friend found out I told her about it and I just don’t feel like answering I feel really overwhelmed right now, i have a good amount of evidence i guess but it isn’t strong evidence, I can screen shot our conversation but I’m not sure what the consequences will be. 

There has been drama between the group several times and I always happen to just know and everything works out in the end but I don’t know about this one, I’m not sure if I can even win or just what I’m doing is just stupid. I’m just trying to do what’s right and let my female friend know, this isn’t ok, I don’t know why he and possibly the others would think of saying that, it hurts her feelings. Everyone has changed it’s been months since school let out, i understand it’s hard building trust from a distance I’m just really confused why they would say that after all they been through and all the FaceTime notifications I get from my phone every day. I forgot to mention this female friend I have isn’t liked by a lot of people, there’s a couple reasons why but I don’t want to get into that but she is known for being passive aggressive and annoying sometimes. the group has been off in way from what I hear even my friend believes it too, but whenever I join those facetimes everything looks fine tbh. 

How can I move through this smoothly and talk this out? I’m confused to why he would say something like that, she’s a sensitive person and she already feels bad about it. I might be wrong I’m not sure but I feel like something is definitely off. what should I do?",05Jul2020,1

925,"Recently, my boyfriend of one year and I hit rocky stuff and are pretty much breaking up right now (literally as I type). How do I let him go and stop fighting and begging him? 

We were decently happy all throughout the relationship, but our differences soon fucked that up. He has his mental struggles, as I have mine, and we just don’t mix well. He’s a quiet, reserved, video game enthusiast who spends a lot of time on his computer and indoors. I’m much the opposite, an outgoing, sociable person. But I am guilty of being a bitch because it helped me fit in. I’m guilty of changing myself (drinking/partying) to have fun. But that’s not usually me. It’s only happened since recently and especially with the quarantine. (I’ve been social distancing, no worries, but I live on “the compound” with my siblings and many young partying family members).

He told me I’m immature and have been unintentionally taking advantage of him. This pains me deeply. It’s not in my nature to be mean. I just didn’t realize how much my family pressurized me so much that I ended up forcing and bullying Him into being who my family wants him to be. I’ve expressed my guilt many times and promised him to change. We had the agreement of if I change, he does too, because he has his own faults. Like, for example, he enables his OCD and enables his family to shit on me. 

I love him. We took things quick in the beginning and made our childish mistakes at 17, but I learned to love him and make him my life this past year.

What I’m asking here is, should I move on (obviously not the day after breaking up, but over time), or should I fight for our relationship and beg him to let me change and get better mentally and physically?

He really isn’t someone I want to let go. He means so much to me and my life.",05Jul2020,1

My mum has decided to have him stay over for 3 nights baring in mind we aren’t allowed to do that. I’ve tried talking to her but she just shouts at me and says “well everyone else can” or “well we don’t have it” I’ve asked her why couldn’t she just meet up outside and go for a walk or something but she shouted at me. I feel really bad about it and feel like I’m doing something bad. My brother also lives with his grandparents who are in their 60s one is diabetic.

Phew, so I don't really know where to even begin. I can't cover all the details cuz otherwise this will be a novel, but basically my mom (60) has been spending money pretty recklessly. Getting unnecessary tattoos, piercings, jewelry. She bought a purebred puppy last year (which she couldn't afford and had to ask for money from my other parent). She's been smoking weed now with terrible lungs, she's going to be having open heart surgery soon (like within a few weeks soon) and now she wants to adopt ANOTHER expensive purebred puppy.

She wont listen to ANY of us, not me, not my siblings, not my other mom. She cannot afford this dog, let alone how close it'll be to her surgery. Me (22) and my siblings are gonna be rotating taking care of her and I don't want to have to deal with potty training and keeping a baby puppy entertained as well.

but after he sexually harassed me at work, i had proof in texts, voicemails etc too- 
i broke down to my husband, we talked to my GM and the coworker was fired. 
after he was fired he called all the males in my office and told them i was lying but i had and still have the proof that he’s the groomer / been harassing me.

trying to make his way in. 
i left crying and called the police to make a report.

Last week we met for the first time in person and though I thought it went well, there was a bit of awkwardness and nothing other than conversation happened but it flowed really well and didn't feel forced. In the evening after our meet she text me and asked if we could be friends. She thinks i'm awesome, loves talking to me and wants me in her life but didn't feel a 'spark' on our first meeting so doesn't want to lead me on. 

It kind of devastated me. Everything about the month before we met in person went so well and I thought we connected so much, I was expecting to meet and instantly be all over each other but for any chance of romance to be gone in an afternoon felt utterly brutal. She said she understood if I didn't want to see her anymore but really wants to be friends, and I don't know how to move forward.

My problem now is that I really like this girl and I miss not chatting to her so much, but equally I don't know how to deal with wanting her romantically when she didn't feel a spark. I don't know what to do, as far as people go she is an amazing person and i'd love to be her friend but how do I get over not being more? If I'm her friend and she finds someone else, which she will do, how do I stop feeling destroyed by that?

I don't know if i'm asking for advice on how to move on or if there's anyway to repair the spark, I don't want to be a friend that's always pining for her, but I don't feel like I want her gone from my life.

Any advice will be massively appreciated. Thanks",05Jul2020,2

So theirs this female coworker. We both knew what we were doing since the beginning when both of us were catching feelings for each other and we both knew what would of happened if it didn’t work out. At this point we’re just cool but not sure if we’re friends because she told me “we can be cool at work but nothing beyond on that” and at this point we’re not talking. She did told me to back off and let my feeling fade away. It hard when her and I work together at the same time. I kinda want to make progress with her just because I do truly care about her and I grown attached to her son and it sucks not knowing I can hang out with the buddy. She did tell me that I add stress to her life but that’s because her baby daddy got involved in our relationship....so at this point I’m not sure if I should try anything like should i ask how her Fourth of July was ? I haven’t talked to her since Father’s Day. It sucks that whenever I do night shifts at work. She’s constantly on my mind and gives my anxiety every time I wake up thinking what if I did was wrong?

Hello people or reddit my brother and I are at an impasse and could really use some real advice. We're arguing about the comparison of 2 fields, Nursing vs IT. Now I know those are 2 different fields and you can't really compare them but bare with me here.

Nursing: As many already know, to become an RN, you’ll need a (ADN/BSN) degree to be able to sit for the NCLEX exam. Only once you pass the exam can you get your RN license in order to work. Most that pass the NCLEX will end up working as an RN, making X amount of money depending on their state. The next level after RN would most likely be NP which would require about 1-2 years more of schooling (MSN).

IT: On the other hand for IT. You can pursue a BSIT, and while doing so, you can take your CompTIA certifications whenever you’re done studying for them. The most preferable ones are the CompTIA trifecta (A+, Network+, and the Security+). You can even start working as soon as you’re done with the trifecta. You can pursue a masters in whatever route you choose, whether it’s the IT management route or the CyberSec Assurance.

The things that are vague to us and trying to get more insight on are: are entry level positions / titles and how stable they are, salary of positions, the number of job positions currently open for hiring, and last but not least the turnover rates for said positions.

Mom always used to show us how easy it is to leave 1 job and join another if she didn’t like it, while she was a PA. She also used to show us how companies would seek her out instead of the other way around. My brother is obsessed with those notions, because of how stable the medical field is. I on the other hand believe that the medical field isn’t the only field that’s like this, I know a friend of mine that was able to get a $75k SysAdmin job with the Security+ certification and navy experience. I also believe that there’s real growth and wealth in the IT field that can be achieved as you get more education and certifications. So if you’d be so kind to help us shed some light on the matter, we’d really appreciate it.",05Jul2020,2
950,"I'm on mobile, so the formatting might suck. TLDR at the bottom.

Basically, I'm in college (it's a bit different in my country than the US but it's somewhat comparable). I'm 22, she's 20 I think. Let's call her A. Last year was the first year of school for us and now it's summer break. I have depression and suspected autism, so I'm not good at talking to people and social interaction exhausts me a lot.

When the year started out, I befriended a girl (let's call her B). I then got sick for a week and A &amp; B started hanging out. I quickly realized that B was pretty mean to everyone and she started bullying me, sometimes in front of our classmates (my classmates are great and stood up for me). A continued to be her friend the entire time and sometimes joined in on the bullying. I could tell she wasn't that into it and she was nicer when B wasn't around, but she still took part.

We haven't had proper school since January because of an internship and then Covid. School only started again in late May and it was once a week. I guess A and B stopped being friends because they didn't have a chance to see each other outside of school, because they weren't really hanging out at school anymore. A actualy became pretty nice to me and obviously I was polite back because that's just human decency, but I don't think I ever gave her any indication that I wanted to be friends.

Since our break started a week ago she has texted me twice to ask if I wanna have a sleepover. The first time was pretty late so I used that as an excuse, but she texted me again tonight if I want to hang out tomorrow and stay the night and I have no idea what to say. I don't really want to hang out because she participated in bullying me and I don't really trust her. I've been bullied before and I know that if they turn friendly, they usually want something. But I also don't want to be rude because I'm going to have to see her again in the fall. I also don't think she's a bad person or anything, but I just can't get over how she treated me especially since she has had plenty of opportunites to apologize and hasn't done so.

Can anyone give me advice on what to say? I think I might just text her that because of Covid I can't come over (I see my grandma daily) and that my mom is pretty strict anyway (which she can be), but that's also pretty much just an excuse and I'm not sure if she'll get the hint.



TLDR: girl who was bffs with my bully and also bullied me herself wants to be friends, I don't want to, but I don't know how to politely tell her.",05Jul2020,3
952,"I know the title looks weird so i'll explain. Where i live there are 3 species of crayfish, 2 endangered and native - mud and noble crayfish and one widespread and invasive - striped crayfish. It was imported here in 1800s and he basicaly ravaged our lakes bringing noble and mud crayfish to the brink of extinction.

So there is a lake near to my house and there were never any crayfish there. But suddenly, this summer we started to notice more and more striped crayfish there, to the point where now you can't go to the beach without encountering at least a couple. I suspect there is so many of them because there were never crayfish there, so now they breed like crazy when there is plenty of food, and when the ecosystem stabilizes they will become much more rare.

So here where my dillema comes from. Where i live, boiled crayfish is a delicacy. I never tried it because it's only available at restaurants and is very expensive. Traditionally, noble and mud crayfish are more desirable since their meat is more tasty but i found online that striped one is quite good as well.

So basically, should i go on a striped crayfish killing spree and get enough of them to eat nothing but crayfish for a week, or is it immoral/uncool or something? They really suck, they basically came from other country and now are decimating our native species. Even the government says that if you accidentally catch it you are forbidden to release to stop them from spreading. So basically everyone thinks they shoud fuck off. So would i be justified if i performed this civic duty of cleansing the lake of illegal immigrants and eating them afterwards, or should i just let them live there?

Btw if you know any good recipes for crayfish let me know, i will have enough of those filthy pests to try them all.",05Jul2020,2

Resently people have thrown around the idea that i drink too much alone, I dont think i have a problem beacus drinking hasnt afeccted my work or my relastionship with my family. But I do drink often at home by myself after work and

druing the weekend. I have friends who would hang out with me if I just asked and I do hangout with them but I will always try to leave early even when camping I tried to leave at night without anyone noticing.

One of my friends is more direct with feeling and stuff and she asked me once when we were hangingout with a couple of friends ""Why dont you want to be our friend?"". That stuck with me and later I wanted to tell her

that I do want to be friends with them and I dont like being alone but I gave up on saying that pretty quick. Ive relized when we are hangingout with the ""Basic Hangout"" group I try and be a bit further from the fire or not really 

paying attention when they speak to me. Ive come to realize that I try and be distant because I want attention and now when I think about texting them I usually just delete it and call myself a attention seeking wh###. And now I

dont how to talk to them about my feelings without feeling like a asshole who seeks attention.

954,"I (25f) am going to try to keep this short but I think it needs a little background to explain why I feel the way I do. Working out or losing weight gives me so much anxiety. Before I met my ex (26M) I had lost 80 pounds, gained muscle, and was in love with my progress. I had shown him older photos of me at my highest weight and he would tell me that he would have never even talked to me if I was still that weight. And I should mention that I still had about 40 pounds to lose to truly be at a good weight.

Over the next year he would come home from work and tell me, ""people wonder why I am dating you because of how you look."" He always thought he was settling for me and he was god's gift to the planet. He was overweight as well, which i feel is important to add. I had started to gain some of my weight back which happens in relationships and decided to focus on the gym again. He would go with me and correct every single thing I did, even if i had proper form. He just made me feel like everything I was doing was wrong and was going to hurt me.

About two years in my mental health had dropped to the lowest it had ever been. And I was gaining weight because I coped by eating. Well at a time I was going to discuss my mental health and how he can help, he thought it was the perfect time to tell me I had gained too much weight and he wasn't attracted to me anymore.

I have since broken up with him but I am struggling so much to get back to who I was. Even the thought of the gym makes me extremely anxious. I have even been struggling to just go out and do things because I don't want people to see how much weight I have gained. I am actually now the heaviest I have ever been.

How in the world do I cope with all of this? I feel like I am hiding and too afraid to go out and change anything about my life. Any advice would be amazing.

957,"A year and a half ago I was dating a girl that I will call Lily and while I was dating this girl, I met another one that I will call Rose.

While I was dating Lily I was developing a nice friendship with Rose. After some time Rose told me that she wanted a relationship with me. At first I was conflicted because I didn't immediatly realized what was going on and what I was feeling for her. I had to take a decision between Rose and Lily. I chose Lily and told Rose that I wasn't feeling the same way with her. After few weeks things went to shit with Lily, so basically I found myself losing two people that I liked. Obviously enough I started regretting not chosing Rose and I found myself thinking about her for 8 months and then, after those 8 months, I kinda managed to reconnect with her (we didn't see or speak with each other for those 8 months). This March, I confessed my feelings and told her the whole story, about the decision and the fact that I couldn't stop thinking about her for almost a year. She was surprised and everything made sense to her. We started writing each other until a week ago for about 4 months, when we finally managed to see each other after the pandemic (from march to june we couldn't see each other because of it). 

Now, after 3 ""dates"" she told me that she realized she is not interested anymore in me. I'm devastated. I really cared about her and I really wanted a relationship with her, because I felt something different and ""higher"" compared to what I felt for Lily or for any other woman I dated before. Something unique.

And here's the actual problem: I feel like I was dating Lily just because I needed to fill something missing in me, or because I wasn't happy with my life and through ""random"" relationships maybe I could fix these problems. But it is obviously not true.

So, to wrap everything up, my question is: how can I be satisfied with my life without the need of ""forced"" relationships? I don't want to miss another opportunity like Rose just because I can't distinguish between true feelings and the random monthly crush.

I hope I made myself clear, probably I forgot some important bits of the story, but I think that the final question should be enough. Sorry in advance for any grammatical error. I hope that this post fill in this sub; I was thinking about r/relationship_advice but technically this is not a relatinship, so...

He went to college for Law and Justice and spent four years there, got a degree, and trained for about a year at his police station. He's not the type to ever abuse his power, he normally just does road jobs or tracks down a road racer. I think it's really cool that most of his work is done undercover, too. His proudest accomplishment to this day was when he arrested one of his own friends (ex-friend now) for attempting to sell him drugs over the internet.

Now, most of you already know or have heard of the protests and conflict happening in America. I'm all for Black Lives Matter, I agree that racial profiling is not acceptable and neither is racism in general, and I know damn well that our president isn't helping very much. But on the other hand, I'm not one to talk about politics and go to protests because 1) I am only 14, 2) my parents are white boomers, and 3) my brother is a cop.

I really want to support BLM, a lot of my friends openly support it on their social medias. But I sort of held back for a while because I'm just so torn. I sign petitions, and I occasionally post on my socials about it, but not as much as others and I don't know when I end up in the wrong.

Rubbing his feet, grabbing him drinks/foods to be served while he sits watching Tv, asking me to help with my younger siblings M12 and F15, but in a way that’s like parenting. It’s made my sister resent me. She has severe mental health problems that are either dismissed or scaled down. My mom tries to stand up for me with it, but he accuses her of taking my side. He lets my siblings get away with pure laziness, while expecting me to be perfect. I’m just so frustrated.

First, my parents have suspected this on some level since I was a child but they are very religious so they do not support homosexuality. After I came out my mom took it particularly hard, for example, she would come into my room early in the morning and pray by my bed while crying. It would pretend to be asleep but she would pray that I would change.

The real issue is that my mom thinks I am gay because of sexual assault/rape. The thing is, I have never been sexually abused. Ever. My dad luckily believes me but my mom thinks this must be the ""reason"" that I am like this. I know that sometimes people who have experienced trauma suppress their memories and even though deep down in my heart I know I have never experienced this, my brain keeps asking ""what if?"" and I get so much anxiety just thinking about it. 

It is really hurting my mental health since my mom would rather think I was abused and not even help me than rather accept her daughter for who she is. I feel so much resentment  towards her and I can't even be mad because I get in trouble for calling her out on shit. I can't even talk to her about how much it hurts me because she'll probably still think I was abused.

None of us really thought anything of it, she is the youngest of our group, so we never let her smoke with us when we used to last year, and so despite us all stopping, we couldn't blame her for wanting to see what it was about.


She's always been a bit of a wild card, constantly talking about how the government is all corrupt and how all police are evil and can't be trusted, so we didnt see anything out of character of her wanting to be ""rebellious"" like how she saw it. 


I told her about the dealer in our school and told her the basics, be careful, dont do too much, make sure you're somewhere safe, blah blah blah. We we're with her the first time she got high and needless to say, it did not go great. She took way too much, lost her wallet with loads of money and cried for 2 hours non stop in the middle of a train station. 


After that she took a break, however two weeks later she informed us she had gotten more. From then onwards she would smoke about once every week or so, and sometimes before school, nothing really too concerning. 


Then once quarentine came, she started getting high more and more,smoking cigarettes and getting drunk inbetween. It got to the point where if we went outside she would keep her eyes on the floor looking for cigarettes she could use that people had dropped, and she had hidden bottles of vodka in a forest, her mums and her dads. 


I dont know the details but i know at some point her parents found out, and she argued with her mum and went to stay with her dad, who was much more supportive about this. 


Time skip to now. She gets high at least once a day, drinking and smoking cigarettes inbetween. She's meeting the wrong kind of people, and just today she informed us that she had met a man named Michael (who was over 18), who offered to buy her cigarettes and get her weed for free if she went to his blues concert. She lied and said she was 18 and lost her ID, but trust me when i say she does NOT look 18. Shes looking into buying more intense drugs, like ecstasy, and we haven't had a conversation with her where she wasn't high or talking about drugs in about a month. 


While I know this is nothing too bad right now, she has always been very naive, and I see her as a little sister. She's so smart and intelligent, with the highest grades in her year and in the top 5% in the county for her math scores. Me and my friends don't want to see her throw this all away and wanna help limit her somehow, but we have no clue as to how.

It’s got to a point where I only trust one person other then family. It’s someone online, but someone real. Only he actually understands and relates to me. I’ve known him for 2 years and he’s made me happy like no one else has. People say “it’s online, it’s nothing” yet he’s the only one I feel comfortable talking to. Someone I can trust.

I have called my manager(s) several times, they tell me they do not have access to my banking info and they can’t help me. 
They’ve given me several numbers to call one of which isn’t even in service. 
When I call is the people on the phone tell me I have to talk to my manager and get them to email HR/payroll yet when I talk to my manager(s) they say they can’t help and to call the number.
I was supposed to get payed 9 days ago and I’ve been running my ass off getting bounced around trying to figure out why I haven’t received my money/where it’s gone. 
I swear this has to be someone else’s job? Why should I as a new associate/employee have to figure this out?
The managers have given no condolences or advice, it really seems like they don’t care about resolving this one bit. 
What should I do? No one at the company is willing to help me resolve this, I’m 18 this is my third job and I have no idea how this stuff works... I’m thinking I should just quit and forget about the pay check? However I don’t think I can walk away so easily, it infuriates me to think Ive wasted more than 50 hours of my life working for free - that is not what I signed up for.

994,"Hello

I know this might not sound like a problem that i should get my hands on at all, or even where i should post this, but i was having an anxiety attack prior to writing this, , but time is ticking. But i have emotionally connected to this girl and i can't let her to go back to her family. The details (I will refer to my friend as R, and her mom as M): My best friend started to date this girl from a different town (it ain't that far). Everything was fine and dandy he didn't really notice anything wrong with her, only that her delivery is a bit cold or may sound very passive aggressive, i most certainly noticed and just thought that she is just a bit rude. But as it turns out as many things it stems from her home, family and surroundings.

 Apparently, her mom is a full blown alcoholic and i say this without a shadow of a doubt a full blown sociopath. No i'm not saying this because it would make my story more dramatic, she bullseyes every single tick when i looked up the key factors to recognize a sociopath. I went to her home once, and me and her boyfriend were bombarded with rude remarks and i didn't fully understand was this some sort of joke i'm not in on yet, but when i started to notice the way she talked with R, full of curse words, calling her a bitch, slut basically any horrible thing you can say to your offspring. It was a really horrible expirience, but then i got some more details. Apparently M does not work anywhere, she survives off R and her sisters disability checks, constantly verbally abuses her (And i'm not sure but i think she told her boyfriend that she was physically abused by her aswell). M really hates R boyfriend, because he is not rich and doesn't buy her alcohol (R had an ex that was a drug dealer and was good friends with M, used to buy her alcohol and drink together. On topic of that M does not hide the fact that she incredibly cares only about herself, and even tried to convince R to get back with her ex even tho he was a complete fuckhead who didn't leave R alone and kept calling her for months after they broke up. Obviously because she will have someone to buy her alcohol.) I heard enough to understand that M is a sociopath, there are no social norms for her, she shows no remorse nor empathy, is fueled by only her own needs, does not think of consequences ( very obviously) is really aggressive (not physically but verbally: Shouts on R all the time when we were there, even angrily answering to our non important questions).

 I think i established that this is pretty f\*\*ked up, and i wouldn't believe it if i wasn't there. Anyways R is riddled with health complications, i think is autistic, but she is such a sweet girl, innocent and naive and not that bright. And my friend just admitted that he doesn't love her, and well it's because he felt like she would be a burden to him. I was quick to correct him that really he has the option to just end it, but he is really thinking only about himself, and well he admitted that the feelings have faded (not to bash on my friend, but i hate that so much) This weekend R was with her boyfriend at his place with his family and she seems to be shunned by his family for being riddled with complications and not ""bright"", but very politely as i understood ( that influenced his view about the whole thing for sure.) So he is planning to tell her how he is feeling today or tomorrow, and because he has a job and that's not his property but his parents, he is gonna drive her home, while being in denial that she just hyperbolizes her problems for pity, but i'm sure this is serious and that's her best way of crying for help that she does not want to go back there. 

Ok, so i'm really heartbroken by this very very badly and i want do to whatever it takes to save her from that. because i live with my parents currently, i cannot decide anything and i don't work anywhere (yet.) i was planning to rent an flat and just live for as much as i could, i do have some money under my belt, but i'm not sure if i could secure my financial stability in upcoming months.

I'm really at a loss here, and i just need some ideas to help me either cope with this or to save her from bullshit.

P.s : This is in Lithuania so any eastern european people would understand how difficult this could be.

997,"My (F28) boyfriend (M26) of 2 months and I both live in the Netherlands. His dad lives in Curacao and he hasn't seen him in about a years time or something. Now we've talked about us going there (and  other locations for vacation) sometime before, giving me the impression he would want to take me to meet his dad. 

He just mentioned that hes probably going to go see him during this summer for about 2 weeks. But didn't really give me any more information. I told him I was happy for him that he will be able to see his dad again, and asked him if he was planning on going alone. 

He just said that he doesn't think he would want to bring me with him because we've only been official for about 2 months now. 

I am a very insecure person because of past experiences, and I am aware I can sometimes overreact. 

Him wanting to go without me for 2 weeks makes me feel sad or like he doesn't take this relationship as serious as I do. I know 2 months isn't a very long time yet, but when I make something official with someone, I do that because I trust them and want to create a future with them. I would've taken him with me if I was going on a trip to see my dad, because we're not ""just dating"" anymore.

998,"She critizes me everyday, the words I use, clothes, weight, etc, acording to her standars. Not she's probably not as bad as you might image her, but she will say one or two comments on it daily, sometimes she'll turn it into a fight because (for obvious reasons I like those words and or clothes). I am tired of it, and if I call her out on any of that she's always the victim, saying I never agree with her, that I'm disagreeing on purpose, yada, yada. 

It's infuriating, and even more so that it's starting to affect me. Quarantine started in May here, so I spend 99% of my time at home. Instead of doing any past self-harm method I eat now, and since I no longer use to move as much I barely burn any calories seeing as I'm sitting down from 8h00 - 17h00, sometimes till 18h00 or more because of work. I've gained some weight, but I'm not obese, nor was I am or am I skinny. Now that I see her every day at least twice a day she'll call me fat and refers to me as someone who is on her way to be 300-500 pounds, my brother is also an asshole that mocks me about it. I am nowhere near that weight, but the fact that I've been hearing it every day for months has started to impact me, I look in the mirror and holy shit, I look so fucking disgusting, I can't find the motivation to excersise everyday, or to strict diet. I'm really starting to feel obese. I bought some panties the other day, I asked myself if I should change to XL (FYI - Did not need to go near XL), but that's how much it's starting to get to me.   


My self-steem is pretty much shattered, has decreased my libido, and I no longer feel sexy enough to send pictures to bf, althoguh It does not help that boyfriend likes lewd anime on twitter (shows up on timeline every now and then, not a stalker), makes me feel as if they're both right, that I'm in fact ugly, obese and unwanted.   


I guess the advice I'm looking for is: 

* How do I find the motivation to workout-eat moderately? 
* How do I get my self-steem back
* How do I make her understand that **a)** we just have different points of view and **b)** That her calling me fat doesn't ""help"" or ""motivate"" me at all?  - Some context on this last question, I did tell her once to please stop it as it is not helping me and her answer was ""Well, you're not listening to me, so I keep telling you that"". 

&amp;#x200B;

Ps: Yes, she has told me to excersise too. For: Society or other people, to get a better job (Before my current job, because apparently you can't get a good job if you're not ""skinny""), and lastly for health.",05Jul2020,1
1000,"I have been dating this dude for almost three months and well.....I recently found out that he has been struggling with depression. I then tried to follow up with him about it and asked if he was okay. But his only response was send me news article. i am just as concerned about the stare of the world as he is but when my boyfriend says he is struggling with mental health.....i am sorry but that takes top priority. And then expressed these feelings to him but he then proceeded to tell me not to worry about it because he has been talking to professionals and his best friend about it. He told me that he just doesn’t like talking about it. I asked him if that was the case....why has he been going to his friend and admitted that it made him feel better? He said it was out of necessity and he has known his friend for years.

I mean, as someone who has dealt with depression.... it broke my heart when I heard about his failing mental health and I am worried sick about him. I also felt like a bad girlfriend fo not noticing it before. And it kind of hurt me that he has been talking to his best friend this whole time about it but never came to me about it. I mean, if he wants to talk to his friend about that’s fine.....but why did he keep me in dark this whole time?! Why can’t he talk to me every once in a while about it too? I mean, I am supposed to be his girlfriend. Not only is it my job to help in his time of need but he also knows that I struggle with depression myself. And I hate to say this....but it kind of made me slightly jealous of the friend who he has been talking to. I mean, what does this friend have that I don’t have that made him go talk to the friend instead of me.

God so many emotions are running through me.

1007,"I run into disagreements with a band member all the time. He’s one of my best friends but we but heads a lot, the most when it comes to the music we make. Not so much the music itsself, but the avenues we use to promote it.

The difference between him and I is that I’ve been in the music industry for a long time (about 10 years), understanding the business and understanding how money is made and what the obstacles are. I have a more realistic understanding of how it works, what is ultimately important, and how to manage realistic expectations.

For most of his life he has made it a point to not really interject himself into situations where he could learn. 

Just recently we started making music again. I’ve filled him in with how social media works (which just a month ago, he was telling me ‘didn’t matter’ for our music to succeed)

There are a couple promotional services and platforms we started using that I know are highly beneficial and valuable at our stage. With four hands, we can knock out more work and get a great boost out of them. The problem is that we used them once, and only once. He’s already telling me he doesn’t see the value in them, so he does not want to participate in them.

His rebuttal is: “I don’t see the value in it, so don’t expect me to participate. I’ll do other things” also saying that I can’t expect him to do things my way all the time.

For me, I don’t mind doing things other people’s ways. My problem is that the things I’m doing I KNOW will HELP us. It’s clear that his understanding is limited. So  we should at least implement them until he’s caught up to speed, and THEN he’ll have the authority to determine what’s valuable and invaluable.

Anyways. How do I deal with this? We just started and his stubborn-ness to participate and see the value that is clearly there, is making me feel like I don’t want to participate and/or participate less. He wont bite the bullet for the better. It’s self-defeating for the group as a whole. How do I deal with this? Do I stop trying? Do I put in the work on those platforms? Do I stop doing music with him?",05Jul2020,1
1008,"
For a little bit of context
Replacing my name with Tatu*
 My parents are JWs 
 My mom is a Nurse for a Morton clinic*
 Typing this on mobile, there may be a lot of grammatical errors.*

 I was 17 turning 18.* also my birthday is July 4th*

The story starts (around 3 am) July 3rd when my best friend invited me to her family friend's birthday which coincidentally was my birthday as well. We had been together for her's last year together and she wanted me to be there for this years as well. And me being the optimist I am figured I would be able to go and my parents wouldn't mind me going either. So I told her that I'd probably be able to go and eventually we decided to head to bed and I figured I would ask them tomorrow morning to see if they would let me go. To my surprise, I got this as a response

Their reply to me asking: ""I know this is not what you want to hear, but need to pass on this. You start work on Monday and have a driving class next weekend so can't afford the extra risks right now. Plus there's a problem with my health insurance I need to fix to make sure you and (my twin brother) are covered - Sorry I know it's disappointing and sucks""

When I read this it made me feel like complete shit, it made me realize the type of people they are. It's been like that my whole life and I hardly ever get to do anything with the people that I choose. It reminded me of a time when I couldn't go to a trampoline park because our house was ""messy"". I find it more ironic they blame COVID because my mom went to the store for popsicles 10 minutes earlier. I was done with it.

I replied with this: I can't just go, I get that Corona exists and health and safety but its ultimately unfair for me, it's always been like this I feel like I'm mentally damaged because of things like this it isn't only disgusting, mentally disturbing, and world-shattering it damages not only my mental state and my reputation as a person. (a lot of people are expecting me to show up) I know I have a lot, I've always had to balance a lot. It feels to me like what I want to do is always on the side it doesn't matter I feel dehumanized. I feel like I should ignore people because every time I reach out and want to do something some unorthodox things like this happens. I virtually never complain because it will do nothing. I sit and do nothing because I feel I will accomplish nothing. It just hurts.

To that I got this :
 Come back and talk to me, I don't want you to feel hurt and dehumanized and when you talk or speak up it does help. I never claim to be a perfect parent but I'm trying to do the best I can. You're at the point now where you'll be able to do more and more of your preferences - and if it wasn't for Corona and the risks associated you would be able to go today. You have a bright future ahead of you Tatu, don't let a temporary decision turn into permanent consequences. I wish you going was a good decision, I even asked you the other day about how you felt being stuck in the house. Adults like me are going through the same thing. There's a reason why we don't go to the Kingdom Hall, or out in service anymore - or even to over to people's houses or restaurants
Your mental health and your physical health are both important to me.

So eventually I went back to their room only to be told that COVID exists. So I left their room without a word said to them. I went to my room and just sat and thought for a bit. I was morally conflicted and having a mental breakdown. So I conclude just to call it off and tell her to not come to get me, but she refused. And enunciated the idea that it's my birthday. Nobody should have to sit inside to something like this ever. Then my brain started thinking they're things you just have to do. With that, I left despite my parents, telling me no. For a while, my stomach hurt there was no winning for me if I went or if I didn't.

Eventually, we ended up at their house where they were having the party and I was able to enjoy myself for a while until I got a text from my dad asking if I went anyway

I replied with: Yes, it was extremely bothersome to me it just really hurt me a lot. It was a lot to take in and the way things went makes my stomach feel bad. In my head I was telling myself there are things I just have to do, the past few hours has just been an emotional rollercoaster for me. I understand that's you might see me leaving as something wrong but it would've bothered me. It's been an itching feeling for a long time. Before I left I was in my room crying wondering what am I going to do as either way there was no winning for me. I know I have a lot with driving and working... it's just really got to me. Sorry

And to his reply
So the issue is, it's not just your health and safety you put at risk. If you can pass this on without having symptoms. So your basically telling us you hanging out with people more important than our jobs, health, and everything else. When you make it home you need to shower and go directly to your room.

And so today nothing has happened, apparently, I can't get on my computer until next Sunday and honestly I'm considering moving out. I still feel mentally damaged and I'm thinking about getting some sort of therapy. The problem with both of these is money and I didn't get to make many friends during high school due to my parents being JWs. I'm quite lost and just need help.",05Jul2020,1

A week ago, I confessed to him after his birthday (we were out at a bar) and he didnt say anything. He sent me a text 2 days later tho saying I was very courageous bla bla bla but that he rly liked the way we were and wants to stay friends.

He keeps  making me think of him just when I start to move on.

I dont wanna cut him off because in the back of my head I do still think we will meet again someday. I really love him and I feel like he feels same (cuz his actions say so) but wouldnt admit it.

1011,"I wanted to ask your opinion. Should there be boundaries on movies,series or even animation on what content they can and cannot make? Is a movie on teacher-student relation be acceptable? or A movie on incest? A movie glorifying mysogyny or even rape? Surely Movies are a result of reality and reflect society but the opposite is also true sometimes. Movies do affect society. I am not able to make my mind if everything should be accepted because people should have a rational mind to understand what is correct and what not OR or their should be a boundary because people in India or infact the whole world are not same,some think with brain and some with heart.

1012,"i had an abusive boyfriend with an asian fetish. as the relationship went on he made me more and more into his picture perfect anime/kpop girl. he would send me pictures of anime girls to recreate. he would play kpop music videos and tell me which one was “me”. he would tell me how much he hated the chinese (i am chinese) but how beautiful korean girls are. and many more things to fetishize me which i didn’t realize were abusive. when he would tell me “look at me” during sex it was my favorite thing, but now i see it wasnt because they were MY eyes, it’s because they were asian. 

now every time i see a beautiful asian girl i hate it. i get so mad. i look at her as competition. I DON’T ENJOY THIS! i used to adore seeing asian girls included in shows, ads, etc. because they were like me! but now all that runs through my head is “he would fuck her over me” it’s terrible.

I told her I need to think a bit more about the whole situation and grasp my thoughts. I wanted to, BUT DID NOT, suggest for her to be careful of men when drinking is involved as some use that as a way to make it easier to sexually assault woman.

1026,"yesterday was the fourth of july, and instead of celebrating like everyone else in america, i wore all black and didn’t celebrate due to my beliefs of the country. one of my friends noticed and got hostile. 

when i was questioned, i simply said i didn’t want to celebrate, and he got extremely volatile and instantly resorted to harassing me when i asked him why he disagreed with my opinion so much. i attempted to deescalate the situation, with no such luck. he took screenshots of the conversation, cropped and edited them to make me look bad, and then posted them without my consent. he cut out the parts of him being hostile and harassing me and only posted my responses. he then took screenshots from a conversation with someone else, edited them and cropped them so it appeared as though i said it, and then posted those as well. 

the things he was posting from other conversations and claiming i said them included racial slurs, as well as homophobic and transphobic language, and clear derogatory terms to women and minorities in america. i have never said anything like that in my life. he attempted to paint me as a racist, a homophobe and transphobe, as well as sexist and misogynistic. i’m the furthest thing from racist, i’m literally queer and trans, and i was born female, so i can’t be misogynistic or sexist. 

throughout all of that, he was also deadnaming me and misgendering me despite me being out to him the whole time i’ve known him (since september of last year). when i asked him to take the posts down because he did not have my consent and i did not want him deadnaming me and effectively outing me, he blocked me on the spot. he then spread lies about me to his girlfriend, who happens to be my best friend. 

whenever someone asked him to take the posts down either because they knew they weren’t true or because they didn’t want him outing me, he would tell them to “f*ck off” followed by a slur, and then block them before they could take a screenshot. 

i realized last night that i could potentially take legal action against him since he is 18 and i am a minor (not stating my age for safety purposes). i was unable to obtain screenshots of his story and our conversation because he blocked me, but i’m sure my friends can. 

is there any way for me to take legal action against him? he tagged me in those posts and his friends came and harassed me and told me to k*ll myself and a lot of slurs, but they all blocked me before i could get proof of it. it’s caused me a lot of mental pain and it left me sick to my stomach multiple times today.

1030,"I wouldn’t describe my relationship with either of my parents as complicated. My father is a simple man. Him and my mother split when I was 5 because they’re both same sex attracted so that’s just how it’s always been for me. My sisters experienced him as an angry man early on, but to me - I was always daddy’s little girl. I would describe him as any American sitcom dad. He likes cars and collects matchbox cars, he likes television shows; pretty much a mash of anything and everything. He likes food and going out to eat - but like, beyond that he just exists. He works two jobs and always has - he’s trying to get down to 1.

I work 40 hours a week and live about 45 minutes from him. He works day shift, I work evening shifts. One of our days off coincides - but I’m always doing something that one day. I like reading and writing; two things my dad never really liked or understood, as well as video games. He likes Crash bandicoot and candy crush. I’m really religious - he really isn’t. I tell him about big things - like my engagement, promotion, moving out, etc. but I don’t talk to him about day to day things - nor do I really talk about personal things with him, as he isn’t very in tune with emotions. When my fiancé and I broke up for a couple months, he was like - move on, you’ll find someone else. I know he cares and loves me, but emotions are hard for him.

He thinks I like my stepdad more - but honestly, I just talk to him more because he’s easier to talk to. He will carry a conversation himself. He’s also
Easier to talk to with emotions - we also both enjoy reading, journaling, and some video games. He’s been helping me plan decor choices at my wedding because he’s been in the industry before and my dad doesn’t care much about decor.

My father is very sensitive. He cares about us deeply and he shows his affection through money. Last summer we went to a water park as a family which was a lot of fun! My dad struggles with patience and overstimulation which turns to anger quickly in those situations so he isn’t always “there” during these trips, but he tries. Everyday, he looks at a picture of my sisters, my nephew (his grandson), and my fiancé.

I guess we both need to bend - but I don’t want him to feel like I like anyone better than him. My parents screwed up a lot along the way - but that’s my father and I love him very much! I want to share more of my life with him, but I really don’t know how since we both feel so different than each other. Any advice? Especially from fathers themselves?",05Jul2020,2
1031,"Long story short, my mother was extremely emotionally abusive growing up. There was little to no physical affection at all. No hugs, cuddles, kisses, nothing.  My childhood was spent trying to not make my mother upset while also trying to earn her love/attention. My father was passive and did nothing to protect me. My mother is also extremely manipulative and was very skilled at turning herself into the victim. Nothing is ever her fault.  I didn’t realize my upbringing was abnormal until I met my husband and saw how other families interact. 

So now I’ve moved away (best thing I’ve done for my mental health), gotten married, and had two children. Even tho my family was “off”, we did family vacations, my parents went to my sports games, they went to PTA meetings etc. We were oddly close in that regard. Anyhoo, I do not enjoy my family. I don’t look forward to their visits at all- it’s just stressful for me. But yet, I feel obligated to remain in contact with them because they’re my parents. My kids are their grandchildren. 

Also, I do not think either of my parents have any real sort of idea of the emotional and mental pain they’ve caused me. If I just up and cut ties, I think it’ll seem completely out of left field to them.  I recently just started therapy to work on my self esteem issues and my current inability to really connect or empathize with others. And to also deal with my mama drama. Also, I do not believing telling my mother what she did to me will be helpful in any regard— I don’t believe she will ever take responsibility and instead she’ll turn herself into a victim and make *me* feel bad for saying “she was a bad mother” 🙄 (even if I never say those words...)

So how do you know if/when to walk away? How can I overcome this feeling of obligation to please them and include them in my life as an adult? Any advice at all? I’m tired of dreading their visits. I’m tired of forcing/faking my way through Xmas gifts, bday gifts, etc.

1032,"Throwaway account since my friends know my main.

&amp;#x200B;

Apologies for the long post in advance, I have a bit of a rant/also asking if there's anything I can do regarding this situation.

For some background info: Yesterday my 2 friends and I decided to drive almost 3 hours to go to the beach and have a fun day swimming, shopping, getting dinner, etc. It was getting late so we decided to go for a walk on the pier to watch some fireworks then head home. At the pier we met 3 guys and some other people around our age (18-20) and ultimately decided to go hang out with these 3 guys and party a bit. We took our own car to the guy's house and at first, everything seemed normal. The guys were sweet and funny, and honestly cute. The oldest guy (20yo, I'll refer to him as guy #1) said we could drive over to his house instead since we could chill and smoke in his garage and thinking that sounded more fun, we said yes. Upon arrival is where things started getting really strange:

&amp;#x200B;

Within the first 5 minutes of being at guy #1's house, his friend (guy #2) pulls out a rifle and asks if we wanted to shoot it. We were really weirded out by this and said no, but he insisted and instead aimed the gun at the woods and fired 2 shots randomly (especially weird considering guy #1's parents AND 4 MONTH OLD DAUGHTER were home)? We just ignored this and instead headed to the garage to sit down and smoke. Guy #2 continued to talk about guns, all the ammo he had, and said he needed it to protect himself since ""black people didn't like him"". Not realizing one girl in our friend group was half-black, he continued to talk about saying the n-word and increasingly made us uncomfortable. Upon realizing my friend was black, he said ""I knew there was something different about you"" and it was so off-putting and distasteful. (Side note: Throughout the night this guy kept going on about how his father was the Mayor and his grandpa was the Chief of police, therefore he never got in trouble with the law/cops). We tried to let it slide since at this point it was clear we were all a little nervous, so we joked around/made conversation. Somehow or another, my friend made a dick joke and guy #1 then proceeded to show my 2 friends a picture of his penis and gloat about how big it was. While guy #3 had barely said anything at this point, he laughed it off and just said "" damn guy #1, you just don't give a fuck do you?"" and they all laughed it off thinking their friend was cool or badass or something. I could tell my friends felt disgusted and even scared at this point. The guys still continued to hit on us even though it was clear we were on-edge the whole time. The last 5-10 minutes was so uncomfortable as we were trying to find an excuse to leave and it was almost midnight at this point. Finally, I stood up and gave us an out, where we then said goodbye and got in the car and were all like ""what the fuck just happened"". During the car ride home I discovered they had been just uncomfortable as I was, and my one friend (who was the mixed girl earlier in the story) admitted she felt like we were going to get shot at one point. Honestly, there was a moment where I had a genuine fear we were going to get hurt, and the whole ride home I felt a little shaky. They didn't seem intentionally malicious, but the whole experience was a little traumatizing. Am I right for feeling this way? Or am I overreacting? It seems at this point my friends are over talking about it but I still feel upset about the whole thing. Is there anything I can even do about this?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: My 2 friends and I met 3 guys at the pier and went to party with them at one of the guy's houses. Once there, one of the guys pulled out his gun and continued to talk about racist slurs and how he has called black people the n-word. His friend showed my friends his dick pic without their consent. Is there anything I can do about this situation? How do I feel better about it?",05Jul2020,2

So I was out of town for a couple of days and came back to a black baby kitten sitting at my window. I live on a ground floor and I guess it's easily accessible for a cat to climb up and sit there.

Kitty climbed back up tho.
I already have a cat and I leave the window open cause he likes to look outside. There's a mosquito net so he can't get out, too. So now they just lie next to each other and purr and they talk or whatever cats do and the mosquito net between them.

However, my co-worker and friend has told me that my boss has told other staff members that I left because I was in love with another staff member twice my age who left just before lockdown, about three months before I left. The context here is that another co-worker started this rumour after a minor disagreement with me about a year ago. I dealt with the rumour at the time, and informed my boss that it had a very strong impact on my mental health, and consequently my physical health.

Last year I got out of a terrible long-term relationship. It was particularly awful in its last two years, and it ended when he left me, and he married someone 9 years his junior 2 months later. I've recently started seeing a therapist, partly for things related to the relationship, and probably for other things. I just remembered something today, and I'm not sure if it's worth talking to my therapist about (I don't want to waste her time). I'm at the point where I'm trying to figure out what parts of our relationship were abuse and what were not (he always told me that I was abusing him ... my therapist is helping me work through this, he was a HUGE gaslighter, and I struggling to make proper sense of what happened). My ex got me into smoking weed a bit, and I especially used to make use of it to help myself fall asleep at night time (I struggle with anxiety). He would often strongly encourage me to get as stoned as possible before turning in or, sometimes he would encourage me to get drunk, or both. He typically would not partake himself, or would only drink or smoke very small amounts. Sometimes when this happened he would initiate sex. Now, I REALLY don't like anal play. It's just not my thing, I personally find it embarrassing and uncomfortable (not judging people who do like it, you do you). My ex was aware of this and was told on multiple occasions. However, when he was successful in getting me extremely drunk or stoned, he would finger my as*****. I feel like he probably completely inserted his fingers on some occasions, but I don't actually properly remember because as I said he would make sure I was extremely stoned or drunk first. I never stopped him, even though I hated it and it made me feel awful every time he did it. I always just kind of sucked it up because I knew he liked it and I knew it would be over quickly. I know what he did really wasn't great, but does it count as assault?

I'm just trying to work out what parts of our relationship were wrong and which were not.

My mother passed away 3 years ago, then I lost the person I loved the most, my business went down due to multiple causes (grief, depression from loss, more competition etc.). I also got into some debt, although not huge and I could not longer sustain myself fully in my country. Doctors caused me chronic face skin and eye issues to add on top of that and I became suicidal.  
My father insisted a lot I should go to another country to start over, but I never really wanted that and I always felt I had to push myself. I tried to make it more attractive thinking about money and that maybe I can solve my issues with my health there.   
I landed in this new country in November 2019 and although I was living with a relative we really didn't get along and she was sometimes rude or stressful. Then  the lock down came and I lost my income again, as little as it was. My relative took over, and what I understood that was an act of good will, she said that it was a misunderstanding and that I owe her many months' rent and bills. I always expected to pay the bills but I hoped she'd understand about the rent. In the beginning I told her that that was the best I could to at the moment and if it was not ok with her, I would understand and I'd just go back to my country because I don't want to get into debt, and now I am about 3800 pounds or 4700 dollars into that.   
I developed heart issues because of stress since I am in this country.

I wanted to leave home before but there were no flights to my country and only later  did I find out you could ask for a special flight from the embassy. 

In May I got a contract with a famous fashion brand in sales, and they paid me partially from their own money for May and June. Again, they set their eyes on me, but since it's retail and I hate it, I never really wanted it. At this point I was crazily missing home, things were deteriorating with the relative and all I wanted was to go home, but I was afraid that what if I didn't make it with my business again, then what I would do?  
Then more stress followed as the company said it would have to fire people and then decided to give us some money, like a few thousands, if we renounce ourselves. I was happy to hear that on one side, and I considered to apply for that, since it was enough to pay a good part of my debt to my relative and also live off at home for a bit, and maybe I could start my business again.   
However, I don't know what happened, I hesitated and my stupid survival brain took over, as in oh my gosh, what if I won't make it again in my own country so I did not apply for that money, which I regret it now, because I was thinking all I could do with it.  
Now relative also wants me to move, which is extremely stressful. I keep going in circles in my head, between asking to HR to reconsider and also give me that voluntary leaving funds, but probably I can't take it anymore since the term expired. Then I wanna shoot myself for missing that. Then I hesitate from bringing up this stuff because I am thinking, yes but what will you do back in your country? And also I am thinking maybe I will be able to solve some of my face issues in this country, but the health system is so slow, my appointment took 8 months and it's only in October.  
I feel my mental health slipping away, I feel alone and like an alien in a society that seems so foreign and that I share with no common elements, I am stressed, undecided, I haven't gotten really over my old relationship, but he is also in a different country now, I am in my mid thirties and I am thinking I don't want to grow old here being a seller in retail. I keep thinking about my old days as a small business person in my country and how I enjoyed the freedom and independence.  How here I have none of that. 

I am and feel alone here, with no one close, no real life friends, no boyfriend, people are already having kids and here I am. I just want a break from all the stress, I don't know which choice to make.  I keep driving myself crazy and in circles and I drive the people around me crazy too. I am afraid of failing home, I am thinking I should have taken the offer and pay the debts..  
I am thinking that here I have a job and it could be more stable, but then again not, if a company goes bust and that it will take me months and months to pay my debt, that even if I work here I am not left with much. I feel I will be alone forever and feel confused and suicidal.   
I contacted and ex that I loved a  lot and still have feelings for. We broke up 2 years ago, but this spring we spoke again and he said we can talk, and that he hopes to meet me again one day, and yet, my message was only ''sent'' on Facebook, even though we are in each other's friend list and it devastated me again.   
I feel like I can't take anymore the stress. I don't know what to do, which decision to take. I want to go home but I am afraid I won't make there, but I hate it here. I also am hoping I can fix my face skin issues here but it is a long time to work in retail which I hate, until then. I am regretful I didn't take the voluntary redundancy money, and I am beating myself up for not having the balls to do it, yet, unable to when wanting to. My head is a mess, please help!",05Jul2020,1
1051," 

Quick background:  
This is not a first.  
Our father was physically abusing me until I was 10 (25 now), no longer in the picture

I  got fired from the job, just like all of my work colleagues  (coronavirus related redundancies) and we were drinking, saying goodbyes  etc. When I came home I see that my sister is staying at my and GF’s  place, both were already sleeping. I already knew something’s wrong, as  she’s living really close by and while we are on good terms, she’s super  shy and wouldn’t ask my GF for a sleepover unless something happened at  her home, where she’s living with our mother.

I wake them up and hear the cliff notes version of the moment when shit hit the fan.

My  mother’s currently with her third partner. They were in the garden,  drinking, blasting music and doing karaoke well after 10pm. My sister  was in her room (she wasn’t invited to their little party - she doesn’t  like my mom’s another boyfriend and he’s not doing anything to change  that as he completely ignores her).

Time  and time again my sister (18) told my mother about her feelings, how  she’s kinda neglected, that when the boyfriend comes she changes etc. It  may sound like a regular jealousy, but it really isn’t - he likes  talking about how he’s beaten someone (of course there’s always a  reason), how he does some stupid shit and needs to ran from the cops  etc. My mother thinks that those stories are highly entertaining.

So,  they are partying, music playing loud as shit from the huge speaker she  bought, my sister’s getting more and more pissed off.

One  of our neighbours comes to the fence and yells that they need turn this  down as it’s late and people want to sleep. I don’t know about you  guys, but I feel like this is a perfectly reasonable request and I would  do the same. Mother’s boyfriend comes up to him, tells him to fuck off,  screams other nasty and just weird stuff (“I see that you are on  cocaine” - it’s basically impossible to get cocaine here and no one’s  doing that anyway, people here prefer beer and vodka). At this point  probably half of the neighbourhood is watching the scene but they keep  at it, they start hitting the fence violently, all around extremely  embarrassing situation. Few things happen at the same time: my GF  arrives there to help separate the two of them if needed, my sister  starts crying and runs to the older lady’s house who lives across the  street (she’s not perfect and a real gossip, but they grew really close  over the past few years and she’s become a grandmother figure to her).  While all of this happens, my mother does nothing because, as she will  say later, this is between her boyfriend and the neighbour.

Bonus  points: the older lady’s husband joins their party and they continue  drinking - he’s also an alcoholic and my mother’s aware of that, but she  doesn’t stop him as “that’s not her problem”. It’s not a first when  they enable him instead of saying to go the fuck back home.

The  older lady and my sister come out, start talking with my GF, my sister  asks if she can sleep at our place. She stayed here for two more days,  as the embarrassment and the entire situation was just too much.

My  sister is a very emotional person but for the past few months she’s  been acting really off - sad, maybe even slightly depressed. I tried, I  really did, talking with her over that period and being as supportive as  possible. I knew that it was about her and mother’s relationship, but  she wouldn’t open up.

Later that  night she started crying and told us how mother treats her, that she  does not talk with her like mother with daughter, that she does not show  any care towards her, that she’s cold and distant, always puts blame on  her. I fully knew what she meant, as mother was doing the same to me  until I moved out of the house. When my father was beating the shit out  of me she didn’t do anything, never told me that she loves me, when  there’s a new guy he’s the most important thing etc. I learned to just  not give a shit and live my own life, but my sisters not there yet. She  decided to stay at our place because she was scared what other type of  emotional abuse she would face once back home. The older neighbour also  said that my sister was crying when they were in her house, during the  loud music argument.

I decided  that I’ll have a talk with my mother, which happened two days later,  once my sister decided it’s time to go back. I went with her, as she was  still incredibly nervous.  
My mother did not even notice my sister  was gone until the afternoon after the argument, said she’s not used to  checking my sister’s bedroom.

When  my sister came in, mother pretended that she hasn’t noticed her. My  sister’s looking at her and she does not speak to her, like she’s  invincible. At this point I’m fuming and say “what the hell are you  doing mom? Why you are ignoring her? What did SHE do to you?”.

She  says that she’s angry at her because she overreacted and went to the  neighbour, who will now tell the entire town some made up shit.

I  say “I think the entire town is already aware of what happened thanks  to your boyfriend”. She then starts defending him, says that nothing  really happened (I cut it short by saying that I have a recording) blah  blah blah. I yell “listen, I don’t give a fuck what happened at the  fence or who she went to, I know that she’s an emotional wreck (she  started crying again) and all she needs is your attention and an honest  talk. So don’t explain yourself, just talk with her as she’s feeling  neglected.” She keeps saying that it’s all because of the older  neighbour, that she’s trying to turn them against one other and that  nothing happened.

As always, I’m  hitting a wall - I see that there’s something wrong with my sister and  that she’s a mess, my GF and the neighbour see it too. I try to be  reasonable, I keep saying that it does not matter who started what and  that she should just look at her fucking daughter and she will see what I  mean but as always it’s not working. I ask my sister if she stays or  goes back with me, she says that she will stay. We keep in touch via  texts for the next hour - turns out that all my mother got from our  argument is that the lady from across the street has a bad influence on  my sister and that they are not allowed to see each other. And then she  gives her a silent treatment. And then the boyfriend comes, picks up my  mother and they go to the beach, leaving my sister alone once again, no  talk whatsoever.

Again, she comes  to my place, crying like hell. I offer her all the help I can and ask if  it would be easier if she talks to the psychologist I know, because at  this point I’m scared as shit that she will do something stupid - as I  said, it’s not the first time an argument like that happened. And for  the first time in what feels like forever she smiles and says “I would  love to that”. At this point what i feel is the most important thing is  that she needs to learn how to not be so obsessed with what her mother  thinks and does and that there are other people around her who care. I  know that hearing it from a stranger may be more powerful than from the  ones she’s close with, it’s what helped me at least.

I  then get a call from my mother who yells at me, saying that little shit  like me can’t scream at her, that I went way overboard, my sister  overreacted and after all it’s actually all our fault. She also says  that I have no idea what’s going on in their house, that I shouldn’t  interfere, that it’s a shame I never protected her like I’m now  protecting my sister... at this point I’m like what does that have to do  with anything, you never protected me from my father either, and I  stood up for you on more than one occasion. She says that thanks to her  my father did not kill me I say WTF and she ends the call lol. Oh, and  on more than one occasion, when either me or my sister were misbehaving  she threatened that he will be taking the custody... even though she was  fully aware of his actions. And during one of the arguments she said I  don’t give a fuck about anyone, not even her or my father so WTF x3

Growing  up with a parent like that really messes up your head, but now I’m  thinking that maybe I did overreact? Maybe I'm the asshole? I don’t  know, what matters to me now is the well being of my sister, who’s  clearly grateful for arranging the appointment with a psychologist. On  the other hand, I was really harsh to my mother and not listening to her  part of the story, but I know that if I did I would probably start  believing her, and not the 3 people telling me otherwise. Sometimes,  when dealing with her bullshit, I think I know what people who follow  cult leaders feel like. And sometimes I feel shit for questioning the  said cult leader.

Anyways, sorry for the long story and thanks for taking your time, I look forward to hearing your thoughts.",05Jul2020,3
1052,All throughout my teenage years I have had the same group of friends. We are very close and I value every experience I have with them. When I miss a gathering it seems to me it is mentioned more than the gatherings I was there for. I can’t help then feel like they are having a better time when I am not there or it happens to be more interesting when I am not present. This is particularly annoying when out of your group of 20 you are the only one not to attend something due to family commitments making me feel even worse about not going. This has happened a few times and I’m not sure why it’s bothers me so much. This may seem like such a small issue that I am making a meal of but I might as well ask for advice.,05Jul2020,1

Hey folks, for a long time now I’ve experienced this thing where if I experience something in the short term (past day or couple minutes)such as watch a movie, learn something new yesterday etc. etc. I feel like I experienced that long ago. Sometimes I do have dreams that precursor some events, however often times when I’m just doing something simple like watching a YouTube video or do some personal studying on topics I enjoy, I wind up feeling later that I experienced the same thing long ago. This isn’t a one off thing, this is something that’s happened for a while now and fairly regularly (few times a week).  I don’t know if this has anything to do with my rough past or what, but I just want help identifying what this particular feeling is for some sort of closure.",05Jul2020,1

The only thing working rn is just the touch. Even my storage is almost full even tho I deleted every app! And so so many photos... I even deleted my calculator and more useful apps! Every time something happened to my phone, My dad took it to a friend who fixed it for cheap. He would often fix it pretty quickly and give it back to me and it was all good. But when I took it for the camera he said there’s son fixing it... and now every button like I said isn’t working anymore..I told my twin sister about what’s happening and that I just need a new phone and she said I’m spoiled and that I should just take it to the guy to fix it but I’m tired of paying and repairing my phone all the time I just need a new and good one. She doesn’t understand and I feel like I’m not asking for much..? I would get a job and but it myself but cause of corona I can’t and no job needs any more people... I ran out of ideas. I know my dad will buy me a new phone if I just beg him enough but I feel so bad for asking... yes we have money and we’re a little above average but still I feel so bad... idk what to do. Btw I’ve never even traveled anywhere and have never been on a plane and like I said I’m 17. So yeah we do have money we’re just saving up for stuff like a new car and stuff so I feel so bad for asking but I can’t handle this phone anymore... please help.

1062,"Both females in our early twenties

My friend has had really low self confidence, and recently she's started 'camgirling' (her words not mine) for a friend of hers, and I'm worried she's finding all her self worth in the approval of this guy and the way he describes her looks and makes her feel sexual and beautiful. 

I'm really happy for her because she's happy, but she's gone from very shy to suddenly considering setting up an only fans bc this guy would find it hot and sending him photos and other things she can never take back. She says she feels like she has always had a wild side but it's been surpressed by some bad experiences she's had, and he brings it out of her. 

I'm worried because it's very sudden and it seems she's changing a lot in one go (to the point that prior to this man she said strongly that she was lesbian, and now she's saying she's gay except for this one guy, and her sexuality is her business and doesn't even need a label, but this is only important because it shows how drastic this change has been to her mentality and personality). I'm also afraid she is placing all her self esteem and self worth in the hands of this man. 

She's so happy though, and I'm not sure how to put this to her without her feeling like I'm trying to burst her bubble or anything. I'm also not sure if it's even my place to advise her, maybe it's not anything to worry about at all. People do this sort of thing all the time! It's just the sort of things she says, how enthralled she is about it, how drastic the change in her has been, how much her self worth seems to be invested in him rather than from realising how great she is. We've been best friends for 9 years but it's been turbulent and we lock horns sometimes, and I just don't want her to think I'm trying to put her happiness down when she views the situation as a source of extreme happiness. 

She views it as a fantastic opportunity to overcome her self esteem problems - I'm seeing it as using a man's attention as a vessel for self esteem",05Jul2020,1

1067,"Let's say for example I like baking. I love baking even if I bake badly and it turns to a burnt too sweet or bland cake. I enjoy the process, doesn't need to be perfect.

But then, one people I take in high consideration (or not) tells me something like:

- I baked so badly today, I burnt so many cakes

- You did well with this cake, nice

- You almost cooked a good cake today

So all of those little things make me feel pressure: the first because they are a better baker than I and I just know I burn more cakes than them. And the fact they seem grumpy about it makes me feel like I can't enjoy my own fun process of baking and burning, because they don't (?)

The other because it puts expectations on me - like the purpose is to bake a good cake, and I can't have enjoyment in baking.

Or if it was me jogging, and one day I go in a marathon because I have fun running, but someone else 'comforts' me because I didn't win the marathon. It makes me feel shitty and from then on in my mind I have a shadow of the expectations of other people.

Not because I want to please them directly, but my brain thinks that's the 'real', 'normal' way to exist. I mold myself into other people's expectations. 

They don't do it on purpose but I still have trouble reconnecting to the childish, innocent, excitable side of me that just enjoyed the process.

(jogging is close to the real situation. I didn't want to tell the real situation because I fear I'd be reinforcing my brain by thinking about it)

She is very dependent, we used to have the same friends but they all ditched her I felt bad so I kept being nice to her. She did recently befriend one of my friends and I don’t know how I feel about it. 
I also think she might be manipulating me. For instance, she tries to get her way by trying to make me pity her. She tells me if I don’t bring her along to events she’ll be “really lonely”. She will also  keep bringing up topics till I’ll say what she wants. For instance, I got a job at a restaurant because of my father and she kept bringing up how she wanted a job, how she wanted to work at a restaurant as well and finally after she realized I would not tell her she should work at the same place as me she brought it up herself that she was going to try to get a job at the place I work (which I do not want)

1070,"I work part time in a retirement village as a dining assistant (serving the residents their meals and then tidying up the dining room after). So it's a pretty simple job but it's my first proper job while I'm still at school.


I had my first ""performance review"" a few months ago but it was very brief as it was my 3 month check in and I was still new. Simple questions and it took about 5-10 mins all up, things like ""what's going well?"", ""how are you settling in?"" etc. My manager said that he'd heard good feedback about me from my supervisor and he was happy with me and he let me know that my next review (coming up soon) would be more in depth and we will be discussing things like goals and what I want to achieve in my role.


I know this might sound stupid but I honestly don't have too many goals in this role, aside from maybe working a bit faster and more efficiently but I feel like it's such a simple job that there's really not much more to do if that makes sense. 


However...I only work Saturdays and once a week on a Friday night the dinner shift is a ""fine dining"" shift as opposed to ""normal dinner"" like on the other nights. This is something I'd like to get involved with and would like to start working the fine dining shift. The training for it (assuming it's similar to all the other training I've done) would be done over 1 shift with a buddy where I would come in and learn on the job.


Would it be appropriate for me to bring this up in my 6 month review that that's one of my goals/something I'm interested in doing and would like to work towards being able to work the fine dining shifts?


I'm essentially asking for more hours, extra responsibility and more training but I think that also shows I'm keen and committed/have goals. Or would this be a bad idea for me to do?


I'm conflicted because I feel like it's somewhat a bad idea as afaik they already have enough people filling the fine dining shifts and therefore they probably don't need anybody else trained up to work them yet and when they do then they'll ask. On top of this, goals usually require ""actionable steps"" from the person wanting to achieve them and if there's currently no need for new staff then there's not really much I can do as actions to make myself suitable for fulfilling my goal of eventually being able to work these shifts.

I thought it was hot, but then I noticed he had sent a video of me masturbating to them as well. I felt so uncomfortable and violated. He didn’t ask for my permission before sending the video. I immediately told him I felt very uncomfortable. He apologized and we went to bed. When I woke up I still had that icky feeling when I was around him. I told him how uncomfortable I was feeling and he apologized- saying he was very fucked up and didn’t think through things right. I don’t know if this is something I can forgive him for. I feel like my trust for him is broken and I’m not sure if it’ll heal.",05Jul2020,1

1081,I've recently started seeing a guy that I really like. It's only been a few weeks but it's the first time in a very long time I've felt an actual connection with someone. I'm pretty jaded when it comes to relationships and it's hard for me to trust people. He's gone for a long weekend with his family who's visiting and I have no idea why I have this incling that he's lying to me. He said he doesn't have much signal (he's in the mountains) so he can't talk to me while he's gone. I have no idea why I just have this gut feeling something is shady. Am I being irrational? Is it just because I'm jaded? I don't know.,05Jul2020,1
