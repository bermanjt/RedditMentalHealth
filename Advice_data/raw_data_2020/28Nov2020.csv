0,"I'm gonna turn 15 pretty soon, its well, honestly its a little terrifying.

Growing up is getting scary, when I was younger I was so happy, and excited to grow up.

I'm aware how, you'll get more responsibility as you grow older at times its nice.

But I feel like I've wasted my youth, though I know I still have some years to be a teen.

I just feel like, times going by to fast, and I'm not exactly sure what to feel about it.

Any advice on what you think I should know, and possibility how to cope with these inevitable changes, before I turn fifteen?",28Nov2020,1

3,"Ok so I adopted a new pup, jack russel terrier. Aaand hes a chewer, my moms airpods got chewed first, he got the left air pod with a lot of bite marks but its still useable. He got mine ripped off the top of the case and got the right air pod which is also still usable. I tried to switch my good left airpod with her bad one but apparently she had a 2nd gen airpod which would not be compatable with my 1st gen so... I hid her left one so she doesnt find it and well.. my airpods are still useable and chargable... Should i just keep quiet about it? I dont know what to do because shes been fighting me real hard about adopting the new pup and im scared she will kick him out or give him away b/c of this. I take care of all his needs clean up his messes and his vet bills so she doesn’t have much of a clause to take him away. He was a stray too so she never had any hand in adopting him other than allowing him to live in the house.",28Nov2020,1

6,"I have a new neighbor who noticed that I refinish furniture in my garage. (Foreshadowing) He was on his porch one day (his house is next to my garage) and we introduced ourselves. During this interaction he said “we should hang out sometime.” 

Now, I’m not interested in hanging out at the moment platonically since we are in the middle of a pandemic, and we live in a particularly hard hit area. I’m not adding new people to my bubble. I’m also not interested in him romantically. I’m just not...he seems fine, but I felt no attraction. Soooo, I dodged the question and just left the situation. I know that’s immature, but that’s what I did. 

So a few days later, he left a note taped to my garage door saying that he had an old dresser that he was going to throw away and he had left it on his porch for me if I wanted it to text him. (He left his #) 

Stupid me, I texted him to tell him that I didn’t want it, but thank you anyway. So, now he has my number. 

He has texted me every day for three days. This is just a bit much for me. I would be fine with a cordial friendship, but we aren’t going to be best friends, and we are definitely not going to date. I just don’t want to let this go too far...

So, how to I nicely tell this guy to back off? I mean, I know what I’m supposed to say, but this is my neighbor, so if he happens to be an asshole it’ll be bad for me.",28Nov2020,1

8,"Hey everyone. I’m currently 19 years old and a month away from 20, live in a small Wisconsin town of just under 30k residents, I’m a former high school drop out who just recently got his diploma, I’ve been working retail jobs nonstop since I was 15 without every really having more than a month long period without being employed. My retail job is despise but it pays decently well and I end up making around 1200-1300 a month. Finally I also stupidly chose to wind up 15k in debt currently from buying a 2017 Ford Fusion, I also have learning disabilities along with generally just not being a very intelligent human being and I can’t function well in a classroom 

I’m extremely depressed and I deal with suicide thoughts daily and suffer every few weeks from strong panic attacks. I’m extremely awkward looking and oddly built (I get a lot of comments/insults regarding it), people also are aware of the fact I dropped out and suffer from mental issues so I feel I’m treated in a very fake fashion by most people. I also crave affection from other people which I’m not capable of getting 

What should I do? Any ideas? I want to just run away and live in my car. I hate where I live and every day feels exceptionally pointless 


I currently have another 2,500 to my name. What should I do? Do I go to trade school despite having no interest in it and just settling? I either just want to kill myself or run away and nomad it in my car at this point. I just need some ideas to keep me going lol 

Thanks for any and all help",28Nov2020,1

10,"Since about early October, everyday, multiple times a day I will randomly get a headache and I feel very weird and off (it is really hard to explain how I feel), and my mind races and I hear voices. I asked my mother what she though about it, and she said that it could be stress from school, or some sort of anxiety. I don’t know if I need to go to the doctor and see what they say, or if I’m being dramatic and it is just stress.",28Nov2020,1
11,"I'm a 17.7 year old female, grade 12 student, senior in high school, etc. 

I've always been an academic. In fact, I suck at sports, I'm shy, and a lot of the time, I feel like my grades are all I've got going for me. 

My family thinks the same. My Asian grandparents expect me to graduate with 1,000 awards and accelerated admission to Medical School or something crazy like that. They got mad at me freshman year, when I got a 91% in grade 9 mathematics. 

So, I put all this pressure on me, my family puts all this pressure on me, universities that I've applied to puts all this pressure on me, and I'm also secretly dealing with severe anxiety issues and a decade long eating disorder, ten years and still going strong. 

I'm exhausted. 

And then I see these girls who excel in the academic world so effortlessly. There was a girl at my school who graduated with an average of 98.5%. Now when I get 97%, I'm like ughh could have done better. Yesterday I did a Calculus test and I thought I might have gotten a single graph and maybe two other questions wrong. I had a serious panic attack. 

My head hurts, I'm sleep deprived, and once I'm done this, I'm going to go study more. But I'm crying as I write this and I don't have anyone close to me so please please give me advice on how to have a better mind set or not get burned out etc.",28Nov2020,1
12,"I’m 22 and currently live a busy active life with a full time job in construction, I’d love to have my own personal dog. My family have a 4 year old dog at the moment. If I end up getting the kelpie (breed of dog) it would live at my family home with my parents etc so it wouldn’t be bored we have a fair bit of land and live by the beach so it’s no problem going for swims and walks etc. I would love a dog but want to make sure I can look after it properly",28Nov2020,1
13,"So I told this girl that I was really good friends with that I had feelings for her and then she told me she also had feelings for me too. But then she said she was already putting time with someone else and we were super close friends like hanging out everyday so I thought like she was just talking to some other dude nothing seriously tho. 

So we started messing around and having sex and I started noticing she would get weird and distance Friday-Sunday and then back all up on me the rest of the week. So the entire times she’s telling me she doesn’t want anyone knowing our business and I respected that cause I don’t like people all up in my business but I live with other roommates and we all know the same people so obviously they started putting 2 and 2 together that she was coming over all the time and shit. 

To make a long story short she text me out the blue one day and was like are you telling people were having sex?? And I was like yo what the hell that definitely ain’t shit I do but ultimately she didn’t believe me even tho she was telling our homie that we were gonna go on a date and she was always out my crib. So like she didn’t think of people just using common sense buuuut come to find out she had a whole ass boyfriend the entire time and her boyfriend found out we were having sex I guess and they’re still together and we all hang out in the same circles ohh how shooting my shot ended up lmaoo",28Nov2020,1
14,"I’m 15 and I love playing sports especially skiing, my whole year revolves around skiing. But last year I had a concussion and a torn ligament that put me out of sports for about a year. Now I’m out of shape. I have virtually no cardio, my heart pounds over nothing, it’s hard to breathe, everything makes my muscles scream and I just miss being a great athlete. I’m doing physical therapy to get better and trying to exercise everyday but I can’t help but feel that it will take forever to get better. I have 15 days before the ski hill opens and there’s no way I’ll be better before then. I’m more worried about the cardio because I build muscle relatively quickly. I just want to be how I used to be. I wish I never had an injury. I just want to be better.",28Nov2020,1
15,"So as the title says, I want to prevent my friend from developing an eating disorder. He’s a 15 (M) and he seems to be pretty insecure about his weight and to deal with that, he usually doesn’t eat or skips meals and it’s kind of an awkward conversation to have so I’ve never really gone about it, but whenever he brings it up I try to convince him that he should eat and that skipping meals isn’t the healthiest way to go about losing weight and that he could possibly develop an eating disorder, but he ignores it and changes the topic however I’m still somewhat concerned so is there any way I can at least get through to him about it? Thanks in advance, I’ll reply to any possible responses later tonight",28Nov2020,1
16,"Hey so the thing is there's this guy who I know through someone, but I've never met him. Recently he followed me and started texting me. I went on his profile and it was pretty clear that he has a girlfriend. But I didn't think much of it since he would only reply to my stories once a week.  So I just assumed maybe he's trying to talk to me casually. But then yesterday he asked me if I wanted to meet up. I still don't know what intentions he has. I would really like to know what I could tell him or ask him to make sure that he knows that I'm not into him like that without being rude, cause I'm still not sure if he's trying to flirt or not. But I just found it weird that he would do all of this when we've never talked before or met before and just know each other through some people.",28Nov2020,1
17,"We’re in lockdown. I’ve stayed home since March, because I truly am afraid. My father (if we can really call him that) continues to go out as if it’s nothing, he comes back from God knows where without cleaning up or taking the proper precautions. I’m afraid of this virus, and I’m afraid he’ll bring something home and it’ll latch on to me or my mom. What do I do? We have nowhere else to go, and when I tried talking to him, he basically bit my head off saying that if anything happens it’s because of the little babies my mom watches during the day (whose parents all work from home right now). I’m not a hateful person, but I sincerely hate my father. He’s selfish and irresponsible. My heart goes out to everyone who has to continue going out to work, but my dad is nothing like that, he’s just going to shoot the shit with this guy and then that guy, and then back to the other guy. He’s being an asshole. I understand this is a hard time, that you’d rather be out doing something, but it’s not it’s just him who’s going through this right now. And it upsets me that he’s willing to put everybody at risk because he’s a fucking idiot.

18,"If I ask him if he treats eating disorders and he does not treat EDs and suspects I have one, can he drop me as a patient based on that question or do I have to explicitly state to him, “I have an eating disorder” for him to drop me?

On top of that, my bank account is under my parent's ownership and i can't access any of my money without asking them to buy something.

21,"I don’t really feel cared for by my bf, only occasionally if he notices i’m upset or something or at random times but it’s never a constant feeling. At the start of the relationship my bf made jokes about how being with me would save him money, and i just brushed it off which was stupid but it’s fineeee. To give some background he’s not very affectionate. He was for a couple days but then i guess he got comfortable and stopped. He told me he didn’t like kissing and never liked kissing in the past (like with past relationships). When we have sex it’s only from the back, except one time i asked to switch and we never kiss when we do that lololol. I made another post the other day where i found out he has an only fans, and was saving girls pics and his twitter likes was full of only fans stuff. He’s on his pc all day everyday since we’ve been quarantined (totally understandable but some attention without feeling like i’m annoying/bothering him would be nice). He’s told me before that i’m so much (because i was asking to cuddle) and it made me really sad so i told him he should get a gf who doesn’t give a fuck about him then, he told me to shut up and gave me a hug. If i do ask for a hug or to cuddle it’ll always have to have a time limit, like i’ll tell him just for 5 min (to compromise) then he gets back on his game. Anyways i’ve been sick the past couple of days and been taking naps, today i was taking my lil nap and he woke me up and he cuddled me for a little bit and was staring at me in the eyes and it made me feel really good. After a little bit of him just looking at me he started rubbing on me and he made me cum. He went to shower and came back so it could be his turn. We put on a movie that we could watch and i thought we would finish it even after he was done. I went to the bathroom to wash my hands and brush my teeth and i saw him back on his pc, and he was smiling so he knew what he was doing. He tried to give me the switch but i just told him no and now i’m here. I’m asking for advice because my friends say that he’s an asshole and treats me like shit but idk i would like more opinions and just to hear other reasonings so i can understand more. :’) It makes me feel bad cause he just asked if i wanted a kiss and i didn’t even ask for it, stuff like that makes me feel so much better and it makes me just make excuses in my head for him. (also if u read all this thank you, and plz don’t make me feel bad for how i feel, i’m sensitive but i will listen to other opinions just don’t be mean about it) thank u again &lt;3",28Nov2020,1
22,"So my older sister recently went on maternity leave for 3 months. When she started back working she asked me to live with her and babysit her three month old baby for 11 hours a day, she said she’d pay the bills because I wouldn’t be able to work. I said yes to help out. Before she got pregnant and had her baby we weren’t really the closest after she moved away, after she had her baby is when she really tried to talk to me more. So in the first day of me living here she has been starting to say I’m eating up all the food out the refrigerator, she said I don’t really want to babysit, she’s complaining about bills being high, she said I lay In the bed all day. What I actually do is babysit for 11 hours 5 to 6 days every week. Though It was completely new to me because I’ve never had a child I clean up the house for her and do everything for the baby but she is still looking for a reason to say I’m doing something wrong.

He asked for a rematch and I said no because of his behavior. He continued to swear at me even more. 2 days later I have ignored him at ps4 party as much as possible. He joins the voice chat through my friends account saying the words childish and embarrassing about him . He gets even angrier and threatens me that he will hit me at school. One day before he is alledgely going to ""hit me"" he writes again that he will not hit me because others asked him not to do so. But that I may be beaten if I do something that makes him angry. 3 weeks ahead (now). The person who wanted to fight takes my friend's iphone writes your moms a whore to me.

27,"hi! so, i’m a sophomore and i need some help/advice i guess? 

this school year has been crazy. my mental health has deteriorated horribly and it’s affected my grades. last year, i managed to keep my grades at all A’s &amp; two B’s. now, thanks to covid &amp; my physical and mental health, my grades are low. and the end of the semester is near. 

i have two Ds in my latin and geometry class (sickness put me behind in latin and my geometry teacher only gives us the notes and has us teach it to ourselves; i can't learn like that),  C in biology and apush, B in honors english, B+ in orchestra, and A in career connections (i'm only taking it because we're requires to have a business credit for some reason). 

we're in school in person, but about a week ago (before our thanksgiving break), they had us do distance learning, and i think that may have brought my geometry grade down to an F (the grade book hasn't been updated) and i’m SO scared. 

i do theatre, and it's the only thing that keeps me going, however you get kicked out for the year if you have two Fs. and i’m literally on the edge. my depression affects me so much to the point where it’s showing up in my grades. 

my parents want me to go to college and my mom is so disappointed in me. she says i’m a failure and to be quite honest, she isn't wrong. 

i don't know what to do— i've been trying to put my mental health first but that's not going to be good for my grades. i can't focus like i used to, nor can i even do basic things (like change my bedsheets &amp; brush my teeth). everyday is a struggle for me, and the worst part is that i can't receive help because of how expensive treatment is and covid. 

when i go back to school next week, i’m determined to keep my grades up and all of that, but i know my mental health isn't going to mix well with that. but at this point, i think i’m going to have to sacrifice my mental health for my grades. 

is there any alternative? my latin teacher doesn't have time to help me any, my geometry teacher is not good at teaching at all, but my biology teacher is helpful, so i know i can get help from him. my honors grade will go up with the essay we're writing, and my apush grade is just going to go up with time and the next tests hopefully.

Boyfriend and I are both 22. Recently I discovered my boyfriend follows and likes one of his exes posts on Instagram. This ex is someone he claims treated him badly and that he would never want her back. As far as I’ve been made aware they aren’t friends. We had a conversation recently about exes. I told him I don’t follow mine or have their numbers because the relationships I’ve had in the past were with less than pleasant guys and I see no point keeping tabs on them. He told me he followed a couple of his exes but not his most recent. I knew he did follow her so I knew he was lying. After I asked him why he was lying to me he said he would unfollow her so he “wouldn’t get in trouble again”. I have been very understanding about his exes even going as far as to hang out with one of them. He talks about his most recent ex often, with all of it being bad. It seems to me he still has lingering feelings. This is normal of course as it hasn’t been all that long since they broke up and I wouldn’t mind if he had actually been taking steps to put a bit of distance between them until he had moved on.

THE TEXT: 
Hey - Something’s been on my mind I haven’t wanted to say. But I’ve got to ask that you dress up a little bit more for work. We always had a policy that people need to wear some make up and It looks like you’ve stopped doing that. With everybody wearing masks I don’t expect them to wear a full face of make up but I think everybody should at least have their eye made up. XXXX would’ve said go put some lipstick on… But today nobody can see your lips! I was at an event at XXXXX a month ago and I noticed that everyone’s eyes looked so good. They were all wearing make up and were dressed up for work, and this was on a Sunday! Nobody was casual. We need to continue to do that as well. The competition is doing it! Every so often we all need to pick it up a bit, myself included. For you it’s especially important since you’ve cut your schedule back and clients know that you’re looking to move in a different direction. They need to see that you’re still committed fully to this when you are here and without any make up on it doesn’t look like it. Please don’t be mad at me. I’m just trying to keep our standard up.

My last 3 years of school were very underwhelming. I lost many friends, became unpopular, and didnt go out much or socialize much, although I still had a few friends(also ""losers"") those years. It made me very anxious because, hearing people say things like, ""the young days are the days where you should go out and have fun, be wild"", and knowing that most people in my school went out, seemed to have fun, and were somewhat having a life, I felt like I was wasting my life, but I wanted to compensate by at least doing fun things, or ""live my life"", after I was done with school, but also have a successful career.

I graduated highschool in the summer of 2020, my grades were ok but not overwhelming, my best grades being in physics and maths. I never had a proper idea of what career path I wanted to take.

My original plan was to join the army for 6 months and then study something the following year(it's more or less mandatory to go to the army for 6 months from age 17 to 30 in the country that im from, but its kinda avoidable. So essentially I wasnt going to the army because I really wanted to, but rather because wanted to have time to find out what I really want). Then, when corona came, the admission for the army was not a guarantee and in addition to that I started to dislike the idea of going to the army. So then I decided on not going to the army and to rather study mechanical engineering in germany;it was basically a rushed decision. 

For the record I never really wanted to study in germany and I really didnt want to study my course in german(my second language even though it is my mothertongue), I kinda found overseas places like canada or austrailia more appealing, but I ofcourse would have had to  to leave everything behind.
 
After the summer, I moved to the place where my uni is(2 hours away from where I lived with my mom and brother), but due to the coronavirus pandemic/lockdown, everything was taught online, and there were no activities or events so I havent found any friends here. The place where I live is basically a dorm but everyone has their own ""flat"" which is basically a room and bathroom, but there are however commonrooms. I would really like to find new friends here but as I previously said it is very hard due to these conditions. There sometimes are people in the commonroom, but I feel like these people already know each other and that if would be wierd to just approach them.

Additionally, Im having my doubts about my studies. Im not sure if mechanical engineering really is the thing I want to study because although I prefer it over many other things, it is in fact extremely difficult, especially in the uni that im in, and I dont really want to be spending 50hours+ a week doing stressfull work, maybe something else would be better for me? Im also having doubts about my uni because I have no friends here and also would prefer a uni in an english speaking area where I can study in english.  

I now find myself very depressed. I am pretty unmotivated to do many things, and have gotten very undisciplined. Im not getting along well with my mom as of now. On ig, I see all the people I knew in school having great times and finding new people, and exploring places. Even my friends and my gf(whom I now have a long distance relationship with), are telling me how they are going out and finding new people in their new unis(mostly in the uk and the netherlands). Although I am am very happy for them, this makes me reflect on myself and my shitty situation. I am somewhat having a life crisis right now. I just want to do something meaningful in my life and become more disciplined

Should I stay in this uni? Should I apply to another uni in the uk, ireland, the netherlands? Should I try studying something else or worling for a bit? Im also getting a slight earge to leave everything behind and go to canada or austrailia or maybe even some lesser known country like a pacific island or a 3rd world country, but this would mean leaving my whole family and everyone I knew behind which I would maybe regret later. All I know is that I am very lost right now and really require some advice or at least an external opinion. 

For context studying something else somewhere else wouldnt be much of a problem financially as long as its not like 40k a year, as my parents(especially my dad) arent badly off. I am scared that if I decide to leave this uni and go somewhere else that I wont like it there either and that ill have wasted more time and money.",28Nov2020,1
42,"I did something stupid. 

I work for a major pet company in one of the service areas. I took a picture of a client's dog and posted it in a private facebook group focused on how animal obesity is abuse. 

I realized that's stupid, and took it down within a few minutes. The damage was already done, as someone screenshot and stalked my profile, and reported me to the Corp office of my workplace. My store leader approached me to let me know not to do that, and that he's arranging a meeting between him and my direct manager. He said I'm not being fired, but it's pretty serious. He only said this when I asked him if I should be worried. 

My direct manager doesn't think I'm doing well enough to train for the position I want, but won't give me feedback on how to improve. 

I'm worried this ideot move may have taken me out of the running. If it has, I have no reason to stay here. 

Should I start looking now, or wait until after the meeting? Do you think Ive screwed myself?",28Nov2020,1
43,My boyfriend and I were talking and the topic of exes came up. We talked about following them on socials. I personally don’t follow any of my exes or have their numbers. He admitted to following a couple of his exes but not his most recent ex which ended a few months ago. The truth is he is following her and liking her posts which he lied to me about. I find it weird considering it wasn’t long ago they were together. As far as I’m aware they aren’t friends. He tells me often how badly she treated him. Which makes it hard to understand why he would want to keep tabs on her. I don’t normally mind exes I’ve gone as far as hanging out with another one of his exes. Besides his status saying he’s in a relationship there’s no posts about me on any of his socials. When I asked him why he lied he got defensive and unfollowed her so he “wouldn’t get into trouble again”. I kept a level head but I was upset that he lied to me. I’m genuinely unsure how to take this.,28Nov2020,1
44," 

I don't know what to do, I just need some hope. I'm young so I can't do much right now.

Family Issue 1: So somewhere between 2016 - 2018 my mother began listening to Q conspiracy theories. She's been crazy since she was a child, but not as crazy as now. She doesn't believe black people are discriminated against, she also thinks she is black, but she's white as a sheet. She believes black people in America shouldn't be called African-Americans, she just thinks they should be called Americans because they usually haven't been to Africa. She is also quite emotionally abusive and narcissistic. I got into some trouble at school and she sends this text later that day, ""Looks like you need to be babysat better. Stop sucking so hard loser."" I know it sounds fake but it is real. If someone shows me how, I can show all of you the text. I'm quite young so I don't know what to do, losing hope over here. She is mad at me and my 2 sisters. Me and my middle sister spend only Mondays and Tuesdays over at her house, on school breaks we spend 0 time there. When we aren't over at my mom's house, we spend our time with our grandparents.

Family Issue 2: My oldest sister just turned 22 and moved out to go to Miami. Other older sister got a boyfriend and is now treating me like an annoying 5 year old who doesn't understand her struggles. I'm getting angry and am now ignoring my sister and mom.

Family Issue 3: My great-grandmother decided to stop dialysis, she was supposed to go yesterday but she didn't. I saw her for the last time a few days ago and would really like to see her now, but I can't. She will die likely within the next 3 days. Please reddit, how do I cope with all this stress, I just can't.",28Nov2020,1

46,"I am on my 3rd job since graduating college 5 years ago, and I'm not happy.

My first job was terrible and I was severely overworked, stressed, underappreciated, isolated (only person in my department), and underpaid.

My 2nd job I really loved, but it was more of a freelance lifestyle. I would have maybe a week off work then work every day for a week. It was very flexible which was great, and I loved the hustle of finding work for myself to do. But then, they took away my one project I loved working on and gave it to a full-time person which was really hard for me because it was like my baby. After that I started looking for more stable full-time work. 

Which brings me to my current job. I really like the job itself: I get to be out in the community, do what I love, do something different every day, and I really like the people. The pay is ok...and I am getting a raise in January. Until recently I felt I could really see myself staying at this job for a long time. But I'm almost at 2 years there now and really feeling trapped. 

I had a zoom meeting with my supervisor (no one likes him) last week to discuss some mistakes I'd made lately. I think he could sense my heart wasn't in it anymore and he wanted to know if I was serious and wanted to stay. I said yes, but I'm not sure I meant it. The problem is, my schedule. I work WRF 9-5, then weekends 3-midnight. 

I've had to miss weddings, events, family gatherings, and time with my fiance since he works normal M-F 8-5. (He LOVES his job and is still new there so moving towns is not an option right now.) So, we never have a full day off together. My super asked me if there was anything that would make me happier at work and I said the schedule. He told me, because of seniority, there is a very low chance of me ever getting off weekends any time soon, and my heart sank. This is a good time to mention the place I work is a 24-7-365 operation. So, since I am low on the pole, I end up working all the holidays. I am getting married next year and starting a family, I saw a flash into my future having to leave my kids and family at home on Christmas Eve to go to work because I'm on call. And I really don't want that. I should also mention the nature of my job often requires me to go to unpleasant situations that sometimes involve death, sadness, anger, and some really horrible things...Sometimes even dangerous, and I'm a small woman. I know I should have a thick skin but it really wears on me sometimes when I think about all these awful things. 

So.... there are all the pros and cons. I don't know what to do or where to go from here because I really thought this was the best place to work in my town in my field. At first I really saw myself staying a long time. I'm not sure where to go from here now. One girl I work with who's been there 15 years complains all the time about pay and management. I don't want that to be me. I can't work for a different company in the same feld, that's just not an option. 

I don't know if I should stick to my field, try to go back to the freelance thing, or try a new industry. If I go to a new industry I'm not sure I'm qualified as this is the only thing I've ever done. If this is too vague I can give more detail, just trying to keep it neutral... I feel really stuck.",28Nov2020,1
47,"So I recently moved in with my friend from college because we got hired at the same workplace. I moved in first so I had bought enough toilet paper to last 6 months for myself. I told her she could use mine until she got settled in. We are both women. I use 1 roll for around 5-6 days. It has been 6 days we've lived together, and have gone through 9 rolls. She has not bought her own, and the other day told me ""Since there's already so much, we can just buy some when it's all out.""  When I told her, ""Since I bought these, can you buy the rolls when we run out?"" She responded,  ""But we're using it together. We should split the cost."" I didn't want to keep talking about it so I didn't state the obvious: that I bought these rolls and she's using them for free.

Should I talk to her about it? I don't want to be petty, but I'm on a tight budget. I have severe allergic reactions to cheap toilet paper, so I can only use a certain brand which is quite expensive.  I feel like at this point, the best solution would be for us to just use separate toilet papers but is that too petty? I just can't fathom how we're on our 9th roll in 6 days! I did see her yesterday wiping her hands with a chunk of toilet paper instead of using a towel so I suspect that's one of the reasons why we're draining so fast.... Any advice?",28Nov2020,1
48,"Hey guys,

So for the Spring 2021 semester, I'm going to be returning to campus in apartments, and we're allowed to select up to 3 other people to live with.

I first messaged my friend, let's call him A. We agreed to room together and are looking to get 2 more people, but we don't really have any other mutual friends to room with.

I messaged another friend, let's call him B. I asked B if he was down to room with us, but he told me that he was already grouped with 2 other people (one of which I'm good friends with) and invited me to room with them, which means I will have to abandon A.

What the heck do I do here? I don't want to abandon A at all and he's a good friend of mine, and I asked him first. But at the same time, I have an opportunity to live with 2 other cool friends, and I honestly prefer to live with 3 other people than just one person. Thanks for any advice.",28Nov2020,1
49," Hey guys, I'm writing to you guys to judge me as a person. I honestly though can't say if I'm in the right or wrong. No I'm not a killer or anything; I haven't done anything wrong. But I really just want a take on my situation. As we all know covid-19 happened. When it first struck China, I was very sociable some could say a popular senior who likes to party and hang out with his friends. I also love to lift as it is a great stress reliever. I still got very good grades and proceeded to go to UMD for computer science. My parents are extremely strict with grades and want the best for me financially. My parents themselves came from China and were immigrants who worked very very hard to get where they are now which is very admirable. However, they are also in their 60's and both are at risk in the covid sense so they have to be very careful with how to approach it. Thus, I went into complete lockdown with no social interaction from February to July. At that time, I just played video games and watched movies, and worked out using maybe the most preposterous things I could use to get a pump. I also enjoy getting high in my bathroom alone (yes, desperate times desperate measures). Of course, I knew what was at stake here so I complied. By the time, I was supposed to go to college I was thrilled because that meant I can finally have a normal life. And thus, until November 22nd, I thoroughly enjoyed my time at college. But then the second wave happened. I went back home and I was supposed to go back to quarantine. Yes, such a short time to relish the freedom I had. So, I thought to myself, I have to find a way to at least have a life when I go back home. I told them I was only allowed two times a week out, have to practice all the social distancing guidelines, and on top of that, I would be quarantining away from them at the house. The process would be I would live in a room very far from where they would be. Food would be delivered at a halfway point, where I pick it up in gloves and masks both cleaned with soap and water after I put it on. I would be allowed to go downstairs but it would be when they are no present and I wear gloves and masks. I am told that covid is not airborne; it is spread through water droplets. So if I don't feel any symptoms, don't talk, and my hands are clean there is no way they can get it right? They initially agreed, but of course, the situation became increasingly dire. Covid is currently worse than it has ever been. So, I come home and suddenly I'm told I can't go out for two weeks because of CDC guidelines. I'm a little perplexed by this because I took a test Tuesday (I came home Thursday), and it came back negative. Not only that with the whole I lock myself away from my parent's thing, I didn't see a problem. However, I agreed just to make them feel safer. So 8 days go by and it is Friday. I finally tell them I want to go out, I know I don't have the virus, I'm safe. They say no again. We get into this big argument where I begin to realize they don't want me going out at all. I tell them so what about the agreement. They say the situation is really bad now, no is no. I argue more and act more emotional. It gets to the point my dad and mom are saying that I am intentionally trying to KILL them by just going out twice a week. Not only that, they call my brother to 'talk some sense into me', my brother who has caused nothing but problems for my parents while he was under their roof, who was a terrible brother to even me by abusing and harassing me. In the end, I just gave up and accepted my fate. So, I can't go out anymore, but I have lost so much respect for my parents now. The entire time, they berated me calling me selfish when they dont even think about the 5-month sacrifice I made the first summer not even complaining. I am even willing to make more sacrifices now. My mental health has always been very great, but for the first time, I'm struggling. I mean I am a sociable guy and love hanging out and talking to people. Now, I feel like a criminal in my own house, and talking to my parents only results in more shouting. They just don't see anything from my perspective. Obviously, I want the best for my parents. I was truly shocked when they called me a murderer if I went out tonight. I mean now, if I leave, I have to live with the fact my parents see me as trying to kill them. No, I just want to be able to be happy while also being safe. What are your opinions on the situation; I really want to know. Ask if you want more details, I'm writing this pretty frantically.",28Nov2020,1

53,"Basically my partner(m) and I(f) moved a month ago to a flat that my sister used to rent, we met some of the neighbours who are pretty cool. One particular couple are definitely my kind of people and I love chatting to them when we bump into them, particularly the husband, we have a lot in common! 
I don’t really have many friends (mental health issues and just kinda struggling with life) but hes really friendly and quite nice to talk to. He recently gave both my partner and I his number, and added us on Facebook. We honestly chat online quite regularly (a slow convo throughout the day) the conversations have never, emphasis on never, been inappropriate. 
We just chat quite a bit. 
I enjoy it because like I said I don’t really have friends so it’s nice talking to someone other than my boyfriend 24/7 (which I have no issue with. I love him obviously lol) 


But basically, I’m really worried I might be crossing a boundary or something with him? Not sure how else to word it. He has a wife and child and I have a boyfriend. Once again the conversations have never been inappropriate and there is absolutely nothing to signify they ever will become inappropriate. 
But every so often he’ll send me a message and my boyfriend will seem kind of uncomfortable about the fact we’re chatting. He hasn’t said anything yet and I think that if he did I would back off, but for now he hasn’t. I’m concerned that maybe his wife feels the same too? I’m not very good at this sort of stuff so I don’t know if I’m over reacting/imagining things or if I am doing something wrong?

54,"To preface, I'm a 17 year old guy living in South Texas where racism is as bad as the stereotypes. I didn't realize that until I started to grow up. People started confiding in me more and I came to find that almost everyone in my family is a closeted/somewhat uncloseted racist. My mom, I have found out, was sheltering me from this because she knows how horrible it is as well, yet she would never admit that they are racist for some reason. I have about 25-30 family members that I have consistent contact with and  only like 5 of them are not racist or at least open racists. This includes quite literally everyone on my dad's side except one uncle and everyone on my mom's side excluding my mom, yet she doesn't think her family is racist despite them regularly using slurs and saying overtly racist things. I guess what I'm asking you guys is what do I even do with this information? I was so naive and innocent to these things, and I grew so close to some of the people in my family, yet I cannot stomach anyone with these beliefs in their heart. It doesn't help that I'm agnostic and my family is completely Evangelical except for my brother and one cousin. I feel like I'm the complete antithesis of my family, and quite honestly I feel so betrayed by everyone I love.

Yesterday was third time(she wanted to hang this weekend) and my friend goes “aren’t they Up almost every weekend?

However instead of showing it to my parents and proceeding to self isolate i deleted my data for the app and wiped my exposure log as I don’t think I could survive self isolation. I feel like I should tell somebody that I received the notification and that I should self isolate. however because I wiped my exposure logs there is no proof that I was ever in contact and because I have prelims(mock exams) in 2 weeks I’m scared people will think that I just don’t wanna do my prelims.

I immediately bolted into my daughters room and saw the neighbor on top of her thrusting and her arms wrapped around his neck. They had a blanket over them so I was spared from seeing what would have been a much more disgusting and disgraceful scene. When they noticed me they were scared out of their wits. I grabbed the neighbor by his neck and threw him out of my apartment and slammed the door shut to have the talk of a lifetime with my daughter. She initially was silent and refused to talk but after a few hours she answered some of my questions. Assuming she was being honest, I found out that she started this  “affair” by seducing the neighbor because she thought he was attractive (I will admit that the neighbor is well above average in terms of looks), that the said “affair” has been going on since April, and that she really believed it was her fault and did not want to press charges against him.

I stole 1/4 a pill, then 1/2, then a whole pill (benzo). I assured to only use them when my anxiety attacks were too much to keep with my daily activities.

61,"(Florida) She was a waitress at a restaurant so health insurance was never really on the table for her as she couldn't afford it. It's been about 4 months since her surgery and she walks with a severe limp and her only job has been serving. She doesn't qualify for disability because she is not deemed ""disabled"" by the state because her injury shouldn't last for more than a year (which is bullshit because she can no longer walk normally and a simple stroll turns into a full-bodied marathon)- which means she doesn't qualify for Medicaid.   


 Qualifications for Medicaid in Florida are:  
 

* Pregnant, or
* Be responsible for a child 18 years of age or younger, or
* Blind, or
* Have a disability or a family member in your household with a disability, or
* Be 65 years of age or older.  


Which means she can't pay for the physical therapy she needs to help improve her ability to walk. She's fallen into a depression and I feel so bad because I can't afford the physical therapy either and I feel like such a failure. Such. A. Big. Failure. It's crushing me....  


She got a new serving job and was about 4 months into it when this happened and I guess since she doesn't claim all her tips, on paper she didn't make enough money at this job to qualify for unemployment. The denial for disability letter stated that since it wasn't going to affect her for over a year, and since there are so many ""work from home jobs"" now-a-days it shouldn't be a problem to find an income for her. She has no experience in any telemarking or call-center job so it is increasingly difficult for her to find work. And her mental is fairly weak at the moment.   


I'm at my wits end here and am just begging for any advice that could help her receive benefits or any prospect into some form of employment she could do from home (she has no form of transportation). I can't watch her dwindle away mentally from this any longer. Anything helps, thank you.",28Nov2020,1

63," I've always been doing good at school, being quick to understand and pick up concepts, but I always feel like I am on the verge of failing, and now that I am well into my junior year of college, it just got worse, I literally have the first mid-term test in 9 hours, I've been studying for each course as best I can, but I always feel stress, and a sense of impending doom, like anything could go wrong at any second 

 I always were the ""gifted kid"", I was programming since I was 12 years old, and played the piano since 9, I was never tutored into these things, just learned them on my own through the internet and books I could find, but I always felt like these skills have amounted to nothing

Today I was having some stomach issues so I came home around 1pm and as I walked into my apartment I heard male and female moans and a bed creaking. I immediately bolted into my daughters room and saw the neighbor on top of her thrusting and her arms wrapped around his neck. They had a blanket over them so I was spared from seeing what would have been a much more disgusting and disgraceful scene. When they noticed me they were scared out of their wits. I grabbed the neighbor by his neck and threw him out of my apartment and slammed the door shut to have the talk of a lifetime with my daughter. She initially was silent and refused to talk but after a few hours she answered some of my questions. Assuming she was being honest, I found out that she started this  “affair” by seducing the neighbor because she thought he was attractive (I will admit that the neighbor is well above average in terms of looks), that the said “affair” has been going on since April, and that she really believed it was her fault and did not want to press charges against him. I wanted to sue him on charges of statutory rape, but much to my dismay the age of consent is 16 in the New Jersey so that is not an option.

Ever since my son was born, we are seeing more of my parents and in-laws (weekly if not more). We all live within 5 minutes of each other. Previously, we would visit them once a month for dinner and everyone got along.

68,"I'm currently confused about my sexuality and feel like I'm living a lie.

For context: my fetish basically denotes that I'm only into girls who are big. Like, really big- 50ft tall big (relative to my own size).

On the one hand, I'm charismatic, come across as relaxed in social situations, and have a wide circle of friends.

On the other hand, I feel like I'm constantly having to act. I have absolutely no desire to have sex with a girl at normal size and never have (despite having had the opportunity several times), but nobody is aware of the fact that I'm a virgin and I actively maintain that facade for fear of rejection (I lie, basically). If I could go back in time, I probably would have just been honest about it, but at this stage it would destroy my reputation and probably ruin a good few friendships built on trust (which I still don't feel good about betraying).

I wish it was something I could talk to a friend about, but it would surely forever distort their perception of me. Not even my closest friend knows.

I also force myself to go on dates I don't particularly want to go on in the hope that I'll feel something, but I have literally never even fancied a girl- let alone have a full-on crush- and I don't see it happening anytime soon. Dates used to scare me, but now I just find them boring, routine, and fruitless. I really would like to meet a girl I can have a relationship with, but for some stupid reason, my brain won't seem to allow it unless they are many orders of magnitude larger than me. As you may have guessed at this point, my 'type' is about as unattainable as it gets.

A preliminary question: would anybody recommend a testosterone test? Would it be worth seeing a doctor? I'm physically healthy and, from a purely physical perspective, showing no signs of low testosterone. But I thought it might be worth a try nonetheless.

71,"I (f28) regularly experience men staring. I'd understand this happening if I was atleast wearing makeup and dressed to impress so to say but this happens when I'm just doing my usual thing and in all honesty it's scary. A few examples: I only ever shop at a certain shop unless I have to as there is a shop assistant there who stares/glares at me the entire time I'm there and when possible deliberately walks close to me as they're passing me in a aisle; A man driving his car literally slowed down whilst driving up a big bridge to simply stare at me whilst I was with my child as we rode our bikes and today whilst riding home from the school run a man made eye contact with me and I looked away to then glance back as I felt myself being watched to see he had literally turned to glare at me. I honestly dont understand why men stare (those examples are just the more obvious ones but it happens alot). When I'm out and about I dont wear makeup, (I never smile at them or covid) I throw my hair up and wear my face mask and still the staring happens. The one with the man literally stopping and turning to stare for a prolonged, uncomfortable amount of time is what has caused me to ask for advice because although I dont think he'd remember me, I volunteered as a support worker for a company 3+ years ago,and he was a service user there and has complex mental health issues but I noticed I felt a flash of anger and thought about confronting him to say ""what are you looking at?!""

75,"So my parents have always fought and awhile ago i was talking about it with a friend and she said ya that’s kind of not normal and healthy. There’s always big fights on family vacations where my mom usually ends up crying, they have a big fight id say every 2-3 weeks, and my dad is generally just narcissistic and he’s pretty good at manipulation. 

Yesterday something was different and my dad picked a fight with my mom for a very stupid reason, (the house being a mess with decorations) and he lashed out, and decided to not attend thanksgiving with the whole family, but even more than that it was my moms birthday. My mom always goes out of her way to do stuff for my dads side of the family, and this seemed like the last straw and my mom was pretty mad about this, and my dad isn’t backing down so it’s gotten pretty tense. This seemed like a pretty big deal and I’ve heard divorce thrown around maybe a couple times before, but now when they’re yelling they’re just throwing it out more casually.

Other than the fact that I don’t like to see my mom crying and stressed out like that, I don’t really have any emotional attachment to my dad, and it wouldn’t really bug me if they split and I feel like it might offer some peace. 

My mom has talked in the past about who would my siblings live with, or what we would think if they got divorced and I’ve always been like it’s really not a big deal to me but I’ve never shown support for it, since the topic is uncomfortable to me. It just seems like all the time now it’s like there’s always something going on with them, and my mom has always been trying to make it work but again I think not going to thanksgiving with my mom’s side of the family and it being her birthday was a pretty big deal.

My dad has done this even on is own birthday, special occasions, vacations, and I can’t understand why he always try to make everybody in the house feel bad, and lashes out at us sometimes and not just my mom.

78,"Hi, 

I’ll start off by clarifying and giving a little bit of context. I’ll try to keep this short and sweet. I’m 24 and I’ve never been in a relationship. I don’t casually date because short term commitment isn’t something I’m looking for. Naturally since I haven’t found “my person” yet I haven’t had sex before. My experience is pretty minimal and yes by choice haha well not exactly I take life as it come and love just hasn’t I suppose.

I’ve been speaking to a guy online for a while. We sort of know of each other so I thought it’d be nice to not be lonely this lockdown. When we started speaking it was clear our personalities matched and from there built a friendship for the last 5months. 

I’ll admit going into the I knew we got on as people but I was viewing it from a platonic point of view. The conversation never really ended just move from app to app. The day before yesterday he changed the tone of the conversation and I went with it. We’ve built a bond as friends and frankly I didn’t mind exploring what could come romantically.

Anyway the conversation continued and the subject naturally changed. We were able to speak just as we were before. This was up until 30mins ago. He kept bringing up details of our previous conversation but I was receptive enough. I think he took the hint and the conversation continued. 

I went about my day and had planned to respond to him later on after I finished all of my errands. I was busy today and he knew. Out of the blue he sent me a video on Snapchat. I opened it expecting a funny video or an inside joke or something.

What I received has left me borderline traumatised. He sent me a video of himself masturbating and literally getting off. I feel violated mainly because he took that experience away from me. I feel completely disrespected but what I don’t understand is why I feel cold. I think that’s the best way I can describe it, I feel like he used me without asked. This feeling is slightly making me sick. I don’t know what it is, I’ve never been sent anything of the sort and I’m horrified.",28Nov2020,1

80,"Hi! I am the oldest sibling in a family of 6 (mom, dad, me, 15 yr old sister, 8 year old brother, 1 yr old baby). So I don’t exactly know where to go for this, but I want to do something about it and my post got removed from r/parenting because I myself am not a parent so I’ll post here.

So my mom told us she was pregnant a year ago and me and my 15 year old sister thought this was a mistake because we know our parents are tired from work and don’t get enough sleep. But of course, they said it’ll be fine, they could handle it.

Fast forward to this year, she has finally turned 1 and I’m genuinely concerned for her wellbeing. First of all, I have already moved out, I am 20 dealing with my own life, the stress of university is eating me alive, plus juggling around my plans and responsibilities refrains me from being there for my baby sister. 

However, I moved out because living at home was such a toxic environment, my mom and dad always being on their phones, we often never even spoke to each other throughout the day, and we did it was always arguments upon arguments because my dad is so stubborn and my mom is so passive she just let everything slide. It’s also a hoarder’s playground. There’s little to absolutely no walking space because the entire living room is covered with toys and random shit that doesn’t get cleaned up at all. The rooms are incredibly messy, and their complex currently has a rat infestation issue. 

On top of the unliveable space, my dad is a bum and plays video games all day and just watches the news. My little brother is too busy playing video games, my other sister is in high school busy with assignments, and my mom works during the day so there is literally NOBODY watching this baby. I make it a plan to visit them every weekend so I can play with my baby sister and take her out for walks because otherwise she would get none of that. I’ve witnessed my baby sister crying right in front of my dad and he’d still continue playing video games instead of consoling her. Not to mention, my sister texts me, updating me on what’s going on and apparently the baby gets dropped on her head because of their neglect.

I’m infuriated and I want to do something about it. I’ve talked to both my parents about their neglect several times and they fight against it saying “I’m not a parent so I have no right to tell them what to do”. Please give me some advice and back me up, I’m going insane and can’t focus on my life because I’m worried about my baby sister and I don’t know if calling child services is appropriate because I’ve never been in this situation before.

82,"First off, I just want to preface that I know a lot of you are going to tell me “there’s no need to care about how you measure up against other people!”, and before you say that I’d just like to say I politely disagree, feel free to ask me why if you’d like to know. Anyway, I digress.

Recently I’ve realised that my perception of my own intelligent oscillates - sometimes I feel like the smartest in my immediate surroundings, sometimes I feel incompetent and that I’ve severely underestimated the abilities of other people.

Most of the time I feel that most people are pretty stupid (excuse me, I know I sound arrogant but this is how my inner dialogue goes) and don’t really think far outside their own bubbles. I can usually tell straight away what roles people play in social circles, how smart they are, can at least make an educated guess on how people feel about themselves and what drives them. I also usually pick things up quickly and complete tasks at a higher quality and in less time than most people around me. This makes me feel smarter than the average individual.

But when I’m on my down low, I feel that more people than I am aware of is capable of the above, though I do not know how accurate that is. I start feeling like a fake, like I’ve been convincing myself that I’m so much smarter than everyone around me and this is usually where I try to ground myself in reality and prevent myself from going overboard with the arrogance. I feel that I’ve been embarrassing myself by acting in such an arrogant way in public and people are probably aware of my high sense of self-worth and may be laughing at how conceited I act behind my back.

I know this is a productive though albeit somewhat toxic cycle, I manage to keep myself in an equilibrium, but it makes it incredibly hard to figure out where exactly I stand in regards to intelligence to people around me, save for an IQ test which I haven’t yet taken. My mind also goes to the extremes, feeling extremely insecure or supremely confident within weeks of each other, and these changes can be triggered by really tiny events like observing something I did not expect from someone in a social setting, or hitting a wall when doing coursework.

Has anyone here figured out a reliable way to gauge your own intelligence without an IQ test, at least with minimal bias? And an additional question - how do I wrestle with myself in a less toxic way? I can get suicidal thoughts briefly when I’m at the extremes of insecurity, though I haven’t yet taken them seriously and am always able to pull myself out of those situations through logic.",28Nov2020,1
83,"Hey!

I'm just at my wit's end here. I don't know what's right or wrong in this situation and I really appreciate your opinions.

Backstory:

I(18f) have two brothers, let's call them LB (10m) and BB(26m). We get along well and are pretty close.
LB and I live together with our father; BB has his own place. 

Our family has gone through a lot - our mother passed away from cancer in the beginning of 2019. 
After her death, we found out that she'd been cheating on our father for the last ten years.
He was/is more than heartbroken and struggles to express his feelings and process all of this.
BB and have tried to be there for him as best as we could - this whole situation has taken its toll on us, too, though and we just can't give him the help he needs.

I have always had severe mental health issues and this whole situation didn't help at all. 
I've been in therapy for at least 5 years now, had a plathora of different therapists, meds and inpatient stays. 
My Dad has sadly never been supportive.
He doesn't really believe in therapy and puts my issues down to just being lazy.
He's probably the one who needs therapy the most, though but refuses to get help despite promising to.
I know that I can't force him but it's just very hard to see him get worse and further away from who he once was.

We struggle a lot financially. Especially after Mum's death so Dad has to work a lot. I'm pretty much the primary caregiver of LB. 
Don't get me wrong, I love LB more than anything but I just can't give him what he needs. I'm still half a child myself and I can't replace his mother. We've always been close and I've always taken care of him a lot but this is just too much. I'm incredibly overwhelmed by this responsibility and my brother definitely deserves someone who has the time and resources to take care of him properly.

Let's get into why I'm posting on here:

This summer, my Dad has gotten himself a girlfriend. 
Which is totally fine, I want him to be happy and she's really nice. Let's call her W. Just to get this straight, I have have no issues with her and we get along well, none of that is her fault.

There are a few things that are just... too much:

My parents (who would have guessed) have always had marital issues. W just so happens to be the person my Mum thought Dad was cheating on her with. It shouldn't matter now but it just feels... wrong. Especially after what my Mum did. And BB and I think that there really might've been something between Dad and W before.
If that were true, pretty much all of my childhood was a lie. As if it wasn't already.

W also has late stage cancer. I really want her to get better but this is really difficult for LB and me. It makes a lot of trauma from our Mum's illness resurface and it's almost like reliving all of that again. It's hard for me to face her and I often get flashbacks when she's around.

Our Dad didn't really talk to us about having a girlfriend, he just brought her one day and since then,  she's here pretty much 24/7. She's moved in pretty much on the spot and though I get that Dad wants to take care of her but this is just... a lot.
He mentioned in passing that they're together now after she already lived here.

I've tried talking to him multiple times but he refuses this topic and just screams at me. 
We don't really talk at all at the moment.

All of this is just... too much for me. I'm more depressed than ever, I can barely get out of bed and get nothing done. I'm incredibly heartbroken because I can't recognize my Dad anymore. 
He's not a bad person but I feel like he hates me.
I had a terrible relationship with my Mum who picked me as the scapegoat and was very abuse towards me and my Dad's behaviour reminds me very much of that.

My therapist suggested moving out.
I have access to a social worker and there are a few options available (though it may be quite difficult for me financially since I'm still in school)
I'm just so torn - I don't want to abandon my family, they're all I have.
I especially worry about LB. I want the best for him but I can't really get him the help he needs without my father's consent - which he doesn't give. As of now, CPS can't do much either since my Dad isn't outright abusive towards him.

I have no idea what's right or wrong. I feel like I need to endure this for LB but I just can't do this anymore.
I also don't want to hurt my Dad. I mean, he's the only parent I have left and I already know that me moving now out means pretty much ending any positive relationship we ever had.

84,"Hi guys! Summary before I get into details - 24 y.o. African American man with a psychology degree with issues on finding a job. 

I’ll try to include pertinent details while making it short. I have obtained a job since I was 15 so that gives me about 8-9 years roughly of various customer service roles. I was a waiter for a few years in high school, worked a couple customer service jobs in college and also was a customer success manager for 7 months as of this year but it was severely underpaid so I resigned in February. I have had plenty of interviews since I finished my degree in August of this year and I can’t seem to sell myself into a job. I majored in Psychology but I don’t have any psychology work experience which makes it impossible to get a job in the field - I’ve applied to numerous customer service-esque jobs and they all refuse to hire me. I’ve had many final rounds of interviews and Im just frustrated no one thinks I’m qualified for their roles (customer success specialist, customer service jobs, entry level IT roles that say they will train (but then reject my application due to lack of experience). It just seems so impossible and I am losing hope on finding a position. So far every job has explained that I don’t have the skills needed but I’ve been working my entire workable life so it’s a bit disheartening. I’ve interviewed for manager trainee positions, entry level (no experience required jobs) with no luck!! I honestly feel like I had an easier time getting a job before I had a degree which doesn’t make sense to me. I don’t want to play the race card - but a part of me feels a certain way because a lot of my under qualified white friends with no degrees hold stable jobs with good income and it’s just not adding up. It’s as if as a black man I have to work twice as hard to reap the same basic benefits.

I’ve updated my resume plenty of times, explained gaps, explained why I’m interested in companies yet no one is willing to hire me for any job. Does anyone have any advice for my specific experience? I’m feeling very depressed that I went to college and worked hard with sometimes even 2 jobs at a time during college for none of it pay off in the long run. A lot of my friends are solid in their jobs and have families and such and I can’t stop thinking how I cannot find any source of stability and i’m approaching my 25th birthday in a couple weeks. 

Please share similar experiences/stories because I’m coming to a point where I want to give up on everything... The only jobs I’ve been able to get thus far post graduation have been temporary positions with no intention of hiring me.",28Nov2020,1

86,"Hi everyone, I could use a bit of advice right now! So I recently turned 18 and have never been in a romantic relationship. This past year I’ve been trying to work on myself, as I’m fairly introverted and need to really push myself to meet new people/try new things. I’m at a point where I would like to try dating/ or at least meet people to get some experience in that area (romantic or physical). To be honest I’ve never even had strong romantic feelings towards anyone, but I had a very small social circle growing up, hence why I’d like to reach out to others. So my question is- what is your opinion of dating apps? Have they been useful to you in meeting people? Would people even consider someone with no experience on those sorts of apps? or would you recommend I wait for something to happen ‘naturally’?",28Nov2020,1
87,"so as the title says, i just started at my first job at a fast food place and while i really enjoy the company of my coworkers, as well as doing the job, i have a manager that screams at me constantly. when i first started working, i wasn’t shown how to do most of the tasks around the place, i was basically told that i’ll be taught as i go along. after a month of working here, i know how to do most things but of course i’ll still struggle a bit to do something i’ve never been taught in the first place? 
which is what happened yesterday. i made what i  thought was an extremely small mistake (literally just put a little too much icecream in someone’s cup) and i was screamed at in front of everyone by my manager. she kept saying, WHAT ARE YOU EVEN DOING?? has NO ONE ever taught you how to make that? oh my god, i’m so done.
this isn’t the first time she’s done this, but this was the angriest she’d been. she kept pacing around afterward and sighing as well and it just made my anxiety peak even more and i basically started crying. i don’t know what to do. i’m tired of being screamed at all the time but i really don’t want to lose this job. i realise that i may just be too sensitive to work in fast food but quitting really isn’t an option for me right now. :/ any advice is appreciated",28Nov2020,1

89,"Hello people,

I am 27(m). When I was about 22/23 I broke up with my gf and job and didn't really know where to go. 
I only had a ""friend"" in another town, who always told me how nice the music is I am making and often said i should move to his city to get things started with music.
I never really trusted him because he was unpredictable and irresponsible. But somehow his charisma was influencing me, i caught myself over the time trying to be like him in many behaviour patterns.

So I moved to his city, psychological in bad shape and confused about what i want and who I am. 

In his prescence i always acted different, even to his friends. Somehow we were like brothers but on the other hand i felt like he is trying to take advantage of me. I always had the feeling that i shouldn't do anything with him.
2 years ago we moved for 2 months in an appartment, i was still recentful and bitter about my life and he payed not even half the rent and moved into his own flat. 
I hate myself for spending trust to a person i realized MANY times before he isnt worth it, and i was so secure not getting in contact with him anymore, but then i always went like ""maybe this time"". And i always knew it was wrong. It was like, ""what else do i have""... I saw in him kind of the ""doorway to success"" whatever that means. I feel so heavy ashamed for that. 

And now i have behaviour patterns of him left and his opinion in my head criticizing me from time to time. The last times we spent together i always felt like autistic. He was talking and showing me stuff and i realized and accepted but didnt really care, just gave him the feeling that i listened so he would be quiet then.

I feel like intoxicated by him now. I tried to copy some social behaviour from him which i wouldnt had to do if i had spent more time with other people. 
He was most of the time just a talking guy trying to get influence. Nothing i would honestly respect. But i was weak.

Can you tell me how hearing his voice in thoughts criticizing and laughing at me could stop? Is it just a sick ego? Shame?...
Even when I feel good and suddenly something reminds me of him, my life energy feels drained.

Sorry for the chaos, i am trying somehow to get this together.

Have a nice weekend girls and guys. :)",28Nov2020,1
90,"As we all know covid-19 happened. When it first struck China, I was very sociable some could say a popular senior who likes to party and hang out with his friends. I also love to lift as it is a great stress reliever. I still got very good grades and proceeded to go to UMD for computer science. My parents are extremely strict with grades and want the best for me financially. My parents themselves came from China and were immigrants who worked very very hard to get where they are now which is very admirable. However, they are also in their 60's and both are at risk in the covid sense so they have to be very careful with how to approach it. Thus, I went into complete lockdown with no social interaction from February to July. At that time, I just played video games and watched movies, and worked out using maybe the most preposterous things I could use to get a pump. I also enjoy getting high in my bathroom alone (yes, desperate times desperate measures). Of course, I knew what was at stake here so I complied. By the time, I was supposed to go to college I was thrilled because that meant I can finally have a normal life. And thus, until November 22nd, I thoroughly enjoyed my time at college. But then the second wave happened. I went back home and I was supposed to go back to quarantine. Yes, such a short time to relish the freedom I had. So, I thought to myself, I have to find a way to at least have a life when I go back home. I told them I was only allowed two times a week out, have to practice all the social distancing guidelines, and on top of that, I would be quarantined away from them at the house. The process would be I would live in a room very far from where they would be. Food would be delivered at a halfway point, where I pick it up in gloves and masks both cleaned with soap and water after I put it on. I would be allowed to go downstairs but it would be when they are no present and I wear gloves and masks. They say no again. We get into this big argument where I begin to realize they don't want me going out at all. They say the situation is really bad now, no is no. I argue more and get a little emotional. It gets to the point my dad and mom are saying that I am intentionally trying to KILL them by just going out twice a week. In the end, I just gave up and accepted my fate. So, I can't go out anymore, but I am really surprised that they would say that I am trying to kill them and for not showing any sympathy. The entire time, they berated me calling me selfish when they don't even think about the 5-month sacrifice I made the first summer not even complaining. I have not received any appreciation for my actions.

It’s difficult for me personally to let go of the past and i’ve had a reputation for lashing out in anger because of what i went through. I know people will say “let the past just stay in the past” but i dealt with so much from 6 years old up to when i was 14. Absolute torment which involved physical, mental, and emotional abuse all because my autism makes me an easy target. I feel like it’s best that i finally find closure and reconnect with some of those people and see if they have changed and if they’re willing to acknowledge their flaws.

But I started to realize that it was everything like that has the same exact horrible smell to it now, ruining all my favorite foods.

99,"Hi! A little background, my grandfather used to smoke, probably from when he was like 15 until a few years ago. He is now 72. When I found out that he smoked I was pretty upset, I was 15 and told him that I still needed him to make sure he did his very best to stick around until my wedding. Well, I've met my life partner and him and I decided to elope in June because of covid. Eventually we will have a big official ceremony, but we weren't planning to do that until 2023. So we had time to save up money and we would have been more comfortable in adulthood. 

But yesterday as I was leaving my grandfather pulled me aside and told me to have a spring wedding once my husband is home from being deployed. He was crying and said that ""if he is your person then I think you should just do it."" Of course we haven't told our family we have already gotten legally married just because we wanted them to feel like the ceremony was the important event. They're very stern (my side is anyways) about that kind of stuff.

Well anyways I explained to him that we planned on doing it in October of 2023. And he told me to have a spring wedding again. He just really kept pushing for a spring wedding. My grandparents have been in really good health and are planning on selling their houses to move closer to me and my parents as well as my brother.

101,"This is going to sound very, very dumb but last June I started paying rent (not much, but right now I'm not making much) once I got a job out of high school. My parents did not ask for it, I insisted, I thought they needed the money and was trying to do a nice thing. I guess they still do but it took a while for me to fully realize that they just suck, so bad, at money. I didn't plan to quit paying because it did technically double as food money, and I'd feel bad.

The other day I told my sister I couldn't afford to get art supplies I wanted for us both because of rent and she said she didn't know I paid rent, and that she didn't pay rent. I could have sworn she did. 

I can't even be mad at my sister because neither one of us is forced to pay rent (... do not mistake that for good parenting). I just feel like a fool. I offered to pay rent, knowing their money habits but still focusing on the fact that we're all low-income and then right when I'm done feeling sympathy this hits me like a brick. I could have sworn my parents told me my sister paid rent. I know they told me a family friend that stayed with us for all of two months last year paid rent, so I guess it's just my sister :-)))))))))))

For context: We recently had an argument that lasted about 4 days. D and I were in a group chat with three other people, and we were both ecstatic over having a new friend group after being so lonely for so long. One of the other members (who will be referred to as T) invited one of my friends, G, to the chat. D despises G for reasons I don't know, and immediately began to become hostile, saying things such as, ""Ew, a germ."" ""Kill the germ."" ""Die, germ."" ""Fuck you, germ."", etc, and would instantly follow up the remarks with, ""Oh, I was just joking."" G has a rough home life, and D is completely oblivious to this, and so I decided to defend G against D. Personally, I don't think making a rude joke and then following it with ""I was joking,"" makes it any better. T then started a call, which we joined, but D had themself deafened to the call, meaning they couldn't hear anything we were saying. (T was paying them to be there.)

I said, ""I don't think D's bad mood justifies what they've been saying to G."" Upon hearing this, T messaged D and told them that I said, ""I don't think D should be in a bad mood.""

D snapped, left the call and all group chats with me. I messaged them, asking what the matter was, and they blocked me. 

The next day, D informed their girlfriend of our predicament, and the girlfriend began to message me and harass me with inappropriate images and different obscenities. D even unblocked me to send an inappropriate image, then reblocked me before I could say anything. 

D's mom intervened, telling us that we should probably talk and bury the hatchet. I asked D how I should change, what I could do better, and what I can do on my end to prevent another fight like this, but D didn't do the same for me. D doesn't think that growth is a two-way street, and has never asked me how I feel in all of this. They continue to tell me about all the fun that they are having with T and the other friends, disregarding the fact that I cared about them and miss them. 

D hasn't been in a good place mentally, but neither have I, and I don't know how much more of this I can take. I know it will hurt D if I cut them out of my life, but I can't seem to get them to understand that this is killing me, too. What should I do?",28Nov2020,1

But none of these guys graduated college (there's a reason I'm mentioning this -- it's not to pass any judgment I promise) and they all had blue-collar or ""creative"" jobs (not 9-5 office jobs).
(I graduated from an elite university and work an office/corporate job FYI)

Anyway, I eventually got tired of these type of dudes (even though the sex/sexual chemistry and attraction was through the roof) and wanted to start dating someone more ""seriously"" whom I can view as a long-term partner/potential husband.

I recently matched with a guy off a dating app. We talked 24/7 for several WEEKS before meeting up. We went to the same university. He works at a top Fortune 500 company (it's universally known) as an engineer, obviously makes really good money, and all that.

The first date, we went on a ""social distancing"" date to a lovely garden (he paid for the tickets). He also bought us lunch even though I insisted on splitting. Then we ran errands together (I had to, and he offered to come along) and he drove us around the whole day. At the end of the date, after we spent 6 hours together, he kissed me on my cheek and said he'd like to see me again.
He followed up that night and set up another date a few days later (today).
Today, he went out of his way to pick me up (he lives 40 miles away!), and took me on an amazing date driving (he drives a convertible) to the mountains with the roof/windows down. Again he bought me lunch even though I insisted on paying. He again ran errands with me and then dropped me back off home. This time, he kissed me on my forehead lol. Then he said ""See you next time?"" before I agreed &amp; then went inside my home.

Throughout the whole day today, he was touchy in a respectful way (ex: hand wrapped around my waist while sitting down or standing up) and we held hands in the grocery store, walking, etc.

I guess I'm just new to a guy NOT wanting to sleep together immediately.. Is he even attracted/interested? I have so many questions.........

I definitely like him!

TLDR: I'm used to guys sleeping with me immediately but a guy I'm currently seeing has NOT tried to sleep with me after 2 dates. Does it seem like he's even interested????",28Nov2020,1
115,"Awhile ago I bought our border collies a stuffed duck. We have both an older (unknown age) female and a 2 year old male. They tore that thing apart immediately. Luckily I’m okay at sewing. A couple times a day I would re-stuff it and sew the limbs back on. 

They had their fun playing with it and at some point it became little more than scraps of fabric. I ended up wrapping one of those really thick asparagus rubber bands around it because I figured it would make it last longer. It’s really unrecognizable vs the duck it once was.

Now our younger border collie has moved back to his rope chew toy and tennis balls, but our older female has found a sense of comfort in the mutilated duck. She carries it around with her in the house and brings it with her to cuddle at night in her bed. 

The duck is nasty at this point, I’m scared if I wash it it will fall apart. I mean there’s no stuffing left, it’s pretty much just a scrap of fabric. It’s time to move on, but our girl Stella loves the dang thing and it’s gonna break my heart to throw it away. I already tried once and she got it out of the trash. 

I bought them stronger stuffed toys with chew guards that should last longer, but she really loves her duck. What can I do to make it easier for her? 

I considered buying the same exact duck to replace it but I doubt it would last much longer, and I don’t know if she would accept the replacement.",28Nov2020,1

119,"I was planning to get my ears pierced soon, so my mom wanted to buy me earrings as a gift. There was a ton of sales and we were looking over at the earrings. (Since I was going to get my ears pierced as a beginner, my mom wanted to get me good earrings, so that they don’t cause an infection). Well, all of the earrings were VERY expensive. We talked with the person behind the desk about which one would be the best and ended up buying a pair for $280. I told my mom to leave it so we can check somewhere else for a cheaper price, but she didn’t want to. After buying them, I thanked her and started crying (she didn’t see me though). Although this might sound dramatic, when I went home, I started crying even more. I feel guilty that we went into the store and that I said I wanted to pierce my ears because I didn’t know it would come with such a big price tag. I also feel guilty because my mom spent so much money on me on just a pair of earrings. 

Overall, do you guys have any advice on how to get over these feelings?",28Nov2020,1
120,"I’m 15f and I’ve been dating my boyfriend 15m for almost a year. He buys carts (Basically has super concentrated marijuana oil that you smoke), and uses them to help his anxiety. I recently started smoking with him. I don’t do it often, probably about once ever two or three weeks. When I first did it, it did calm my anxiety and make me feel mellow. However, the past few times we’ve hung out just at home, we’ve been smoking, normally taking multiple hits of the cart over multiple hours, to stay high. 

I love the feeling of being high. It’s magical. It makes me see in colors and forget all worries. I feel so happy and laugh a lot. But after I’m home, get sober after sleeping, the next day, I want more. I think about getting high a lot.

My jaw dropped &amp; heart stopped. This girl could’ve gone off on her completely, but she shook her head, said something polite like “I don’t know how that matters.” I reaffirmed, “anyone can like anything.” I removed the customer from the situation and told her I would help her find what she needed.

my mom just got out of a very toxic relationship with a man (who was a covert narcissist) she stayed with too long and she even recognizes it. she never said sorry for staying with him longer than she should have and refuses to listen to how she could’ve done better. she let that man talk to me way too much. and it’s done a number on me mentally,

130,"I would like to start this off by saying (obviously) I haven't been diagnosed with anything and will not claim to be, I'm not about to self-diagnose myself.

Over the past few years, probably since I was 15 (I'm 20 now) I've always had phases of being absolutely miserable. Not wanting to do things like hang out with friends, shutting myself away from family, stuff like that. 

I managed to get a girlfriend (now ex) and it helped me feel more alive, but part way through that she drunkenly kissed a friend and since then my trust has dwindled massively and after that relationship ended things got worse. I attempted on my own life a couple of times, went on walks in the evening not planning on returning etc. The bit that worries me the most is sometimes I just cannot bring myself to eat, I don't know why it just happens.

Luckily now I have managed to find someone who loves me despite this having happened to me, and so its not as bad, but it still keeps creeping up on me (especially with stress), to the point where recently I nearly had a breakdown at work.

I've been told by friends in the past to seek help but something just holds me back, mainly having people worry about me, but also seeing the side effects of antidepressants and how it affects people I know. I've never been able to bring myself to go through with it, always saying ""it'll pass"" or just distracting myself, hoping it goes away, like working for example.

I am thankful that, as of now, I feel I have things under control, but what can I do if things get bad again? I don't want to lose my family and friends, or hurt them, but I just don't want antidepressants and don't know what else I could do. I appreciate anyone who read all this and any advice.

P.S I don't know how things like this work but I'd appreciate people not forwarding this onto authorities or whatever, I just want to know what I should do if I can't handle it.",28Nov2020,1

133,"TLDR: Might fail out of a school program I'm enjoying, will know in a couple weeks, would it be self-fulfilling or smart if I were to start making plans in case I fail out?

While I'm not someone who plans everything, I like to have a general idea of where I'm going, and struggle when I don't know where I stand and/or have a goal I'm working towards; as a result, I'm very quick to decide on a direction to pursue whenever I achieve (or lose) a previous goal. In part because of this part of my personality, I'm currently 28, holding a BA without much career potential as is (used it to pursue a higher degree initially, was miserable), and am back in school in the first year of an AS program. Thankfully, I'm overall enjoying the practical part of the program, and believe it's a good career fit for me (it's an AS which would make me employable after passing a certification exam).

However, my first test in one course I failed bad, went about studying for it all wrong. I learned from it and improved drastically on my following test for that course, but am currently still narrowly failing, with just a couple weeks left for the semester. In the program I'm in, if you fail one course you're removed from the program, regardless how you've done on the other courses or how close to passing you are. Knowing the impact of failing one course has led to increasing depression on my end (aside from the usual, I have a natural tendency towards depression); I'm bringing the depression up not because I'm looking for help in this area, but because it's a factor in play that is making passing this course harder, since it's impacting my ability to focus and study.

I am currently trying to be optimistic and am trying to study as best I can without depressing myself further, but a part of me wants to also start making plans for in case I don't make it. I don't want to create a self-fulfilling prophecy, where I unconsciously find myself not doing as well as I could because of having a back-up plan in place. However, I would need to have a job by the end of the year due to sizable student loans having payments restarting in January without any grace period should I be removed from the program, and this is hanging over me more and more as the days go by. Also, as mentioned at the beginning, I struggle if I'm not working towards something or have a clear path ahead; I would need to fill the void left by removal from the program to hopefully avoid further depression and anxiety, especially since I'm unsure what the impact emotionally would be if I were to fail. Would looking at job postings, reaching out to someone who may have a job for me if needed, or similar be bad to do at this point? Or should I tell myself that worst case, I'll still have a couple weeks in December to find something if that's how the cookie crumbles, and ignore the want to start planning in case I fail?",28Nov2020,1

I have finalized a copy of my original letter, and I'm hoping that it is good. I have a couple things that I want it to do:

1. Express my emotions and feelings, specifically my love and gratitude, to him.
2. Not seem too much like he'll die for certain and not seem too pressing/pushy/forward.
3. Not seem too dramatic, but still express what I'm feeling.

Below is the updated copy:

&gt;Dear Grampa,  
I really don’t know how to begin this, since I usually don’t share my emotions like this. Nonetheless, here goes nothing. I love you, Grampa. I am so appreciative of you, and I am so blessed to have you. I am so grateful for all the great experiences I have had with you over the last few years, whether it be when you taught me how to separate the nuts and bolts, when we did hay together, when we were chopping wood, or when we got to go on the Christmas train, it was all so very amazing, and the best part was being able to be with you, as well as Grammy.  
Unfortunately, this past year hasn’t been the greatest to spend time with you guys, but I hope you know that my love and appreciation for you guys is no less. I was so delighted to see you guys at your house right before I left for college, it made me so happy, so thank you for letting me have dinner with you. Anyways, I just wanted you guys to know how much you mean to me and how much I love you.  
Thank you for letting me work with you whether that be building the woodchip road to the chickens, cutting hay in the field, or splitting wood. Whether it was cold out or hot out, I was always excited to be able to spend time with you. Thank you for teaching me how to drive the boat in Ipswich. Thank you for teaching me how to drive the tractor. Thank you for bringing me to the construction show in New Hampshire, too. That was very much fun! Thank you for bringing me with you guys to get lobster rolls and take a boat ride with Don. Thank you for bringing me on the Christmas train ride.  
I hope you know how appreciative I am for all the experiences and times we got to spend together over these last couple years, and although things have changed and become more difficult this past year, I hope that we can continue our fun times again soon. Even if we just watch football on Sunday or watch some episodes of Gold Rush, as long as we can spend time together again, that’ll be a dream come true, but we shouldn’t rush it, because I know there’ll be a time when we can do it all again. I know you have a fighting spirit, the same fighting spirit that Mary had, the same fighting spirit Grammy has, and the same fighting spirit Dad has, and I promise you, I have it, too, thanks to you. With this fighting spirit, I promise you we’ll continue to live, love, and laugh as a family, I promise you that, no matter what tough times lie ahead.  
Thank you for teaching me all the lessons you have over the past couple years, such as hard work, humor, honesty, strength, perseverance, integrity, and the value of family. From words of wisdom you have shared to observations I have made of your actions and habits, I truly do thank you for teaching me such great lessons and virtues, essentially instructions of how to be a good man. While I do have Mom and Dad and I do have what I’ve learned from Xavier, I know for a fact that I wouldn’t have the potential I do if it weren’t for you, so thank you so much.  
It is my wish that I could only return the favor, but you’ve done so much, and I could never repay the debt I owe you. Nonetheless, I will do my best. I will do my best to continue your traditions of hard work, emphasis on family, love of the outdoors and the country, and above all being a good man, a good person. I will do my best to pass on this key lesson to my future family, to my future kids, and to everyone I meet in life. Already, from experience, these lessons you’ve taught me have already proven useful as I’ve made great friends I couldn’t have made otherwise, so again I am very grateful.  
In conclusion, I just want to thank you, tell you how much I appreciate and love you as well as tell you that, although I’m not sure how much longer this distancing and separation will go on, I do hope we can see each other again and spend some good quality time together like we did before these times. Regardless of how much longer we have to wait for the times to get better, I am extremely grateful for all you have done, and I truly mean this, and I will always love you and appreciate you. I will never forget all of these lessons you’ve taught me and experiences we’ve shared, and even when we can’t see each other face to face, we’ll never be too far away.  
With the deepest appreciation and love,  
\[my name\]

Along with asking whether or not you think it is good, I am also very much in need of how to present it to him. The next time I'd be able to see him is on Christmas, but I'm not sure if he'll make it until then. Do you think I should wait until then? Or do you think I should mail it to him? If I should mail it to him, do you think I should call him before he opens it? I'm really hoping that he does make it past Christmas, but while I am optimistic I am also pragmatic, and I recognize, especially since he could barely get down his oatmeal this morning, according to my grandma, that his conditions are worsening. I'm not sure what to do, but I really want to express to him how I feel, and I don't want to wait too long, or else I may regret it for the rest of my life. What would you suggest I do about my presentation of this letter to him?

tl;dr: I've updated my letter from a previous post and I'm wondering what you guys think. Also, if I'm unable to present it to him in person before Christmas, how should I get it to him? And if I mail it, should I accompany it by a phone call beforehand?",28Nov2020,1

141,First thing first I have a child. So it seems like she doesn’t make effort to be with me anymore? We don’t go places.. I literally plan things and she would rather be out with her family. So why even plan at all.. I work mornings just so I can be home with her she gets off at 4:00 finds a reason to stay out until 6 or 7 sometimes. Sex? Forget it she says she’s always too “tired” or “not today” or even yet now she says we’re not 16/17 anymore we’re literally in early 20s couple years till we even hit 25.? I recently said “I’m just going to work nights” she still doesn’t care should I just leave? I wouldn’t see her at all working nights because she works mornings. It’s starting to just be toxic honestly I feel better not being around her work/school/ working out but when I come home it’s like “fml whyyyyyy”,28Nov2020,1
142,"I have the bad habit of distancing myself from friends after a while. I enjoy their company and I think they like mine too, but it’s too tiresome for me so I ghost the world for some days - or several weeks - and then I return. 

I hate that about myself because it affects negatively my friendships and I feel very lonely during those reclusion periods. I don’t think it’s depression because it doesn’t affect my life beyond that. I work, talk normally in person if someone approaches me and continue my routine normally. I just can’t make myself respond messages or enter discord during my free time, but while busy I can only think about talking to those friends I ghosted. I hate it.

145,So I (16 year old male idk if that’s important) had to drive about 45 minutes to another town to get some pizza for my brother who just had surgery and was throwing a fit (and we are twins so it’s even more awkward) and I called it in so I could leave faster. The girl who called it in ask for my name and she told me it was a pretty name. I didn’t think anything of it cause I was like “aww that’s neat”. Well I pick up the pizza and she ask me if I was with a group of friends about a month ago that played among us in the restaurant. I said yes but we don’t hang out that often since I live kinda far. She then tells me she would play among us with me anytime and got the doors so I could get the pizza to my car. I get home and all I could think was “I never got her name” and I called the restaurant again to see if she would pick up again. She had apparently left for the day. Idk if she was trying to flirt or be friendly but I kinda want to find her. How should I go about this now or should I just leave it. Thanks again in advance,28Nov2020,1

147,"This is not that big but I have been having trouble with my brother(13yo m). We recently adopted my dog and it’s been great but recently my brother has been really rude and irresponsible. The most recent disaster was that he just wanted her to like him. What happened was that on thanksgiving she was allowed to have a tiny bit of whipped cream on her food and I was ok with that but I still was unsure about how much he gave her. Today, at dinner he poured out 2 full cups of whipped cream into her food bowl but luckily, I grabbed it before she got it but he was doing everything to make me feel bad like calling me mean, terrible dog owner, and cruel. I was starting to feel sad and just started to get her dinner. As I was scooping the food behind me I heard him snickering. I immediately knew he was giving her whipped cream and turned around and saw my dog being fed 2 whole cups of whipped cream and my brother just laughing his head off. I took it away from him and she had eaten it all. I screamed at him telling him that the last time she ate whipped cream. She threw it up because he made it with so much sugar and he continued to call me mean, terrible dog owner, and cruel. You get the pattern. This has been happening a lot recently but I don’t know how to stop it. I have tried to ask my parents and they tell him off but in the end when it comes to SSAT, homework, overall responsibility, and my dog, he can say he’ll start to be responsible but in the end they can’t do anything. After telling my parents that they should just force him but it never works. I may be a bit exaggerated but this is my perception. I need advise on what to do.",28Nov2020,1

I think I’m into guys. I’m not sure exactly. I haven’t been in a relationship for a while so it might come with it but I do feel attraction and get aroused when I see a couple of any sexuality, gender and etc. 

I have been getting rejected by girls a lot lately. So I understand that there might be some major flaws in me. I got into Tinder and Bumble. A lot of girls raised interest and liked me but would never follow up or see me in person. So I understand it is what it is. 

I made a Grindr and turned on the guys tinder profile. I saw a lot more guys liked me. I liked the validation and the flirty remarks. I thought they were pretty fucking smooth guys. I learned a lot from them and they were open. They went for it. I liked that. As a guy I lack that and I don’t do good with certain things. I struggle with putting my emotions out there because when they do I always get rejected. These guys did it in a cool way. This was all back a couple months ago. I started watching gay porn. I watched this one where they were a couple and made out. Netflix and chilling basically. It was hot to me. How they were all cuddled up and then they had sex. I think the bald guy was really hot. 

I have now been turned off by guys. However the idea of being in a relationship with one sounds nice. I’m not saying I hate women so I have turned gay or anything like that. I feel they want me more and I think I’m into the idea of being with a guy. I want kids so I know long term it wouldn’t workout but it feels like I could have someone. 

I’m into the idea of going on dates with them and doing all that romantic stuff. However I’m a virgin and quite frankly an idiot. So I’m not sure what this is. Please help me. Should I go out on a date with a guy?",28Nov2020,1

152,"My older brother [19M], has high-functioning autism and it’s affected me a lot of my life because my parents don’t know how to raise a neurodivergent child. For as long as I can remember, my parents have always convinced my brother he wasn’t autistic and that he was “normal”. His behavior towards me has always been hostile, he verbally and physically abuses me almost everyday. I am not trying to villainize autism at all and I apologize if it seems like I am. I’ve tried talking to my parents so many times and they give the same excuse, “oh he’s autistic, you have to be nice” “he’s not normal like you” and other things. When I would fight back with my brother, I end up getting yelled at because according to my parents, I’m supposed to be the “normal” child (having autism does not make someone normal, idk what my parents are thinking). I don’t think my brother has ever been to a therapist or psychologist other than the speech therapist at school, I believe. I’ve tried convincing my parents to get him therapy or a psychologist and they just don’t listen. My brother even verbally and physically abuses my mother, he even yells at my grandparents. I’ve been affected by my brothers actions since I was born. Earlier this week, I was sitting next to my dad on the couch and my brother straight up just hit me really hard so I scratched him, then he starts throwing a tantrum about me scratching him, am I just supposed to sit there and let you hit me????  He continues to keep yelling and my dad is doing nothing. My brother can get really violent to the point where I’m genuinely afraid that he’ll actually kill me. I go into my room and isolate myself because I’m too scared to go outside. I’m convinced he’ll hurt me and my parents don’t care. I’ve fought several times with my parents and they just don’t care.  They pretend like they do then do nothing about it. I’ve lost so much sleep and cried so much this week and I feel so lost and tired. Today I went outside of my room and once again my brother hit me and I scratched him and the same situation happened again. I went back into my room. I started angrily texting my dad, who works in a different state, about everything. I started my texts off to him calm but I got angrier and angrier because my dad just wouldnt listen. I cussed out my dad and just told him everything that was wrong with our family. He called my mom and had her threaten to call the cops on me as well as kicking me out of the house. Out of anger I cussed out both of my parents and said some things I regret saying but then again, not really. My parents and even my grandparents are trying to make me seem like a psycho and saying I’ve gone crazy and that it’s my fault for everything and I just, I’m tired. The whole ordeal was about an hour. It’s been about two hours since the whole situation and I just don’t what to do anymore. My dad texted me saying he wanted me out of the house and that he was no longer going to parent me and I just keep uncontrollably sobbing and crying. My parents keep disregarding my mental health and just say I’m being disrespectful when I’m genuinely struggling living in this house.

i have 0 intention or even want - in the slightest- to get back with her, i honestly dont even care to even hang with her , but if it turns out to be her just wanting sex or something id be completely down. She’s hot as hell and ive been dry since we broke up.

162,"Two weeks ago from this day I (27m) took around 4g of shrooms for my birthday. Overall it was a pretty good day, but at one point during the trip I had a few memories triggered of some crappy stuff I've done to others in the past, wherein I had an insight that I would eventually have to confront bits of my past in order to make peace with myself.

I won't go into too much detail here but one particular thing I did around 10 years ago has been bothering me the most. Out of jealously I made up a rumour about this girl that pissed her off pretty badly and as a result she literally spent months trying to figure out who I was so she could get an apology out of me as I was too scared to own up to it at the time, however she never did figure it out was me and I'm pretty sure I fractured some of her friendships at the time as a result.

Now, every day since this shroom trip my mind wanders back to it. I've thought about reaching out to her about it and asking whether she would still appreciate an apology/explanation or whether she's happy just to keep the past in the past, as I don't think it's right to trigger memories/emotions by forcing it on her, not to mention the idea of doing it makes me nervous.

I don't exactly know to do here as I'm not sure whether my mind is still somewhat distorted from the trip and if I'm overthinking the whole situation.",28Nov2020,1

My sister was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2018. Everything seem okay and her chemotherapy was going great. My sister wasn’t taking this seriously at the beginning. My sister was the kinda person who cared about her appearance and men. She notice her breast was getting swollen but she never did anything at the beginning. We told her get it checked out. It went untreated for a few months. In 2018 my sister came over and told us that they found a lump in her breast. She had breast cancer. With chemo she saw some signs of improvements. Her lump was shrinking. My mother told her to have her breast removed but she refused to do it because she liked her breast. My sister made the mistake of going to Florida to be with the guy she was dating and my mom told her don’t go to focus on her chemotherapy. She said she wants to go. Her exact words were ‘it’s my life I do what I want if I die I die’ June 4th 2020 she lost her battle with breast cancer. 


When COVID-19 started to spread I was a nine believer. After the virus started to infect more people in the USA and around the world and as I kept watching the reports on the news I grew concerned. I never wore a mask because I was still a none believer. So then after wearing a mask was mandatory I finally bought a couple mask and started using. On my birthday on April 3 I started to feel sick. Uncontrollable chills, headaches, body aches. Chest pain. Back pain. I had no energy. My chest pain was getting worse and worse. I rushed to the emergency room. they tested me for COVID. I tested positive. they did a Scan of my chest and found Pneumonia. Being infected with COVID caused a pneumonia and the ER doctor said a lot of patients who tested positive had the symptoms I had including pneumonia. There was no vaccine at that time. COVID was still new and no one knew about it. They treated my pneumonia and gave me a bunch of medicine and antibiotics. I recovered a few weeks later. Then I took another test and it came back negative. 


My stepdad was a none believer like me. After I started wearing a mask he started to make jokes. My mother would tell him to wear a mask. He would mock us. One time he pretended that he couldn’t breathe and then once we went to his bed he to check on him he started laughing and just making jokes. My stepdad went out and still did the things he did before the virus was here. so then one day he started complaining of chest pains. Back pain. No energy. Symptoms I had, I told him go to the emergency room. He said no: then one day I woke up and I had this weird feeling that something was wrong. I went to my stepdad room and noticed he was breathing loud. His breathing was weird. He couldn’t walk. This time he wasn’t joking and it wasn’t a prank. He went to the emergency room. Then a few hours later I called the hospital and they said he was admitted and is on a ventilator. he was on life support. I couldn’t believe it. My worse fear came true. my stepdad was in the hospital for 4 weeks. The virus caused his lungs to collapsed, kidney failer, liver problems. It was causing blood clots in his blood and he couldn’t get blood flow to his hands and feet. His toes and fingers started turning gangrene. They couldn’t amputate because he had a fever and was on life support. The doctors allowed me to visit him. i had to put on a suit and stuff and I was able to go in the room. I his hands and feet were all green. He was turning skinny: I could see his bones. My stepdad was a little conscious and he could hear my voice but couldn’t really talk or respond to anything: the doctors couldn’t save him. So I said my final goodbye and I came to the decision to take him off life support so he could go in peace. He took his last breath on June 7th. A few days after my sister passed. 


These past few months it’s been hard for me and my mother and family. I’ve been feeling sad but numb. I can’t feel anything or cry anymore. I have these moments when I feel a rush of sadness coming then this feeling of despair comes. Right low I feel numb, a little depressed and in disbelief. I went to see my therapist (I have my own personal mental health problems I’m dealing with) I feel lost. i can’t sleep. Thanksgiving was hard. It felt weird. Two empty seats at the table and knowing that I’ll never see them again is difficult. Sometimes I have suicidal thoughts but then I feel guilty and selfish because there are a lot of people dying and I’m here thinking about suicide. I try to go to therapy and speak with my therapist but it doesn’t seem to make me feel better. At this point I feel like what’s the point of living when we can get sick and go at any moment. I never thought That this would happen to me. I’m a good person. I love and help people. I keep wondering why this has to happen to me. What did I do to deserve this. I always thought that if you was a good person and did everything Right that these things won’t happen. Everyday I wonder what I did for this to happen to me. why did god let this happen. I don’t know what way to deal with this. Every time I talk to my therapist it helps but I feel like I need to deal with this on my own without my therapist. No matter how many times I explain this or talk about it, no body can’t understand the pain I feel. The pain and sadness.",28Nov2020,1

167,"Okay the very clear answer here is Yes, but let me walk you through my thought process.  

I've spent a long time being in love with someone.  Im very in tune with my emotions and I consider myself to be a very logistical person.  In all of this time that I have loved them, I've done a lot of self reflecting, learning, and growing.  I know that person does not love me back, and I've learned to accept it.  They have no obligation to love me the way I love them.  We are very close friends - they care about me, they love me, but not in the way I do.  And thats okay.  If you're familiar with the show How I Met Your Mother, this person is my Robin, essentially the same exact situation and relationship.  We even have the ""if we're alone at 40 we'll marry eachother"" pact.  I truly believe that this person is my 'twin flame.'  Yaknow, minus the major aspect of them not loving me back.  I don't think I'll ever stop loving them.  

So, here is my dilemma.  Recently I've met someone.  They're awesome.  They make me happy.  Is it wrong to get into a relationship knowing I have such deep feelings for someone else?  I know 'Robin' may never feel the same way about me, and I accept that.  Am I to be alone forever because im waiting for someone who won't be there? I'd never cheat on someone with them, and I'd never intentionally hurt someone for them. Im a very love-oriented person, so I will still give the person I met the world and try to make them as happy as possible.  Im capable of loving someone else, maybe just not like I love 'Robin.'  Futhermore, aren't a lot of people in this situation?  I feel like a lot of people have met someone they loved more than anyone, and it just didn't work out.  You must move on.  But I can't stop thinking its wrong for me to get into a relationship knowing ill always have deel feelings for someone else.",28Nov2020,1

169,"I'm working in a small company and besides bookkeeping I'm kind of the assistant of my boss. That means I have to communicate with him quite much and most of it is in a written chat. 
I'm working there since 15 months. My boss has a habit of writing rather annoyed replies when he thinks I'm ignoring his instructions or when we talk cross purposes (which happens way too often). Instead of trying to sort it out, I get something like ""seriously, this is your reply?"" or ""is it so difficult to do like I told you to?"" and most of it is solely based on misunderstandings.

At one point I couldn't stand it anymore and told him that his harsh replies on subjects he simply misunderstood are neither helpful nor appropriate. He was a bit surprised, as in his opinion it's ok to be pissed when (supposedly) I'm not doing my work. Sure, if this be the case, he can be pissed. But it was a misunderstanding. And so I asked him to ASK ME instead of accusing me if he's not sure. In the end he understood my complaint and we left it there.
I'm surely not the most laidback person in the world, but no matter how angry I am, I always take a deep breath and reply as neutral as I can, sticking to facts rather than emotions. 
Today we had another misunderstanding to which he replied in a very stroppy way and I replied something like, ""my last info was this and that, there's no need for such a reaction, jeez."" and it was fine afterwards.

I know it's difficult to give advice with just a bit of info, but what do you suggest or think? I don't like to be addressed like I did something wrong when I didn't and I know most of the time I'm not able to reply to it in such an offhand way as I did today.

Pet expenses avg $200/month, pet insurance lol, don't even get me started. 

We are about to renew our lease and my girlfriend is upset with how I've been handling the finances. Specifically including the garage when I total her monthly share. She just said if she knew was paying half the garage she would've said no a long time ago and was like ""why should I pay half of that"". I told her I just split everything 50/50, showed her how the bill comes from management company and I said that I'm helping pay for a 1/3 of the apartment I never step foot in. Now I guess I'm the bad guy. 

Have I not been fair chopping everything 50/50? Should I not include the garage in her rent? Should I chop the rent in 3 and ask her to pay 2/3 of the bills minus the garage and see how she likes that? I wanted to move to a house with a garage that would have been cheaper than the apartment but she wanted to stay.

Tldr: 3 of us in a 2br, girlfriend, her daughter, and I. Also rent a garage. Monthly bills are split 50/50 right down the middle including garage she doesn't use but suggested we get so we could stay in the apartment where she comfortable and not have to move into a new place. Is chopping everything 50/50 wrong?",28Nov2020,1

174,"ok so here's the gist of it:

im a tranny, unemployed, only have a high school diploma, no friends, no driver's license, no money.

my mom supports me but i know that ive done nothing to repay her. im literally a leech both financially and emotionally. ive basically never done anything positive for her since grade school.

so what do you think? do you think itll be easier on my mom if i just quietly killed myself? obviously im not going to do it in the house. i was thinking of doing it somewhere like secluded. i was thinking of just hopping on a bus and killing myself in some random forest. maybe ill dig a really deep hole first so no one finds my body while hiking so they dont get disturbed.

i know my mom will probably feel sad about it but dont you think one moment of sadness is probably better than prolonging the sad feeling that she gets just from me existing? also i wont be a financial drain that way.

idk, thoughts?

(heres some more information than in my other post): 

im on antidepressants and they basically dont work. also my mom is supportive of me being a tranny but she doesnt like it when i act like one. im sure she does love me but its more of like how u love ur child. its like ingrained in her. i let her down since i was a young basically because i lied a lot as a kid, basically got shitty grades and yeah. i have other family members but im mostly worried about my mom since the other people will get over it good its just that my mom is sick and im worried about the stress it might do on her. 

you might ask me why dont i just get a fucking job. i dont know. im scared of going out in public and speaking because i had a surgery and my voice is kind of fucked up. so i dont know what kind of job i should look for. also i know this is pathetic but ive never had a job before so i dont know how to look for one. 

im basically just a neet loser who watches youtube 24/7. 

if you need more information just ask. i dont think this is against the rules but if it is im sorry.",28Nov2020,1

The easiest and most simple way to fix it would be to cut it all off. I’ve wanted to have short hair for a pretty long time now but I don’t think my mom will be too happy about that. Everyone seems to love my hair and she wants to keep it long. I’ve never asked her if I could get it cut but one time she saw that my Mii character on the Wii had short hair. You would think that I asked for a purple mohawk, 3 tongue piercings, and a face tattoo because she immediately got mad at me and started saying that I am a girl and that I have long hair. She proceeded to make fun of the hairstyle and tell me that it looks nothing like me for the rest of the night.

I’m definitely not expecting to be able to convince her after that but I’ll never know if I don’t try. What are some ways to convince her to cut it? (She already cuts my brothers hair at home so we won’t need to leave the house to get it done)

185,"I've been living with my grandmother for some time.  I have been stuck in a routine of going to work, coming home, and spending all of time in front of a computer doing school work.  I believe this cycle is a heavy anti-depressant.

I have a toxic and negative relationship with my grandmother's husband and and I often live in a constant state of anxiety.  I primarily choose to avoid everyone and stay in my bedroom rather than to be confronted with conflict on something of a regular basis.

I can't comfortably use the restroom or the kitchen, and I always feel that I can never have a sense of peace or privacy.

The silver lining is I have a secure job and health insurance that is flexible with benefits, and I am not charged rent.  This allows flexibility and time and space to focus on college as I do consider it to be primary.

I have been offered to move in with a very close friend due to unfortunate circumstances.  Her roommate and her husband committed infidelity against her.  This has resulted on her only being dependent upon herself.

She has given me until the end of November to decide with the option of moving in by January.  The lease would be up until June.  She offered a position at her place of work.  She has showed me recurring pay stubs of the position she was in that I would be hired onto, that shows it is consistent.  

An approximation of what would be the expected amount of time worked, would be the same amount of time I work now except 6-800 more in income every month.  In a sense, this eliminates the added burden of the expense of the rent.

The problem is that I would be quitting a job I have seniority on, giving up my health insurance, and my grandmother would lose support that I have given her.  And, in just six months I expect I will have to make another move and transition when the lease would be up.

I currently have consistency and security.  I do have anxiety that changing that will risk my progress academically, potentially financially, and possibly my health (losing health insurance).  

However, the prospect of moving in with a close friend, to a large city, working a new job is exciting.  I believe I would be happier, have more life experience, make more connections, have more opportunities.

Lastly, I care for my friend deeply and I want to support her in any feasible way that I can and I can see a scenario to where we both stand to benefit.  

I feel that if I do go, I will break my security and put myself in a significantly higher amount of personal risk and if I stay that I will always regret I didn't take a new opportunity to have more and new experiences.

Any input is appreciated.  Thanks

186,"Hello, this is my first time in this subreddit. To start off, I'm a teenager who's still being looked after their parents. (My English isn't that great either, but hopefully it's understandable).

Well, the thing I want to ask is about my parents &amp; grandma. They're not in good terms because of some issues. I don't get to talk to my dad often so I only hear from my mom and grandma's side.

My grandma claims that my parents were ungrateful after everything she's done for them (she helped paid for the house my family lives in, paid my school fees, etc). She also claimed that my parents tried to remove her from the family business before she removed them. My mom claims that my grandma is controlling and abusive to her, &amp; that she technically stole some money from her business. 

I was actually in my grandma's side at first because of my past experiences with my parents. Growing up, my dad wasn't an active parent &amp; I felt extremely alienated from him. There were some issues I had with him, &amp; I didn't want to call him my dad. For my mom, I still remember that one time when she beat me up in bed when I was practically still a toddler &amp; up until now she still has anger issues.

Yesterday, I was talking to my grandma that my family is in debt &amp; is struggling with money. (It wasn't always like this, my dad used to earn a lot-- but he got fired due to some reasons). My grandma told me something that shocked &amp; upset me. It was that a long time ago, my dad bought a car for his sister &amp; and that he sent money to his other sister behind my mom's back. Also that the money from the business goes to my dad first, &amp; my mom struggles to ask him for money.

We planned to go out (yes, everyone wore a mask), so I had to ask my mom about it (it was only my bro, mom &amp; I in the car at that moment). I think she was shocked to hear that as she stopped the car for a moment. She asked who I got it from &amp; I told her it was grandma. At some point, she brought up that she realized she had the similar attitude as my grandma &amp; that she was sorry for the things she's done. She also said that my dad is the one who takes care of the finances (reason why the money from the business goes to him first) &amp; that he apologized already about the car, money sister thing. (There were also some other things, but I'll leave them out).

She also brought up a good point of why my grandma would tell me something like that. I'm starting to feel like I'm being manipulated. My grandma would often ask me about how my parents are and stuff about the business. Sometimes even ask me to take pictures of the workplace.

Honestly, I'm just really confused about this whole thing. Maybe it's better for me to not take sides? Anyway, I left some things out because I'm in a rush &amp; I don't want to leave huge blocks of texts.",28Nov2020,1
187,"First off I’d like to apologize for any potential fluff to the following passage as this all is coming off the top of my head, I will try and be as blunt as possible.
I’m 17 years old and I believe I may have depression the severity of which I don’t know. The most recent thing to happen to me with significant weight revolves around this girl.
I was playing call of duty with a good friend of mine we’ve been friends since middle school, in conversation with him I bring up a girl we went to middle school with and how pretty I find her, I also bring up how occasionally I’d open Instagram and I’d get 30+ likes all from her liking all my shitty memes on both of her accounts. My friend says he can get her to text me, I’d like to state that talking to girls in with the intention to try and date has never been my thing as I’m very self conscious and have little to no confidence in most things I do.  I tell him that I’m not asking you to but if you want to for me go ahead.
Another thing I’d like to add is that I don’t really go out of my way to text people, I don’t know how to initiate conversation with people and this lead to my 8th grades selfs biggest fear at the time, losing contact with what then were the best friends all of which made 8th grade the best year of my short life so far. 
He gets her to text me and we start talking and it doesn’t take me long to start liking her, I knew it was gonna happen. For me I usually get minimum attention from females so when even as little as just responding to me i get attached which has been to my detriment. In august we started texting on Snapchat and caught up with each other. After we caught up we started talking about each other and our texts were paragraphs to each other and I felt like she was genuinely interested in me or atleast just communicating with me. The first text she sent me after a help was jokingly how she wanted an apology for bullying her in middle school, as me and her weren’t the best of friends I’ll say the least, after I obliged she followed up with how she liked my attention even if we weren’t getting along. 
That to me felt significant, but as we talked I found out how many things we have in common, we both are extremely unmotivated in school, we both have parental issues and most important to me we’re both fans of the youtuber CoryxKenshin. 
Before I continue I’d like to point out that she is kinda awkward like me and she claims that she is anti social. 
After a month of texting she abruptly left me on delivered for a week and I decided to go back in and ask how she was doing and she responded with an apology for leaving me on delivered, and I probably mistakenly responded, dismissive of it and told her it was fine. The texts proceeded to carry on as normal, she’d respond about 20 minutes to an hour after my text and I respond within the half hour as seeing anyone text me excites me because my phone is baron, besides my group chat with my boys literally no one texts me. I usually see the text right away for that reason because at that time I was home with absolutely nothing to do so a text from anyone is well welcome to me.
We keep talking and she leaves me delivered again but this time for two weeks and I figured that she has no interest anymore and didn’t bother to text me or open the message, this would’ve been preferable. The two weeks after I texted her last she texts me out of the blue apologizing to me for not responding to me for so long, this time she says she’s been working on herself and school and stuff, once again I’m dismissive and tell her it’s okay and she says it’s not because she enjoys talking to me, and I thinking on it now while typing this it might’ve been made a mistake in responding with something along the lines of “no one ever told me they enjoy talking to me” I think thatve put unnecessary awkward baggage out there. 
But nonetheless we keep texting and I feel like maybe one day I’d gather up enough confidence to maybe ask her to hang out. The idea of that kept me happy and excited, emotions I haven’t felt for so long. The excitement got me to tell my sister about her, my only family member in which I have two, that I trust with any personal information. My sister tells me I should ask for her number and how she wouldn’t want to date some one who doesn’t have her number. Me being completely intimidated by that notion asks for her number in the most “I want to be friend zoned manner” and asked if she had an iPhone and wanted to play iMessage games, I got her number and it made me excited even though my demeanor towards her for the now month or two that we’ve been texting was friendly and not romantically interested but I got her number and that’s all what mattered to me. I’m not aggressive with women mainly because I don’t want to weird anyone out. 
Anyways we play imessage games back and forth and she used friendly competitive barker like calling me loser after beating me ins game and I personally thought it was cute as hell. it has now been about 4 months of us texting. Which leads to around now, November. At the end of October I got a job that I intitially got declined at and I planned to get my first check and then ask her out to an arcade at the mall and I planned to incorporate our constant iMessage games into the question, to see if she wanted to play games in person,and I wanted to pay for everything.
That would’ve been the plan but I saw an Instagram story of hers talking about how she has a crush that she didn’t force herself to have. As we texted I felt like I was further burying my intentions behind friendliness as I didn’t want to be weird so I didn’t feel like that crush she was referreing toward me ,And me being an emotional lonely teenage boy I took it really hard. In my group chat a mutual friend of me and hers asked if he looked at her story saying she’d had a crush the could look at mine saying the same thing, if not if I was okay and I unloaded because then I’ve been a mess for a few hours. They told me it’ll be best to move on and I wish I listened but I kept texting her as having some one to talk to individually like her meant a lot and still i felt like it could all still go my way. My friend that got her to text me told me to ask her out because I’d get an answer so I wouldn’t be so doubtful and to this day I haven’t done so, and now I do think it’s too late. 
Now in late November our texts have become shorter and less frequent, our texts once were almost every 20-40 minutes and now it’s a two texts from her and now sometimes it’s just her playing her turn on the iMessage game and not saying anything. I watch her stories on Instagram here and then and just today a few hours before me typing this she posted a story of her I’m what kinda looks like a restaurant I couldn’t tell as her camera was pointed towards the Celing, and the song he can only hold her from Amy wine house, my assumption is that she’s on a date.
I don’t believe she has lead me on, I unfortunately don’t find any of what she said as flirty, I believe that I’m leading my self on.
Now that all of that is out of the way I have to ask a few questions. 1. Which I most likely know, but have I been friend zoned? 2. Should I keep trying but be a little more aggressive with “spitting game” And 3. Am I just missing something here? 
Please if anyone who reads this can give me some insight, I only come to Reddit as a last ditch effort because I don’t feel comfortable talking to my group chat with my friends because I feel like a bother and an annoyance.  I have no one to talk to.",28Nov2020,1
188,"It’s almost 8 months since I have spoken to my newborns’ father and I’m wondering if I should reach out to him. 

He blocked my phone number and on social media when I was 6 weeks pregnant because I decided not to have an abortion. I had gotten pregnant by him 3 years earlier and had an abortion. I still feel guilty about it and try to convince myself it was the right thing to do at the time. I told him we can’t just keep getting abortions. We need to take responsibilities for our actions. He told me he was just having fun with me and I should find another man to be a father. 

I found out I was carrying twins at 9 weeks pregnant and was able to contact him to let him know. He said I’m trying to “manipulate him” and “persuade him.” He also said he wasn’t sure they were his. I was so hurt by this I didn’t contact him until I was 20 weeks pregnant. I called him from a blocked number. He asked who was calling and I said “it’s Suzy*”. He then hung up the phone. I called back and was sent to voicemail. I told him he was a “b****”, and that the worst thing I could have done for children was to have him as their father. 

It’s been over 5 months since that episode and my babies will be 1 month old tomorrow. (I didn’t contact him to let him know they were born.)

192,"Alright, so this is gonna be kinda long, so thank you in advanced for reading through and giving your option, some facts, just anything you comment. Thank you.

Also, before continuing, this is a situation of depression, and everything bad that comes with it. So here's your heads up about it. 

Ok, so I already know that yes, i do need help, psychology wise and all. But....i wanna know what for exactly, and why what's happening is happening. 

For some information on me, I'm 19F and I have been diagnosed with MDD. I was diagnosed at age 16, but when I went to therapy for it, it made me come to the realization that I've been fighting with it since I can remember (Genetic, it just got worse when I hit 14, went to get diagnosed at 16). My parents and I don't get along, and my siblings and I sometimes get along. My parents were always controlling, and when I was diagnosed, my mom always used it against me. It's my fault because of it, i can't go out in case I tried to hurt myself or others, i can't have any sort of privacy in case I killed myself. I just lost my identity there. Nothing went unsupervised for a long time, not even going to the bathroom. And my brother was no different.

So, i tell you all this because I have been living with depression, thinking it was all normal. So...i have this fear that I am living with something else that I am not really aware of or know what it is.

But....this timeline may clear up why I question and why I hesitate to look for answers professionally.

Age 14: things got really bad. I started to be angry at everything and everyone, i isolated myself, i hates myself and the world. I refused to talk, I refused to eat, I struggled to get out of bed. I cried a lot.

Age 15: Same as age 14, but then I started to SH, just little cuts, hitting myself, pulling strands of my hair. I started seeing little shadows from the corner of my eyes, and I heard voices, mostly myself, pointing out everything bad about myself, and pressuring me to end it or to hurt myself, every single day. To the point where I started to fight with it in my head but it was still going on everyday.

Age 16: Shit hit the fan. Same as before, but worse anger, worse isolation, worse SH such as biting my finger nails completely off, my fingers until they would bleed, bigger and deeper cuts, burned myself, and I would put myself in situations that i knew would hurt me somehow on purpose.

I asked my mom to go to the doctor, we went, and i was diagnosed and directed to a psychologist and given Antidepressants (worked myself up to 200mg)

Here's the thing ....i only went to a total of 4 sessions.... I never completed the 24 month plan we made with my doctor, and the only reason I got away with it was because I told my doctor i was seeing the one in my school, and I told the one in my school i was seeing somebody outside, and nobody verified.

I feel awful, stupid, just straight up angry with myself that I lied when they were trying to help me. But....the reason I stopped was because I felt so much more anger and hatred towards me, my family, and the world every time I got out of those sessions. No, 4 sessions was not gonna start improving me, i know that now and knew that then. But I was so angry and embarrassed about everything I had talked about, that somebody else had to even listen to me, that nothing will ever be the same for me again....i was so stupid.

A few months later....i did try on my life. I failed, but I did try. So i continued with life when I was ""better"".

Age 17: I was feeling better. Still had bad days but better. I continued the pill treatment but like I said, didn't talk to anybody. 

I met my current boyfriend. He knew about my diagnosis but not about the pills, not yet. I told him a day before we started dating, and he still accepted me. We broke up a month after.

No, at that point we hadn't fallen in love, but I did feel sad again, and I hadn't in a while. I stopped taking the pills for a week because I thought about how I felt and I felt confused. Why does this sadness feel so weird?? 

I came to find out that the pills had numbed me if all feeling. No happiness, no sadness, just numb. And I don't know how I didn't realize but I was basically a robot. So i left them for a while more. 

I started doing more stuff that were kind of reckless. Got a tattoo underage, I tried my hands on a few drugs, stopped eating again, ditched all my classes everyday, stole, SH again, just things i wouldn't ever do overall.. I don't really have an explanation for all this besides I wanted to (note: i didn't do all these things right away. I stopped taking them around beginning of November-March, so during this time period i was just careless). 

Age 18: I got back together with my boyfriend (been dating for 2 years in February, truly love him). We were doing pretty well. Then I decided to just take the medicine again. Again, no consultation from a doctor whatsoever. And I went numb again, but I noticed this time.

The only reason I noticed was because my boyfriend noticed, and he had told me I had changed, and i wasn't the same. The more we talked about it, the more we came to the realization that I was just numb. He could tell me he loved me, i wouldn't feel anything. He would tell me I look beautiful, i wouldn't feel shit. He would tell me problems with his family, oh well??? A family member died, well that sucks. I didn't feel anything....so after 2 months of taking them, i decided to leave them again. Nobody knew except my boyfriend. And after a month i was back to feeling and myself. 

Age 19: Here we are. It's been roughly 1 year and 8 months since I had taken the medicine....and I felt i have been getting worse through this time. Slowly, but just worse 

I struggle to talk again. And i try, this time I actually try, but I feel I could cry if I dare say something. I try to be more open, but I hate it more than ever, even to my bf. He has to push me to my limit for me just to say ""I'm feeling sad"" or ""I need help"". I trust him, i do, with my life. But I started to feel so scared to just talk. 

I feel I need to be alone but I can't at the same time. I'm scared to be, i don't like to be, but at the same time I feel I need to run into the woods and never look back, and leave everything behind. I can't look at people in the eyes, it's weird to me.

Recently...I've had the bad thoughts again. Of SH and...worse. Every morning I wake up, i think it, and I have such a hard time getting out of bed. I want to call out if work every single day, but I haven't. I start to want to crash the car while I'm driving. I think of driving away somewhere else where nobody could find me. 

I'm not in school this semester, but last semester i ditched, and ditched, and didn't do the homework, and i failed. I felt so weak and tired every single day I just felt i couldn't. And i feel the same way now. I think about going to school and I get physically tired and depressed. I hate thinking about having to go to class for who knows how many more years. I hate thinking about having to work for the rest of my life just to pay off bills, live, make some sort of living....i get so tired just thinking about it. And when it comes to doing it....i start to get even more tired. And i get sad because I can't do it. I struggle so much...

I don't have friends, despite how many times my bf has tried to push me to make friends by introducing me or encouraging me to go out and all. I just feel too scares or anxious to do so, idk what it is. I have the same voices and arguments in my head again.

I don't even wanna read anymore. I don't even wanna draw anymore. I don't even wanna paint, or cook, or swim, or work out, or do archery....i don't wanna do anything anymore. I just wanna lay down and rot away.

...i want to quit life. I wanted to be a psychiatrist and a college teacher, i wanted to have kids and foster kids, and that takes so much work that I was ready to do when I started college. But now....i wanna quit.

I don't want to take the medicine though. I don't want to feel nothing again. I don't want to see what I saw in my bf's eyes when he said I love you and I didn't feel the same. It was so much pain, and now, almost 2 years into the relationship....i would never forgive myself in another life. 

I don't want to give that same control to my parents. I still am under their roof (even though I pay rent for my room). I'm still under their insurance....i am across of them finding out and my mom using it against me. Always at all time, and saying I will never change and i can't ever be away from her. Never. It was so suffocating...

I don't want to keep walking around acting normal and just feeling absolutely nothing. And i know about it now, so k won't be ae to avoid the feeling of numbness. I don't think it would be a problem if i hadn't noticed but...i know it will be now.

I feel like a brat. Talking about everything I feel like a brat. But I just need to know....i don't know what's the right thing to do anymore. I don't know if I should look for other means (not harmful).

Help, please. Ive talked to my bf about this, all of this. And more personal stuff that I won't really wanna talk about unless asked. But I need outsiders perspective. I need help. Anything helps.

Thank you all for reading, I'm so sorry for the long post.",28Nov2020,1
193,"My mother started smoking again after two years
My mother and older brother got into a fight because my mother's diabetes was acting up and she would not let us take her blood glucose, it was 400. Anyway she said the only thing she loved was cigarettes, not her family, friends, or anything else. She dumped all her pills down the toilet and said she they are poison and that doctors are evil.  The smell of the smoke bothers me and my brothers breathing. What do I do?",28Nov2020,1
194,"So my mom has bipolar disorder and we have had a really complicated relationship. We are both women and are fairly close. My mom likes to sleep naked even with me in the bed which I’m not a fan of but I wear pajamas so I’m like whatever. However this week she was FaceTiming her boyfriend, their conversation was very normal and non sexual, and she starts touching herself on the call-while I’m laying next to her in bed. When she ended the call I said hey what were you doing? And she said touching myself. I said that’s inappropriate- and she said I didn’t orgasm. I then called an Uber and left her house. The next day she says that she is sorry, and that her boyfriend is just so sexy she had to touch herself. I did not respond. Now it’s been 4 days. She hasn’t called, she hasn’t taken responsibility-and it feels gross and violating that she did that. It’s a really weird situation, and I’m just going to wait it out until she apologizes. She tried to gaslight me and make me seem like the crazy one. She made me doubt myself. It’s a fucked up situation. Just because she’s my mom do I have to have her in my life? If she never apologizes do I just cut her out?",28Nov2020,1
195,"I’m stressed. My friends are mean, my mum is strict (and thinks I’m too young to be bisexual), and current events are just plain bad. I should probably explain. (Also on mobile, sorry)

First, current events. Well, y’all know what’s happening. My school used to be a hybrid during 2020 (every other day in school physically) but someone tested positive so we’re all at home until December 7th. I honestly don’t mind learning from home, I can get away with a LOT during online classes. Mainly during science. I swear, this teacher is the worst teacher to ever teacher. That’s a whole other story for another day though. However, this goes right into the next topic-

My mother. I’m not allowed to work in my room. I MUST work at the kitchen table (unless I get approved to work on the couch). The way my house is laid out is the kitchen is connected to the living room. There is no wall in between, just a set of stairs. Both my parents work, but my mum works right next to the couch and my dad sometimes works in the kitchen. This creates a LOT of background noise. My science teacher got pissy that I used the chat box (we use google meet) so I had some background noise heavy revenge. The Malicious Compliance sub didn’t like it because I mentioned current events, but it was pretty funny. That teacher still hates me though and gives me shit every class. 

Other things my mum does/did in the past two-ish months that stressed/pissed me off-

-when I told her I was Bisexual she said I was too young to decide that
-gave away my birthday gift from my friend because ‘someone else would want it’ (I have a YouTube channel, it was the perfect addition. I’m glad I got some footage when I did)
-(more of a thing that’s been a thing for a LONG time, but eh I’ll tell it here) is actively discouraging and makes me feel like I’m too young to do anything

I’m tired and don’t have the mental capacity to list more things right now, but the birthday point brings me to the friend problem. For context my birthday was on the 8th of November, so this was recent and I’m still upset about it. About a week before, my ‘friend’ (let’s call her R) decided to host a sleepover. And invited every single guest who was going to my party (she was going too). She invited everyone but me. The sleepover WAS ON THE 7TH. They drove from her house directly to my house. It wasn’t a secret either. The night before the sleepover one friend let slip they were having a sleepover (I don’t blame him, he didn’t know I didn’t know). the night of the sleepover THEY LITERALLY CALLED ME IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT boasting about how much fun they were having. My mum was still up and I cried to her. I was damn near cancelling the whole thing.

When they arrived I didn’t last long. During my party I had two mental breakdowns. About 15 minutes in I almost kicked everyone out but my friend (she’s the group therapist, let’s call her M) talked me out of it. We ended up having a great time when I got out of my funk. However, I’m still upset about it. Today I was talking with a friend from a different state (we’re best friends of 7 years, I open up about a lot of stuff to her, let’s call her S). S was talking about her jerk of a sister. I can confirm she’s a jerk, I’ve seen it first hand. It reminded me of all the shit people have put me though in the past two-ish months, and I just let loose. I kinda feel bad about interrupting her rant, but I couldn’t take it anymore. She didn’t have any advise to give me, sadly.

These are my only friends. I don’t know what to do. I hate R with all of my being (I didn’t like her to begin with, but this strengthened my hatred even more). M and S couldn’t give me any advise on this. I am seeing a therapist, but she double booked herself two weeks ago and we have yet to reschedule. I’m trying to start a small clay making business too so I can save up for S to visit as a birthday gift. It is kinda my fault I moved away from her, after all. It’s too much. Please help.",28Nov2020,1
196,"so for context, ive been friends with the same group of people since middle school, so about 5 years, and a couple of our other friends in the group for about 3 years. they’re really the only people that i hang out with, but lately (over the past few months) it just doesnt feel like they care enough about me anymore. anytime i would want to rant about things that were bothering me like abusive parents, terrible living conditions, mental health, things that were very important to me to talk to someone about, they wouldnt respond to me in the groupchat for hours or when they did theyd talk about it for a few minutes and then brush it off and talk about something else. lately, it just feels like im a burden to them and theyre so busy with their own stuff that they dont have time for me (one friend got a bf and spends every second with him, another got a bf too but just doesnt talk to me, another works all the time and didnt talk to me anyway, and another disregards me) i only have one real friend in this group, my best friend, and she checks up on me and talks to me all the time, but the others dont. a couple days ago, i turned off notifications for every app, group message, call etc that i was in with them and have just disappeared and not talked to any of them for days, and guess what? none of them but my bsf have reached out to me to talk to me or make sure im okay or just like chat at all. i feel so dumb and lonely, these are my best friends and it just feels like they completely forgot about me. i dont know what to do, if i should confront them in a message? or continue ignoring them to see how long it takes them to check on me? or just disappear completely and move on? please let me know if im a toxic friend for thinking this way and ignoring them to see if they care, idk if thats healthy or if im the problem.",28Nov2020,1
197,"I graduated from high school this year. After moving back to my home country(USA) to finish last year of high school I don't know anyone here, I don't have friends just my brothers and dad. My dad is always gone at work and my brothers doing their own thing so its like im living alone. I've lived in Europe for 4 years because of some major family problems and I adjusted there without knowing the language and almost failing 3 years of high school. A lot of trauma during that period but a lot of memories. I met my girlfriend, friends and had a fun and freedom life. I'm in a LDR currently. I'm working on a business here, studying a lot, researching a lot,but I don't like the culture in the USA, I miss what Europe makes me feel like. Although friends come and go, I feel like if I start the grind now and focus on my work life I will miss out on things at my age. I don't know where to make friends after finishing high school cause I may not be going to Uni, and I'm pretty much home all day working out. I look at my girlfriends life and other friends and maybe I shouldn't chase the money, even though I like what I'm doing. I always had a little dream to move somewhere in a city center, rent a little apartment and live for what each day has to offer. I'd meet a lot of foreigners, backpack, maybe even couch surf and live life simply without materialistic things... I like to DJ  house music so maybe I could grow that into something.

199,"I really don’t know how to write this, so please excuse any confusion or grammatical errors I will write this as clear as I can. I needed time to process everything that has been going on so I could write this clearly without crying my ass off. Over a month ago I (M18) came out to my parents as bisexual. They were NOT accepting. My mother went into hysterical crying while my father was mad, disappointed, angry, and blamed my mother for “spending too much time with her as home during all this quarantine that your mom’s femininity has rubbed off on you!” That’s literally what he said. They’ve accused me of “living a double life” for liking both guys and girls saying “you can’t live this double life! That’s not what normal humans do!” They tried to accuse me of “seeing” adults who are way older than me and saying that I’ve been brainwashed by them and bad influence friends when I’ve literally never dated ANYONE or even talked to anyone age inappropriate and all of my friends have actually been nothing but accepting and caring to me! They even asked me if I thought I was a girl! No offense to any girls obviously but I love my body and I am comfortable in my own body and I have always and will always be and identify as male. They even made me return my Dr Marten boots that had JUST arrived two days earlier because they said “only girls wear platform shoes” EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE FROM THE MENS SECTION OF THE WEBSITE. They also tried to make me return some nice overalls I had bought from forever21 but I had luckily thrown the receipt and tag away so got to keep those. There was a lot of crying from my mother and I and it hurt me knowing that my own parents don’t accept me, like me, or take pride in the person that I am. They said that “those kind of people are born like that. They are NOT made and YOU were NOT born like that. You were born a boy and you grew up acting like a boy!” Yes I was born a boy obviously I’m pretty sure me out of all people would know that. It was in the end of sixth grade when I started “feeling different” and questioning my own sexuality and questioning why I was finding guys attractive in the same was I finding girls attractive. I feel trapped in my own house with them monitoring my every movement and them constantly looking over my shoulder to see what I’m doing on my phone. The day I came out ended with them thinking that I’m “trying to turn straight and doing the right thing and doing what god wants.” Well, if we’re going that route, last time I checked 1)god doesn’t make mistakes 2)god makes us all in his image 3)god loves us all unconditionally no matter what. I don’t even know why they thinking I’m “trying to turn straight” when that literally NEVER came out of my mouth, neither directly or implied wtf. At this point I have no choice but to lay low in my own damn house until I move out. So far, my only chances at moving out is if the university that I’m applying to accepts me for next year (currently a freshman at community college) or if I MIRACULOUSLY win the lottery and become financially independent. Both which are hella long shots. I don’t know if I’ll be able to make it another school year in this house if this university doesn’t accept me because they are literally making it impossible for me to live here. And the thing is that I really foolishly thought that they would accept me. My mother was always defending the lgbtqai+ community when the news showed the violence that my community was experiencing. I guess everything is different when it hits home. I literally don’t know what to do except “lay low until you’re able to transfer to university” like my best friend suggested. I’ve have been miserable since then and I feel very uncomfortable in my own house and I can’t even open my phone around them without fear of something popping up that’ll make them mad or without them looking over my shoulder. It’s that bad. I had even asked my mother in the past if she was homophobic and she said “no. I respect them. I give them their space.” I came out because I saw on the news that the pope approved of civil unions between same sex couples and I asked her what she thought and she said that it was good because “the gay community needs to stop being attacked.” Thirty minutes later she asks me if I would ever consider dating, holding hands, or kissing a guy and I said yes and that’s when everything went downhill. I said yes because I felt secure and safe finally being able to come out and I thought they would be accepting. I was really wrong. I really don’t know what to do except hope that I get accepted for next year or if I miraculously win the lottery and move out. I’m writing this at midnight half asleep because if they saw me typing all this during the day they would freak so excuse anything confusing. They’ve already threatened to take my laptop, car, phone, etc if I don’t “do what’s right and become straight” so I have no option but to lay low for my safety. I don’t know what narrative they had in their heads when I was born but right now they don’t have my best interests in mind. They have their own interests in mind. I’m sorry to them but I am my own person with my own decisions and my own feelings and I don’t need anyone telling me what I am or am not in order for me to identify as a bisexual male. Even with all of my friends who drink and do drugs I have NEVER done any of those things because I am not easily influenced or peer pressured. If I were easily influenced and brainwashed like they think I am then I would’ve done all those things by now don’t you think? I really just want to get accepted to this university so I can move out and be myself and live my life. I don’t know how I’ll pay for it but I just want to get accepted there and figure the rest out from there. I just know that once I move out and firmly tell them “I am a bisexual male I know who I am” they will stop talking to me and will want nothing to do with me. I would love for them to accept me and continue being in my life but if they don’t want me in their lives then I can’t do anything about that. I’ll continue to succeed but without them sadly. I am proudly able to be who I am today because of them. They raised me right. To not let anyone But they don’t see that. Idk what else to do but lay low until I eventually move out to my university. I’ve given them their space here at home bc I don’t want any negativity happening and I just want to move on and live a happy life.",28Nov2020,1
200,"Alright I finally realized im a joke at work, got a boss who i don't like. For various reasons, but I feel like he likes to fuck with me due to my reactions to him.

201,"My mom is extremely strict, every time I've saved up money she has quite literally forced me to use it, regardless of where it's from, I've learned to spend it on things I want at the moment because of this, rather that than be forged to spend it on my meals when I go out with family which I have no choice on. And on a few occasions she has straight up taken the money.

I do not have a car, nor permit or license, I'm terrified of doing so but I don't have any convenient I'd and my mom won't let me have a bank account or repurpose one of their spare to save up unless I have my driver's license. And even then she keeps saying I don't need one till I move out.

My mom doesn't want me to leave because as is I'm kinda like a free maid, I cook 50% of the meals, I do all the laundry, I take care of every one of their fucking animals (nine), I do cleam single dish, all deep cleaning and organizing, I make her work-specific-meals and beverages, even when in the same room I go and have to do whatever she says and cater to her. She doesn't cook (my dad helps) or really do anything for herself besides get ready in the morning, and even then I pack her stuff. I'm her emotional punching bag too, if she's ever pissed she's cranky with me (almost constant) and I am not allowed to be even somewhat the same.

My dad is in a financially abusive situation with her, he owns nothing but his clothes, no one of our vehicles or house even though he pays for it too.

She wants me to stay for college, she would pay for basic bills and groceries and such as in I wouldn't have rent, but I would have the same responsibilities, as is it is really difficult mentally to do these things, she never appreciates or validates my effort and I'm constantly spiraling in and out of suicidal tendencies which are brushed to the side because ""we spend money on you"".

Let's say a blanket is messed up or there is a bowl and cup in the sink she is pissy for the next 30 minutes and even then, until she's almost in bed I do not have free time.

When I was physically attending public school I came home every day to hours of chores because the house needed to be this way and that, by time I was done it's dinner time and then I'm fucking spent and she had no sympathy and would bitch if I did not have stuff done by time she came home.

I don't know how to get out of here when I'm eighteen and I have no idea how to do anything like taxes or bills, I don't know how to drive and even if I get the test done she won't teach me. 

If there are any questions I can answer I'll try if I didn't cover it, but I feel lost everytime I think of next year, or when I finish high school.",28Nov2020,1
202,"I (16F) am desperately trying to figure out my life. Job, license. All that fun stuff. But now that I’ve started junior year the school and my mom are really cracking down on prepping me for planning out college and a career. I’m a little psyched out. Now I love to draw. I’ve been doing it for a long time but really got into it when I was 10. I feel like I’ve come a long way with it and that I’ve improved. Drawing and art is my passion and I’m really proud of my progress. Anyways, I really want to be an animator. Things like avatar the last air bender, watching it is just, mesmerizing. The animation is just beautiful. I look at things like that and I want so badly to do the same. My mom wants me to start a portfolio (Although I’m worried that what I draw isn’t good enough for one) But at the same time, my best friend thinks that I should do something more practical. For a while I considered just a 9-5 desk job, to ensure that I’m in a comfortable position. But not only would I lose my dream of becoming an animator, but I wouldn’t be able to attend art school. I’ve always wanted to go so I can experience everything. Pottery, sculpture, wood burning, painting, drawing especially. I want to learn it all. Watch myself improve. It sounds like a dream. But I’ve heard that it’s a tough business to get into and she’s worried that I won’t make it in the business and I’ll end up broke. And honestly I’m worried too. If I don’t pursue animation and drawing, what else could I do? A desk job sounds awful and the only other thing I like doing is baking, but I don’t like it THAT much. Im just so frazzled. What do I do if my art isn’t good enough to get into the business, or even art school? Or if I can’t find a job. I have no idea what I should do for a backup plan. I know that there’s actually a headquarters for rockstar games 20 minutes from where I live, and the animators make great money. But I don’t know if I could get in. What do I do?

205,"So I had recently met one of my old friends in my hometown and we started talking on Facebook messenger after that. We keep on talking about life and how we were doing and we exchanged numbers. We text and call but we don’t call much because we’re always busy. So I keep on texting her for a while trying to make myself relevant in her life(like just talking to her daily). I had started to develop some feelings after this. So for thanksgiving I went back to my hometown and of course I got word of this before we went. So I start asking her if we would want to meet up and hang out(we aren’t strangers so it’s not weird. Our parents know each other). She says that we should have met at the place she worked because it’s so close, but she doesn’t work during those days. So she declines it and says we can’t meet up because she doesn’t work that day. I say we can’t just meet up outside of work and she just ignores it and changes the subject. I should clarify that I felt a love for her when I called her late at night. So by the time she ignored the topic and changed the subject I felt heartbroken. I haven’t shown any of these feelings though. I’ve been very friendly and understandable like any good person would be to an old best friend. So I’m not sure she would even think that I think about her this way. A while ago her boyfriend broke up with her and she needed time to be alone. She seems to be over him now, So she’s single. I know I’m not entitled to a relationship to begin with but I really want to maximize my chance with her. I really like her and I want to make her happy.

207,"“I’m so over dramatic, all I want is attention,” I say to myself, sobbing in a corner of my room as quietly as I can, so my mother doesn’t hear. 
“Wow I’m stupid,” I exclaim as the genius next to me answers a question that I never knew the answer to.
 “I’m terrible at my sport,” I say as I beat my PR every other race, and the person next to me has been doing the sport years longer than me.
 “I’m a terrible horrible person,” I say as I get put into leadership positions by my peers. 

I can’t tell you how many times I have watched my friends repeat these things to themselves, talking about how stupid, or ugly, or mean they are. I tell them not to and I do the same thing. It makes me wonder, why can’t I take that advice? Why must I wallow in my sorrows over lost people and mistakes that can’t be fixed? I see people close to me put an incredible amount of stress on themselves, to the point they have mental breakdowns over little things because it’s just built up and built up and built up. 

Take a moment and breathe. You may not get that perfect test grade, perfect life, perfect job, or outcome. Work to do well in life, but don’t overwork to the point of burnout and exhaustion. Because when that happens, all you’re left with is depression and self hate. You telling yourself over and over and over again how stupid, incompetent, and irresponsible you are, causing this painful circle that you go round and round in. You can’t get up the energy to do that assignment or task, and then you fail it and beat yourself up. “Why couldn’t I do that? It was so easy, so simple.” 
Depression is hard. It’s even harder when you refuse to give yourself any amount of rest. I legitimately gave myself a stomach ulcer being so stressed and refusing to take any amount of time to rest. I’ll practice my sport until I retch and cough. I’ll fail a test and tell myself that it’s not worth it and I may as well quit. 

I recently got quarantined, and now I’m sitting here wondering, why on earth don’t I take my own advice? I hate my life, my personality, my face, everything about me. I sleep until noon then stay up until 2 am. Then i sit there and tell my friends how beautiful and worthy of love they are. My point is, when giving a friend a pep talk, remind yourself to take your own advice. After giving a friend a pep talk, look in the mirror and say it to yourself.

210,"I can't find a place that will allow me to post :(. I am seeing advice below:

I started a style blog that recently gained some traction and thought I'd share my Instagram and blog with my sister since I was getting some PR packages and shared some items with her after reviewing them. I told her I wanted to keep my blog and social media (Instagram, twitter) private and not shared with family or friends. My sister only lurks my social media but never comments or even like any posts, so she doesn't support me anyways. Recently on Instagram, she tagged me in a photo, even though I told her previously I wanted to keep my social media and blog private and only told her. I am thinking of now ""blocking"" her and other friends and family. I know this may sound extreme, which is why I am asking for advice. I don't want her to awkwardly confront me or makes the situation weird in any way. My reasoning for blocking family is because they are nosy and I really want my blogging space to be just for myself and freedom of expression. I feel like I can't freely post or talk about things when they are lurking everything I am up to. I feel like she may think that tagging my blog Instagram was harmless, but it really crossed a boundary for me.

212,"Hi, I just need some advice on an issue I’m thinking about.

My boyfriend is graduating next week from college. It’s taken him longer then others to finally get through school (due to financial issues and poor decisions in the beginning of his college days), but he’s made it to the end and we’re all of course stoked. We live in a two bedroom townhouse but we only have a one bed upstairs. Our room downstairs only has a rug and a single couch. My boyfriends mom is coming out of town to visit us for his graduation and will be staying with us. My mom is also coming next week to stay with us for his graduation (My boyfriend attended my graduation and my mom feels strongly about wanting to show support to him as well). They will both only be in town for 3-4 days.

Anyways, we’re not sure who to give the bedroom upstairs to now. At first it was my boyfriends mom hands down, but now with my mom coming we don’t know. Granted, his mom offered beforehand to buy a blow up mattress because she felt bad about taking our bed, but my boyfriend had already told her that we don’t mind her taking it before hand. 

The only reason I’m really debating it is because due to him being in school &amp; not working at the moment, I pay for a majority if not sometimes all the expenses when it comes to the house (which is fine with me!) So I feel bad telling his mom that she now has to sleep on the air mattress, but I also feel bad telling my mom to do the same when I’m paying for the place we’re all staying at. I also paid for his mom (and the 2 nephews in her care) plane tickets without telling my boyfriend because she confided in me that she wasn’t sure she would be able to come out and visit due to personal expenses. The tickets were only $23 per person and I knew my boyfriend would be crushed if she couldn’t come so I had no problem offering to pay. (She even offered to pay me back but I declined, she’s a really nice person going through hard times)

I don’t know, I could really just be overthinking this, but who do you guys think should get the bed? My boyfriends mom because the weekend is about her son or my mom because I’m paying for it all?",28Nov2020,1

218,"I just want to preface this by saying that it's my first time posting on this section of Reddit, so please excuse any repetitiveness (a major flaw of mine), rambling (another flaw of mine) and bad grammar. I have a lot to get off my chest and I'd really like some advice. This is also on a throw-away account, but I don't know if it's worth it because the details on this are pretty incriminating already.

I'm currently in university and am trying to maintain a friendship that started... five years ago? It doesn't sound like long but is one of the longest friendships I've had. I have intense social anxiety that makes it difficult to make new friends (or even talk to new people), and I have a feeling that it might also be affecting my ability to maintain friendships long-term.

However, in this case I don't think I'm the only problem. This friend is very nice, we fit in almost every way (similar interests, hobbies, same way of thinking, etc.) . I have not just social anxiety but physical health problems, and she's very understanding and accommodating of my health issues. I don't think she really understands my social anxiety, though, because from her perspective she's seen me as this loud, brazen girl (which I was in high school - I was confident, conversationalist and outgoing) but now we go to separate universities, so she hasn't really seen me in an interaction outside of our friendship group (which is literally just us two now, due to various other issues we've lost touch with the other part of the group - but there was no arguing or conflict, we just didn't connect with them). Therefore, I don't think she 'gets' it and although I've tried explaining it to her, it kinda seems like it goes in one ear and out the other.

One of the main reasons I'm writing this post is because due to the pandemic, I've currently been doing the responsible thing and staying inside as much as I can. Because she's a social butterfly, she likes to have people over at her house - it's never a party, but always one person at least every night (she also posts on social media almost hourly so it's not difficult to miss). I've never judged her for this although it isn't within our town's guidelines, because as I said before, it's not like she's hosting parties and she isn't one of those people who don't believe COVID is a thing.

I feel like due to this, it has been a sort of ""out of sight, out of mind"" situation and we haven't talked for... geez, months. No texts, no phone calls - during the initial stages of the pandemic, we had video calls and texted daily. For months it's been radio silence and her mother has actually been the one to reach out to me sometimes to say that she misses me. Just a side-note because I know this sounds weird, but it really isn't - I'm an avid fan of board games, my family doesn't like them. I don't want to force them to play it, but my friend's family adores board games so pre-pandemic I frequently went over to their house to play board games with her family instead. I have good relations with my family and hers, it's not anything alarming.

Anyway, so (maybe) a month or two ago, I reached out to my friend after her mother reminded me of plans we ought to make. She put the reins into my hands and said she was up for anything I was comfortable with during a pandemic - I have a feeling she thought she was doing me a favour. So after ruminating in it, I mentioned an online escape room (something she and I both enjoy plus it's COVID safe). She didn't seem very excited about it but she's normally quite stiff over text, so I had a niggling doubt in the back of my mind but thought I was just overthinking it. After texts back and forth, she kinda left me on read (as in, I was the last person to text but there was a conversation so it wasn't like I had been conversing with myself). I do think I'm slightly to blame here for overthinking the fact that I was the last person to text and she left me on read when I should've checked up, because she could've just forgotten about it. So, a month later her mother commented on one of those Facebook memory posts (as in, the thing Facebook uploads to show that it's been one exact year since \_\_\_\_\_, in this case it was a games night that happened exactly a year before). I said, fuck it, I'll text her and I texted my friend.

She replied and we negotiated a date to meet (exam season and shit for us, plus I have a socially-distanced wedding to attend in a few weeks). I think she did feel bad for essentially not talking to me for months, and she said (paraphrasing here), ""I was busy with work and have had trouble adjusting to online coursework, plus X Y Z, so I'm sorry I didn't text you."" This just rubbed me the wrong way because she's had months to get in touch with me, plus she seems to forget that she posts literally everything that happens in her life on social media - I've seen that she has had people over almost every day or she's gone out to meet this other person. Or she's reminiscing on social media about concerts she could've gone to or she's previously went to that she can't go to anymore cause of the pandemic - this isn't an issue, but it's the fact that she could've texted me anything during the time she was reminiscing on social media. She could've literally sent me a photo of a spork and I would've happily responded to her with a stupid-ass answer because... that's what friends do, or at least that's how our relationship was.

This isn't the only issue I have with that comment she made. Before this pandemic she's had this mentality that I'm always available for her because she's busier than I am (she has two part-time jobs and coursework, plus is very diligent with her dogs and hobbies). I've always complimented her on her ability to manage her time well, and always half-jokingly put myself down in the process (for example, ""I can't believe you have time to do all that when I can't even do \_\_\_\_\_""). I have a feeling this has become fixed in her head so now she genuinely thinks I'm doing nothing (when I've been doing loads of extracurriculars to improve my job prospects after my degree, taken on another course alongside the one I'm already doing, applied to and got accepted to an internship). Whenever I bring up her inability to make plans with me (ALWAYS in a casual, jokey way and with a lot of thought to make sure it appears this way), she always comes back with, ""I've been busy with my two jobs and coursework..."". When I said I wasn't going back to the town my uni is in because everything is online anyway and it's much more cost-effective to live at home, she replied back to me something along the lines of how since she's busy, she can meet me whenever she has time now. I did correct her immediately (""I do have my own life ahaha but yeah"") but I do think that's what she thinks now.

I've been rambling on for way too long but anyway, my main problem is that it seems like she just doesn't seem to know the concerns I have regarding a) my social anxiety, b) my time versus hers, c) how I feel about the way she says things, d) her prioritising other people over me. She hangs out with other people over me, hasn't even texted me yet she manages to post and tag other people on random posts all the time, has even managed to find a boyfriend in the middle of a pandemic (although to be fair, she's been really eager to find one so I'm happy for her). The thing that, I dunno, hurts my feelings the most is the fact that I'm one of her longest friends too and yet she's not really reached out to me whatsoever. When I did reach out to her a few months ago with a casual, conversational text with an actual subject, she replied to me really formally for some reason and sent me a text that was polite yet dry, so I literally had nothing to work with. It just doesn't feel good to know that you aren't worth someone's time to even text a word saying hi whilst with other people she's willing to spend almost every day with them - and the fact that her mother has been missing me and communicating with me more than she has.

I just don't know what to do? I'm meeting her fairly soon (literally a few days before Christmas) and I don't want to ruin the mood of such a festive event. I do feel significantly upset about it, though, but I'm so anxious that I think I'll just skim over the issue and be like ""haha it's okay"" when she tries to excuse her lack of interest in communicating with me. Before, I wasn't very scared of confrontation (like I said, I was outgoing and confident) because I do think problems need to be addressed, not brushed under the rug. But I feel like if I try to call her out, I'll just end up seeming like a jealous, overprotective bitch (""You're always meeting other people but you can't text me!"").

I apologise for the lengthy post and I'd really appreciate some good advice on how to handle this situation!",28Nov2020,1
219,"Ok. Theres a girl i really like and just think the world of. She is super sweet and fun to be around. Im 18 and shes 19 so nothing weird. We started texting a week ago and everything seemed fine. There was flirting and shit and everything was good. One day she asked to hangout.  I agreed immediately. I came over and we cuddled and watched a movie. She turned towards me and we talked about random stuff but it was meaningful conversation. I didnt want to try anything like going in for a kiss because i wanted to make her feel comfortable. Out of nowhere she asked me if she could kiss me. I obviously said yes and it was straight out of a hallmark movie. Romantic as hell. She initiated everything and i made sure everything was ok with her. I left that night at 12 because me and her wanted to stay together. The next day everything is just peachy. She starts acting weird and she asks to be left alone. I respect it and leave her alone. The next morning i get a very long text basically saying she isnt ready for a relationship or anything because she isnt exactly mentally stable and has baggage. I told her i 100% understood and that we could stay friends untill she felt ready. Its only been two days and it feels like a month.

239,"Hey everyone, I’ve been losing a lot of weight recently and I’ve dropped quite a bit in terms of size. My bras (38DD) no longer fit me, and I can definitely notice a size difference when I see them in the mirror. 

I sort of knew this would happen, starting off as large as I was— but I’m dismayed at this reality. I don’t want my tits to look like deflated balloons :/

What can I do to continue my weight loss but minimize the impact on my boobs?",28Nov2020,1

242,"Early November my father passed. My father was a simple guy and didn’t want a service but my step mother (which I will refer to as Jane in the post.) who was separated from my father for some years, insisted. So I offered to pay for part of it with the money I had received from a gofundme. My aunt told me to not worry about it that I should use the money to take care of my brother and sister 16 &amp; 15 because I was getting custody of my brother and my older sister took in my younger sister. 
No problem. Right? Wrong. 
A week or so goes by and my friend shares the gofundme and someone donated a good amount to it. So my uncle (ref. Dave) unblocks me from Facebook and decides to message me after four years of not speaking, to do what? Ask for money of course. So I told him no and that his wife told me to use it for my siblings.

Now my dad has a truck that nobody could find the title to and we couldn’t file for a lost title because the death certificates had not processed yet (slow because of COVID) so I parked it at my fiancé’s fathers house until we knew who the TOD was and everyone was okay with that. 
About 2 weeks after, Dave drove Jane to the house in the middle of nowhere in pitch black to take the truck. Jane said that she heard from someone that I had the title and I was hiding the truck from her because she was the TOD. I later found out that she is the TOD because she had called the dmv. Had she asked me to come get the truck because she new she was the TOD that would have been completely fine, I just didn’t want it going to the wrong person. But no, she is telling people that I hid the truck from her and that I knew all along that the truck was hers. 

My father owned a home that I am trying to save because I am the only one financially able to. As far as I know everyone agrees and they said it was a good thing that I am trying to save it. I’m in the process of getting the title and loan transferred to my name. I changed the locks, put up some signs and put a pad lock on my fathers door. (There was already a latch there to begin with.) My grandmother still lives there and all of her income went into my fathers account so I took my fathers card and got my grandmothers money, and money for the light bill for my fathers house from the account before it was closed. My father also received food stamps so I took the card and bought food for my brother and also for my grandmother, I am now waiting to meet up with my older sister so she can use it for my younger sister. 
I get a message from my grandfather on my biological mother’s side and here is how it goes;

Him: Really Ryoshi! You won’t like the outcome. It will bite you in the ass!

Me: What do you mean

Him: So you haven’t taken all of the go fund me money,your dads debt card,the food stamp card, his truck that was hidden at a house of one of your fiancé’s relatives, didn’t put a pad lock on the bedroom door should I go on! It will come back around...

Me: I parked the truck there because I didn’t have room here at my apartment, I took the debit card so I could give grandma her money that was in there and then the account was closed, I have the food stamp card because I have *brother* here and I’m waiting to meet up with my older sister to give it to her, and of course I pad locked the door because my brother (not the one I have custody of) is a thief and likes to sell everything he can get his hands on for drug money. And my aunt told me to keep the go fund me money for the kids and the house, I gave my older sister $1200 of it already and the rest is in an account waiting to see what is happening with the house. Don’t believe everything everyone else says either... I offered to pay for the funeral and my aunt said save the go fund me and use it on other things we need and as soon as someone donates a big amount uncle dave unblocks me from Facebook after not talking to me for 4 years to ask me for money when they specifically said no when I offered. How is that fair?

Me: I gave grandma her money and I paid the light bill and then the account was closed. 

Everyone is acting like I’m taking advantage of everything I can when in reality I am giving everything I can to help my older sister and The kids.

Me: I’m saving the rest of the go fund me to fix the house if I get it like I was told. If I don’t get the house then obviously I have no problem splitting it up for everyone. 


Am I a piece of shit? Should I be giving more? I’m not even sure what more I can give. I respect my grandfather more than anyone in the world and it seems like him and everyone else is against me for doing the right thing. I am a 21 y/o M and I feel like I’m being more of an adult than anyone around me. A part of me feels like I should just give up and I’m not sure what to do.",28Nov2020,1
243,"So I'm a student, and a part time worker. I lost my previous job in March due to COVID because I worked in a hospital, but I wasn't deemed essential so I decided I couldn't wait and found a new job at a restaurant.

I've been working there for 6 months and most of my coworkers I love. We even hang out sometimes out of work! The cooks though, I believe are talking bad about me, although I can't confirm for sure. They only speak in spanish, but there's only so many times they can say the words ""puta"" ""Gorda"" as I walk by without starting to get uncomfortable lol. Where I work from we can see each other and every time I look up literally they're looking at me, giving me death stares or laughing straight in my face.

I've gotten close with most of my coworkers, so im able to let my guard down around them and joke but other than that i'm really shy around the rest of the workers because I don't know them well and I have horrible anxiety. There's no way i've ever been rude to them or disrespected them because my anxiety literally wont allow it. We got on fine for a little, then things just started to change. It gets really uncomfortable because I have to speak to them directly a lot about orders and such and they ignore me, wont even look at me when I speak to them.

I don't really know what to do because I don't speak spanish, I have no proof they are talking about me but it's become kind of obvious. I asked one of my friends/coworkers about it and he simply said he doesn't want to be ""put in the middle"" so there's obviously something going on.

I would tell my manager but I have a feeling she doesn't like me, and I don't want to sound stupid since I have no concrete evidence.

Do i just ignore it? Do I find a new job? Any advice? :(",28Nov2020,1
244," At the beginning of covid we all agreed that if one of us got it, we all  got it. Fast forward 8 months later and I and another roommate return  to our home states for thanksgiving while following the rules. The next  day after we leave, the other two roommates decide to go to an illegal  rave, and feel sick the next day. We both get calls telling us to stay  in our home states for two more weeks. This pisses me off really bad. I  just got a promotion and have to go into work to pick up new equipment. I  also want to pick up groceries for them because they tell me they have  been going to the grocery store. Which is fucking stupid. I want to go  back into my house which I pay for. I only brought a few pairs of  clothes on this trip and have a limited time With my family. And if I do  have the virus. I do NOT want to give it to my family. I have told the  two infected roommates that I need to come back. They say they WILL LOCK  ME OUT OF MY OWN HOUSE IF I COME BACK ON MY SCHEDULED FLIGHT. I looked  into moving it and it will cost a lot of money which I don't have,  because I have being paying for their rent and food because they lost  their jobs to covid. We all agreed that if one of us gets it it will be  faster for all of us to get it and just get it over with to waist  minimal amount of time being sick. Now they are saying that if I come  back I will get it and will have to make them isolate longer. But If I  come back in two weeks to a house with people infected living in it, I  will surely get rona and delay them from working longer, screwing  EVERYONE over. Am I really such an asshole wanting to return to my house  and get the virus and get it over with asap? And even not, I have  suggested the idea of me getting a hotel until they are clean so I can  maintain my job, but they said ""That is stupid and selfish"". Am I really  being selfish?!?! I need more clothes. I need to be able to work a job  to support THEM. I have suggested work arounds. They are hippocrates for  going to the store and out doing shit. WTF?

Self-worth will help us be a little more selective. You understand what it’ll cost to have your attention, and you don’t allow yourself to be up for grabs for anyone that shows you the slightest bit of attention.

We keep ourselves from romanticizing when we realize to do that means to strip people from choice. At that point you’ve decided on a story they don’t even know they’re playing along to nor probably want to.

We keep ourselves from romanticizing when we switch perspectives and try to imagine how it would feel if someone were to do that to us. You’d feel like a puppet on strings. “Dance for me monkey... now tell me you love me.”

We keep ourselves from romanticizing when you realize these people are whole ass individuals, someone’s child; with aspirations and hobbies and the ability to say no.

We keep ourselves from romanticizing when we see we’d rather get to know the subject a little more to see if they’re even fit to be in your life. Next to all that self-worth and sovereignty.

He sent me a message yesterday, but I've been debating on what to do with it. I have a lifelong habit of dumping any and all friends but I'm getting old. Friends are a rarity now, which makes me think twice.

I found out that he's a liar. He knows that I don't participate in social media because it's cancer. The thing he doesn't know is that while I don't ""participate"" I still stalk him with fake accounts, because everyone will eventually turn on you, I've learned in life.

I discovered that he was dishonest about several things. He's a secret raging liberal when he knows I'm very conservative. He might have intentionally baited me with his girlfriend. I believe he did this to trick me so he can talk behind my back or annoy me.

I didn't take the bait, remained silent, and after I discovered this treachery, asked him several times if he was still with the same girl to which he answered in the affirmative.

If he's that sneaky, what good is it to keep him around? What use is he to me?

On the positive side, he can be a good guy. I declined, but he offered his home to me when I was almost homeless again and invited me to holiday parties. That was touching.

I just have this constant level of distrust because of what I've found behind the scenes. He was at the very least misleading on some things. How do I know if he's not taking notes and plotting?

Overall, she's never really 'worked' so this was all new to her. At her new job, there is a girl our age (who is lesbian) that has been helping her get by. This girl is very nice to her and sometimes does her tasks and helps her out with her tasks. She's always there for her, and my girlfriend has developed feelings for this girl.

259,"(Ben)Me: 17M, 
Father: 53M
Mother: 51F
Bill: Older Bro, 19M
Todd: Twin bro, 17M

Names have been changed for anonymity. 

I don’t want to hurt anyone. I love my family, especially compared to my other relatives. However, more and more, I’ve been feeling pressured and forced to live a fake life around them, lying about awkward and forced my statements are with them, how much I hate Bill due to his mockery of my sexuality, and how he seems to be extremely ignorant, and how I can’t go to them for help. Here’s the gist. 

1. Ever since middle school, I’ve been getting these long lectures from my father about health and work ethic. They make sense, but they were boring and I mean, we’re in middle school. We didn’t pay attention for 3 hours. Sorry. 

Now, these have been playing up into legitimate issues that I’ve been seeing more and more commonly with my dad. He’s less and less able to think with his heart and empathize, and instead thinks things logically through way more often. Even after I’ve shown him multiple times that my instinct is to live on my heart, despite what he says about my Mensa brain. I just want to live happily. He seems to think every problem has an answer, when it doesn’t. 

I went to therapy after a while, and my therapist saw what was wrong, and after that, I started lying. Constantly. I’ve been constantly fake to my father’s face, and he’s been eating it up. It’s awful, and hurts to do. But it keeps him happy. I want to tell him the truth, but in a way that won’t ruin his life view, since he’s only been continuing this life lecture business with me in HS. Not Bill or Todd. Only me. I’m scared of him. 


2. My older brother. 
Bill can be funny. I get that. Lots of his jokes land perfectly, and his laugh is infectious. I can also get behind his often offensive humor. It’s hilarious. What I can’t get behind is when he makes his jokes personal. Not in a “you insulted my sexuality now die” sort of way, but in a way that’s specifically targeted at me. 

Bill loves making sacrificial humor. He insults one person specifically, and we all laugh at it. For my whole life, I’ve been his guinea pig in this. My family’s gotten involved before, but they gave up once he hit junior year of HS, 2 years ago. I’ve felt mercilessly bullied by him, and am afraid of him seeing me, because he always cracks a joke I’ve asked him to stop constantly. “Ben Ten” I got bullied for it in elementary school, and am somewhat scarred by it, hating the name. I don’t know how to get it through his thick skull that personally insulting and bullying a family member to their face isn’t okay. I hate it. 

3. Lack of good support. 

My twin brother doesn’t do much. He’s not that socially adept, and is bad at picking up clues or hints. He works hard, but is dense. 

My mom is caring in a motherly way, but doesn’t usually help get to the route problem. Just helps me calm down. Little more. And now she has COVID so not even that. 

I want to run. Please help. I’ve been talking to my friends constantly about this and I’ve been bottling it up for a while and I don’t know what to do.",28Nov2020,1

261,"*TDLR; Right before the pandemic hit I \[22M\] was in a situationship with a guy I like \[23M\]. I feel like there was a misunderstanding that scared him away. I've wanted closure on that situation ever since, but in between now &amp; then there's been several reasons why I've been hesitant to ask. At this point, I feel like it's weighing on me so I really want closure about what happened. Since it's been so long I'm worried bringing it up now could seem intense, especially since I have issues with over-explaining, so I'm trying to figure out how to bring it up on a simple way.*

When I \[22F\] first start crushing on someone, it’s usually a mutual friend that I don’t know much about yet. I might really like them but I **don’t** want to go on dates yet. I prefer to build a friendship first. I prefer to hang out with them in-person for awhile (which could be several months) and see who they are in a candid setting. *Then,* if I still like them after all that, I’ll ask them on a date. I’m gray-ace so I’m rarely attracted to anybody, so this doesn’t waste my time because there’s nobody else I would be talking to anyway.

Last year I started liking a guy \[23M\] I met in my college town. He had a girlfriend at the time, so I didn’t act on anything because he was taken, but we did become friends. A few months into our friendship, him and his girlfriend broke up. Even before their breakup, I felt like there was an underlying attraction in our friendship but I wasn't sure. I couldn’t tell if it was sexual or romantic tension, but if there was I wanted to address it. We were friends, but new friends. I still hadn’t spent enough time around him to know if I would ask him on a date. Also, considering he was fresh out of a relationship I figured he wouldn't be interested in dates anyway. So I was wondering if he’d be interested in being FWB but I wasn't sure how to ask. At first I thought I'd play things by ear and just see how things felt, because we hung out quite a bit. But he got super busy around that time so I wasn’t able to see him as much anymore. I was worried if there was mutual attraction and I waited too long, I would miss my chance to say something.

I felt like it would be overly-confident to ask if there was something going on between us, because I really wasn't sure. Instead, I thought maybe I could put my attraction on the table so he'd feel comfortable admitting it back. But I wasn’t sure how to phrase that, so I ended up telling him I liked him which wasn't what I wanted to say because I knew it could give off the wrong impression. I felt like he misinterpreted this as me wanting to get into a relationship which is exactly what I feared. I think he felt pressured to give me an answer when I just wanted to go with the flow, which I never got to clarify.

About a week later we ended up alone and the room was thick with sexual tension. I was shy and closed-off because I was worried it was all in my head, and I didn't want to do anything that made him uncomfortable. When we finally admitted we wanted to hook up, he said he was hesitant about pursuing me because he was worried that something was going on between me and my close guy friend (there wasn't). We talked about it. We ended up not having condoms, so we only fooled around. I felt like we didn't get to properly feel out our chemistry that night. After that, there was some confusion and that situation was never really properly addressed and he didn't reach out much. Then I had to move away in March because the pandemic, and we got separated. We talked about it a little, but it was lightly brushed upon and it didn’t really give me the clarity I wanted about how he felt about me at the time or what exactly was going on.

I’m stuck where I was in March where I still really like him, but I still wouldn't make a move because 1) I never got to see him open up in person and 2) I'm not interested in LDR or Zoom dating at all. Him and I both have the same trait where we’re really shy the first few months of a friendship, but show more of our personality over time. We were still in that stage of shyness when I moved. We’ve been video calling each other since May (as friends, nothing flirty) and have been more of ourselves, but I really value in-person interactions and seeing what it feels like to actually be in someone's presence.

Over the summer, he started dating around again and I was a little sad that I wasn’t able to be there to see how things would’ve played out with us organically. I was really curious to see what our chemistry would’ve been like (sexual or romantic). Then in September I found out he was in a relationship, and it kind of got to me because that situation with us felt so inconclusive but there was nothing I could really do about it anyway. I started to drop off and talk to him less, because it was a weird emotional back-and-forth and having trouble processing it. I still wanted closure about what happened earlier this year, but I asked for advice about it on here and the consensus was that since he was in a relationship it could be misinterpreted as being manipulative or trying to interfere. So I didn’t end up asking him about it.

As of a couple of days ago, I think him and the person might’ve broken up from a few things I saw on social media but I’m not entirely sure. So now I’m trying to figure out what to do, because that curiosity is eating away at me about that situation but it’s “old” now. I’m afraid it could seem strange asking about it now, because it might seem like I was waiting around for him for that long and seem creepy. I wasn’t technically waiting on him, I just happen to still like him. I also have a problem with over-explaining that stems from childhood. I keep feeling like if I bring it up that I need to give a whole justification about why i'm bringing it up several months later because I'm so afraid as coming off as a creep if I don't explain why. But I'm worried over-explaining could come across as stressed and intense. So I need some help on how to start that conversation/lead into it?",28Nov2020,1

264,"M/19 I’ve been struggling for over a year now. I thought things were getting better but tonight I went to eat with my girlfriends parents and some of her family and it was awful. I feel I made a fool of myself and I was just utterly embarrassed. I cried in her arms when we got back to my house. I don’t know what to do. 

My main problem is my eyes. I don’t know where to look in social settings, my eyes usually just go down and I’ll look at the table or ground. I also move my hands a lot like rubbing them together or something. 

I’m pretty sure the reason I get anxiety is because I’m kinda short (5’6) and it drives my confidence way down. 

When I get the anxiety it feels like I have no control. Like someone or something else is driving and I’m taped to the backseat having to watch. Some things that happen: I’ll be looking in a direction and someone else will look toward me and I’ll unconsciously look a different way, or when I’m looking at the table it’ll feel like my vision is trapped and I can’t look up. 

I really can’t do this shit anymore. I just want to be happy for myself but also for my amazing girlfriend, she’s the best and I want to be better for her.  Can someone please just tell me what’s to do. 

Thank you",28Nov2020,1

This girl and I have gotten super close and it seems like we really like each other. I felt like things were moving in a good direction. She invited me over for drinks last week and we had a great time, the vibes were kinda off so I didn’t make a move and she seemed annoyed ever since. The next day she sent me a good morning text with these emojis 🥳💃 saying she had a great time. But some days she seems off and other days she’s all over me. It’s confusing 


So the other day she sent me a morning text on thanksgiving with a heart 


Long story short I have other reasons to believe she likes me so I just straight up asked if she just meant it in a friendly way 


“ I’m sorry I’m dumb and a bitch but I don’t remember putting a hearttt. I just don’t usually use the heart emoji ever for anyone so idkkk I’m sorry I’m dumb.  I at least never ever use the red one 😂 I assigned the colors all different meanings so idk “",28Nov2020,1

269,"After years of not having a single ""real""girlfriend I finally have a girlfriend the only problem is...I don't feel the same way about her. She's so...Lovey Dovey and we only met 3 months ago and she started having feelings for me in October. the only reason I said yes to the relationship is because I've never had a girl actually be attracted to me and actually want to date me so I said screw it and decided to date her. I really do want this to work but shes so clingy and texts me all the time and calls me babe and baby all the time and I can't break up with her cause that would break her heart and I would feel really really bad and now I think I've been leading her on because I've been saying I love you to her with hearts and kiss emojis, and also telling her i love her when she says i love you on call. She decided to date me during fall break so right now were not in person we are just texting and calling so shes been talking about how she misses me and how much it sucks we cant see eachother until january (cuz i decided not to come back for 2 weeks because i thought it was dumb just to go back for 2 weeks then stay home for 2 weeks then come back again for 2 weeks then stay home then come back for 2nd semester)...

anyway i just don't feel the same way, like I don't really love her but I WANT to love her, and I feel bad that I don't love her and that I'm leading her on but I also don't want to break up with her because it would break her heart and I would feel really bad, so I don't know what to do at this point, plus she's already talking about our first kiss and I don't even know how were gonna do that with this whole pandemic going on. 

Side Note: This is her first real relationship and also my first real relationship. She also has a lisp and not alot of people like her at the college we go to because of how rude she is to people and how bossy she is. Also I think she has a lisp or something but I'm not sure because it sounds like when she talks shes deaf or something I dont know, but she isnt deaf. I know none of this matters I just think mabye these might be the reasons I don't feel the same way and I know I sound like an asshole I'm just really confused and really wanting a relationship but I don't feel the same way about this girl and cant get out of the relationship without breaking this girls heart so I don't know what to do. 

In summary: I Finally found a girl who likes me but she's super clingy and not liked by alot of people, we met 3 months ago and started having feelings for me 1 month ago, since early October or late November she started sending me shit every other day telling me she has feelings for me and asking stuff like ""If we get to know eachother more can you see us happening?"" ""I have feelings for you"" ""I still have feelings for you"" telling me she has a crush on me in pm on zoom class and when I keep rejecting her advances she spam texts me saying shit like ""are you mad at me?"" ""im sorry"" ""your probably mad at me and never wanna talk to me again"" ""you probably hate me and i understand why"", and she just nonstop kept asking me if we could get together and assuming i hate her when i rejected her and one night I was really high in my dorm room off of this gummy I had and I was deep in thought and decided fuck it and finally said yes to her advances. I regreted it the next day but I couldn't tell her I changed my mind because that would be a fucked up thing to do so I just decided to go along with it and see where it goes, and over the course of 2 or 3 weeks things have been pretty iffy. For starters she's SUPER cheesy, like for example whenever I say I love you to her or your the best gf, shit like that she goes ""baby you just made my heart melt"", she says ""babe"" and ""baby"" constantly, she thinks im gonna break up with her for another girl (which is not true at all), theres just honestly alot of problems and ik its not just her but like oh my god i need this fixed. I feel like she just dove head first from stranger to lover cuz literally i BARELY know this girl, like honestly i don't even really know her at all tbh. Speaking of that today she was gonna try to give me a quiz on how well I know her and I'm like I barely even know you (ofc i didnt actually say that but still). 

TL;DR: Met a girl in college 3 months ago who decided she loves me, she's super clingy and kind of annoying sometimes but I really want to try and make this relationship work even if I don't feel the same way about her right now.",28Nov2020,1

272,"This is a big one, I was kidnapped in Bali after I stayed at a hotel and caught the manager filming me in the shower (I'm a dude btw). I told him that I would report him and demanded my money back from the trip. He told me he would get someone to kill me if I was ever to release a video of him and others talking about it. He got his thugs to intimidate me in the hotel. Anyways I was in a taxi van thing, with other travellers and it turns out they were in on it as well. They knew I was on edge and said something along the lines of throwing me off a cliff. *Slide open the taxi door and jump out* at this point from the anxiety and paranoia of being threatened with my life abroad my body went in full fight or flight mode. I ran through a jungle, and was being chased by about 20 Balinese guys where it was literally a game of cat and mouse for hours. I eventually came up to a road where a group of them were (I was covered in blood and mud) to which they started taking pictures of me and wiping their hands on my skin. I then ran away again to where I was free running through peoples back gardens to where I fell through a roof and rolled down to someone's pool. I was found again to where they chucked rocks at me and threatened me with bamboo sticks (one also had a machete). I was put in handcuffs and put into this van with three rough looking balanese guys, I was taken back to the hotel where I first arrived in my trip. I was locked in my room for days without food or water, one of the men in the hotel let me out to where I was so frightened and distrusting everyone I was surrounded with I went to the roof of the hotel and sat up there. I was forcibly taken down, where I had a short stand off with about 6 Balinese guys to where they put me on the floor and tied me up by my arms and legs. We drove for a while, and I was taken out of the car and tied to a bed, rolled into a building of a mental asylum. Yes a mental asylum abroad. I was injected with sedatives and woke up tied to a bed with the door open sharing the room with other patients. After contacting the embassy and convincing them I wasn't crazy I was released. But that whole experience wasn't the scariest part. Because I had been going through so much trauma, stress and paranoia I ended up having a psychotic episode. Which honestly, is one of the most terrifying experiences. 

It's now 3 years later, I don't have psychosis anymore and I rarely think back to the events or even care for them. I'm 2 months sober after using alcohol, drugs and smoking as a coping mechanism since the trauma, I'm on antidepressants and seeking therapy also I'm currently in my second year of university studying literature and film after I felt good enough to be able to study. However I still suffer from chronic PTSD in which I perceive eyes as threatening and it can be exhausting or anxiety provoking to watch TV, day dream and socialise. The PTSD has given me depression and obviously anixety which comes along with mood swings and social anxiety, then also having little confidence and poor self-esteem. A lot of my friends kicked me while I was down either not wanting to be friends since the trauma, gaslighting or being passive aggressive to me. I don't remember what it's like to be comfortable in my own skin and just naturally talk to someone or a group of people at once. I've blocked some toxic friends on Instagram and I've blocked my abusive alcoholic mother who is now going through a divorce with my dad. 


My plan of action is to stay sober, continue with my studies, write scripts, reviews or something else with the entertainment industry. Learn a martial art when things begin to open back up, get a part-time job, meet new people who share my interests and meet a nice gir oh and obviously stick to my meds and therapyl. But this social anxiety is crippling to the point where I feel uncomfortable watching two characters on screen interact and I fear it's going to impact my career. I'm just wondering what I can do to be more sociable again and feel comfortable looking into someone's eyes and get myself out there into the film or writing industry.

275,"Trying to keep the details as vague as possible because I know a few people who use reddit quite a bit. Created a throwaway account for this purpose. 

This is going to be a long one, so if you want, skip ahead to the bottom. 

I'm from a conservative, eastern culture society where parents financially support their children until they are able to do so themselves which is a great help but also are subject to their parents' wishes as they are financially dependent on them. This is quite normal in my society.

I went to college and got a professional degree, and will be applying to do further studies in the United States as my home country is not a safe/suitable place for me to live. Another factor is that I spent all of my life not in my home country, with the exception of my college time and I'd rather stay somewhere else. 

My parents support my endeavours because they're first generation immigrants (to a non-US country) as they consider settling in my home country as a failure. They are not struggling financially by any means. I am well aware of how much they have saved up over the past few decades (because they choose to make me aware in case anything happens) and they have more than enough for both me and a younger sibling to live comfortably with low paying/no jobs. 

Applying to go to the US is quite a lengthy, expensive process considering I'm not paid much currently so even though I'm 25, I'm financially dependent on them. They have told me repeatedly that I can rely on them, and they spare no expense to help me pay for educational expenditures. For that I am grateful. But when it comes to personal expenditures, they are extremely stingy as time goes on. 

I don't spend a lot of money. I only 'splurge' per se on food but I can't remember the last time I bought a new piece of clothing. Everything else 'expensive' I've bought for myself has been related to personal  growth like skincare, or protein powder. So when I do ask them for some help with something important like a phone, I don't expect them to splurge but I do expect something at least on par with our social status. In the end, they refused to pay for a new phone and I had to pay for it (the cheapest model I could find with decent features which took up 50% of my monthly income) and even then they only contributed a fraction of the cost. Please keep in mind that I only ask for help with things that I cannot possibly afford on my current salary. 

They are also against me getting a side job to help pay for my own expenses saying 'its a waste of time when we can just give you what you need.' But when I do ask them for help, they say no.

They have no trouble saying no to my sister. They give her what she wants/needs with a little less restriction but she also has chosen a career that has given her jobs/internships that have paid her more than I've been paid in a year. So she is able to afford these more expensive things after working just a few weeks without taking a large hit to her savings. Considering she is three years younger than me, and more independent, I am very happy for her but also very frustrated. 

The final and probably the biggest thing, is the mental health issues that runs rampant in my family. I am unsure about what they are specifically, but my parents are aware that they have them. However, because they feel like it hasn't affected them personally, they do not want to get help. But they do not realise that it affects the people around them. I have been subject to years on end of mental abuse, being told I'm a waste of resources when I make a minor mistake, but also being told I'm the smartest and capable of anything I put my mind to. I have been yelled at for hours on end with some really harsh statements being said. My actions, as innocent as they are, have been twisted to seem like I'm a vile human being who only lies, cheats and steals. One parent has been unbelievable harsh with me (blocking me on whatsapp on multiple occasions for months on end and then unblocking me and treating me with such affection) and the other while they acknowledge that the first is too much, finds a way to justify their behaviour. They also blatantly dismiss my own mental health issues by saying its an excuse to justify my low (according to their standards) performance.

I can go into more detail regarding this, but I wont as it is quite painful for me to dig up. 

TLDR; my parents not backseat driving my life, they are reaching out and grabbing the wheel while I try to navigate life. they are mentally ill but refuse help and I suffer as a result. I am financially dependent on them for at least another 1.5-2 years. How do I deal with both.

Right now, all I can do is study. I know most people are going to say to keep my head down until I get another job in the US and be financially independent and then cut them off. But it is extremely difficult considering I'm surrounded by friends whose parents are extremely supportive and don't give them so much trouble with money. Or they're financially independent and living on their own. As a result of genetics/life circumstances, I've also become extremely anxious and depressed making it hard for me to just sit down and study inorder to get to the financially independent part. I've gotten help but ultimately the only thing thats going to help me out is being live my life on my own terms. 

**I would appreciate some alternative viewpoints/harsh love/motivation to last another 1.5-2 years of this because honestly I feel like I can't last another day.** 

*TLDR; my parents are not just backseat driving my life, they are reaching out and grabbing the wheel while I try to navigate life. they are mentally ill but refuse help and I suffer as a result. I am financially dependent on them for at least another 1.5-2 years. How do I deal with both.*",28Nov2020,1

277,"Hey, Reddit: what do you think about my home living situation, as described below?

I (20) live with my mom (49), dad (59), and younger brother (18). All of us, except for my brother, are extremely covid-conscious. We don’t go out at all unless it’s the grocery store, in which we wear N95’s and wash all the groceries with soap and water once we get home. We have found virtual ways to stay in touch with friends and loved ones. Essentially, my mom, dad, and I have all adapted to living most of our lives at home.

It’s hard for us, as we are all very social people and have had to temporarily sacrifice that part of our lives to stay healthy. 

My brother, however, still goes out to the climbing gyms, beach, and eats dinner at friend’s houses. He wears a cloth mask while he’s out (some of the time), so he claims that he’s being safe. When he’s home, he wears an N95 and washes hands (although not frequently). He still uses the kitchen and lounges in the living room. Otherwise, he spends most of the time in his room. 

The reason the rules more relaxed for my brother is because a lot of the activities he likes to do (rock climbing, spear fishing...) require outdoor/social interaction. He cannot imagine a world in which he wasn’t allowed to do those things.

""The one culture in the world I have no personal appreciation of and have many unplesent experiances with, russian duckabors."" said when referring to their co-Teacher. 


What degree of reprimand would you demand/expect as a coworker, or as Teacher B after reading this and the unprofessional comments in the email? 

I feel one way but fear I'm over reacting. 

TLDR: a coworker accidentally cc'd entire staff/ co-workers an email in which racist remarks about another co-worker were made.  As a recipient or co-worker, What would you say or do or demand from management as a course of action?",28Nov2020,1

I keep on wanting to spend time with people , and get closer despite it doing nothing for me. It always ends up with me feeling shitty in the end , and I’m sick of it.

He want me to take a visa as a job seeker, and then get a working visa – the thing is that I can't even get any type of job, it will have to be something in my educational area and I don't speak the local language, so it will be complicated... he say he will help me, we work in the same field so he can help a lot but I still feel a little sad he isn't considering marriage as it would be so much simpler for us.

Is there a reason to avoid marriage? We are going to live together and we are committed in a relationship, I don't know what really change in having it recognized legally. I can't understand his point, but I also don't want to sound like I am imposing marriage to him... i t just sound like an obvious option and it give negative feelings he don't want it.

289,"10 years ago me and my husband had a huge fight and we separated for a few weeks. In those few weeks I stayed at my moms and decided to go out with some friends to release some stress and have a great time. 
I ended meeting a guy at the club we went to, we got along so well and he was so funny and overall a really nice and charming man. I ended up getting a little drunk and talked about my husband to this man, how upset I was with him and how we both are always arguing, nothing ever going well between us. The man was incredibly understanding and listened. I eventually stopped and we danced and laughed the entire time. We ended going to a hotel room and spent the entire night there having sex and having the best night both of us can have.
We went our separate ways in the morning, kissed one another and said goodbye - that was all, we didn’t exchange numbers or anything, we just had the memory of the 
exciting night both of us had. 
Eventually me and my husband worked things out, got back together the following month. 

10 years later, last month to be exact - a new guy is hired at the restaurant my husband works at. My husband praises the man, loves how he works and says he got along with him quickly - says the man is a hard worker and a great cook.
Last week I was passing by and decided to stop and say hi to my husband at work. Going in, I immediately see a tall man standing near the register speaking to some customers. I approached him and that’s when I recognize him, the man I slept with 10 years ago! He looked at me and smiled, “how can I help you?” He said. I told him I was here to see my husband and eventually my husband came out and we both had lunch on his break.
The man though kept smiling and staring at me, even turning back to take another glance at me as if trying to recognize me.
Not sure if he remembers me but I’m definitely sure he does as he kept looking at my direction every chance he took.

I don’t plan to tell my husband about what me and the man did 10 years ago, but I’m also worried the guy would say something but as of now he hasn’t from how I see it. This is something I’ve kept all these years to myself and it feels like it’s karma getting me back for sleeping with the guy to begin with. 

Should I say or do something? It doesn’t seem like anything has happened but I’m worried, not sure if I should even do something to begin with.",28Nov2020,1

I also tried to explain if you own a business to find a wholesale and buy at cost before buying at a store that has already marked up the price. 

I believe the business will be bankrupt soon. Due to no budget.  Not proper purchases for retail.  And use money for personal expenses.

291," During the pandemic, I found out about multiple horrendous things that have occurred in my family. My sister recently opened up to me about how my mother abused her as a child and was a narcissist. I could not believe that my sister was treated this way, but it made sense because of my mom's behavior. My mother has always had over-the-top reactions, blows up if things do not go exactly her way, gives ultimatums (i.e disowning me, threatening to not allow me to return to University), and has repeatedly called me and my sister hoes, whores, bitches, etc. starting in our teenage years. I know I am not perfect. I have drunk too much alcohol, partied too hard, been in interesting relationships, and have had arguments with my mother. I just do not understand why this warrants my mother to act the way she does. I remember whenever I was in high school, my mother punched me in the face because I told her that I wanted to date this boy from my high school. In college, my mother gave me an ultimatum and said that if I did not stop dating one of my former partners, she would tell my dad to stop consigning my loans for college and would disown me. She did not want me to be with him simply because he was a republican and she was a democrat. Just recently, me and her got into a massive altercation because my boyfriend couldn't pick me up from the airport. I explained to her that as I have been traveling (by plane), I was going to find a different mode of transportation, self isolate, and not see my boyfriend because he is with his mother who is high risk. Granted, I explained to my mother that I did not prefer flying to see her for Thanksgiving, but she said that she would really appreciate it. She said that by him not picking me up from the airport, he was not considerate of our family and that I could not let him walk all over me in our relationship. I have had a lot to chew on these past months. Besides me finally seeing my mother for who she really is, other members of my family have also shown their true colors. My grandmother is physically/emotionally abusive, my grandfather is a possible user of child pornography and my aunt is an enabler to my grandmother. Me and my sister usually get along but when we do not it is horrendous. She has always had a temper. I understand that due to a lot of the things she has had to deal with/go through in life that she is usually pretty angry or ticked off around family. I just am not sure what to do. I have already emotionally distanced myself from many family members, but I can not handle altercations with them. Whenever I get into an argument with my mother or sister, my body physically shakes and I cannot stop myself from crying. To be quite frank, I feel like a baby for crying all the time. What can I do to manage the anxiety I have surrounding my family? I have been considering possibly going to individual therapy as I do not have many friends to talk with.",28Nov2020,1

295,Recently my ex started following me on social media. When our relationship ended we decided to remain as friends. We broke up after he moved away and we thought it just wasn't working anymore. I really liked him but it just wasn't gonna work anymore. He had told me it was because of distance. His friend later told me that there was this girl he started to like and he started talking about her right after we broke up. We had already broke up so I wasn't going to say anything about it. After finding that out I just stopped following him on social media  and we didn't talk anymore. I told me friends about him following me on Instagram and they didn't say much they just asked if I was going to follow him back. I said no and they didn't say anything else. I checked his Instagram and three of the friends I told now follow him back on Instagram which sucks and I'm not planning on talking to them about it but it kinda hurts since they know how I feel.

296,"I overheard my SO’s friend, Paul (38), talking about an affair he’s having with his coworker, Kathryn (28). I’m aware of very explicit sexual details, and Paul says he’s in love with Kathryn. This affair has been going on for 6-9 months. 

Paul has two kids with his wife, Melissa. The kids are 3yo and 1yo. Kathryn has a long term boyfriend. They’ve been together since middle school. Paul, Kathryn, and Kathryn’s boyfriend all work together in the civilian sector of a naval air station. Melissa works as a nurse. 

I reached out to Melissa via Facebook and told her about the affair. I left out all of the sexual details and Paul saying he’s in love with Kathryn. I basically told her I know explicit sexual details, and gave her a few details about Kathryn and her boyfriend that I would have no ability to know of otherwise. 

Melissa does not believe me. She said she asked Paul and he says there’s nothing sexual. Melissa says that Paul and Kathryn are best friends, and that’s it. I suggested Melissa contact Kathryn’s boyfriend because I heard Paul say he’s worried that the boyfriend is suspicious. 

I really doubt that Melissa will do anything with this information. I’m dumbfounded, and am considering texting Melissa with an example of when Paul and Kathryn fooled around with Melissa in the house, and/or reaching out to Paul’s coworker (who is my neighbor). My goal would be it try it get Kathryn’s boyfriend’s information so I can tell him directly. I think the boyfriend will believe me, since he already suspects an affair.

I don’t know what to do. Do I drop it, give unsolicited sexual example(s) to Melissa, or try it track down the boyfriend? My SO already said he’s done with Paul as a friend, but he refuses to get involved in confirming my side of the story with Melissa. My SO thinks I should drop it because he’s concerned that Paul will get drunk and do something to harm me. Paul does not have violent tendencies, but my SO says you never truly know people. 

TL:DR acquaintance is having an affair, I told the wife, she doesn’t believe me, should I give her more explicit details? Track down the boyfriend of the female cheater? Or drop it completely?",28Nov2020,1

302,"So this is my first time ever posting to reddit so apologies in advance for if this post is messy or confusing, the fact I'm writing this at 7 AM after several days of no sleep doesn't help either. Further apologies if it ends up being long winded, this is very much a last ditch effort to figure a way out of my mess after several years of just accepting it.

To start off, I suffer from a few mental health issues, namely depression, paranoid personality disorder and what I believe to be stress induced insomnia these lead to my days going one of two ways, staying awake for several days with minimal to no sleep lacking the energy to even move due to sleep deprivation, or sleeping all day with zero motivation to leave bed when my insomnia finally lets me sleep. This leads me to lead a life where I never really have the energy or motivation to fix anything that goes wrong causing issues to pile up. Coupled with my paranoia making it very difficult for me to contact people for help, its easy to imagine how I got into this place and I accept that most, if not all, of this is entirely my fault hence why I am searching for how to get a start on fixing it. Lastly on me before I get to the problem, I live alone since my sister left for university leaving a lot of her bills piled up for me to deal with (this will be semi-relevant later), and I am currently on benefits with no job so calling out professionals or buying expensive equipment to deal with the problem isn't entirely on the table. 

With some background out the way, the way this all started was shortly after my sister left. We had a deal when she was living with me, I would pay half the rent and the electricity bills, she would pay the other half the rent and the heating bills. She kept up with rent but never paid heating, causing a debt to pile up which then caused them to turn off my central heating and hot water, leading to damp problems within my home. This was only made worse some time later when a leak occurred in my roof, leading to yet more damp issues. Due to my own negligence, I let a lot of garbage pile up, only ever throwing it into the backyard with an ""I'll deal with it later"" attitude and furthermore let the garden become overgrown inviting large amounts of insects which then migrated into my home likely due to the damp, cold environment. Finally, thanks to this damp once again, mould has started growing in spots over my house with the worst being on the wall above my stairs, it appeared incredibly high on the wall (I live in a fairly old home where the walls are very tall), it is in a spot where I cannot reach to clean and cannot afford a specialised ladder that would be able to reach up so high in order to kill the spores.

I am completely clueless where I even start to deal with this. I want to tell my landlord as I haven't yet but I'm scared he will evict me if I told him what a mess the home was in. I can't be evicted, not in the state the world is in, I'd have nowhere to go as my family are on bad terms with me due to drama over the years. Any advice is greatly appreciated and once again, apologies for any mess or confusing aspects of this post. My mind is a mess right now. I just want a way out, each day this goes on my life starts to look more bleak and I struggle to continue fighting onwards (if what little I do can even be considered fighting and not struggling)",28Nov2020,1

312,"So I guess I should start by saying that I'm not necessarily happy with everything right now. I'm currently a college student and we just got sent home early due to the pandemic. To my surprise when I came home my friends from my hometown had moved on and kind of forgotten about me. There's a reasoning for it and I'll get into it in a moment, but I am a freshman in college and this is the first time I'm really feeling lost. 

So my friend and I had been friends for a couple years now and to make a long story short we are in a very rough patch at the moment. Going into to the summer before college we actually had gotten super close and extremely friendly with each other, our bond was great. Towards the middle of the semester he had become envious of two chicks who lived across from him. I'm not going to lie I grew very jealous of this and eventually brushed it off.

Later in the year I had gotten a girlfriend and began to spend less time with my friend. So naturally, he spent more time with the chicks across the hall from which he lived in. Then, one big thing happened. With only like 2 weeks left of our semester he and his roommate (who I will name Brad) got into a heated argument which actually led to Brad moving in with me. My friend had asked me to move into my room and I told him sure but I then realized that he would probably prefer to stay in his room and not have to move all of his stuff like two weeks before he had to move again.

Brad and my friend had been arguing because Brad had ""broken bro-code"" and was sleeping with my friend's ex-girlfriend. I didn't ask nor care too much about the drama because I have my own stuff going on like a pending court case and mourning a recent loss of my close friend due to suicide. So with all the dramatics I tried to stay out of it - just because my input wouldn't be that great because I'm still pretty hysterical about the whole situation. 

This is where things get really out of hand. About a week after Brad moving in we were all still hanging out as a group with the exception of my friend not joining us or reaching out anymore. Then, I had seen him drunkenly walking around the hallways and so he didn't garner any unwanted attention I brought him back to his room and he just began venting to me. Saying how I abandoned him for the group and how everyone hates him and I just put it off as him being drunk but I was still there to comfort him. Then eventually he started saying he was going to hurt himself and as soon as I left he was going to ""do something stupid"" and he just kept on saying it and it kept repeating in my head. So I slapped some sense into him, literally.

Now, we have both returned home and he was obviously upset that I hit him but I am sincerely sorry for doing so but the suicide talk is such a trigger for me I didn't know what to do. I tried apologizing over text and reaching out to him but to no surprise he ignored me and left me on seen. I was genuinely worried about him though even through everything and recommended him to the Prevention Hotline. Right before we moved out I even tried talking to him in person and it was just so shallow and he was just mumbling and not caring at all so I just up and left because I was so upset.

So I get home and I try to make plans with my friends from back home and they either ignore me or ask wtf happened with the whole situation. Scared that they were gonna drop me (which happened with my last friend group from back home) I just let everything out. Eventually I started to lose hope that I was gonna get my friendships back and regain that hope over and over again but tonight was hard. My friend (I'll name him Josh) had reached out to me asking what was going on and he told me to just wait and take time. 

After our conversation not even 15 minutes later he was texting me saying that he doesn't hate me but I need to get help and that he knows what I did and obviously I'm going to be confused so I kept asking him what was going on and he said that I was manipulating everyone into thinking that my friend was a bad person. Which I would never do, but now I have no room to defend myself so I just pulled the plug on the whole thing and it really broke my heart.

I really enjoyed my time with all of them but because I decided to choose the roommate over my friend that makes me a horrible person? I just don't get it and it seems like to me that they all just wanted to let me go. My girlfriend has been a big help with me through all of this and it has gotten me through the bulk of it but now I just find myself asking. What do I do next? Like my friend group just bailed on me and those were the dude's I have hung out with all the time. So now I just feel very alone and in all honesty I'm very scared of what is to happen next. 2020 has taken a lot out of everyone but I feel like I lost a lot in such a short amount of time, it's so traumatic that I sometimes have episodes like I'm developing bipolarism.

So I just need advice on what to do next. At the moment I'm home and I'm safe but I have doubt and now I'm starting to question if going on is really worth it but mentally I'm strong and keeping my head above the water as best as I can. I can't really afford my spring semester of college right now so I am probably going to work through the spring semester so I can re-attend in the fall. I also considered military to give myself a sense of purpose and belonging but I really don't wanna be away from my girlfriend and family for so long, it's really a worst case scenario for me.

I've been in tough situations before but this one feels extra hard after everything that I have been through this semester. If there is any advice someone can give me on the situation please let me know. Thank you.

315,"Before I begin, I want to make it clear that I am in no way a stranger to mental health.  I have struggled with anxiety and depression at varying severity for many years, as well as a severe panic disorder and a tic that developed after emotional trauma.  What I'm trying to say is that I know what to look for when those around me are struggling with mental health.  

That being said, my sister is lost in a way that I can't quite understand.  To give some brief context, she's in her early 20's and has a job that deals with psychology, though the place she works at just transitioned back to working fully remote. For the last week or so she has been feeling and acting like she's extremely uncomfortable.  Her actions/state of mind would seem like depression, but the thing is, she doesn't necessarily feel that way.  She's more so confused and dazed all the time rather than feeling emotional.  She also has fits of shaking (its like she's shivering) when she gets particularly anxious, but doesn't quite fully have an anxiety or panic attack.  It's just the shivering.  She's also dissociating a lot, which is something that never used to happen to her, and mid conversation she will often blurt out of nowhere something along the lines of "" Is any of this even real?"".  She's always overanalyzed everything but never seriously struggled with anxiety until now.  It seems she has completely lost her sense of self, to the point where she constantly has this dull look in her eyes that is both scared and lifeless.  She can hardly eat as well, and my mother and I noticed her going to the bathroom after every meal, but upon following her and listening, she's not throwing it up either.  She just can't eat in large quantities without getting an upset stomach.  It almost seems like she's deteriorating from the inside out, and it all started abruptly with no direct cause.  

I know depression can come in many forms that don't make sense, but that's not quite it either.  She's just mentally not there.  It's like perpetually being in a daze and not being able to tell what's real and what's fake.  I should also add that she feels that she willed herself into feeling this way.  It all started one night when she said she ""overthought everything to the point of losing it"" and that's when she began shivering uncontrollably.  I have dissociated in the past (and sometimes still do), often to the extent of feeling out of my own body or like I was ""going crazy"", but never in a way that made me shake uncontrollably.  

I've asked her if she has taken anything or done anything recently that might alter her state of mind but she says she hasn't.  I trust fully that she would tell me if she did, she knows I would never hold something like that against her.  Our family situation definitely doesn't help either, but I still can't imagine that pushing her over the edge.  Her reaction is so unique, especially for her character.  It's so unlike her that I still wonder if she's taking drugs or something even though I know she's not lying to me.  

I just want to know if anyone has experienced this or known anyone who has.  I've offered as much of my own wisdom to her, whatever that's worth, but I still cant wrap my head around it.  I don't know everything, here I know next to nothing.  Any advice would be much appreciated.",28Nov2020,1

We tried making different offers on places, offering more in advance, there was a few places we applied for that were barely liveable but we we're happy to work on, we have some personal references but the issue is we have no rental history. I'm not sure what other options there are.

329,"so, me and this girl became best friends around four years ago, when i moved states / school. we immediately hit it off and we've been super close ever since - we were always seen together and we'd hang out every weekend, and have sleepovers equally as often. 

although, me and here are both really headstrong; she's super stubborn and defensive and I'm quite temperamental and emotional so we'd have fights every now and then (and she's sorta immature when it comes to certain topics so that kinda ticked me off, and i have a tendency to not empathise with her if i think she's being irrational, etc. etc.) we were super young then though, so when i'd tell my mom ab our fights, she'd just brush it off and tell me to get over it and it'd be over by tomorrow, and she was right - the very next day we'd be friends for months and months until we had another disagreement and went back to being friends that same day. 

however, her mom seemed to dislike me from the get-go? i think it was about a year after we became friends, but it was 2-ish weeks leading to her birthday and me and her had a disagreement about something (i don't remember what), and she cried. her mom has \*hated\* me ever since. she almost immediately began speaking to other moms (my friend's mother was part of the PTA), and started spreading rumours about me and my family. i had people i barely even knew come up to me and tell me about how much their parents hated me. although she'd also done things to hurt me, it seemed like her mom only focused on situations which were my fault, and zeroed down on them. it really sucked having beef with my best friend's mom.

this all continued up until 2018, when we graduated and moved to high school (we go to the same hs, too.) since the majority of the parents who had connections to my friend's mom had their kids go to different schools than me and my friend, so that was fine and dandy.

things kind of hit a peak in 2019(?), my friend started frequently watching porn and tried to encourage me to watch it with her, and she'd just started crossing certain boundaries in our friendship that made me really uncomfortable. so, i told a few of my other friends what happened and the rumours spread all around the year level (i still feel really bad for that, i think i should've approached her instead of telling people bc i didn't know how big it was going to get.) 

obviously me and my friend stopped being friends till around late 2019?? and we had a talk and i apologised (blah, blah). things were okay, until mid-this year, when she met some boys online (who are much older than us, smoke and drink, and keep in mind we're minors.) and she really began to change. she started making really distasteful jokes and even mocked me for my childhood trauma and eating disorder, and she'd seriously started becoming super neglectful in our friendship too. sometimes she'd even text me saying how her mom thinks \*im\* the one who influenced her to act like this (but why would i influence her to act in a way that actively mocked me???)

flash forward to Halloween, me and her had a sleepover where i tried (keyword: tried), to confront her about the jokes and stuff (i didn't want to repeat 2019), and she got super defensive. she started swearing at me, and said stuff like 'if YOU have the trauma, why can't I joke about it??', and i got seriously pissed at her, and told her to call her mom and go home. 

she took that as me kicking her out?? and left my house alone in the middle of the night. i tried calling her and even walked up the street of my house to look for her, and couldn't find her. i called her mom and her mom gave me an earful, which really hurt (but i understand.), and ever since then, both her and her mom have been super hostile towards me and my family. 

my mom tried to reach out to her mom to have a chat, but she was really rude and started calling me toxic, a bad friend, etc. etc. 

i suppose the question i'm asking is, what do i do? how do i even approach this situation? how can i prove to her mom that i'm really not that bad, and is it even worth it? i'm absolutely terrified of her and her mom, so i don't know what to do.",28Nov2020,1
330,"Hello, I'm looking for advice on two subjects regarding women. The first being that I want some advice on whether or not I should send this full message or just part of it. But no matter what something will be sent. Keep in mind that the person I'm gonna send this to is a woman who I considered the upmost best among my high school as well as a decent friend of mine and she used me many many times. I seek nothing but personal peace. The message yet to be sent is quoted below. I'm also looking for advice on how to forget her because shes stuck in my head. She obviously doesn't think or feel the same for me, so how can I move on? Another girl or relationship won't help no matter how special. The same can be said about just keeping myself busy with new hobbies or anything. 

Please help me with some advice, its quite an emotional release read and obviously long lol, thanks.

"" Hey, happy early birthday, late Halloween &amp; Thanksgiving. I know it’s only been a couple months &amp; you don’t care to listen/read, but still here’s an important message for it’s my last ever to you. Written over months of time. My mom sends her love and hopes you’re doing amazing. I was also able to think deeply about everything in my life that has purpose &amp; meaning since the last time we spoke. Two of which were; My emotions? I found that they are the most valuable and shouldn’t be wasted. I’m sorry I acted like a child. I wasted them on and in front of you, which I shouldn’t have ever done and I regret it deeply. You in my life on the other hand? At the very first sight of you, I was wordless at how gorgeously stunning you were. I soon then found out shortly that you became decent friends with my old ex best friend Hunter, he informed me of some of your interests(kickboxing), how smart you are, etc, but everything he told me of course was exactly what I was wanting in a partner/friend. I’m a bitch, coward, etc for not admitting this until now but, obviously I had the biggest crush on you ever since I laid my eyes on you. Every single interaction with you in high school I was the shyest I've ever been. It just got worse every time we talked or interacted. After you said so much to me when we hung out, I thought and talked about you so much, you were a top priority that had my full attention, energy and mind focused on you. That was until I saw what was being reciprocated back. I appreciate the fake hugs, emotions and words you said to me but I beg of you to never ever give those fakes out again, please, just so another guy won’t have to feel what I felt. &amp; don’t tell people everything that they want/ need to hear like you did to me, that’s truly fucked up. Once fake hope runs out it takes so much out of someone &amp; it’s so incredibly hard to get back what the fake hope took. The last hug you gave me will mean more to me than you can and will ever understand because it was the only “sincere” and “meaningful” hug I’ve ever gotten in my life. Lmao props to you for giving something so real yet fake to me. Also, I know you probably don’t believe me when I said how much your hug meant but that was my first hug from a woman whom I truly liked at the same time. The only lies I've ever told to you were about my past relationships and obviously my feelings for you. I’ve never had a girlfriend and have only been on one date in my entire life. I know it seems pathetic but I’ve explained my reasoning. You meant the world to me for a week after your fake inspirational chatting with me, I thought I actually found a real genuine friend that could maybe one day become more. You were somebody I could’ve respected and trusted completely. Moving on, you recommended me to contact my old best friend Sarah, so I did. We talked just fine for about a week and a half until she blocked me outta the blue 🙃. The thing about me getting blocked from Sarah is that it was identical to you sorta. You both said you’d get back to me and didn’t. But anyways with her it was a lil different because she was also in a bad mental spot and it worried me a ton. So I got our mutual friend who you also happen to know, Scott T. to make sure she’s ok and to see what happened. That’s when he informed me that she informed him that I overwhelmed her and probably you as well with shitty emotions/ problems that you shouldn’t have heard because you guys already have enough in your lives. I’m truly sorry again about that. It was absolutely wrong &amp; horrible for me to do.  I was and never will try to have you be a friend therapist &amp; if it felt that way, I’m sorry. Not only did I feel safe and really comfortable with you that first night you hung out with me but I really felt that could’ve trusted you. That night you weren’t the only one drinking a decent amount. I’m sorry I couldn’t control myself &amp; I apologize for royally fucking up our itzy bitzy fake friendship. I would’ve really enjoyed doing fun activities &amp; celebrating life with you. Thanks for being there for me in our shared classes to provide me with something to look at and daydream shit about lol with the fake affection throughout time &amp; nothing else. It was interesting meeting you to say the least. I hope you have an amazing life and truly find what you deserve. From a guy wishing you the best and most of your birthday as well as life 🎉🎂-Z

Pathetic ps’s that couldn’t fit anywhere else: I’m not sure if you were also lying about nobody having your back but I would’ve covered/had yours no matter what. Even if you wouldn't ever of had mine back. I don’t know why but I just think about this specifically a lot. 

The only reason I typed all of this is because of how special I truly thought you were and because of everything you said kept you on my mind for a long time.

Thanksgiving thoughts: I’m only grateful and thankful this year for you being there for me when nobody else was. Means an understandable amount to me. 

Knowing some parts of your life being brutal unless they were lies told to me again, no matter what happens to you or our so called friendship, you'll always have a place to stay and call a home at my house. Never again do I want you to experience a car living life. 

Sorry about all of this lol, at least all this will maybe provide you with a comedic laugh or smile if you actually read it lmfao. ""

334,"I don’t know if this is the best place for this, so please direct me to a better suited sub Reddit if this doesn’t belong here. 

I personally... after a pretty cold childhood and a toxic relationship, crave physical affection. I was hugged a few days ago, it being the first time someone hugged me in a year. I know that may not be a lot to some people, but to me it felt... I can’t really describe it. And I’d be lying if I said I just crave physical affection in general. To be honest, I crave from someone specific. The person I love, my best friend. But she doesn’t love me and she has clear walls about being touched ; likely due to her past. I respect all these things. I’d sooner rather die than destroy our friendship over my selfish emotions. But it doesn’t stop me from lying awake at night wondering what it would be like to cuddle and hold her. Or to hold her in my arms when she’s upset. And to run into her arms when I’m upset. Heck... the idea of holding hands makes me feel so weird. 

Is it wrong to feel like this ? To so desperately want something from someone else like this ? Something, that the person in question probably cannot give me. I feel guilty. I feel it’s selfish of me to want this so much. That maybe if I loved myself as much as I loved her, I would feel okay. But I don’t love myself. I hate myself.

My 2nd kitten was given to us for free from a family friend it was so sweet, cuddly and needy and fit my personality perfectly. I loved him so much but I didn’t have enough money to get the kitten shots so they forced me again to get rid of him by returning  him to the family friend. 

I now have the money to afford another pet and all the necessities they need. I feel really bad because they keep screaming at me when I suggest getting a kitten instead of a puppy.

341,"so long story short i broke up with my first boyfriend of 2.5 years (he was also my first kiss and first time) back in march because i wasn’t sure of myself and i had to figure out my feelings about everything in my life (except him, i was never out of love with him). we tried to get back together in july but he had fallen out of love with me during the time away. he’s now moved on, and i can only hope that he’s found his happiness. i don’t know where i’m at right now. some days i’ll be fine and then others i just kinda feel like i’m holding on. i have dated a few guys here and there, as well as given myself a break from all romantic involvement. during the first couple months of our relationship i was sexually assaulted by another guy, and it was traumatizing for me, and my ex. i think my main problem with guys is i don’t trust them or what they say. ever. with my ex though it was different. i never had any issues with him. i felt completely and utterly safe with him. i can’t find that in other guys. the unknowingness of whether their intentions are good or if they’re going to hurt me scares me so much i lose all interest at the flip of a switch. i don’t know if it’s just part of my trauma, or if i’m still in love with him. i want to believe that things are the way they’re supposed to be, but the only thing i want to do is run to him and ask him to love me again. i miss the safety. i know it’s not the right thing to do, so i don’t say anything. but sometimes i hear our songs and i can’t help but reminisce on him sitting in the drivers seat, singing the songs we loved to me. i think about how he was the one to calm down my panic attacks. i get them more often now. i don’t feel loved. i don’t really feel anything. i just don’t know where to go from here.",28Nov2020,1
342,"I met a person about a year ago who I became friends with quickly. They have always been a little lonely so they became really into me, even romantically, now that they were receiving some kind of attention. I felt a bit meh about them. Over the course of the friendship their situation became worse: family struggles and much more (that I will keep private for anonymity) and they spiralled into bad depression, suicidal thoughts and self harm. By that time they weren't contributing anything but negativity to our ""friendship"". They refuse to see a therapist or take medication and have isolated themselves further and further. I moved away so they only text me now. 

I am one of the only people they even attempt to talk to about their emotions, but it is a frustrating and exhausting experience for me. I don't find them interesting as a friend in any way, if it weren't for their bad situation I would've stopped talking to them months ago. Trying to talk them out of hurting themselves is a mine field. I hate putting in this much emotional labour into a person I don't even like.

Yet they've threatened self harm and even suicide when I wouldn't talk to them or when I said something they didn't like. I fear that I will be responsible for the suffering or even death of a person.

347,"I just got let down after shooting my shot with a girl I’d had a thing with a year ago, but didn’t pursue due to being an idiot and other complicated factors. I’m heartbroken. I was, and still am, in love with her. She’s unique and amazing and beautiful and kind and special in so many ways. 

It feels like she is the only person in the universe who will make me feel the way she did.  It feels like now that things didn’t work out with her, I will never have the experience of being deeply in love with someone, and having them return that feeling. 

I realize that to some degree these are irrational thoughts, but my situation is also complex, and can make dating harder. 

A bit about me: I’m a 28-year old trans woman. I’m a bit overweight (but not obese) and I’m early in my medical transition, so I don’t yet pass. It sucks. And the dating pool for trans women in general is limited, much less for ones like me who are not models. I am making efforts to lose weight (with some success) and the longer I’m on hormones, the more feminized I’ll look. I’m also planning on surgery in the future. 

I have tried dating apps, which haven’t worked out. I realize that the body I am in right now is a difficult one to attract a partner in. But I’m so sad and lonely and desperate to be touched and loved.",28Nov2020,1
348,"Mom told me the government would go to our house tonight to do swab tests on everyone in my family including me. That's how we do it in my country, if you test positive, the government gives everyone you live with a swab test, then takes you out to quarantine in the hospital (I live in the Philippines). Dad got exposed because someone in his office had it, their company had to do swab tests on everyone, now it just came out he's positive.   
Now back to my question, now what? I'm worried that I got it. Mentally, i'm fine. Everyone's fine and chill, it's just that someone in the family had it, bad luck. What i'm worried about is what if I got it too? We never had much contact today, except when he pat my back when I was in the kitchen. That's all I could remember. I stayed in my room for the most part. He's going around the house wearing a mask by the way, since morning. I really hope my dry throat is just a phlegm thing, or it's just because I ate sweets too much today. I don't know if we drank on the same glasses of water today though.  


Are there any precautions I could take? I just washed my hands, i'm not touching any part of my face starting today. I'll probably drink lots of water. I'm kinda worried for myself, and for my family as well.

With all that background, my question is do you think I should buy a new car? or put the final $1500 just to keep it going for another winter and deal with buying a truck in the summer when I don’t have to take out a loan for it? Or maybe not even buy a new car and keep mine until I leave next year. My car has brand new breaks and tires on it and I have put 5000 plus in it the last 5 years of owning it.

TL: DR Girl with an unhealthy obsession with me is following me to my University and creating false rumors about me so she can steal my scholarship money. 

To understand this story, I need to first give you guys some background information. I've also changed all the names and locations for the sake of privacy. 

I've been going to this church for a while; I learned about it through a former crush (now very close friend) named Daisy. The first time I visited was years ago, and Daisy introduced me to her friend Jordan. Now Jordan isn't what we would call a ""looker"" by any means. She definitely isn't the prettiest girl out there, nor the thinnest. As a result, she has pretty bad body issues and has terrible mental health. Jordan is also mildly autistic, not so much that she cannot take care of herself but enough where she doesn't know how to read a room or properly express her emotions. She had started to develop feelings for me, and I did not reciprocate. She had her friend text me at some point, and I politely responded I was not interested. Jordan did not take it well and proceeded to blow up my phone and have a complete meltdown. I soon left that church not long after that for unrelated reasons.

Fast-forward a couple of years, I ended up going back to that church again through my friend Daisy and got to see Jordan again. I became friends with her little by little, not very close friends who go grab lunch, but not strangers either. As I mentioned earlier, she is mildly autistic and doesn't really understand how to convey emotions well. So I realized that she had a crush on me, at first. It was not a problem. I would just humor her by texting her back and just being a nice person overall. I knew many guys don't give her the time of day, and it didn't cost me anything to be nice. However, she took this to mean that I liked her, which was not valid. Over the last year, her feelings towards me have gone from a mild crush to a full-blown unhealthy obsession. She would text me 3 times a day, always bother me, and make me extremely uncomfortable. I tried to be cool about it and not let it get to me; however, it became increasingly harder. The last straw about 1 1/2 months ago when she texted me that her mom was ""forcing her"" to look at Christian Colleges out of state even though she was already dead set on the local college where we live. I had already been accepted to a very prestigious Christian College, named Liberty University, out of state. So I asked her which ones she had been looking at, and the only college she named, and it was Liberty University. However, I talked to her and said, ""Oh, they don't offer the major you're looking for,"" but she only responded, ""Oh, I changed my mind. I want to be a Graphic Designer now"" (Even though she had been dead set on being an engineer not even 2 weeks prior). However, I swept it under the rug and actively tried to not bring it up again. Until about a week and a half later, I talked to Daisy and said, ""Hey, you know Kaila already committed to Liberty University, right."" I absolutely blew my lid; how can someone be so dead against going to this school not even a week and a half ago and now be committing to going there. Apparently, Daisy had let it slip that I was going to Liberty, and now that was the only school on Jordan's radar. Daisy and I both independently concluded the main reason she wanted to go to Liberty was that I was going there. We later found out this was 100% true. 

From that point on, I dropped the Mr. Nice guy look, stopped responding to her texts, and actively tried to avoid her when I saw her in person. However, she only saw this as trying to play hard to get and texted me more than usual and came up to me more frequently. It was getting so bad that she could do anything, even something as harmless as saying ""hello,"" and It would just absolutely ruin my day. So one day, I confronted her and took her aside and said as gently as I could, ""Hey, I know you like me romantically, but you have to understand that I do not like you like that"" She took it surprisingly well, and I thought that was the end of it. Oh, boy, was I wrong. The month she was insulting and cold towards me, I don't care about her opinions, so didn't bother me at all. However, she did mention lies about me to our fellow students and to some church leaders. This part really bothered me because I also volunteer for the church and depend on my volunteering to receive Scholarship money. Money I won't get if I have a bad reputation. I heard she was spreading lies and was talking badly to others about me behind my back. 

For unrelated reasons, I wouldn't attend church for the next month (Had to tour my university and go help a friend). I talked to my Pastor and gave him an appropriate amount of heads up, and I also told my close friends and our student leaders that I had to go and they could not depend on me for a little while. I told them I was fine and would see them soon. I did not tell Jordan because 1) I would not consider her a friend by any means 2) I really like my privacy and don't think it's necessary to tell everyone unless it personally affects them (Ex: My pastor and our leaders). However, over the next couple of week, I keep getting texts from her always along the same lines, ""I know you probably don't want to talk to me, but I hope you're ok, you don't have to say what's wrong"" I barley responded to them, and even when I did, I stayed super vague. However, yesterday she sent me a whole essay over text, and I will share it with you now. 

""I've had a lot of time to think and wonder about what is going on with you. You're probably suffering with a lot rn. Pushing people away won't help tho. Myrtle advised me not to say this bc you'll shut down according to her, but it needs to be said. You going MIA for weeks is not cool. You have responsibilities and people depending on you. You've got Lily depending on you to be a co-captain. You've got Pastor Carl depending on you as his student intern. You've got me and Ted and Marshall and Barney because we depend on you as a part of the hospitality, worship, and recreational team. You want to be a pastor. If something goes wrong in your life and you do this, you will let so many people in the church down. Things like this need to be learned now. Through my thinking, I've also thought did you become a Christian because you realized your brokenness and was wanting to turn away, or was it to get Daisy? Were you really saved? I can think different outcomes, but that doesn't mean it's true. What I'm trying to say here is I'm so concerned and worried that I think about it a lot because I'm legit worried. I care for you so much as your friend, you don't even know or care to know. But you know what? Me caring about you doesn't seem to do anything anymore. Part of me wants to just throw in the towel and give up on you because it doesn't seem worth it anymore; however I don't want to give up. This is the last text I will give you until you come back or text me or give any sign that you're still alive or whatever. You'll get through this bc I know you are strong, but you're stronger through the Lord. Goodnight""

I haven't responded, and I don't think I will. A lot of the things she said in that text are also blatantly false. I spoke with Pastor Carl and Ted and Daisy that they could not count on me. All of the work I do for the church is completely unpaid, and I can leave anytime I want, and Pastor Carl has let me know that many times. It seems like she made many assumptions and made a big deal about something that was none of her business, to begin with. To me it also seems that she is using the mask that ""she cares so much about me"" to hide her true obsession.

I'm just really lost on what to do with her going forward. If I could, I would just be the bad guy and harshly cut her out of my life. However, she is very well connected with our church, and it seems like she's dead set on ruining my good reputation. I fear if I cut her out, she may only ruin my reputation more and spread more lies about me. She wants my scholarship money, and I wouldn't put it past her to tell lies to make me lose it, so they can give it to her. If I continue to put up with her, I feel like I'll only keep enabling her and indirectly telling her that her behavior is acceptable. In the past, I've talked to my pastor about her and how she makes me feel, but it was all over stupid stuff like she annoys me or she texts me too much. By the looks of it, it seems like I am probably going to have to deal with her all through university, which doesn't bother me cuz college is big. I'm just more worried about what she tells others and how she will continue to ruin my reputation and possibly cost me thousands of dollars in scholarships. What do I do?",28Nov2020,1

363,"Half a year ago my father and I(17m) decided to work on a large scale farm, me being in charge of animals and making cheese and him on planting crops and all else. All the investments are his, of course. 

So, half a year ago my aunt(50f), her husband(50m) and his son(27m), let’s call him Jimmy, moved into a very rural area. I take care of the animals with the help of Jimmy everyday. As I said, he is 27 and completely unable to live or work on his own. Not disabled, just a completely lazy spoiled dummy that has been living with my aunt for the past seven years because my aunt petties him and her husband for the person Jimmy is. He doesn’t know how to control animals well and he hits them when he gets nervous, maddening me and making the situation worse. So I take care of the animals and he takes care of mostly cleaning(and there’s a lot of cleaning to do). 

Now, I really love my animals and they are the best thing I’ve had in the past seven years of my life. They cured my depression, irritation, loneliness and gave me meaning. Because of that I had become a very laid back person that does his job happily. I always talk to my animals, I like to sing/parody songs at work, I sometimes dance a bit, I like to act funny speaking to animals and etc. Obviously, I now act in a similar way while at home. Today I overheard my aunt arguing with Jimmy yet another time, saying “...you’re the older one, you’re supposed to show him(me) how to act, yet you act like an idiot all the time”. I think that she thinks that, first of all, the way I act is stupid and immature(although it has nothing to do with being responsible/irresponsible), and second of all, that Jimmy influenced me in the way I behave. To be clear, I have little to no respect to Jimmy as a person(there are plenty of reasons) and I act like the responsible person. I even got Jimmy to listen to me(at work) without arguing back after getting angry at him a couple of times, but Idk how my aunt really sees me

My question is, how do I earn the respect I desire and be viewed as mature while acting silly when I’m in a good mood? I think that I’ll feel a bit better when the money from selling cheese appears, because right now I depend and live of off my aunts money, but when I’ll start selling cheese(which I make already), we will all benefit from that money and perhaps I’ll be more respected by others. Right now I feel like a simple farm worker, because that’s how I’m treated. Should I just keep grinding through and wait or is there another way to earn that little bit of respect I’d really want in life right now?",28Nov2020,1
364,"So about a month ago my (f19) boyfriend (m19) of over three years broke up with me. He didn’t even give much of a reason, just that it was taking up too much of his time (we were ldr). 
I was shocked as I didn’t see it coming at the time (although looking back now I can see that our relationship had fizzled out months before). 

We agreed to stay on good terms and texted for about a week. Then that just kind of stopped. 

About a week ago I was going to message him on Snapchat to ask what his new address was ( we’ve both just started college) so that I could send him a Christmas card. That’s when I noticed that I’d been blocked. Not just on Snapchat but on all social media. 
This hurt me more than I care to admit. It was a sharp stinging pain that stuck me right in the heart. I guessed he didn’t care about me anymore. 

Flash forward to last night. I get a text from one of my friends (apparently he hasn’t blocked my friends). The text was a screenshot of a meme on Instagram that said something like 

“Ever stay up texting someone until 3am? 
Where are they now? 
You should have just slept”  

She sent me the screenshot because at the bottom of the picture it had shown that he’d liked it. 

I know this may not seem like a lot to some people but it meant a lot to me. At the start of our relationship there was a three hour time difference, so 3pm for me would be 6pm for him. 
I used to work late on Friday and Saturday nights and get back to mine at around midnight, meaning it was 3am for him. 

So that’s when we’d text. It was such a special part of our relationship and for him to simply like that post shows me that he doesn’t even care about it anymore. 

How do I stop being to hurt over this? 
How do I move on?

Tl;dr my ex liked a meme on Instagram that was throwing shade at our relationship. I’m upset, how do I move on?",28Nov2020,1
365,"I probably got someone pregnant and don't know what to do. They just found out a couple days ago and started having morning sickness yesterday.

366,"Hey Reddit, I did cheated in a university exam because of some reasons. I ended up feeling awful during the exam that I ended it early and applied for a late exam. (I had reasons that qualified) 

I'm feeling awful about even thinking of doing this, I feel extremely guilty. I'm a good student whose performance went downhill during covid-19. But my uni doesn't have a record for me because we've been affected by lockdowns ever since I started. I have autoimmune issues causing organ failure, chronic pain and fatigue (I'd say it is similar to appendicitis level pain, but controlled in part by medicines) and also depression (K10 was in late 30's) plus I haven't been able to see the doctors properly due to lockdown because according to public healthcare I'm not affected by a serious enough issue. I did end up paying to see private doctors when I had lost 10 pounds in in like a couple months and had consistent bleeding. Which caused another issue - money! I lost all my money!

I'm not sure If I'll be pardoned, or given punishment, or what It will be. I'm super afraid someone's gonna tip my university and I'm gonna get caught even tho no one even knew about me cheating. I applied for a late exam the next day of the exam. If there's a misconduct staff member here at a university, can you please tell me what you take into consideration while seeing a student? I'm super afraid of what to do, I've only heard stories about expulsion from university in cheating cases. 

I was just so over asking for extensions again and again added to it was a guilt and the thought of what my professor thought, so I tried my best to give the exam on time. I wasn't able to make it tho.

Please advice what should I do, I'm pretty sure I'll be able to manage the late exam okay. It isn't packed up between other submissions in the week so I should be okay. I'm just feeling extremely guilty about trying to cheat.",28Nov2020,1

368,"Ok so I had a memory of when I was younger and was curious as to if it was a hallucination or something else.

When I was 9 years old I snuck into my mom's room to play the PS2 at 5am (she had it there bc she used it as a DVD player). I was getting ready to play Ultimate Alliance when I had to use the bathroom so I got up and for some reason glanced at the closet. To see a person in there who looked familiar, although I don't know who it was. I remember he looked pretty odd having mid length hair, sunglasses, goatee(?) and a tanktop. ""He"" was sitting on the mountain of stuff that was my moms closet at the time and it looked like he was really there. He then said exact words ""You know your supposed to be in bed, not having fun. What are you doing?"" I was so freaked out that I woke up mom crying that someone was in the closet. When she looked no one was there... 

Does anyone know what happened in this situation? Did anyone have a similar experience? I honestly don't know exactly what to think of this memory and have no answer to it. Particularly with how familiar the person I ""saw"" was.",28Nov2020,1

I did my speech and when i went back to my seat, my brothers fiancé had something to say to me.

I jokingly said bavk that I woukd MC their wedding if they want, and she said ""Id literally want anybody else but you""

373,"For the last 5 almost 6 years now during the night I have been going out in my backyard and walking and listening to music around a small trail I made. It helps me to relax and deal with my problems/stress in a healthier way.  For the last 3 maybe 5 months (I think longer) one of my neighbors has been filming me and my backyard while trying to hide in his backyard.

He and many of the neighbors already know about my night time activity and I gladly explain my reasons why I do so in the past when asked about it. But he nor any of this man's family or friends have ever come up to me asking me to stop or why I'm out there in the first place. I should also note that this man is mentally unstable and is dangerous. In the last 10 years even longer if counting the times before my family moved into the neighborhood this man alone has been arrested several times for many reasons.

I want to talk to this man and ask why he is filming me when I'm out there and as well as taking pictures of my backyard even when I'm not out there as me and my family had caught him in the middle of filming and taking pictures when I'm not out there.

Also, I would like to add that every time my porchlight or my RV gate light or another light source comes on that would light up his backyard he runs in his house or ducks/runs for cover where he can't be seen. I can also hear his phone make the picture-taking sound and see the red recording light on his phone as he holds it up facing me.

He has not come to me or any family or friends, no police have come to talk to me or my family. My dad keeps saying it's nothing but this is a very new and creepy thing for this man and I'm concerned for me and my family's safety.

I kinda just want to call the non-emergency police number and explain my concerns as I am scared of the man but not scared to the point where if I had to fight him I would. He's in his 40's and is overweight. 

So what should I do? call and ask the non-emergency number and ask them? or go to the neighbor's house and ask him why he's doing filming me/my backyard and that he needs to stop?

Please I get more and more worried about this every time I see him out there I don't know what to do.",28Nov2020,1
374,"Hi there Reddit, you bunch of beautiful bastards. 

I am not generally one to ask for much help or advice, but I am very torn on what to do here. I love this girl very much, but frankly, I told myself to evaluate the whole situation if it becomes something i dwell on too long…

So here goes. Throw away account for obvious reasons.

My girlfriend (20f) and I (24M) are very happy together and love each other very much. We both currently live with our parents as she is in college and i work full time overnights. Our schedules can be hard to work around to see each other, but we make it work. Everything between her and I as a couple is dandy…

But…

Recently, her mental state’s been deteriorating and fast. Her and I both grew up in very strict, conservative households, and both of us still live with those parents. Im a little older than her, and the last two years i spent religiously (ha…) trying to repair the damage done to my parents' relationship. Thankfully, my mom and i both matured and learned how to properly research and challenge beliefs, and her and i are very close for the first time since i was a kid. 

My gf’s situation is less...fortunate than mine. She also grew up in a similarly strict environment, but the difference is that she never made peace with her parents. Her mother is religiously toxic, often worrying much more about her daughters “faith” than her emotional or physical wellbeing. She was a medication guinea pig the moment she was diagnosed with adhd. Put on tens of different pill combinations. Adderal, xans, ritalin, lamitrogin, ceraquil… to name a few. She was in and out of the hospital through highschool, and has a troubled past to say the least. She struggles with substance abuse, SII, and frequent panic/anxiety attacks. 

Last year, i got a disturbing text from her saying good bye and that she hoped i found someone i deserved. This, obviously, terrified me for two reasons. 1, duh, she may be gone now. And 2. The girl i dated before her constantly threatened to take her own life if i ever left her. We fought like crazy and it was a long drawn out, toxic shit show. I didnt want a repeat of that, and this was looking like it would be disturbingly similar… it was almost out of nowhere at the time.

I had no choice but to wait, and the next day i get a call from a nurse saying shes in the hospital and tried to kill herself with pain pills. I left work immediately and rushed to the hospital, and there’s where i met her parents for the first time (awkward as hell). I was also left with a painful decision...leave her and not even risk getting manipulated again, or double down and stick it out…

I said screw it and doubled down. There was something different about her than my ex. My ex was a narcissist and pathological liar. My GF now is a sweetheart that has only ever tried to make me happy, but her struggle with cutting, depression, and suicidal thoughts usually leaves me needing to be the strong one to help ground her and get her through it in a healthy and reflective manner so she doesnt spiral into hating herself. 

For a few months she was better! I was very happy and confident in us for quite some time.

But the last two weeks are driving me insane. Its one thing to be anxious and say “i just think im not good enough” and its a whole other when its like “im just never good enough, tempting to blow my brains out, but ill be fine…”

Obviously, one is damn near deserving to call the proper people to drag her to a hospital, and the others just voicing anxiety or insecurity. I point it out when shed over do the suicidal rhetoric, and she was better about it (or at least more conscious of it.) but it got to a point this week where now im just terrified of checking my phone. I was terrified of another text or call coming in to say she was gone forever. (Hell...AM, scared). We had a lengthy talk about it, and it was her suggestion to take a break for a few days from talking to each other while to give me a break, because it was her impulsive quips and not something she would genuinely say to hurt me. 

Im thankful for the momentary peace of mind, but its clearly still plaguing my mind. I guess my questions are:

1. What do I do? 

Her and i are usually really good at communicating and i honestly understand what shes going through to an extent...but im getting tired of always being the strong one more than twice a week. Shes had more bandages appear on her arms and thighs, and is just overall worse. (she thinks shes slick hiding them, but i notice. Not worth making her feel shittier about it, though. Id rather she cut than bash her head into her window...)

2. Am I being played, too nice, or both?

 My ex girlfriend before her was malicious and had no real desire for me outside of what i could give or get her. My GF now just has crippling problems that she deals with as a result of years of emotional (sometimes physical) trauma. Shes in so much fucking pain, and it literally hurts my heart when i see her anxiety tear her apart inside out with delusional levels of self hate suppresses.

Shes strong...but struggling. She always offers to pay for food or drive, has saved my ass on multiple occasions (car got totaled...she made sure i made it on time and could keep my job. She hardly slept to get me to work since i work nights…) and i know this is different than my ex. 

3. Am i naive for having stayed the first time? 

I know she wants to get better, she truely does, but shes living in the same room she tried to hang herself in in highschool, in the same house of the mother that she still can barely breathe a word to without some sort of condescending lecture (ive seen it first hand…).

she's been having regular insomnia, night terrors, and panic attacks at random hours.

Last one… 

4. What do you do when someone you love is falling apart (not necessarily gf bf), is there any more i can do for them? Anything? My heart hurts for her...

Aside from supporting them, i guess?. Any mental health programs in the area are absurdly expensive and require her to drop school for awhile, and She knows doing that prolongs her living with her parents, so her plan is to tough it out until she can move out next year. 

These last few days we have had a mini break, but whats supposed to ease my mind is simply making me more anxious knowing that she now wont call me if she worsens for whatever reason. Ugh, This shouldnt be a problem...i shouldnt have to deal with the fear of her fucking dying at any given moment. I already lost a girlfriend to heart complications in highschool, and it took till last fucking year to forgive myself enough for our toxic relationship up to her death. I dont know if i can go through another death like that and still be the same person...

Anyway, any advice or similar situations that can help me decide what to do here? Any thoughts, similar stories, or opinions all help. I want to make this work if i can. 

Thanks guys.",28Nov2020,1

In my past relationship ( first relationship ) at 24 my ex was clearly still hung up on his ex but would deny it. I gave him the benefit of the doubt and in the end when we broke up he finally admitted I was there to fill a void. I was basically second best. 

This still angers me especially as I lost my virginity to him. To be honest I still haven’t forgiven myself for that. But alas I learnt a lot from that relationship about what I want. 

My current boyfriend that I met 2 years ago is great. He’s a lovely guy who has been serious with me from day one. The only thing is early on in our relationships when we spoke about our pasts he mentioned he’s had 2 girlfriends. He regrets the last one but his first girlfriend that he was with when he was younger - around 22  ( 4 years long ) he said that they were just too young at the time and that nothing went wrong. It fizzled out and that if they met when they were older things could have been different. 

It has be wondering am I second best, am I a place holder - what if she came back now that they are older &amp; more mature. To be honest these insecurities have been bothering me and I’m putting less and less effort into the relationship.  
It makes me feel like she was perfect but their timing was off so he’s with me. But he’d rather her. 

I have brought this up to him and he’s said that he’s happy with me, and that if he wanted to stay at the time he would have stayed with her that he doesn’t think about his exes. But I’m not sure. My ex said the same things.",28Nov2020,1
377,"Please let me know if I’m crazy or not. I’m currently a 21 year old senior in college graduating next semester. My entire life I’ve been comfortable in terms of food and shelter. However, my mom uses this as a crutch against me anytime I want to do something independently. I can’t take it anymore.

I’m literally being forced to work at her small essential business 5 days a week, with ridiculous hours, for “pocket change” or $100 about every two weeks..... Everyday I work I’m either responsible for opening or closing, cleaning the entire store alone, helping customers CONSTANTLY because of things like shitty machines, selling store items, etc. All while being a full time student. 

If not for the pandemic and me being away, she’d likely be paying someone else a respectable salary to be doing what I am. It’s like because she does the baseline things a parent should do such as providing shelter, and helping pay for some school, she thinks she can just completely disrespect any free time I may have. I understand I’m an adult now, but I feel as if my options are severely limited as I need a degree to do what I want to.

I am mentally exhausted and just want to leave. Anytime I say I don’t want to or can’t go to our store because of other commitments, she completely ostracizes me, talks shit about me to relatives about how I “Don’t want to help out” and it frustrates me to no end. 

I know she loves me but she is just not as good at parenting as she thinks she is based on how shitty I constantly feel. I just want to leave. I don’t know how or where but I can’t do it anymore. Please, advice..",28Nov2020,1

It clicked to me with this that telling people to work hard without a purpose is dumb. They need to find their passion first, something that they love to do, something that they will die for. When you have found that desire, then only you have to work hard.

Your success is defined by how fast you find your passion, and how strong you work toward it.

But how can I find my passion? How do I know that I have found my passion? Is there an equation to find passion?",28Nov2020,1

When i started High School i met a girl i found super cool and i would have classes with her sometimes. Me, my friend (M19) lets Call him ‘Jack’ and her ‘Nicole’ was the ‘three-leaf clover’ and would hang out a lot. I admit that i found her extremely attractive, and she found me attractive as well apparently. 

When we began stopping having classes we would still text everyday 24/7 with each other. Then This one time at a party, she told me she had to tell me something, and there absolutely couldn’t be anyone around to hear it. Fair Well it’s just my good friend.. Well yikers i didn’t know what would happen i Can tell you that.

After that. Still texted aaaaall the time. And This began as something we did often. But, didn’t see her as more than a friend and some casual sex. I know now This was stupid af and we should have talked about boundaries etc, but tf it was HS. 

So Nicole asked Jack through a whole year if i’d ever Said anything about me and if i liked her. He then ask her why. Nicole admit to Jack, that she’s deeply in love with me. He was in shock. When he told me, then i was as Well. This was not what i expected tbh.

He told her, since i Said it multiple times, i’m not looking for anything really. Just fun. 

She began trying to make me sooo jealous after that, typical HS drama bs haha. I remember she once made out with one of my friends (a guy i know now is not a friend) in front of me and as she’s not that type of girl... she got a bf. Nice, i see This as a opportunity to forget everything and move on.

Hell no. She didn’t like me at all anymore lmao. Well, we didn’t see each other until like This january (i Think? Just before covid) because me and Jack thought it would be fun with a reunion of the three-leaf clover, and to see his bf again. 

Well. She cried. A lot. Tbf, i don’t know if it’s about me at all. But she tried to talk to me and when we began laughing and have so much fun, that she totally forgot about her bf (to the point where the bf actually got a bit pissed or would try to break the convo with getting shots or something at the bar), i just Think it totally clicked for her or something and she broke Down in tears. Then Nicole + her bf left. 

Haven’t seen her since. But i know Nicole and Jack see each other all the time. And i also see Jack all the time and we in uni together. Should i try to ask Jack to let us 3 hang out again? Is it dumb? 

TL;DR : the ‘three-leaf clover’ broke up because the girl felt in love with me in HS and haven’t spoke the same Way with her since. The other guy i see 24/7 and he see her time to time as Well. Is a reunion dumb? She cried last time i Saw her with her bf as Well...",28Nov2020,1
380,"So, obviously by the lack of post history this is a throwaway. Regardless, I need advice. I'm military, just moved bases overseas. I had and still have a relationship with someone stateside who was about 6 hours away in a different state when I was stationed in the US. I've communicated a lot with this person and I've gone to their hometown but I've never met them. I've been in video calls with them so I know they aren't a catfish. I kind of feelings for them and they do for me as I've been told by select friends who have been let in on the situation. However she has a boyfriend. Not a good one mind you, and she's admitted that to me, even going far as to say that she knows she's going to break up with him one day but she can't due to the emotional strength it requires(3+ year relationship). She's caught him cheating many times and has claimed that the two have been growing distant and barely communicating as of recent(1 minute small talk conversations at best for the last month or so), and she has said ""love you"" when our conversations end. It's definitely noticable that it's not a platonic kind of statement, she only says it in serious circumstance(It's not ""Love you, you're my best friend!"", It's clearly intentional and heartfelt, verified by the same friends who I've let in on this). She obviously seems upset that I'm gone but hasn't stopped interacting with me and I haven't either. I guess what I'm asking is what I'm supposed to do? I want to be with her but me being overseas and her being with someone she doesn't love makes it all feel complicated.

I tried to look up whether that's alright or not and I only found that they(the kids) have the right to have social contacts outside of the foster care system.

386,"I recently had some emdr therapy to try and rectify my crippling self worth after a slew of traumatic incidents during my childhood, and it was incredibly effective. Until my shift at work yesterday.

I'm just a Christmas casual working at an external kiosk for the main store that's hired me, but I take my role seriously, especially after being out of the workforce for so long. I've worked Christmases for years at a previous job which has taught me how to work efficiently without sacrificing customer interaction, and more than a few customers have told me that they really enjoy my upbeat attitude. I haven't had a single customer not smile back when I greeted them. I'm good at what I do, and I know it. If I have nothing to do, I create jobs for myself to keep busy.

One of the jobs I really, really enjoy doing on the clock is rearranging the kiosk. There are three boons to doing this- one, the tables are constantly looking full and appealing- two, customers are more likely to walk up and look at things if they think I'm too busy to rope them into a conversation- and three, if a customer is feeling awkward about coming closer, I can give them a convenient excuse to browse in peace after greeting them. Also, by doing this, I have an immaculate knowledge of what we currently have available to sell, and if I need to fit more stock out, I know exactly where to put it so that the staff working after me have an easier time. There is literally no downside to doing this that I can see.

I've learned now that my manager doesn't agree with my method of work, and would rather not have me do this at all unless I have explicit instruction to do so. But the thing is- until now, I have had zero instruction on what to do and have even been chastised for asking questions or asking for essential things I need to perform properly at job- I was never told I couldn't be doing what I did outside of very specific instances that went against some of the clarification I sought when I spoke with the regional manager briefly on the job. I no longer have any direction for working other than to make sales and clean up every now and then.

Additionally, I unintentionally offended my manager as well after trying to understand from older staff members in private if the their temperament is stress or a natural thing I'll have to live with due to some interactions I've already had with them, and those staff members brought up my concerns to the manager directly. I was partly spoken to on the job about it, and have smoothed it over professionally, but with the new clarification about my work role on top of the language used when speaking with me has unraveled everything my emdr worked to fix. I've rocked the boat and past trauma has come rushing back leaving me sick with anxiety about being fired.

Realistically, I know I won't be- or at least, I hope I won't be. I know I'm a good worker. I know I'm open to working with people if there's even a chance at open communication, but I haven't had that. And to make it worse I'm now terrified to even ask my manager a single question now that they've said they don't enjoy being questioned about their plans or how they do things. I'm sure most workers would be thrilled at being paid just to stand around for a few hours and very genially neaten things up every now and then, but I just can't work like that when I know I can improve my station to make it more productive- it's literally one of the work ethics I agreed to in my contract, but my ideas aren't wanted here. Even if I could bring myself to just jaunt around for the duration of my shift, my past requests for even simple things and the response I've had has left me very insecure about what I'm allowed to do in order to not piss anyone off.

I don't go back to my psychologist for another two weeks, and I can't book in with her sooner as she's in high demand, and I don't know what to do. I've agreed to dial it back at work and could probably put on a strong face on the clock, but the emotional damage is persisting. I feel worthless working here now, and I don't know how to bring back the same jovial attitude that the customers have come to know and love me for knowing that it's not appreciated. I'm too scared to even talk to anyone at work now, and I know it's an irrational response to what's happened. 

I need some rational perspective on my job and how I should perform in a way that won't rock the boat further. I sort of know how to go about it, but I need reassurance that I'm not wrong for doing what I've done until now.

Please don't suggest contacting HR. Having another talk about all of this with my manager included would cripple me emotionally.",28Nov2020,1

I wake up at like 10am do my day and it gets to like 1-2am and I'm just not even remotely tired but I know I should try so I lie in my bed tossing and turning with my eyes closed from around 2-5am and then I just say ""fuck this"" and get out of bed and start my next day or carry on with my day however you see it. I then spend the entire next day wide awake never feeling tired for even a moment despite the fact I have all the shit feelings from not sleeping so I have a headache for like a full 12 hours ect. Until the night and then I can finally sleep mostly just due to the fact that I have a headache and not because I'm at all tired. I just don't get it. It's so fucking annoying and there's nothing I can do. The only thing in the world that gives me a normal sleeping pattern is smoking weed which is completely illegal here and gives me an anxiety attack that feels like a heart attack every single night that I smoke before I go to sleep and it feels like I'm going to die EVERY SINGLE NIGHT thus I try to avoid smoking anymore. I just feel like everything that would or could help me in life is completely unobtainable whether it be because of financial reasons, mental health reasons or legality issues and how are you supposed to live like that.

In my past relationship ( first relationship ) at 24 my ex was clearly still hung up on his ex but would deny it. I gave him the benefit of the doubt and in the end when we broke up he finally admitted I was there to fill a void. I was basically second best. 

This still angers me especially as I lost my virginity to him. To be honest I still haven’t forgiven myself for that. But alas I learnt a lot from that relationship about what I want. 

My current boyfriend that I met 2 years ago is great. He’s a lovely guy who has been serious with me from day one. The only thing is early on in our relationships when we spoke about our pasts he mentioned he’s had 2 girlfriends. He regrets the last one but his first girlfriend that he was with when he was younger - around 22  ( 4 years long ) he said that they were just too young at the time and that nothing went wrong. It fizzled out and that if they met when they were older things could have been different. 

It has be wondering am I second best, am I a place holder - what if she came back now that they are older &amp; more mature. To be honest these insecurities have been bothering me and I’m putting less and less effort into the relationship.  
It makes me feel like she was perfect but their timing was off so he’s with me. But he’d rather her. 

I have brought this up to him and he’s said that he’s happy with me, and that if he wanted to be with her he would have stayed with her that he doesn’t think about her like I think he does. But I’m not sure. My ex said the same things.",28Nov2020,1

395,"So, here's some background on me: I am a 14-year-old Jewish boy whose skin appears to be a combination of British, Sephardic Jewish, Hispanic, and Eastern European. I'm also of above-average intelligence (my IQ is currently 125.)

I hate my body. People say I'm handsome, but I don't agree with that. I hate how small my face is, I hate how big my skull is, I hate how big my hands are, I hate how tall I am (which most boys envy my height), I hate my curly, brown hair (which every girl I know obsessively complements), I hate how hairy my body is.

I want to look Korean. I wish I was shorter, I wish my face was bigger on a smaller skull. I wish I had breasts, a plump butt, and a vagina. I wish my hair was long, flowing, and black, partially dyed pink. I wish I could wear girly clothes like Converse shoes, Vans, boots, skinny jeans, dresses, thigh high stockings, denim shorts, leggings, overalls, crop tops, pantyhose, sweaters, high heels, makeup, jewelry, etc.

I also don't feel like I recieved a proper childhood. Due to my intelligence and interest in world history, philosophy, economics, geopolitics, and virology, I've been expected to essentially be a teenage intellectual. I have so many unrealistic expectations thrown onto my shoulders.

I'm never allowed to just have fun and feel normal. It sucks. But, I do have a plan to resolve these issues, but a lot of it relies on my finance, and I'd like if someone can tell me if this is financially realistic.

Before the end of 2020, I plan on opening a bank account. Then, once the pandemic ends and things get back to normal (so April/May/June 2021 time frame), I plan on getting a job at AMC Theatres, which I hear hires 14-year-olds, although correct me if I'm wrong.

At that point, I plan on beginning to save up money. I won't spend a dime of it. Then, in 2025, after I graduate high school, I plan on studying education, atomic physics, microbiology, philosophy, and world history at my local community college for 2 years.

After graduating from college, I plan on getting a job as a history teacher at my local school district. For 4 years, I'll continue to teach history at my school district while living with my father so I feasibly continue to not spend any money. Then, once I'm 24, I'm gonna use some of my money saved up to buy a relatively small, two bathroom, one bedroom, one kitchen, one living room, one dining room, two-story split-level home in the suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts.

At that point, I plan on using skin bleaching cream to look Korean. Alongside this will be HRT, sex reassignment surgery, and facial feminization surgery to attain the body I want.

Then I plan on turning my home into my own private Neverland to cope with the childhood I essentially lost. I'm just in bliss imagining it.

In the living room would be posters for Adventure Time, We Bare Bears, Steven Universe, and other cartoons around at the time, with a couple comfy leather couches and big, soft Snorlax and Wailord bean bags. Every day I'd lounge in comfy seats eating candy watching colorful cartoons.

The kitchen would have a gumball machine and cotton candy machine, with a fun-filled mini crane machine in the dining room. I'm even hoping for a playroom with toys such as slinkies, puffer balls, bottles of slime, knobby balls, 3DS games, and hoppity hop balls.

My bedroom would be filled with huge, cute fluffy teddy bears and Pokemon plushies. There'd be a TV where I can watch cartoons as I drift off to sleep snuggling a giant teddy.

Are these plans financially stable? Thank you.",28Nov2020,1

This has made my life extremely hard: not being able to make friends easily and be myself around people, not being able to go into shops and buy something or talk to strangers if I need help etc.

399,"A little background: I'm an artist and my mom likes to hang up my work around her space at her job. One of her coworkers (let's call him Todd) likes to design board games for fun. Said coworker saw the art hanging up around my mom's desk and asked for my email because he wanted to commission me. 

Anyway, I got an email back in June from Todd wanting me to design the box art for a board game he wants to make based off a zombie movie. He was very detailed about everything he wants in the picture: zombies, soldiers, tanks, etc. I was down for it because I like zombies/horror and I'd be paid $120 since there's so much involved in the piece. 

We agreed to split the payment into 3 sections: 1/3rd of it paid upfront, 1/3rd paid halfway through, and the rest paid when the piece was done. I was sent the first installment very quickly so I got to work. 

I sketched out where I wanted everything to be, and got about halfway through the lineart before I just felt so... overwhelmed. I'm used to doing pretty much just one-person portraits, so this seemed almost impossible. 

Months have passed (luckily this guy is EXTREMELY patient, bless him) and here I am, still stuck in the same spot. I haven't drawn anything since around August. Even thinking about working on the commission fills me with dread. If I try to work on something else, I become overwhelmed with guilt that I'm not working on the commission. I'm beginning to hate drawing. I've done it all my life and I consider it one of the only things I'm good at, so feeling like this is devastating. 

I'm considering returning the money I've been paid back to Todd and just giving up. He is very sweet and understanding, so I don't think he'll be mad but I feel so guilty. After months of waiting, he finds out I'm just throwing in the towel? I just feel so pathetic. 

What should I do?

TL;DR : My mom's coworker commissioned me for a piece that's wayyyy beyond my skill level and after months of procrastinating and hating art, I'm considering just giving up the commission.",28Nov2020,1

404,"So I just started working a retail job where I primarily go and pack orders for items that customers have ordered online. I have packed a huge number of items in the few weeks I have been here and feel that I am decently fast at what I do, I tend not to go super fast in case of mistakes though. The store manager however always checks up on me primarily (or so I think anyway ) and chastises me for being slow. 

The entire department I work in has been falling behind lately as very few people are packing stock with me and too many people are picking stock. The blame for this doesn't lie squarely on me as our department isn't handled well by the people in charge. Another problem I tend to have is that I go to the shop floor too often to find items that are missing so I can complete more orders instead of putting them in the partial section, as many times a lot will be missing. I was told by another team member to go look for items instead of putting them in partial but my manager says not to do that, so I'm hearing this and that from different people. 

The manager wants to get as many orders packed as possible, hence why I try to complete as many as I can. She now wants me to do picking instead? Any thoughts?",28Nov2020,1

My plan is to call the facility later and ask them to move me around, and if they can’t, I’m going to call off right then and there. I don’t want to get fired for being uncomfortable, and I don’t want to lose my holiday pay or bonus because I need it to get Christmas gifts for my family.

I'm currently in a bit of a dilemma and could use some advice.  

A little background : I live in the NYC and got hired recently as a Planet Fitness employee. Before that, I only worked with Crunch Fitness on weekends for 5 and a half hours on Saturday and Sunday. 

Now, why do I want to quit just one week within my hiring? 

I wasn't aware that the area where the Planet Fitness is, has been a red zone due to Coronavirus and so it had to shut down twice. Also, members that go to this Planet Fitness don't care about following the CDC guidelines and tend to workout without masks, having us (workers) have to continue to ask then to keep them on. 

With all that information, I came to the conclusion that it may not be the best place to be working at since I don't just stay in the front desk compared to Crunch. At PF I have to clean, make rounds upstairs, and stay in the front desk as well. My plan is that supposedly NYC will go on another lockdown this upcoming week. I'm planning to tell my manager that I no longer feel comfortable working at Planet fitness once we go on lockdown, even though I just finished my training. 

Is this a good idea? What should I do? What would you do? How should I go about it? Hope to hear from everyone soon!!",28Nov2020,1

Over the past few years he has been in several relationships, he is a very confident and ambitious young man, his past boyfriends seemed to look up to him. He is the one in control, and most, if not all of the times, he was the one to break things off. His current boyfriend, however, seems to have broken his walls.

So this person in my (26M) class is in some of my groups for projects and we've made pretty good friends. She's a busy mom and I totally understand her situation and how hard the program must be for her because of her other duties. 

Anyway, since maybe the second week of the semester, shes been asking me for answers for assignments and whatnot, and I give it to her because I feel bad that she doesnt have time to really do homework or study and she's been saying she's been getting overwhelmed at times.

I have a strong feeling she's just straight up copying my work and submitting it though even though I've told her to use it as reference only.

Now, I do my work over time so I give her maybe 80% of the answers then when I finish I give her the rest. Another classmate of mine that I am friends with has told me she has asked him for the same favors, but only for the last questions (the 20% i havent done by the time ive given to her) so its pretty clear shes asking me for 80% of my work, then asking 20% of my classmate's work then her assignment is done without doing any work herself.

Now, I wouldnt really mind as it's none of my business, except that this means she hands her assignments in before me. Because of this, I have a strong feeling that the teacher thinks I AM copying off her instead of the other way around!

421,"Hear me out, before commenting that he is a predator, please. 

I'm 15 female (also important to note I'm asexual) and about almost 2 months ago I got a message on Discord from a dude who saw one of my posts on 4chan. He didn't know my age or gender when messaging me. We started talking about random stuff and he was generally very pleasant to talk to and we became online friends. I loved messaging him a lot and after a while we would start opening up to each other. We are both shy and nerdy and I always encourage him to actually take care of himself, go to bed at normal times and drink/eat enough. He does the same with my own issues and we generally always try to help the other be the very best version of themselves. Only after like 2 weeks he actually inquired my age and was shocked to find out I was 15.  

He told me he was 29 and I didn't really mind that too much since we were just online friends and nothing weird. I play video games with older people sometimes and we can talk as online friends online just fine. Fast forward and we developed feelings for each other. I asked him if he is specifically attracted to underage girls because I was 100% he was a predator at first, when he told me he liked me. He said he didn’t know what to do with these feelings since it felt wrong because of my age. He said he was generally attracted to girls younger than him, although 15 was really pushing it. He is aware I'm asexual and while he isn't, he said wouldn't want to force things on me and is ok with us having a none sexual relationship as long it means that we get to be together. Our relationship is completely none sexual. 

It's very wholesome tbh we send each other cute memes, talk a lot about our favorite video games, anime, manga and how when we meet up in the future we'd hold hands and cuddle and how we could show each other our anime figures and play video games together. He doesn't give me red flags and he hasn't even asked for a picture of me (I sent him a picture of me wearing a nice outfit once without my face). I know what he looks like (though he deleted the picture after I saw it because he's shy and insecure, like me) He doesn't pressure me to do anything and never says weird things that would give off potential predator vibes. He's hesitant a lot because he admitted he's scared to say something that could possibly make me uncomfortable and ruin what we have. But at the same time idk if this ok? At first thought he had to be a predator but he proved me wrong and is a very kind, loveable and intelligent dude. Because of the 14 year age gap and the fact that I am underage, I'm still confused of what to think of this myself. He's turning 30 in less than 6 months. Any advice or opinions are appreciated. I could see myself being with him long term and might tell my parents about him/let him meet my parents in the future.

I am very close wirh my cousin, we are like best friends, so I am very fortunate to have a cousin my age. I can be pretty sure we won't just lose touch, at least not for a couple more years. I love her, she is amazing. But we are both teens, going through puberty and having our own problems. And our friendship has become toxic.

We are actually three girls (me, my cousin and my sister), we have a group chat, chat pretty much every day and we visit our grandparents and cousin (they live in the same street) about once a month. None of us are touchy kind of people, we don't talk about how we feel, out relationship is more like in a sitcom - we always make fun of each other. I am not sure if this kind of relationship can not be toxic, but earlier it worked okay, jokes just sometimes used to be too much. And now, when my self-esteem is a rollercoaster, everything my cousin writes, tells, sends me make me upset, I constantly compare myself to her and think she is doing much better in things I struggle with. And when she tells me something she finds exciting or literally tells anything, I feel urge to ruin it, find something negative, joke about it in a mean way,  belittle everything she is proud of. I deleted my social media recently and found myself feeling much better about myself, but there still was the group chat that made both of us miserable, so I muted it for a few days so far to figure out what to do. It is hard not being able to share memes and exciting things that happens to me. I thing she feels similair about our friendship sometimes feeling like a competition, but idk if she also feels so bad when things are going good for me. 

So I have just too many ideas how to deal with it and have no idea how to deal with it correctly. Should I talk to her or deal with it on my own? Will this comparison stop if I take time of everything that makes me compare myself? Or do I have to suppress my urge to belittle her? Will our friendship ever be okay? Or do I have to deal with how it is? It is toxic for both of us. I really don't know how to deal with this. If you have delth with something similar or just have any advice, I would more than appreciate it. I really want this friendship to last, I don't have any other friends as close as her.",28Nov2020,1

424,"Hey everyone this is one of the first serious questions I’ve asked on Reddit but first let me give some context, I’m 15 and I live with my grandparents ever since I was 3 because of issues with my parents I don’t want to talk about at the moment 

So last night I was  just talking with my grandma about various things that don’t really matter to add to the question but she told me a story about how she met a guy in 2019 at a convention that we went to but the only thing is that guy died in 2012 so now I’m having a crying panic attack because I think she might have dementia and it makes it worse because I look at her and my grandpa as if they were my parents.",28Nov2020,1
425,"Some context:

We live in Canada where things aren’t awful but they are still pretty strict with lockdowns and all. 

My parents have booked a trip to the Riviera Maya (Mexico) and we are going in a few weeks.
My parents wanted to let me know that we were going back in august, to which I said I was very uncomfortable because that area is very badly hit by Covid. I finally caved in and said fine. The only reason I agreed was because my mother was pressuring me to say yes and saying stuff like : “You think I’m so irresponsible?” and “We work so hard for this for you to say no”. So it was really a false choice. I didn’t want to continue the screaming match that was already going. 

NOW.

In my parents’ defence, they are being very cautious. We are renting a car, using PPE, isolating, etc. But that isn’t enough in my opinion. What about the plane? The airport? Grocery shopping? The list goes on..

Fast forward a few weeks the topic is brought up and my mom says something along the lines of “I’m so glad you agreed to come”. I tell her yeah sure.. but then the thing becomes more serious and I say it’s only cause she pressured me.

This is where shit hits the fan.

My mom denies doing anything to pressure me, saying that I have no perspective, and that my anxiety disorder corrupts my view and what I see is not what’s actually happening. I took offence to that but what can I do, yell at her? My dad is chiming in and saying the same things, spend about half an hour in this thing trying to keep my calm. I finally broke and I started yelling  at them, which keep in mind, I rarely do, because I try to be the bigger person. I say I need to go to my room, and I dash and grab my phone. My dad is screeching for me to get my ass back. I record the whole thing ( yes I know this isn’t the smartest solution and it doesn’t solve anything) My dad swearing at me and throwing insults. My mom agreeing and calling me an abuser and manipulator. The argument finally dies down.

This left an awful taste in my mouth about the situation. 

Fast forward to yesterday. My mother gives me one day to either agree and we all go, or disagree and no one goes. She tries to make it sound like a choice but then she says if I disagree, there will be an argument I don’t want to have, she will lose all of the money, disappointment, etc. Now keep in mind the following. The one condition my mom had agreed to is that the place would have a two week cancellation policy. Just in case things got worse over there (they did). Now she told me that never happened and “we never technically agreed on anything” and “I’m being ungrateful” and the whole schpiel. So I have no choice now. 

Say no and make my parents lose money and have another screaming match

Say yes and go with the risk of getting Covid and my parents dying (they’re in their 50s)

427,"I currently have a 88.8% in AP Chemistry, and I'll probably finish the semester with a 89 or at the best, 90. It's mostly that I didn't do well on the quizzes and lab work in the very first chapter. I'm trying my hardest in the class, but it's just that the tests are hard, and I just can't always do well on those. This is my first time ever getting a B, and I feel terrible about it. My teacher gives extra credit opportunities every now and then, and I take advantage of them, but they're usually just worth 3 or 4 bonus points at most on homework. My teacher made it clear at the beginning of class that he will not drop the lowest grade, allow grade negotiating, or allow assignment redos. Now I'm just worried that I'll end up with a 89.

I'm a senior this year, and several colleges already accepted me. I'm concerned that they will rescind me or change my status from accepted to deferred or waitlisted. I have an A+ average in all my other classes, and all my other classes this year are AP courses or advanced math classes. I've read stuff on Reddit and College Confidential, and even college blogs, and to me it seems that in general they won't rescind you or penalize you for a single B.

428,"Hi,

I've known my crush for more than a year. We gradually get closer as friends and I started to develop feelings for her. She has a dog who she grew up with, if I'm not wrong it's longer than 10 years. The dog health gets worse everyday,  the dog can't move at all, so she had to help him to do everything and anything, and he has a state which he whines a lot maybe because he is uncomfortable. So she struggles with sleeping, the dog would whine every 2 hours and she couldn't sleep or can barely get any sleep.
Well, what I've been doing is just asking her how is she and her dog is doing, and makes her laugh whenever possible. and this goes on for months, so I'm stuck. We usually talk everyday about how our day goes. Mine is just relaxing and her is miserable almost everyday. It pains me to see her in that state and I couldn't do anything but only listen to her.

This guy is her moms friends son. I guess they knew each other when they were really small but haven’t talked in years and years. He’s had a really fucked up life and did some really bad shit and I guess her mom told her it would be a nice thing to call the boy and catch up with him. 

So she texts me and says “I just got off the phone with him, we talked for a half hour! He’s so cool. He skates and plays the drums like you, I think you’d really like him” 

I dunno if I’m just being jealous or if this is weird. Because she never refers to me as “a guy she’s dating”, it’s usually as her boyfriend. 

It’s also weird that they haven’t talked since they were kids and she decided to call him and talk for a half hour. I love that she has friends but the thing where she said I’m just a guy she’s dating made me u comfortable. It feels like, “Yeah I’m just dating this guy so if you make a move on me it might work”

Alright this is a doosie. So I have my friend, we can call her Lucy, then I have my other friend John and his gf, who is also my friend Lauren. So basically I introduced Lucy and John and they started to become friends pretty early on, like super close. I thought it was weird but thought nothing of it. I was like theyre both adults they can be friends. Well heres where it gets bad. The other day Lucy had some issues and was having a mental breakdown and started to say things such “I dont want to live” because something happened with a guy. Now I didnt know who the guy was because she never told me. But I had warned Lucy about John because he has a bad history with his gf and has cheated in the past. She then ignored it, lied to me about her liking my friends and told our other friend. 

Well I was messaging the other girl in my friend group and found out that the male in question was infact John. Turns out they had gotten super close with eachother and ended up wanting to date, and John said he was going to break up with Lauren. Then he decided not to which them prompted Lucy to have a breakdown. I then found out Lucy was going to tell Lauren later about the whole thing. I don’t know if she is going to tell either.

I invited her to my birthday party last year, and my mother was horrified to find out that she was attracted to girls, she told me it was like inviting a boy to a sleepover, and she even questioned my own sexuality and wanted me to immediately distance myself from her.  

I lied for months about how close I was to S, like intentionally leaving her name out of my friend group and not mentioning her to my family in fear of judgement. S recently emailed me (I'm grounded from my phone due mental health issues.) and asked for my moms number, hoping to call and meet up.

S doesn't know how my mom feels about her, and she says she is a sweet woman, but I don't want to ask my mom because I think she will get mad at me and refuse to let her come, I don't know what to do and I REALLY don't want to be mean to S yet I don't want my mom to find out I am still close to her.

Hi,

For the last 2 months, I've been on Fluoxetine and for the past month or so I've been seeing a therapist. I have depression and one of the main ways this manifests is an inability to motivate myself to do even the most basic things. Since taking the anti-depressant things have improved. I am more motivated and less down. Therapy has also helped in this regard too. However, I still sometimes really struggle with trying to motivate myself to study (I'm at University). Some days I can do all the work I planned and more. Other days I struggle to even get out of bed let alone start studying. Today was one of the latter days yet earlier this week was more like the former. I'm now writing this before I try and get on with my assignment as I've managed to talk myself into doing at least part of it but I'm wondering if anyone has any advice on how to make it easier to overcome that obstacle. My therapist has suggested writing a to do list with a routine of when to do things and this does help but sometimes my motivation and mood is so low that I struggle to follow it.

Does anyone have any advice?",28Nov2020,1

She went absolutely bonkers as a result. Cops were involved in a number of instances, and now she is being charged with criminal harassment of her ex and his new gf.

460,"I'm a middle-aged autistic person. I'm independent and even to some extent financially successful. But I've had few close friends, and no partners whatsoever. Basically, lonely. To the point of depression.

But there have been people in my life who have been kind. Or, they at least try. They tell me how interesting I am and how much they enjoy talking to me. That's why they do it every year. They'll call me on their commute so the conversation has a defined end, and they'll heap unrealistic praise on me. Then at the end of their commute they're gone for a year or three.

I also have people who will be kind to me a minute per day. I'm useless the other 1439 minutes of their day, and will be omitted from any plans made, even in my presence. But for a minute, how awesome it is to talk to me.

Really, this isn't kindness. I appreciate the effort, and enjoy the company while it lasts, but if the sentiment expressed was genuine these conversations would happen more often...or last longer. I'm not dumb and I'm not a child. I know insincere flattery when I hear it.

So...there's a new co-worker. She's less than half my age. She knows how old I am. And she seems to have adopted me as her project. We have a lot in common, despite our are difference. She's going through stuff I've already been through. She has the same stressors in her life and in her work. She even has the same physical reactions to being stressed or unwell. So it's not totally weird that she's taken an interest in becoming friends, despite the age difference. I do look and act much younger than I am.

But she abandons text conversations. There's always a reason. Is it normal for a millennial to disappear from a text exchange that seems important? Repeatedly? How much should I dismiss as flakiness? She makes me respond to unrealistic praise...and then vanishes?

She had a personal crisis not long ago. I was her favorite person in her new home state, apparently...but it wasn't me she went to for help. That was another co-worker, closer to my age than hers. I made myself available for talk or to meet up, and she didn't take me up on it. Fine. I know my limits. Barely acknowledged my texts, though.

Weeks later I confided in young friend that I was irked that in the more than a decade working at this place nobody had ever made sure I had a place to be for thanksgiving. So she arranged that I would have her company for at least a snack and some conversation in the morning. But it seemed my place was the only place we could manage a meetup during covid... until there was another co-worker who wanted to join us, the one she went to for help in her crisis, who was now going through a crisis of her own. She made her home available, would that be okay? At least I didn't have to clean LOL.

So, that meetup went kinda like this. When we talked about work it was a three-way conversation. We also watched a movie and a youtube video new co-worker wanted to share. Awesome. I'm glad we were able to share the other woman's yearly movie tradition on a day she would otherwise have spent alone. But the rest of the conversation? New co-worker faced other co-worker and talked at length without so much as a glance at me. I'm used to this, and not terribly offended, but this isn't how you treat someone you've described as your favorite person in your new home state. Right?

Basically, the words don't match the actions. I appreciate the effort, but frankly I'm offended by the insincerity.

Have I misinterpreted this? I believe she legit wants to help, but she's not being as kind as she thinks she is.

Is there a way to ask her to tone down her flattery without offending her? Is there a way to not be obligated to respond to her glowing texts, only to have her vanish and leave me wondering if I've offended her? Should I let this continue at all?",28Nov2020,1

Like, I was mostly polite with her, but then I went to my room and got super anxious and angry and sad like some sort of emotionally stunted toddler. Or, just today, I thought we were gonna go out and buy a Christmas tree, but then my parents said we would do that next weekend instead, and after I was alone I did the exact same thing. I think it has something to do with not feeling like I’m completely in control of what I do, but it’s rather scary and upsetting and I’d like it to stop. This is probably a dumb question, but does anyone have any advice?",28Nov2020,1

464,"We've been together for about three years now. We've lived together for almost two. He works a job with long, hard, stressful hours, all from a desk. He doesn't necessarily seem to have TOO horrible of a diet, since I'm able to see pretty much everything he eats by means of living together, but he definitely needs more exercise. I'm truly all for body positivity and I'd love him no matter what he looked like; I'm more concerned for his health. He's put on 80+ pounds (150-230/240ish) in just about a year and a half. At our age - and at any age - that's extreme and incredibly concerning.

He doesn't seem to get it, though. He brushes it off and makes excuses for everything. ""These pants must have shrunk in the wash!"" ""As soon as I wrap up this project for work, I'll have some time to start running and biking again!"" (Of course, that never happens). ""Could you tie my shoes, honey? I slept funny and it hurts to bend forward."" He's gained this massive belly that makes it hard for him to even put his socks on anymore. His parents have confided in me and asked many times about his mental/emotional health because of this sudden, rapid change.

I think because he hasn't really had any major health repercussions of the new size yet, he hasn't been able to understand the severity of this kind of rate of weight gain. 5+ Pounds a month? And there seems to be no end in sight. I don't know if he's eating insanely unhealthy food at work that I don't know about, or when he goes out without me... Medium shirts to XL and XXL shirts?

The biggest shock was this week's most recent events. We both see the same physician, who also has bugged me about his weight, and recently I convinced him to at least go in for a physical, and he let me go with him. Thankfully it doesn't seem like there are any underlying conditions to the weight gain; it's just situational. We put him through all the tests for thyroid, hormones, etc. However, our physician wanted to take some measurements to more accurately get a body fat percentage and BMI for my boyfriend. The doctor and I were both shocked, to say the least. His gut is 55"" around and he's surpassed 240 pounds, having been 150 at the beginning of 2019. His BFP is nearing the 40%s. I just don't know what to do or how to convince him. If I posted pictures you wouldn't believe it. It’s almost hard for me to drive it home. Please, suggest whatever you can. I want to stay with him but not if I'll never be able to break this cycle.",28Nov2020,1
465,"I know this probably sounds like the most first world problem ever, but hear me out. Some details changed to protect identity. My ex was all about dance music. During the time we were together I thought I needed to be all about dance music to win his approval and i totally changed the person i was and how I acted, dressed and what I listened to to do that. We broke up horribly and he was awful to me throughout the relationship and for a long time after the break up. Im still not healed and still get triggered if I see a photo of of him or anything. 
It has taken years of re-finding myself. I didn’t know who i even was after that relationship and it’s taken 3 years of peeling back the layers to become someone who is TRULY me, for me, not for anyone else. I am an extremely different person now, and have ended up in a very healthy happy supportive relationship with someone who loves the same things as me. I feel authentic and myself again. In all of this, I reconnected with the music I used to love before the bad relationship and found a band which have become incredibly special to me. I love music and this band have kind of changed my life to be honest, because their music has healed and made me feel seen. It has felt like my safe world so far removed from the world i was in with my ex And ive truly thrived here. Also this band are not super famous, but quite known and respected within a certain scene. Anyway, recently a mutual friend of me and ex posted something on Facebook about a playlist they’d made which had some songs from this band on it. My ex commented on the post saying he’d listened to the playlist and really liked that particular band, and had added them to his own playlists. I know I don’t own this band lol, It’s not up to me who likes them and doesn’t. But they’re not super big, it’s not like they’re The Beatles, and the fact my abusive ex is now listening to them has upset me so much. I felt completely sick, this is something that has felt so sacred and special, and so seperate from that old life. If the band come to my city their gigs are small, and now I’d have to consider bumping into him. But that’s not even it, it just feels like something that’s mine, and now when I listen to them, it will feel tainted by him in a way it never was before. How do I move on from it?

Tl;dr after leaving abusive relationship I found a new life and new music that has become very special to me. Now my ex likes the same band and I feel like he’s intruding on my new life",28Nov2020,1
466,"I used to have a good relationship, social life, ate healthy, exercise, good sleep schedule, good grades and even made money selling my art. So you could say I had my shit together and a good life. But it all felt forced and like some chore.

So I relapsed into playing games and getting fat again. I still go to college, pass my exams and help around the house. Other than that not much. I have one friend I talk to on daily basis and one every few months. I feel more at peace this way but not really happy.

I've seen both ends of the spectrum and the first one felt like too much effort and not worth it but the second one feels like not enough effort and depressing.

469,"My parents grew up in the countryside, and in our old farmer-culture there is a very strong opposition to ever throwing anything away. This means that if there is food left, people have to force themselves to eat it so nothing goes to waste. My parents are obsessed with getting «good deals» and therefore buy lots of crap that is low quality or they don’t even need. They never throw anything. Scaps of paper, old worn out, outdated or broken stuff just piles up in their house. 

Because of covid I will be spending some months with them now. 

They do have a huge house with a big living room, a dining room, kitchen, four bedrooms, an office and a cellar. Every room is overfilled with stuff, mostly trash in my eyes. Old clothes that are washed out and nobody has worn for 10+ years. Piles and piles with old magazines and documents. Books everywhere. Broken electronics. Old cheap plastic toys that have been lying there since we were kids. There is also way too much furniture, and none of it fits together. They buy new expensive design furniture, but then refuse to throw out the old worn out IKEA-stuff, so instead of having 6 nice chairs, they have 20 chairs with different quality and design. My mom also buys lots of cheap «trinkets» all the time and they fill every shelf. The fridge is packed with stuff, and half of it has gone bad.

I have suggested throwing out all the broken or low quality stuff, witch probably makes up about 30% of the volume, but they get angry and say «we don’t throw stuff».

What can i do?

I usually don’t view this as my problem and just let them swim in their trash. But now I live here, and there is no space to walk around and I have nowhere to put my stuff. My mom is angry that my clothes are lying all over the floor in the room I am using, but where would I out them when every shelf and closet is filled to the brim with other things?",28Nov2020,1
470,"Now i’m not a narcissist or something. I don’t really think i’m the absolute best but i feel that i’m an expert in stuff i’m interested in. Like i never pretend to be a know-it-all. I just talk about stuff i know, but when i see people who know as much or more than me, its kinda intimidating or unacceptable for me. Its like i have this feeling that only i have all these unique talents and i’m unique and stuff. That i need to get better at those things so that no one matches me. 

When people talk about movies and tv shows , i feel like an absolute idiot having no idea what they’re talking about and feel kinda inferior for not following the trend as i don’t even watch movies/tv shows.

On the other hand , among the stuff i know, i try my best to stand unique and not follow the trend. But when i come across people who’re like me, it feels really intimidating. I’m like ‘wth how is everyone is like me??’

I’ve just got so many interests that its kinda hard to even master them all for sake of this. I’ve got a really different music taste for my age. And i feel like an outlier for it but when i see people who are exactly me its a wtf moment. When i see guys who’re more intelligent than me, its intimidating. When i see guys who know about gaming more than me, its intimidating. When i know guys who excel at martial arts more than me, its intimidating. 

I don’t like the thought of having someone in my league , i just feel like being at the top among the stuff i like. But i totally accept my lack of knowledge for things idk. Like how to just change my mindset? I want to stop thinking like that. Any advise?",28Nov2020,1

I am a teenager in high school, I picked my high school because either other didn't even catch my eye, are too hard for me, or my grades were not enough. I live in a country that has really limited choices and I don't know what will I do after high school. I would say I am an average person when it comes to learning and passing exams, but I have no confidence, no talents and I'm not good at anything, I don't know how to draw, how to sing, how to write, how to dance, I don't know anything about computers, I'm trash at video games and I don't really play any.

I went to vet school, when I'm at practice I pray to all beings that the teacher doesn't choose me to do something because I just can't do it, my mind goes blank, I can't breathe and I shake.

I'm also not attractive I am fat, but I don't do anything about it because I'm too embarrassed and I care too much what others think, because my pants are gonna be destroyed and I don't have enough money to buy another, because I give up easily, because it hurts and so on...

472,"Biology used to be my favourite subject since I was a kid. Nothing would make my day more than watching nature documentaries and learning about it in school. I wanted nothing more than to be a biologist to work closely with the environment as I had never been much of a people person. However, that all changed when I started taking my A levels. I found myself drowning in the workload, forgetting everything that was taught the day before and reading through my notes over and over again only to forget them later in the day. Each test I’m taking I’m getting D’s or worse whilst I hear everyone talking about their A’s and B’s. I’ve talked to my teachers, I’ve gone along to lunch study, I’ve taken multiple tests but no matter what I do, I fail. I now find myself too crushed to even try anymore. My dream of being a biologist is over because I can’t remember anything anymore. And the situation of my home life getting progressively worse along with Covid has made everything 10 times worse.

The one time I bitched at my mom about how she keeps bailing on my daughter and hurting her feelings, she actually decided to take her and my mom kept my daughter for less than 12 hours. My husband and I fed my daughter dinner bathed her and took her over there and my mom brought her back before church was over the next day.


I'm so sick and tired of this useless lazy woman known as my mother. The whole time I was growing up she couldn't even be bothered to raise my sisters and I, literally all she was concerned about was if she had enough NyQuil to drink so she could get high during the day.

But here is my issue. 
I recently lost my job of nearly 15 years with a family business. It allowed me to have extremely flexible hours and I was able to do so much with and for my children. Coaching, girlscouts, Boyscouts, karate. You name it. We did it. But I was fired earlier this month and don’t make enough on unemployment to support our family’s needs. Even though my husband works full time. I’m looking at having to get a part time job AT LEAST but it would mean my oldest daughter(12) would have to watch her brother(6) for a few hours each day. Maybe more. Getting him off the bus. Feeding him dinner if her dad or I don’t get home early enough. 
I’ve discussed it with her and she is more then happy to help. She’s just that kind of kid.

480,"The title unfortunately says it all lol. 6 months ago I (24 F) had a FWB situation with my dealer. Was a bad time for me and 2 weeks later I cut it off to work on personal growth. Since then I still get my weed from him once a month, he lives down the hall. The interaction is short, simple. I thought we were good. Last night he knocks on my door saying I don’t acknowledge him and have bad vibes. He was in his feelings about something- I haven’t figured out what. He was being really disrespectful.

Meanwhile for the past month I’ve been talking to a new guy who is very nice. I was on the phone with new guy when my dealer confronted me, and he heard the convo. So now, he’s like fuck this guy.

Ive been wanting to invite new guy to my apartment. The problem is I haven’t told him that I slept with my dealer. I don’t know if I should. What if they interact and my dealer mentions that we slept together? I’m worried because my dealer hangs around the parking lot so I see him once or twice a week in passing. It’s probable that we will all 3 run into each other. Dealer is hotheaded, has a huge ego, and carries guns. New guy is a lot more calm but I’m worried if dealer says something disrespectful to me that new guy might pop off and get hurt.

I don’t want him to think I’m purposefully keeping it from him. I’m just ashamed of the person I was in the past and since we are not dating yet, it didn’t initially seem relevant in the get-to-know-you phase. However I don’t want to look like a liar later on. Would you tell him? How/when would you do it? 

BTW I know this decision was stupid- I’m kicking myself in the ass too trust me.

481,"I’m (M22) a college student who got home last Friday. Saturday night I hung out with three of my friends at my friend’s house (let’s call him “friend 1” and he is the hypochondriac). On Wednesday a teammate of mine who is also one of my roommates sent a message to the whole team saying he tested positive and that we due to the incubation period we should get tested too. The catch is that my roommate is almost 100% sure he got covid once he was back home. Here’s why: 

When my roommate got home, he went on a double date and then had a small get together of friends over at his house. The next morning the other guy on the double date learned that most of the guys in his fraternity house had tested positive. My roommate ended up being positive along with most of the people who came to his house that night. 

Since Wednesday when my roommate told everyone, my other 2 roommates have been negative as well as about half of my team who has been able to get a test already. One of them even shared multiple drinks with my roommate and thought he’d be positive for sure if my roommate had covid while at school. Multiple friends who are much closer to my roommate and spend more time interacting with him have been negative. I told my friends at home this too.

Due to the high volume of testing, I couldn’t get tested Wednesday and most places near me were closed for Thanksgiving to give their workers a break. I got tested yesterday but won’t get my results until Monday. 

Whenever my friends get together 95% of the time it’s at Friend 1’s house. His parents have always been relaxed with letting us be there and none of our other parents like having people over. Today is the one of the only times each year that my 6 friends can get together. Most of them are in their first year out of college and hold full time jobs in other cities. Me and one other are the two left in college. We barely see each other anymore. 

It’s been over a week since I’ve interacted with my roommate and continue to show no symptoms. I already spent time with friend 1 at his house on Saturday, so if I were positive he and the others would probably already have it too although I’m pretty certain they have nothing to worry about. I’m not sure what to do since we won’t get to see each other much any more. 

TL;DR

This weekend is one of the few chances each year I get to see all my friends together. I can’t see them unless I test negative but won’t have results until Monday. Multiple people who were in closer contact with my roommate have been negative and I’ve been fine without symptoms for over a week. I already spent time with my worried friend and 2 others, but since finding out my roommate got it he’s not comfortable being around us. He’s the only friend worried but it’s preventing us all from spending time together.",28Nov2020,1

I've had a childhood friend for years. We would talk and close then for a few months we would stop because I could not handle him anymore. We'd meet again be friends but he still wouldn't change.. last time we clicked again was bc i was suicidal and tried socializing again. I don't regret it but i need it to stop. I haven't talked to him for months but he is the kind of person that calls, he wants to know what happen. 
I would say that's understandable except... Here is the thing about him. 

His mom is the kind of miserable person that will be rude to social workers and blame the country for everything but she also scams everyone else out of money and favors while never taking some responsibility. My friend who I loved, has consumed all that. On the one hand we would laugh so much we know each other since kids, on the other hand i cant be friends with someone that yells at the girl at the supermarket to pick his bags as if its the cashier's jobs and constantly complains and says hateful things about pretty much everything. The trains, this, that, our town etc. 

I have had discussions with him and he tries. But he doesn't change and after a while he likes to turn what I said against me. Like he needs it to be clear with it in his head.
He is not a bad person or maybe I can't see him as it is. 
People have cut him off before and I don't want to be another person abandoning him. But I can't be his friend. So much negativity and complaining and mostly its hateful. 

We haven't talked for months but I want to end it for good. I want to text him but I don't know what to say. And I am scared. He never lets things go. He still calls anonymously the ppl that have cut him off sometimes. And i know how his mind works. He twists things so they'd make sense.

So I normally just order the fries as it is the cheapest ($5) I almost always get an early break on weekends so say I work 2 hours they give me a break right away but then I have 5 more hours of work (always on your feet/ running around) as it is an amusement park. 

My parents don't seem to care when I bring up I hardly eat there bc it's expensive. I could eat before I go but all the food here is 300 to 400 cals. that doesn't seem like enough. I'm trying to save EVERY paycheck I get in order to leave once I can. Bc of reasons. So I can't afford to pay $12 a day on food. 

I don't even have a license yet (parents won't let me) so on top of the food taxi is very expensive (no public transist this is the south). I just feel like I'm getting side effects of not eating enough like I'm cold often and my eyes look sunken in. I only get $120 a week bc they tax me so much.

We can't bring our own food no fridges are there for employee personal use. And no break room. I wanna hold this out til I have enough to leave. I've tried applying to other jobs but they all emailed back saying I'm not a good fit.",28Nov2020,1
493,"I met this person at the beginning of 2019 after graduation, I was dealing with alot. I was stuck at home for awhile so I would stay up to talk to him since he worked late. I would watch him play games and we would joke about each other. I remember one time we screen shared and he pulled up a map and asked me where I lived I nervously said ""I don't know if I wanna say"" He told me its alright no one else is here. So I told him and he replied ""dude no way I live in the same state as you"" from this point forward I had feelings for him even though im also a dude. I still don't know if I like him in a gay way or not. A couple months later he invited me to play paintball with him. I couldnt go because I just had gotten a drivers permit. I honestly broke my heart it was the last chance I had to meet him. He was moving back to his dads house in another state 12 hours away in october. Most nights in bed I say his name outloud to help me go to sleep. I have had lots of fantasies about him going down on me, showering with him, and hugging him. I cry about him sometimes hes so nice and funny. For a while I was only happy when I would talk to him in text or call. Now I have a liscence but its too late now. He might be coming back for christmas break but maybe not I just love him so much. I have no one in the real world outside of my family. But it feels like he is my only friend its hurts to say it but its true. I have nobody but him, im very socially akward but he understands that.
I also helped him come out, he would always say excessive homophobic stuff. I told him ""have you ever thought maybe gay people make you uncomfortable because you know you are deep down?"" He came out as bi a couple weeks ago and im happy for him. I love him so much, should I tell him?

494,"I don't know if this is going to be seen, because I don't think this is big an issue compared to other stuff I've seen here, but i do want to get this dumb thing off my chest, so I'm sorry if I appear whiny or entitled.

It's high time I should probably consider it haha. Obviously the answer is yes but I can't find the reason in myself to think so.
But clearly I want to, otherwise I wouldn't be writing this.

How did I ruin it? Well I just cut all the celebrations short, make people forget my birthday or make it as regular as possible like just a regular dinner at a restaurant like it's a Friday evening or something no cake no nothing. I even get temperamental about it occasionally. I discourage gifts too. I even went so far as to saying ""I genuinely, genuinely don't want to celebrate my birthday!"" recently. 
Looking back I guess I probably looked embarrassingly ungrateful.

Perhaps subconsciously I always felt like I don't deserve something that good so I try to jeopardize it. I've always thought that birthday wishes that were sent to me was an obligation, and not out of pure thought, because I'm sure one should wish someone on their birthday if they knew it was their birthday, right? Even though I know it's not their fault that that coincidences happen, I stopped thinking my birthday was mine when I had to share it with my aunt's wedding anniversary and another couple's anniversary of a friend of mine. 

I guess my not wanting to celebrate my birthday is also kind of destroying my friendships with people and push them away. There are people who don't celebrate their birthdays either so I thought maybe I'm just being sensitive over this. 
I just don't want it to carry anymore in the future, if I ever marry, or future wedding anniversaries or if I ever have children, their birthdays, you know?

And I don't know how to go about with it. Because at the same time I want peace on my birthday, with myself. I wanna spend time alone on that day this year. But I thought maybe my 25th birthday is important and I don't want people to feel like I don't want to hang out with them or that I don't wanna hear any of their birthday wishes more than I probably already felt like I did- so I'm kind of in a conflict here haha. 

Maybe this issue seems small, but I don't want this issue to snowball into something about myself more bigger or important that I might end up sabotaging because of my distorted point of view on values in the future. I wanted to start here and do something about the mess I created for myself.

I'm open to advice, either way I'm thankful you'd have read this far 🌻

TL;DR I screwed over my birthdays for many years, I see it as a red flag in myself I want to fix or I might eventually ruin something more important than my birthday and the whole thing makes me feel like I sound whiny and ungrateful to them for not wanting to celebrate lmao",28Nov2020,1

To the point: In school there's this one guy. A real dickhead. A classical douche. I'm gonna simply call him Douche in this story. We unfortunately have the same classes. In one PE class where we just finished a bike ride I was washing my bike. The teacher had a while ago said, that once the water runs out(wich would happen before the bike was clean) he would go get more water, and then went in the bike building to help other students with their bikes. So in the outside was me, washing the bike, Douche and his 2 mean-girl friends waiting for their turn to wash their bikes. And surprise, surprise: The water ran out. Well, I just thought: ""My bikes just needs a little more cleaning, it doesn't need more water. Besides, the teacher said that he'd get more water."" So even without the water, I continued to clean my bike. This, for some reason, pissed Douche and his friends off(way too much considering the situation). They just yelled ""Go fucking get more water!"" And I anwsered ""My bikes gonna be clean in a literal sec. Wait."" And Douche just took the bucket and said ""Women can't fucking do anything can they?"". Obviously reffering to me as a woman. Wich I'm not. I then proceeded to call him the f word. I'm sorry about that but it just slipped. Then we flipped each other off.

I minute after the teacher comes out and I tell him what happened. Btw he said he had heard everything but for some reason did not interviene until I told him to. He went in and a minute later with Douche and the Douche doesn't say anything, but I have to apologize. Douche doesn't anwser. The teacher said that it would not happen again. I considered to do bad things to myself, but as usual that lasts about a minute. Then I just kept thinking about what happened.

Wait! Don't go! The problem is this: I can see that me and Douche have beef with each other. If we're in the same group project neither of us say anything. Both silent, the whole 75min that our classes last. And if we have ball games in PE he always hit me even with footballs and volleyballs. Teacher says that it's ""Accidental"". Also in other classes like maths, history etc. he and all of his friends throw their eraser and pencils at me. ""Accidentally"". What should I do?

504,"Me &amp; my ex has a 2 year old together (who is autistic, remember this for later). She has a nine year old who was conceived via a sexual assault as well. For the past year and a half, she has been abusing the older one (primarily mental abuse), threatening him to throw him out on the street to “teach him a lesson” or even saying in front of his face that she doesn’t want him anymore. Keep in mind that I have no legal rights for the oldest child &amp; her family is slowly showing me that they don’t want me to be in his life.

505,"Been with my girlfriend for a month. Last date was last Saturday. Sunday I replied to her story and asked about her day and then said I would love to spend time with her again and since we usually get together on weekends, I said I assume she was free for the following weekend. She told me that hopefully she would, and that she was starting online high school but the classes should be easy so she’ll let me know “throughout the week”. 

So I agreed and on Monday I thought about reaching out because it was her first day of school, I missed her, and since she said she would like us to text about each other’s days. We texted for a bit about our day until she said she was going to bed. Then on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and now Saturday morning I heard nothing from her. She said she would let me know so I gave her the space to work on school and stuff of that nature and let her get back to me. 

The only thing was that on Thanksgiving, she didn’t text me but made a Snapchat story with a picture of us and said she was thankful for me. I replied to it and said happy thanksgiving and that she means so much to me. She said happy thanksgiving back. And that was it. Now it’s Saturday (the day we usually get together) morning and I’m thinking of texting her. I’ve resisted texting her because I wanted to give her space and not seem impatient because she started school.

Introduction and short Version.

Hi as I am writing this down I don't know what to do anymore. I apologize for bad grammar and all this stuff. So to start of I am 16 Years old and MTF. I am out to my parents and a few friends, but I am still male in public because I am scared, and I am still waiting for a therapist. I am over weighted, and I am about to fail the 11th grade in Germany. To start of I don't have any hobbies except computer games. I am not good at anything i would say and everything new I try is not fun or just frustrates me. I am on my computer all day and the only ""exercise"" I do besides going to school is VR gaming. In September, I weight 95 kg and now I am weighting 98 kg. I am eating too much because of frustration and I don't really watch at what I am eating because of stress. When I am trying to do some exercise I am too weak for 90% of the things and I can't find any advice with that. 

The problem with school.

From 4th to 9th grade I was pretty bad at school, and I was suicidal at that time. I started to get some friends and let the bullying behind me in 8th grade and since then it was going up. In 10th I was good enough to start ""Abitur"". Now I am in 11th grade and I don't know 90% of the basics and the school cant to anything about it. I don't know what to do after school and I haven't found any job I would like to do in my lifetime or if its needed just a few years. I am scared to go on and what will happen if I am not able to get into the 12th grade.

The problem with me being incompetent and not having any real hobby.

Since I am 5 or 6 years old I am playing video games. I never stopped or something, and I am playing all day. I like playing video games and about that I am not upset or sad at all. The problem is that his is my only hobby. I do not have any other thing I really like to do in my free time. The biggest problem is that I am not good at anything. At the most things I am bad or sometimes as good as anybody else. It's really putting me down and I don't know what to do against me being incompetent and me not having fun at 90% of the things you can do.

The problem with my friends.

I have friends I guess but I don't have anyone to talk to.  I've been betrayed many times. My old best friend hates me since I told him I am trans, and he told many secrets I only told him to anybody. One day he called me on my phone while being drunk and said. ""This is Elena. \*deadname\* is transgender now."" I immediately hang up after that and I don't know who was with him to this day. This was not the only time this happened but I think its clear that I don't want to trust anybody anymore really. The friends I have I only know from playing games and that the only thing I do with them. My ""best"" friend is the only one I talk to a bit. I do not at  all tell him anything. For me, he is my best friend. But I am not his best friend. I can tell him basic things but not more. He doesn't really care about more than the basic things. Just like everybody else. The last time I really opened myself to someone I got no response, and he ignored the things I wrote him. 

The problem with my weight.

I am not fat I would say. I am chubby. I weight 98 kg, and I am 1.85 m big. I gained two kg in the last three months and I don't know how to really exercise. I am pretty weak and cant do any of the exercises I found to this point. The only thing I do is playing VR games and I don't know if this really helps. Now to the problem with food. My parents don't really life healthy. I can't make my own food really and I eat it all if it tastes good. Nearly 90% of the time I eat too much is when I am stressed, and I am stressed often. I just see the food and eat it if I'm stressed.

The problem with my gender &amp; the problem with my anxiety and also ""depression""?

I have anxiety. I have anxiety when I am under people I don't know. I have anxiety when I need to raise my hand at school. I have anxiety when I want to tell somebody my opinion. I am anxious in many ways. My biggest problems are the fact that I am transgender and me wanting to transition and  everything mentioned above. I just can't stand getting misgendered all the time. I hate my body and even tho I want to transition I often feel like my body could never look good enough. I think I could pass but I would never be sexy or just beautiful in general. Besides that I don't think the people I know would accept me. I would lose even more people. I am not confident in general. I don't have any self-confidence. I am happy often. When I am playing games sometimes. When I talk to friends about funny stuff. Or when I am buying something new and enjoy having and using it. But there is always this sad feeling going with it. When I start to think a lot or got too much free time I don't use I start to get sadder to the point where I am laying in my bed and properly cry. I can't talk to my parents about anything. The last time I spoke to my parents about something important was when I outed myself as transgender to them. To this point they don't know my new name or anything of the things I wrote down in this post. My parents are supportive and would do anything to make me happy but I just can't talk to them. Its driving me crazy. Most of the time I pretend to be happy in front of them or other people that are important to me. Everybody got their own problems and I don't want them to do something for me.

The end.

I don't know what to do or think anymore. I am anxious and don't think I can ever achieve anything. I don't know if there is a way to give me advice but I needed to say all of this. The time I am writing this down I'm having something like a mental breakdown I did self harm today, and I am regretting it. I did self harm a lot in the past, and I am scared to do it often again. I want to finally end this post and if you read thru all of these thanks. Thanks for listening to the problems of me.",28Nov2020,1
509,Okay so I try not to use my phone at night I normally read or just sit and think but recently I’ve started talking to this girl and we became good friends and she stays up super late because she has anxiety and can’t sleep so she sometimes texts me and I’m willing to talk since it helps her but recently my mom went off in a complete rage so I went in to my phone and deleted my messages because I knew she’d take my phone and look through all my stuff and she did and I guess there was a group chat that the girl I was talking to was in with another girl and my mom freaked out over it.

510,"Hey fellow redditors! I really need some advice on this current situation with my best friend.

&amp;#x200B;

Some backstory : I grew up in a toxic household, never had emotional support from anyone when I needed it. I tried to do things to please everyone else and not me (still struggling with it but more on that later). I'm gonna skip a few years and tell you about when I met my best friend. We met on a game. I was going through a terrible time and I really liked talking to him. Fast forward a few years and we became close. I think the pandemic is the time we started talking for hours everyday though, and that made us super close. He said he had feelings for me but I don't really feel the same way + we live really far away from each other. So I told him and we were fine. A lot of things happened. We've been through our ups and downs but we always get through it. And he's been an amazing friend to me.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem - I went through a really, really tough time and through that time, he was there for me. But I also got to spend a lot of time with myself and focus on the things I like to do. I've never felt like this before, because as I've told you, I've always been a people pleaser (even if it hurt me). So, I got to spend time by myself and I really enjoyed it. I don't mind talking to people but I feel like I've started to like staying by myself. And I wanted to discover and focus on stuff about myself, which led me to not talk to my friend for hours like we used to everyday.

&amp;#x200B;

We did have arguments about it and I finally told him what was going on. He seemed to understand at that time but last night, he said that it just doesn't feel good and it hurt. Mind you, we did talk yesterday because I felt bad for not spending as much time together. He was sick and I was going to sleep so I asked him when he would sleep and he got all defensive saying ""you haven't asked that in a long time. Whatever, later"". He also said that me asking that only looks like an excuse to not talk to him. Even though, I asked him because I wanted him to rest because he was sick. I've apologized a lot about it and I really want to spend time with myself. I just don't know what to do 

&amp;#x200B;

We left that conversation on a bad note. It's not like we don't have arguments but most of the time, it's really exhausting

Am I in the wrong here? Please help me out

511,"Hello, I don't use Reddit (other than checking FNAF news and FGO guides), so I apologize if I'm really bad at this lol.

First, a little background knowledge about me. I work a fast-food job in a decently sized town that's pretty conservative. I'm a senior in high school and most of my coworkers are also seniors in high school. This is where it gets weird (and confusing). I go to a high school outside of the district I live in, so I'm an outsider and I don't know most of them outside of my workplace. A bit more about me, I'm a lesbian. I'm not out to my coworkers (or managers), because I don't wanna get ridiculed by my coworkers (look conservative small-ish town that doesn't bode well with LGBT is not safe). Despite this, I seem to attract only men. 

Since my town is required to wear face masks and my job's uniform requires me to wear a hat, I usually look like a mess. This doesn't deter old men who will ask me for my number when I'm working window or order-taking. I have an awful time saying no to people, so I end up changing the subject before they can flirt with me more. It's not just customers who flirt with me, but it's also my coworkers as well.

The first guy who asked me out constantly asked me for my Snapchat and my number, but I didn't think he would pursue me because he had a girlfriend (with who I was friends). When they broke up, he started texting me more and demanding more of my attention in and out of work. He even jokingly sent me a picture of his face talking about NSFW topics that I was not ok with. He wouldn't take no for an answer, so I felt like I was backed up in a corner. When he asked me out, I ghosted him out of panic. He doesn't make things awkward at work and he didn't follow up, but I feel extremely bad for it. On the plus side, he left me alone and I got more comfortable working again (I do feel paranoid that he has gossiped about me to other people, but I can't say for sure).

The second guy (I don't know if he's a senior in high school, he is very vague about it) was trying to intimidate me? He would talk about how he has bodyguards and would emphasize having ""total security""? Really weird. Then, he talked to me my entire break while I just wanted to eat and play on my phone. He kept asking if I was single and that if I could go to the Super Bowl with him. I rejected him (I don't like football to begin with), but he kept insisting that my parents would like it even though we just met that day! 

I told my managers and my mom about this and they joked about it instead of offering advice on how to stop it. I'm not scared of these guys, but I work evening shifts often; with my awful paranoia, this doesn't mix well for me. Apologies for the length. Thank you for reading my story.

TLDR: I can't reject weird advances from men at my work (who hardly know me) because I'm scared of being gossiped about or accidentally upsetting them.",28Nov2020,1

I get really bad anxiety, and one night her and my ex faked getting in a car crash to get me to come to town as a joke. I went off, the maddest I had ever been. All she had to do was ask and I would have went. Well it messed her up and we didn’t talk for about a month or two. She came back a few weeks ago again and I told her that if she isn’t for sure don’t even talk to me. I made more progress this time than I had, she had a want to talk to me. Well I asked her out on a official date the other day and she said yes. We met up the other night with my ex and her boyfriend( we are cool with each other) and it was a great night. I kissed her and told her I love her. She hasn’t been the same since. She told me that word shouldn’t be tossed around so easily and it’s just some honeymoon phase. I don’t need her to tell me when I love someone. She hasn’t been the same since. She is avoiding phone calls and is talking about the other night. She even canceled on our date. I haven’t ever given anyone a second or even a third chance. I really do feel something for her but I’m scared if I show anymore feeling it will push her away. I really need some help guys.

I try to not engage much with his obsession with conspiracy theories and I always try to avoid having any discussions about the crazy topics he brings up. What’s starting to become a serious problem is that he might be suffering from intermittent explosive disorder. I’m no psychologist, but sometimes he has those unexpected temper tantrums where he would complain about innocuous things I do, such as using my own utensils and not sharing or not cleaning the dishes right after cooking (I clean them a few hours after) even though he does the same thing.

Yesterday he yelled at me because I forgot to take off my shoes when I walked into the kitchen (he’s fine with shoes in the apartment, except the kitchen), yet he does the exact same thing sometimes. I took a deep breath and bottled up my anger as I usually do, but I don’t think I can keep doing this for too long.

Im asian and my penpal’s white. We met on penpal matching website like 5 years ago.

We chatted a lot but and then one day my penpal sent a chinky eye photo of him.
And the other day he called me a chink.
And repeatedly said “nihao” kind of stuffs to mock me racially. (I’m not Chinese)
So that’s how we stopped talking.

But like a few days we are reconnected.
He sincerely apologized what he had done.
And I said it’s cool. U were a teenager. 
But like tbh I’m not cool at all.

Anyway, he was a little depressed cuz of lockdown/he lost his job/dropped out of school etc. And he also said he was supposed to have traveled to Asian countries. And kept told me how much he enjoyed food, dramas and stuff from my country.

So I was like “well I can send u some snacks here then” and he said “I feel bad but wow that’s exciting”

I prepares some snacks for him and Im trying to write a short letter to send with the snacks!

But here’s my real question: should I not mention about the past?

I maybe wanna write like this: If there’s anything that hurt you among what I said to you, I apologize. And no more racial slurs, chinky eyes nor nihao’s. Those are not funny. Still teenagers break bad at some moments in their youth y’know. Hope we’re cool!



— summary —
1) my penpal said racial slurs towards me
2) so we stopped talking
3) recently we got reconnected and he apologized to me sincerely 
4) found out he was in slight depression 
5) decided to send him a little gift from my country with a short letter
5) but despite all his apologies I’m still not really cool with it
6) should I mention it on the letter?

I was recently introduced to a guy (24M) by a friend I met at work, and we had dinner on Thursday. I figured the guy wouldn’t be a desperate type, because he was conventionally attractive and had an active social life. I had an okay time - although I wasn’t particularly attracted to him I did my best to make him feel comfortable. Right after we parted he asked me out via text and I agreed, since I thought getting to know him one more time wouldn’t hurt.

The thing is he doesn’t ever stop texting me, and I really dislike constant texting and calling while I’m going about my day. I’m usually busy with work and need my alone time, but the guy doesn’t cut me a slack. He talks and asks questions so much I feel like I’m being interrogated... I’ve tried everything - responding late, faking plans, telling him ‘I don’t text that much’, ‘Why don’t we talk more when we meet up?’ - and he still doesn’t get the hint. Today he asked to call me and I just told him let’s do it tmrw because I honestly felt too tired to argue.  I’m so damn stressed out I want to drown my phone down the sink.

527,"I just became an assistant manager at a chain sandwich shop, I know great gig. We opened up just about a year ago, and we’re the only location within a 100 mile radius (reason why I say, is that it’ll pop up later) before covid she started with around 20 employees, shes now down to 5 (including myself) there’s one particular employee that has been causing very obvious problems and tensions with in the work environment,, I’ll call him L. To say L is a lazy employee is and understatement, I don’t know why out of all the employees we’ve had to let go, I’m shocked she picked him. L is 25 and went to one of our states top colleges to study phlebotomy and the medical field in general, and again he worked at our states top hospitals and got fired. There’s a whole list of the things L does and I could nit pick, but here are the main things. He got into a fight with my boss’s mother in which she is one of the owners, because he took a break in the middle of a 4 hour shift, during a rush. During each shift there’s only 2 workers on, so you can see how it’s a problem. He makes multiple sexual comments towards a female coworker of mine who is a minor, he makes sexual comments towards our married boss, and sexual comments towards customers (in my state not sure if it’s the same for all, but making comments towards customers/clients is workplace sexual harassment) He none stops complains about all the work he has to do, we all have the same tasks to do at this place. Honestly our boss is a very laid back person, doesn’t typically care that we check our phones, as long as all the work is done. While the rest of her employees work their asses off, L complains he sits on his phone when there’s work to be done. He takes two 15min bathroom breaks during a 4 hour shift. L’s favorite thing to do is complain to customers about how he needs a raise, when he’s making nearly 2 dollars more than the minimum wage. My coworkers are uncomfortable working with him, I hate having to work with him cause he tries to argue with me whenever I tell him to do something. I’ve mentioned subtly about firing him to my boss before and she said she feels bad, I tried reasoning with her that he would be fine because he could definitely find a better job with a degree than working at a chain store. My boss takes pride in saying that we have a family business, we don’t bs, and we are honest and fair. When I don’t see how she can say that when just one employee is more or less sullying the integrity of the only location we have in this area. I know I’m only the assistant manager and I dont really have a lot of say in what gets done as far as employees go, but how do I tell my boss that it’s in the business’s best interest to let L go?",28Nov2020,1

I stay because my boss is amazing and so are the people I work with. But I've always had this nagging feeling that I need to do more with my life.. I need to make a difference. I want to do something that really matters. I've never had a dream job or anything. I do have hobbies.. But nothing I really excel at or can make a career of. I never finished college which is something that bothers me, but I can't afford to go back. 

Of course this year isn't really the time to try to branch out considering if I tried I probably wouldn't be able to pay my bills. I live in Colorado now but grew up in Louisiana. I always thought it would be cool to open a Louisiana themed restaurant here or something.. But again this isn't a good year for that. And I wouldn't know how to start if it was. 

I feel like I'm getting older and what if it's too late to find a dream and start a new life? I've always wanted my life to have purpose but instead I feel like I just wake up and work but don't feel like what I do matters.  

Has anyone else ever felt this way- like you needed to have purpose? Did you find a dream late in life and make it work? How? I could use some advice. I don't want to look back in 20 years and wonder what I did with my life as I kind of do that already.

However I have a very large nose, large jaw and chin without any definition due to a lot of facial fat ( due to genetics my face just stores a lot of fat on my lower face and chin so I have no facial definition), low and flat cheek bones, prominent eyebrow bones and deep set eyes with large dark under eye circles (which are due to bone structure not actual lack of sleep). All of these features have been confirmed by facial plastic surgeons  and thereby have contributed to my general lack of attractiveness. Even when I dress up, wear makeup, and do my hair, I am still laughed at and called ugly.  A lot of guys at parties/weddings/general events will call me the ""ugly girl."" In fact I was recently at my cousin's wedding and the photographer said to the event planner, ""I got pictures of everyone, even the ""ugly"" girl (referring to me, as I was standing 5 feet away.) The lady event planner said surprised, ""don't say that!"" But I knew he wanted me to hear it....in fact, I have been in many situations throughout my life where boys and older guys alike have called me ""ugly"" out loud or ""the ugliest girl I have every seen"" out loud not directly to my face, but within a few feet of me to let me know of their opinion. Even despite wearing a dress, makeup, and having my hair down and groomed. The comments are even worse when I dress up and wear makeup like lipstick and eyeshadow because it highlights just how not feminine I am. I stopped caring and realize that i am ugly and no amount of skin care, hair grooming, and nice clothes will change an essential ugly bone structure.

533,"India. I(almost 15f) have been living with mom for almost 3 years now. But now I've decided to go back to my dad. They're not divorced yet, but the case is going on, they've been fighting for years, it is traumatic to me and a major reason for me being much more mature.

But I was always MUCH more mature for my age even at 10/12, and got along with kids older than me, knew about a lot of bad words, knew what sex was(never have done anything with anyone though, and not planning to any time soon). And mostly mentally too, everyone has always said that about me.

My mom used to and still goes to a spiritual institution thing, and my dad HATES it, he even has a slight anger issue I'd say, but he has NEVER even held my hand too tight, and he loves me TOO much I'd say. 

But at my dad's house, I left my old diary, all that time back, and I am PRETTY sure he has found it and read it. The book has a cover of that spiritual org thing, and I just used it because the pages were blank. In that, I had written about my crushes, an older boy, but that guy never knows, I never planned on telling him even then, and he is my friend now, no feelings.  

I also think I have written something about sex in there. And recently I found out that my dad found a few pictures of me, on an old phone that I used to use, that I left there. As you might have guessed, those were my nudes. Yes, I understand I was very young then to masturbate and all, and I was foolish to click pictures, but that happened. I was kinda wild in a bad way. Can't change it; please don't judge me.

I met my dad briefly a few months back, he brought up this topic and was surprisingly talking very calmly and understandingly about it all and saying stuff like I *get that you're a teenager but this stuff, isn't good.* But I am VERY scared when I go back he'll make a huge deal out of it.

538,"This might be long and rather pathetic but i'll try my best. My life path has been a disaster full of self-destructive patterns. I've always lived in the moment and sought cheap thrills that maybe brought instant gratification but still left a huge void inside. Instead of ever addressing these voids, I've endlessly chased cheap thrills my entire life. This includes everything. I lied to my parents about graduating from college many years ago and it haunts me to this day. I was merely a couple credits away but decided I'd rather get drunk every single night and ended up failing three classes that I needed to graduate. Instead of just being honest about it, I lied about being very sick the day of graduation and used that as a reason as to why I couldn't attend. My family is super trusting and didn't even ask for proof of my certificate and just believed me. Believing me is the WORST mistake a person in my life can make because I lie, lie, lie, and lie. About everything. I think I deluded myself into believing everything in life was OKAY but lately i've been facing music I have avoided almost all my life. Reality.

I work as a part-time driver for UPS for the season only with no plan in mind for where I will work afterwards. All the friends I had in my life have recently left because they picked up on my pathological lying ways and are terrified to be around me. I have no education, I work at a job that expires in about one month, I am an alcoholic, and I am a pathological liar. I wake up with a deep pain in my chest every single day knowing that I threw away great people and great life opportunities. But only recently have I started feeling the true affects of my horrible decision making. Only recently have I smelled the coffee and stopped deluding myself into believing I live a good life. I always acted like I had lots of money and was someone I wasn't around others but people started smelling the BS. Just about everyone in my life thought or thinks I am a college graduate that makes about 80 K a year. I am a dropout that flocks from job to job.

I feel so depressed. At 28 years old, I have nothing to show for myself. People that loved me hate me. I am in financial hell. Every single day is a struggle for me mentally as I can't stop obsessing over all that I have lost in my life due to my horrible decision making. A lot of people deal with hardship in life and it's because of things out of their control but 99% of my hardship is self-inflicted. I have great parents. I was given opportunity after opportunity. Most people ""love"" me when they initially meet me and love being around me but I end up throwing them away through impulsive decisions. I've always repeated these actions time and time again but this is the first time in my life that I truly want to change.

I want to stop the lying, I want to stop the drinking, I want to do something that can put on a path to maybe one day having a career. I simply want to improve as a person but I am so scared. So scared that I won't be able to find the strength due to the tremendous guilt and shame I feel every night and every morning. I am thinking of coming clean with my family about everything. Maybe looking into somehow getting back into school though I am broke. I have no kids, I'm single(shocking).

People of reddit, what advice would you give a f\*\*\* up like me? Where do I even start? At 28 years old, I feel like I am destined to live an extremely miserable life filled with regrets forever if I don't make drastic changes but I do not know where to start. I am at rock bottom.

I was so shocked by this I didn't say anything in the moment + she was about to leave. Well I've been thinking about it for a whole day and I feel like I need to talk to her about it. This is not the first time she's acted ""petty"" or said something about them, but then been nice to my brother in person. It makes me uncomfortable and I don't know how to address it. I'm not a confrontational person and I don't know how to phrase - ""you need to get over it"" kindly. She's 27 but can be immature about many things. Any advice would be welcome!",28Nov2020,1

546,"So backstory I was given the opportunity to house sit for a couple for 3 months and it is almost at the end of month 2. The couple is Christian ( this is relevant) and the husband is a pastor. 
Up until that point I had been living with my boyfriend and his family paying rent at their house because I moved out of my house earlier in the year due to some situations. 
However, being a Christian myself the couple wanted me to have independence and not live with bf so much. For context my family just moved to Idaho last month entirely across country. 
Anyways...
I have a fear of being alone. Like I hate it. When I sleep alone I have nightmares (like no one else is in the house). I'm always on edge and anxious. I don't feel comfortable at all. And having severe mental illness being alone for any period of time naturally leads to some not so great thoughts. 
Now I did mention this to them but they said id get used to it. And that my bf and I need to grow individually and not be together so much. 
Now I get that. I do. However my bf is my best friend. We've been friends for 3 years, dated almost a year and having lived together for almost 5 months we've figured out a lot about each other. Personally even though we do spend a lot of time together we both can recognize when each other needs space. We're not obsessive clingy with each other either. We're very affectionate but comfortable being our own goofy selves with each other.  He has times when he goes out with his friends without me and so do I. We're content with that. Naturally we do spend a lot of time together but often his friends come over and we'll all hang out or go get something to eat and stuff. We each have our own jobs. 
Recently weve been thinking about moving out to Idaho where my family is and getting better jobs and then our end goal is to move to Japan. 
However my bf doesnt have the funds rn. I do personally. 
When I brought it up to the couple they told me that I should just go ahead and go and ""if your bf really cares about you he'll follow you""  ""just go and do your thing and let him decide if he wants to or not."" ""If its meant to be its meant to be.""
Am I wrong for thinking this isnt a good idea? Even if he was my girl best friend...i wouldn't do that.
I'm also afraid to tell them but recently I've been spending most nights back at his family's home again. I check on the house of course but I just hate being alone so much. Sleeping with him beside me I dont have nightmares. I dont have much trouble keeping my thoughts in line. I find a quiet security and safety with him and his family. His mom and dad are super nice and his dad takes us fishing and his mom helps me with my depression and anxiety because she has the same stuff. 

I talked to my therapist about the whole moving thing and with my bf there as well and she doesn't think what the couple told me is right. However I'm torn because my religion and the whole mindset of dating for us is for the girl to be independent and the guy to chase. And so I should just move and focus on me and not worry about him. 
The Christian part of me is telling me that I should just go because its wrong for me to spend so much time with him and we also have had sex and thats like awful and I should be independent and I should do my own thing and if hes worth it he'll come after me and if not then I shouldn't be dating him.

But the other part of my is worried it will strain our relationship and my therapist also cautioned me about just moving in general. Im Also worried that wanting to sleep besides him or him being the one person that helps me with my depression is too toxic. Is it so bad to want to be with the one person that accepts you? Apparently I need to be more independent and not need a man so much I guess. I dont feel like I need him so to speak but I want to spend time with him because he helps me feel normal and happy and he never judges me. There's lots more reasons too but yeah. I dont know what to do. I feel part ashamed for feeling this way and part content.",28Nov2020,1

I want to do something different. I got a history degree when I was 24 and am 32 now. I've been working as a gasfitter and I want to return to my roots as it were. My roots, in this case, are the study of history (very broadly), but I don't know what's out there for me.

Basically I'd love creative suggestions for employment, paths that other people chose to follow, ideas that out-of-the-box thinkers wouldn't mind sharing.

Okay you guys I’m at a loss for direction. So my criminal of a brother went and bought a car and put literally EVERYTHING in my name. I’ve been off at college so I had no idea, but coming home for the holidays I intercepted some mail addressed to me saying i I we backed taxes on a car and that if they aren’t paid they’re going to suspend my license. This is worrisome because my brother has charges for DUI, open container, and reckless driving and if something happens and I’m at fault I could be held accountability. 

I was wondering what steps do I take to resolve this? I don’t trust him to take the initiative of taking it out my name. Also, I’m more than positive that he’s opened similar things in my name since my inconsiderate ass parents literally leaves my social security and tax information out for him take. this is really pissing me off because it’s finals week and I have other things to stress about and really just want to get this resolved so I can cut ties with them once and for all because this is the last straw.",28Nov2020,1
551,"Ok so, my husband’s best friend and his fiancée make hot sauces (new business). It’s primarily her thing - he’s just helping her make them. She manages the orders, the marketing, the making etc... I saw on Facebook she posted on her story that she’s making them so I thought, hey I’ll buy some! I texted her asking for one of the three sauces I was interested in and she said no problem is it for you or a gift? ( she was waiting for her labels) I said no need it’s just for me! She told me to not worry about the $ because we’ve already sent them like 2 gift boxes earlier in the year. 

It’s been 3 weeks since I asked...... it takes 2-3 days to deliver from where they are to us....

According to my husbands best friend she’s notorious for not following through with things - so she’s kind of a flake. 

I kind of want to text her and say hey it’s been three weeks, I hope the business is good blah blah etc. But I really want her to be accountable but I’m afraid it might not happen. 

So how do I politely say : hey it’s been three fkn weeks, I would love to have some hot sauce but now I’m really not interested because it’s taking too long. If I were a regular customer I would write the worst fkn review, so what are you gonna do about it?

554,"(Pun somewhat intended)

Hello, I am a 23 year old virgin male. I have been single my whole life, though I have been approached by girls in the past, I have for one reason or another turned them down. Usually because I was stupidly pursuing someone else who I was attracted to more, only to be rejected by said girls later.

Before I go any further, I would like to address a potential concern which may arise: I do not hate women and if someone decides to reject me, sure it hurts, but that is their decision. But I realized today that perhaps my perception of women is somewhat warped from years of only porn and observing the relationships of others and fiction. I ask this in an attempt to improve myself:

I think i'm too picky with women. 

I've only ever liked 3 girls enough to ever ask them out, all ended in rejection. When I consider whom to date, I find myself dissecting said person's physical appearance. I think about a woman's chest, butt, thighs, etc and I didn't see a problem with it because I assumed that's what we all did; even women look for certain things in men like muscle, big penis (though I learnt that porn is exaggerated) and I considered it to balance out as I would also consider their personality:

For example, there's a discord i'm a part of where a handful of guys ""suck up"" to this 1 girl who is a streamer and (not trying to be sexist) she's the generic e-girl thot; the kind that thinks putting on nothing but a yellow bra and panties is ""cosplaying Pikachu"" she does nothing for me as you can tell from her responses; she feeds off of their borderline worship. 

This is where my pickiness stems from: wanting to be with someone who is considerably attractive but also down to earth; not full of themselves and it's because of this I tend not to give many people a chance. 

This line of thinking is also detrimental in another way: If I see a girl who I consider very attractive, I will most likely chicken out because I don't consider myself ""good enough"" for them. I'm not exactly a prize, though I try to be better physically, I usually sabotage myself and stay around the same weight. Before i'm told yes: fat and or unattractive people have sex, but I feel like i'm aiming to high whenever I see a girl I like.

TLDR:

I'm picky, possibly sexist, no self confidence, can't approach girls out of how shy I am and while I like personality, I also like an attractive body. I can only assume said mindset comes from no knowledge of actual relationships and the closest to affection i've ever had being Lisa Ann POV.

How do I turn myself around and improve?",28Nov2020,1
555,"i’ve been working at my current retail position for just over a month now, and it’s a good job so far. i like working there and the pay is nice. but i’ve been having a problem since a couple weeks into the job that i’ve gone to management about a few times now. i work part time, usually five hour shifts monday through friday. the reason that i’m part time is because i have bad sleep issues. i’m not sure what it is but probably insomnia, maybe chronic fatigue. i quit my last job for many reasons, one of them being that i constantly overworked myself, taking on extra shifts and working six days a week. 

anyway at my current job, i keep getting scheduled for hours outside of my availability even after having gone to management about this multiple times. i was told it has something to do with the schedule being made automatically by a computer. on top of being scheduled for hours that i’m not available, i keep getting scheduled for eight hour shifts even though i’m not full time and i’ve told them i’d rather stick to the five hour shifts, which they were fine with. but i’m still getting scheduled for these hours i can’t work. 

i know i’m being difficult and i should be more flexible with them. i want to be full time, but because of the sleep issues i’ve been having long term, i can’t. i already spend nearly my whole weekend at home resting and recovering from the week. i pushed myself too hard at my last job which is why i’m trying to take it easy and get my life in order. 

i don’t know what to do. i thought the scheduling problem would’ve gotten sorted out by now but it hasn’t. i’m going to have to speak with management again, but i’m worried that i’ll lose my job. which would be really upsetting and disappointing because i desperately need a stable job. should i tell management that i want to work just five hour shifts from now on, and give them specific hours (ex. 10-3)? i didn’t wanna have to do that but i feel as if it’s getting to the point where i have to. i’ve been losing sleep over this and it’s making my depression act up. for my last two jobs i was mistreated badly which is why this is so worrying to me. i need this job because the pay is so good and i like working for the company. i also haven’t had any issues other than this. on the other hand, i can’t deal with this schedule issue long term. i’m tired of tracking down management every time i notice i’ve been scheduled for a shift i can’t work. i don’t wanna have to find another job. 

does anyone have advice on what i should do? please no rude comments. i know my post was all over the place but this has been worrying me for awhile. thank you for reading.",28Nov2020,1
556,"Option 1: Stay at home with parents in current city. (With a car)

Option 2: Move out to a new city.

(Secret option 3: Go on a vacation)

Some info: 
- 18F. I’m of age where I live. So ya I can go to bars (although no one tell me to hang around there in hopes of meeting people. That’s terrible friend meeting advice and everyone knows it)

- Was supposed to go to Uni this year but deferred due to COVID. The city I would be moving to would be the city I’m going to university come Sep 2021.

- I have like 10k in savings. Tbh I’m hoping to not spend this when I move except on activities. (Although could be used towards a vacation)

- If I moved I’d either get a job at a golf course or as a waitress. (I currently have a job at a golf course). Either way, doing the math, I don’t think I’d be able to afford a car. (Ideal would be both to spread my options for friends but idk if I can make that work).

- About half a year ago I was ditched and gaslighting by people I called my close friends. So even though I do have friends in my current city, they aren’t close (except for one) and they aren’t moving to my new uni anyways in September. 

- I don’t rly know anybody in new city. But I would hope to find work that would let me meet new people. I also would find a place with roommates around my age (due to the uni being close this is only minorly challenging).

- I’m quite extraverted and don’t find it terribly hard to make new friends.

- I can’t take summer courses at the uni (I’ve asked). 

- I’d move out some time between January and March, whenever a good place becomes available.

- My parents are very strict due to COVID so I haven’t really left house in months and won’t be able to until vaccine. 

- I currently have a stressful Family situation. A lot of my family members have health and stress problems. So on one hand I want to stay and help them and be with them. On the other hand I want to run away.


What I really want is friends, an adventure, and living independently. I’m worried that I’m underestimating 1. How hard it is to make friends and 2. How fun this would be.

Truly luck has never really favoured me. So when I do shit I like to plan for success instead of hope for success. 

Basically plz give advice! What do I do? Other ways to meet people? If I move should I expect to be lonely until I move to uni? Am I better off staying at home?

My husband has been going through a really bad rough patch lately. We moved to a new state about 7 years ago, and ever since then, he’s been struggling to find any kind of happiness in his job. He’s switched jobs (same position, different companies) multiple times, and it all ultimately ends up with him being miserable and hating his job. He’s been in this industry since about 2002, but he moved into a more management role since we moved, and he’s reached the point where he’s so miserable, he wants to do a complete career change. I’ve tried to be as supportive as I can be; I’ve told him he should quit his job and take a step back while he decides his next steps (while it would be a little financially tight, we would be able to “get by” on my income alone), but he always comes up with an excuse to stay at his job. I understand it’s a struggle for him since after devoting 18 some years to this industry, he has no idea where to go from here and I have no idea how to help him. 

Lately, he’s been in a really bad way. He’s started drinking again (after being sober for over 2 years), he’s extremely irritable and the smallest things seem to trigger him (and he frequently overreacts to small infractions), I feel like this enormous divide is opening up between us, and all the restrictions placed on our “normal” lives by Covid is definitely not helping. Our son (10) asked me the other day why Dad is so angry all the time now, and I don’t really know what to tell him other than that his dad is really stressed and going through a lot.

He’s one of those “I don’t need professional help” types, so I don’t know how to approach him about this. How can I start this conversation with him??

which got me upset because she’s done this before when i tried telling her about my anxiety (my friend also has anxiety but it’s diagnosed) and my mother said i was confused and that is was my friend putting those ideas in my head even though i’ve told her about my panic attacks she has just been completely unsupportive and belittles me

Anyway the issue is not the iPad, it can be repaired or replaced, albeit expensively. The issue is when I left it in my room it was fine and was kept in the middle of a table with no possibility of falling down by itself or anything like that. 

I came back to my room in the afternoon after lunch and found the damage. Between the morning when I left it and when I came back three people of the cleaning staff went in and out.

I am less upset about the broken gadget and more upset that no one came forward when confronted. But I do not have proof so I cant go beyond just asking what happened. I also do not want to just throw a tantrum and start yelling at people without proof. Honestly if someone came forward and admit it, I would forgive, forget and laugh it off.

It wasn't violent or anything and it was just a peck but I was still like physically bigger than her. I barely remember anything from elementary school except this. I haven't talked to her since I left that school in 6th grade but have been having anxiety attacks about this every day after remembering it last week. I don't think apologising is the right plan because, even though I feel terrible about it, I don't want to bring it up in her memory if she had forgotten. I'm seeing my new therapist on Wednesday but am anxious about telling her as well. What should I do?",28Nov2020,1
571,"I've been depressed for many years now and one of the few things in life that make me happy and smile are books and TV shows. I started a new one recently that I loved so much but I just found out that the actor that plays the main character (whom I really like) is a huge asshole. I feel so sad and something else too that it's hard to describe, but feels like bad electricity running through my entire body. I tried continuing watching the show but I feel bad that I like the character now. I know it sounds weird but I also suffer from OCD and my mind gets stuck on thoughts. I really want to finish the show and enjoy watching it and I also know that the characters are not the actors. Sadly my brain is not cooperating with my logical thought.

572,"This is all pre-COVID and we're in our mid-20s.

So one of my best friends, lets call him Josh, got a new girlfriend (let's call her Kristin) around 4-5 months ago. I used to see Josh once every 2-3 weeks or so before that because of work and general life stuff. Ever since he got in the relationship its been almost impossible to see him. Pretty much 95% of any free time he has is spent with Kristin and her family, and if I'm lucky enough to hang out with him, he usually brings her with him. With a lot of effort on my end and me being the one to reach out I've been able to see him maybe 3-4 times in the past 5 months for a few hours, and 2 of those times he was with his girlfriend. I've made plans with him 2-3 weeks in advance and then when I ask him a few days beforehand if we're still good to go, he casually just says ""Oh I can't, I'm hanging out with Kristin this weekend.""

I love him and I want him to be happy in his relationship. I really like his girlfriend too. I understand that most of his time should be spent with her, especially since their relationship is still sort of new. I just think that he's really overdoing it with not being able to balance our friendship. If this is how it is now, am I ever gonna see him when he's married or has kids? I have plenty of friends in relationships that I see much more often than him, and even when I was in a relationship I still made plenty of time for friends. I have friends that are married that I see much more often than him. I have friends that have kids that I see more often than him. I also don't think what I'm looking for is unreasonable - is hanging out a few hours every few weeks really too much to ask for? I asked a few other friends about this and while some have said they kind of understand where I'm coming from, others have said that I'm being clingy. I'm open to criticism but I genuinely don't think I am being clingy - I speak to him for maybe 5 minutes a week or two through text and would like to see my best friend once every few weeks.

Anyway, what should I do? If you guys think I'm being weird/crazy, should I just learn to live with it or should I try talking to him about it? Any thoughts would help. Thanks!",28Nov2020,1
573,"Needing to leave. Note we are from NZ where rent is paid usually weekly. 

Basically we were promised that the flatmates downstairs would be quiet and keep to themselves.
They didn't, instead loud, parties, domestic abuse, extremely violent and proper damage. 

2 months ago we were asked if they were given notice can we pay for both rooms which we immediately said yes. No problem. 

They were apparently given notice. 

We waited. We put off moving as we were told they would be leaving. 

They didn't. 

Fast foward to now, we gave 2 notice as per request. With an extra week paid in advance of moving in. 
This means after handing in notice we have only to pay one more week of rent. 

Now my landlord is demanding we pay another week. 
That we are TA for leaving and it coming out of nowhere. 
We have been saying for months we can't put up with the violence of the other flatmates as its making us extremely sick and scared and anxious.

574,"Hey, by the title, you can see I'm struggling. If you're triggered by mentions of suicide and relatively tame substances this may not be the post for you. I'm not the most concise person, by any means, but I'll hurry up and get to the point. I'm also a teenaged female if that's relevant (?).

Two nights ago, I tried to kill myself, I think.  It's kind of blurry. I was diagnosed with MDD last month, and ever since getting medicated, thoughts of hurting myself have worsened. But it was fine, people were totally dealing with worse. It was so easy to distract myself, but even the movies and videogames grew dull. I was, and still am, so scared of running out of things to do... but I also have no motivation to do them. Wanting more of everything in life while also turning it away is an interesting feeling... I think.

I had stolen my parent's alcohol before. They wouldn't miss the remainder of the cooking wine, and if it put off my inevitable suicide by a single night, they would surely see it as worth it. It wasn't enough, though, so I took to the internet to see what else I could fuck myself up with. My BRILLIANT answer was Benedryl.

I took a handful and returned to my room. I initially took two... then two more. Eventually,  my thoughts were a resounding mantra of 'fuck it', and I took the rest of the pile. I remember taking 25, which would mean 600mg. I don't remember anything, really, and it was most likely the wine more than anything. I vaguely remember takings some other sort of pill (my dad takes a lot of medications and keeps them within reach), but there's no way to be sure. I have videos of myself that I don't remember, and I'm literally mumbling jibberish. 

Despite being relieved when I awoke from my 16-hour slumber, I didn't say a word. I watched survivor with my mom and joked around with my dad. I guess the only thing good about this whole ordeal was that it spooked me into throwing out my self-harm tools...

i really don't know how bad I fucked up. It seems normal and fine to me, only a bit concerning. But I guess I'm sorta biased.

575,"So I’m having an issue that I could really use some advice on. 

3 months ago, I booked an appointment with an artist (for today). We had an agreed upon time and I placed it in my calendar. I also used unpaid time off hours from work since this was the only available date for the artist. 

Yesterday I get a message confirming the appointment and artist asks to move appointment 1 hour later, no problem . 

Flash forward today.

As I’m getting ready to leave , artist asks to push back another 30 mins. Ok that’s fine. I take the time to watch some tv. 

Again, as I’m getting ready I get a message saying that they are unable to locate the studio key due to a misplacement. They ask if I’m ok with pushing back the appointment again to either later today when they locate the key or tomorrow morning.  

I understand mistakes happen, although this is a huge inconvenience especially due to the fact I used unpaid time off hours from work. 

If I do get the appointment today , I assume it will be much later today since the artist has informed me the key is MOST LIKELY inside the studio . Looks like best chances are tomorrow. I’ve already paid for the tattoo in full. I was planning on leaving a tip plus bringing baked goods and holiday foods from my country . Would it be wrong of me to not leave a tip?

Context: I’m (22F) a workaholic who lost all of her jobs through covid. Right when things were getting really bad, I got my childhood dream job at a racing stable and I love it. It works fantastic with uni as its split shift and its very good for my mental health. 

However, like many else, I had to drain my finances to survive through covid. I wasn’t able to get any government funding because of my asset pool and my savings; but would you look at that? They got drained haha. 

Anywho, I got offered a second job too, bartending casually at an above-award wage. Due to a lot of their staff leaving Australia to go to their home countries, they’re now incredibly low on staff; so they have asked me to work a fair amount of shifts - great for the bank account, not very great for my sleeping habits. My work day at the moment looks something like this (work 1 - racing stable, work 2 - bar): 

Wake up: 2:30am
Drive to work 1 : 3:00am 
Start shift 1 at work 1: 4:15am 
Finish shift 1 at work 1: 9:00am 
Uni: 9:30am-1pm
Start shift 2 at work 1: 2pm 
Finish shift 2 at work 1: 4pm 
Start shift 1 at work 2: 5pm 
Finish shift 1 at work 2: 10:30pm 
Arrive back at home: 11:30pm

Someone I know just got a job at a healthcare company (In California) and contracted COVID (which has led to her whole family getting infected). She was later informed that she probably contracted COVID because the night shift for her job was sick with COVID. Afterwards, my friend was told she was still allowed to continue her job as a caretaker for mentally ill patients even though she has COVID. 

This raises the concern that this organization continually allows infected employees to continue working. This puts all employees and their patients at risk, including mentally ill patients who may not have a say or control of who takes care of them. I see this as abuse of the mentally ill.

589,"Okay..so Im the type of person thats constantly thinking of something.  
Wether it may be sth that I am personally dealing with or just some sort of fictional character when Im listening to some sort of music that inspires me...theres always sth going on in my head.  
Now I have tried writing a diary etc and I ve found that it helps me get my head clear and a lot more focused on the tasks I ve actually gotta do, but somehow it doesnt satisfy (?) me. And thats one of the reasons why I more or less dropped that habit again.  
I ve thought about a couple different possibilties and different approaches...

1. Writing  
Writing gives you the freedom to basically do whatever you want, yet you cant really tell your own story (just give other characters similiar situations and character traits).  
But, somehow I myself dont enjoy reading that much and basically only read Non-fiction books or anything that has a clear reason behind why I should read it.  
Thats why I thought Screenwriting might be a better alternative for me, since I enjoy watching Movies and Tv-Shows a lot more, at least when it comes to fictional stories, but the problem here is that its basically impossible to get your screenplays on the screen, especially if its just supposed to be some sort of side-project in order to get your head clear and let your thoughts flow out.  

2. Music  
I think of music as another great creative outlet.  
The only disadvantage is that you can basically only tell your own story, but not rly fictional ones.  
Also, I bascially need to learn how to sing for that, since its more or less impossible to tell stories without actual Lyrics. (Its possible, but you cant rly be specific without visual help and then its still hard, and probably not really the type of music im interested in).  
However, I do have some basic music knowledge and have played the piano for I think 5-6 years now, even tho it hasnt been much this year.  

3. Video Editing  
This is basically the compromise between Music and (Screen)writing.  
Im not able to tell my own stories, but I can help stories and characters I like and relate to be seen in a new light and from an entirely different perspective.  
This is also the easiest thing to execute, but its quite far away from the actual goal Im chasing.

Okay..I would like to hear your thoughts on this and maybe some of your own experiences when it comes to finding the creative outlet thats fitting.  
Its clear to me that every one of them has its advantages and disadvantages, but I cant seem to figure out which one is the best option for me.  
Im also willing to spend a lot of time on them, but I dont want it to be a fulltime thing (at least to begin with) and I want to be able to go to school (and later on to university) besides it. So basically think of it as an hobby.

594,"Let me preface this post with a little bit of context (not entirely necessary for advice, but relevant imo), I M\[21\] (nearly 22) dropped out of highschool due to severe depression when I was 16. I had some trauma from witnessing my mother attempt suicide (lots of blood and noise, but she is fine, physically). A little under a year after dropping out, I had gained 30-40lbs, I was living in filth and would play video games from dusk until dawn. I started having suicidal ideations, and opened up to my Aunt when she happened to be visiting (in retrospect, a mistake). She blamed my depression video games and had the bright idea to move me to California (away from my home in Arizona), where I have lived since (close to 5 years). What they failed to realize though, was that whisking me away from my friends, and moving me to a completely alien place did nothing to improve my depression and in many ways only made me more unhappy and more suicidal.  But anyway, During that first year, my Aunt tried to help me  get back on track with my life, I got the CHSPE ( a GED equivalent), a job and things were ok, I was still very depressed but would acquiesce in what she would ask of me. Finally, after about a year when I had just turned 18, I was eligible to enroll into community college. I resented the idea but my Aunt told me she would kick me out of I didn't enroll so I did what I had to. At this point in my life was I was clueless about college entirely, I was a mediocre student in highschool and was raised by dropouts. I had no interest nor understanding of higher education. So when it came time to pick classes, I chose classes arbitrarily and performed well enough in some but poor in others if they didn't keep me interested -- I was just doing what I had to in order to not get kicked out. As long as I was attending classes, I had a home so I did what I had to. In concurrence with the classes I was working, and was still deeply unhappy. This continued for over a year, I was aimlessly choosing classes with no particular aim in mind, my family never asked how things were going (my aunt herself was a dropout too), so I just meandered until I got sick of pretending to enjoy myself so I stopped attending classes, I had yet to find something that interested me and I had no plans to transfer to a university. Following me quitting, I was kicked out at 19. I had some savings, but being that I was living in the Silicon Valley prices are very high so I had to live with roommates. I couldn't survive on my meager pay so I went back to school and took some classes for the sake of that sweet sweet financial aid. In doing so I took a programming class, then another, then more classes. When I finally realized I really loved mathematics and programming. So during this time I'm about 20, liking the idea of college now but because of my previous performance in my apathetic state, I have like a 2.9 GPA. Upon realizing that I  had a completely uncompetitive GPA for transfer to a decent computer science department I wallowed in self pity for around a year and stopped attending classes again, started working full time just living for the sake of being alive. Early this year pre-Covid, I just turn 21, and I start feeling good again. I attend some classes part time and enjoy myself, thinking to myself, ""perhaps I can salvage my gpa to something decent, write a sob story cover letter and get into a decent department"", but then COVID strikes. I lose my job, try and stay afloat, in that panic school doesn't even matter to me, I fail all the classes I'm enrolled in (major specific) and work full time. I try to retake it, but can't find time with work and drop/fail some courses. Now here I am with an abyssmal GPA after failing, I can't even consider myself being able to transfer now. So I don't know what to do, I can retake the courses with some effect to my GPA, but I know I will never be competitive, especially in high demand departments such as computer science in the fucking silicon valley. Now, nearly 22 years old I feel completely helpless. I don't want my life to be this slog of unfulfilling and unchallenging work, living on the brink of poverty. What do I do?

TLDR: Dropped out of highschool due to depression, moved to a new state got more depressed, started attending community college for no reason, mediocre performance, tried again, liked it and now depressed I won't be able to transfer due to shit GPA.

&amp;#x200B;

So now this is where I need advice, I'm going to speak to my counselor about any realistic chances I still have at this school, because I have alot credits in my GE and major specific courses, and I am about 1 year out from transfer for my major specific stuff, but my GPA is awful! At this point I am thinking about applying for a new community college being that everything is online. Because of my current level of math, I should be able to place into my current math classes, and in theory transfer in 2 years at the most(1 year of major specific,(math, programming, physics), 1 year for GE), with an excellent GPA. I just don't see the point in wasting my time trying to improve my circumstances at this college if I have no realistic chance. At the best I can maybe get a 3.1 GPA by the time I am done. Minimum GPA's for the colleges I want to get into are 3.3+ for my major (average 3.6). So what the fuck do I do? I was even thinking about just becoming a freelance developer and just building a portfolio instead. I can accomplish a lot in a year just studying industry specific skillsets and tooling.

600,"I'm a very opinionated person. I have my perspectives and beliefs and I generally feel very strong about them. Not all of these beliefs matter, like some are just about the fandoms that I'm in, opinions on movies and video games and comic books and stuff. But some of it is political, social, economical, and religious. I'm often unable to keep myself from responding to someone's comment or post and starting a debate or argument. Whether the argument is civil or not, I always find myself feeling drained and emotionally distraught. Most of the time it's not a strong feeling, but some days I'll have gotten into 10 different debates and before I know it I've spent my whole day off arguing with strangers on the internet. Sometimes it gets to a point where it's all i can think about for an hour-ish even after the conversation has ended. I hate it. I want to be able to just ignore other people's opinions and outlooks on life. It's not that I want to be in an echo chamber, I just want to be able to not care. I want to still care about my opinions and the issues around the world and want change without getting so hung up on random inconsequential people's opinions. Advice?",28Nov2020,0

I still barely ever get matches, and when I do they always just unmatch the moment I try to start a conversation. Like I don't get it, why did you match with me if you aren't even going to respond and just block me right away?

610,"I spend so much time crying about it that I feel stupid and ridiculous. I love my SO so damn much but there's this issue where I keep questioning if he really wants to be with me and if so is it just temporary. 

We've been together 3 years now and Ive known since the moment I met him, despite our rough patches, that I want to spend my life with him. I tell him this often.

I'm a bit of an overthinker. And by a bit I mean a lot.

 Now the first issue is he has never said this to me. 
 Never said he wants to spend his life with me, never says he wants to marry me, never initiates a conversation about our future or even the future in general. It's always from my side. He says he loves me sure. He adores me. Whatever. I'm at that point where I can't stop crying because I've always had issues with feeling unwanted and misplaced and I was overcoming it. Now it's all coming back because  i don't feel good enough to be wed. I'm not wife material. I'm just girlfriend material.

We are stuck on the same God damn place and it honestly feels like we're moving backwards and not forwards.

We had just started dating when he was looking for a job as he had just left his previous job due to bad circumstances. He was looking for a job out of town so it would have been long distance but he was looking in a place that surely I'd be able to find work too. So I still wanted to be with him.

A little while into our relationship, his father had a fall and he needed help with work (his work being farming. He owns a farm that was handed down to him from his father). So I get it. It's important. He told me he's going to help his father out. I said ofcourse you need to do it. I mean it's not forever.

2.5 years later


We're still fucking here.

I love him Dammit but he does everything for everyone. He moved and started working on a fucking farm on top of a mountain. I understand he's pdobably going to inherit the farm but fuck the farm.

What about me? He says he doesn't want to do it forever but then why is he making no effort to plan and look for solutions.

And where the fuck do I fit into his damn plans.

If he takes over the farm and that becomes his life, then the way we are now is as good as it gets.
(us having a flat together in the town we met where we see each other every other weekend) 
OR
I become a lonely house wife ontop of a mountain.
Maybe work from home, but basically isolated from the rest of the world.

I'm probably the biggest piece of shit and unsupportive girlfriend ever right?
I mean all I want is to build a life with him and live together and get married and maybe have a kid. How. Fucking. Selfish.

A year ago I was at a point where I needed more, so I packed up moved to the big city even further away. I told him I feel like my life is going nowhere, I needed more, I needed to give myself a chance to actually grow. Stuck in a dead end job, no car, living with my mother and in a relationship that's going backwards.
I said that I love him and begged him to come with and we could start a life there.. He said no.

So my heart broke. I decided then fine. I detached myself from him. I broke it off. Maybe like 2 weeks later I was like fuck I love this man. Don't be stupid.. We can still work. Maybe he ends up coming.

He didn't and on the contrary a few months later I ended up moving back to be closer to him.

So am an idiot or a selfish bitch who doesn't deserve this man who loves me and cherishes me and treats me like a princess?

I don't know what to do anymore and my mental health is not doing too great.
If I keep bringing it up then he might cave but then I basically bullied him into a life with me.
If I leave it, then I keep having emotional breakdowns.",28Nov2020,1

615,"So my Dad has had cancer for 3 years. We think its likely this is his last Christmas. My husband and I live 3,000 miles away and have not seen them since last Christmas because of COVID. We live in the US and decided to fly home in Mid-December and stay for 3 weeks to avoid the holiday travel rush. We planned to quarantine in our home for 2 weeks, then fly with real N95 (unfitted) masks, then stay distanced for 5 days and getting tested on the 5th day. I keep thinking that we are being irresponsible. Both my parents are high risk. I don't want to get COVID and neither does my husband. Flying seems very shady right now and I think we are very very close to a vaccine.

That said, my family can't even begin to imagine that we might cancel our trip based on whats happening. My Dad is trying to outfit the office in his house so I can work (I'm an attorney - intense job, but he is in full support). Its constant planning and discussion. His doctors seem to think our plan is ""reasonable"" (it worries my they aren't saying safe) and no one has advised us against going. My husband DEFINITELY doesn't want to go. His family already canceled their holiday trip, and I think if it weren't likely my Dad's last holiday we wouldn't even be considering going.

All I can think about is what happens if I go and I give COVID to both my parents? It would be a death sentence for my Dad. And my Mom is not in the best health either. Or what happens if we get there and test positive on our last test, and then are stuck 3,000 miles away with COVID and no way to get home and nowhere to stay? Not to mention the anxiety while we wait to see if my folks got it. And what happens if I tell my Dad I really feel its a bad idea? He can't even begin to hear it. He told me last time we talked about it that it wasn't a ""command performance"" like I just didn't want to show up. I've gone home every Christmas for my whole life, and I'm 31. And every year but the last 2 I came for 2-3 weeks. I've been very present. I've always prioritized them, but its clear he doesn't feel like its enough if I don't come now, when the safety is marginal at best.

616,"Okay, here we go - since my boyfriend and I bought our new house and rented out the basement apartment, we told my best friend that she could move in and rent the spare room we have upstairs with us for cheaper than the basement because we wanted to help her out.
She ended up dog sitting for us for 4 days and when we got back, the house was a mess. She didn’t pick up after herself at all among other things, she also left the spare room a complete disaster. (Mouldy dishes included).

After some discussion, my boyfriend and I decided we no longer want her to move in as it just wouldn’t be a good idea. Not only due to her messiness, but she’s also a recovering alcoholic who I feel like I cannot babysit and be liable for while I work 6 days a week.

618,"My first kiss was unexpected and gross. I hated how his mouth felt. But it wasn’t the worst part of my first date. He kissed me again, without even asking me if I liked it. The worst part was when we got to my house and he was dropping me off. He hugged me, which I reciprocated but then he held me down and kissed me again. I tried to move my head and turn it so it'd only be a cheek kiss, but it was to no avail. I wanted to cry after it happened. To this day I am scared of that happening again. Of being surprised with a man’s rubbery lips. Of him not allowing me to get away when I know he’s gonna kiss me. Of him restraining me so he can get what he wants. 

Is it too dramatic that this one experience has turned me off from kissing as well as dating as a whole?

I have a date soon, and I’m nervous because he might try to kiss me and I just can’t do kissing. It’s so gross and all I can think of his how my first kiss made me want to throw up. I’m tired of men deciding that it’s okay to just touch me because they want to. I want for once to be the one who initiates a kiss.

620,"So I (24F) have been trying to figure out how to put this all down, but long story short I started working at this place and what started out as a stupid, small crush has grown into to me really wanting to ask out my manager. This crush is really getting in the way of some of my decision making (which I know is my fault for getting caught up in my feelings). Like my job is kinda far from my home and I've been thinking about leaving or transferring for something closer, but every time I make the decision to start looking for other jobs to make it official, I go to work the next day, see him and it all flies out the window. And I don't know, maybe he's just being nice, but we joke around, chat, and stuff from time to time and I can't stop myself from smiling/ blushing when he walks past me smiling. 

This is probably stupid, but it's such a big deal cause usually I have short, meaningless crushes that are really me just acknowledging how attractive I find that person, but not wanting to pursue anything. And for so long I had just been trying to come to terms with the idea that I'd probably end up alone because I'd never be able to give someone a chance, but I want to give this a chance. It just sucks that he's my manager and it'd be inappropriate to ask him out.

Every year during peak season when overtime is handed out she ALWAYS works the overtime. Never misses a day and always give 100 percent and on the days she takes vacation they act like it is a problem even in offseason. But the other same level employees never show up. And nothing is ever said to them about it. On thanksgiving she had to work and was given a standing ovation for showing up because nobody else had. This is common trend but nobody ever punishes the management skipping days. Any advice on how to bring attention to the issue professionally?

Extra info.

She has applied multiple times for promotion even on general manager recommendation only to be turned down for a lesser candidate. 

She never misses days unnecessarily.

Other management above her have spoken out about the unreliability of her peers. 

Skipping management has no available vacation time.

As it is an express bus, most of the people who get on the bus are regulars and work 9-5 jobs in the city center.

There's this one guy who gets on the bus at the stop before me; he's roughly 35? years old, white, 5ft9ish, slightly overweight. He's gotten on the same bus as me for over a year now, which isn't that much of a problem but I've always just had a bad gut feeling about him. Recently, he has been sitting on the top floor of the bus every morning (I live in the UK so our public buses are double-deckered)  and when he comes down the stairs to get off the bus a few stops before I do, he just stares at me for an uncomfortable length of time.

I originally gave him the benefit of the doubt and assumed that he is just looking around on the bottom floor of the bus to maybe see if someone he knows is on the bus or something and actually isn't just staring at me, but my suspicions were once again raised when I started noticing that I could see him staring down at me from his seat on the top floor of the bus at I wait to get on the bus at my stop every morning.

I understand that I might just be overreacting and there may be a positive explanation for this or he might just be socially awkward and might just be accidentally staring at me because I tend to do that sometimes. However, this has been going on for over 2 months now and I just feel very uncomfortable in his presence. There is not a chance that he might like me while thinking that I'm an adult as I wear a school uniform, indicating that I'm under 18.

631,"So I just want your opinions on this.

I have a full-time corporate job and make pretty good money. I could afford to rent a nice apartment on my own. I currently live with my boyfriend of 2 years in his apartment.

He works full -time (8-10 hours a day) for his parents, and their way of paying him is letting him live in one of the apartments they own for free. They also send him like $50 to $100 a week, so he can buy groceries. I guess it's nice of them, but he generates a lot of income for them, and they don't even spend 5% of it on him. I know that he will inherit these things eventually, but not for another 20 years or more, and if it weren't for him, they would need to actually hire someone to do what he does and pay them an actual salary.

Next month they are moving out of their current house, and want us to move into it. I'm kind of uncomfortable with this because I'll be living in someone's house, it won't feel like my own place. Of course, I'm very grateful to have the opportunity to live somewhere for pretty much free, but I just don't know if it's worth it. The place is very dated, it's a 100 yo house that hasn't been renovated in over 20 years. The parents want to leave everything there, from furniture to bedding to silverware. I don't want it. I already know I can't put any of my money into (some much needed) renovations, and my boyfriend thinks that we don't need to change a thing. 

I decided to compromise and agree to leave everything as is, the only thing I wanted to do is to re-do the living room. It's very dark and old-fashioned (dark brown chesterfield couches, ""antique"" furniture, not ideal for a young couple). The parents agreed to take the living room furniture with them and put it in their basement. 

 I set aside around $3,000-$4,000 for a new couch, coffee table, rug, and all of that, so I could feel like the place is at least a little ""me"". 

I talked to my boyfriend, and he offered to get one of the little coffee tables, it was $160 (on sale for $120 on Black Friday) which was nice, but his parents would have had to be the ones to buy it since he has no real income. They said no, and told him to keep their current coffee table because ""it's still good"". It's not an issue for me to buy it, but ""they don't think it's a good idea"". 

I feel like this was my breaking point, it's hard to date someone who's an adult and can't even buy a small coffee table. And I don't love the idea of living in his parents' home, since they're all clearly very attached to the place, and will be getting mad at me for touching/changing anything (and I really don't want to live there long-term the way it is now).

I've talked to my boyfriend about all these issues multiple times, and he just tells me not to worry and that it will be ""our place"".

I feel bad, but if I don't move in there it will be weird to continue dating, and I love him and don't want to break up, but this whole situation is starting to take a toll on me.

There's this one guy who gets on the bus at the stop before me; he's roughly 35? years old, white, 5ft9ish, slightly overweight. He's gotten on the same bus as me for over a year now, which isn't that much of a problem but I've always just had a bad gut feeling about him. Recently, he has been sitting on the top floor of the bus every morning (I live in the UK so our public buses are double-deckered)  and when he comes down the stairs to get off the bus a few stops before I do, he just stares at me for an uncomfortable length of time.

I originally gave him the benefit of the doubt and assumed that he is just looking around on the bottom floor of the bus to maybe see if someone he knows is on the bus or something and actually isn't just staring at me, but my suspicions were once again raised when I started noticing that I could see him staring down at me from his seat on the top floor of the bus at I wait to get on the bus at my stop every morning.

I understand that I might just be overreacting and there may be a positive explanation for this or he might just be socially awkward and might just be accidentally staring at me because I tend to do that sometimes. However, this has been going on for over 2 months now and I just feel very uncomfortable in his presence. There is not a chance that he might like me while thinking that I'm an adult as I wear a school uniform, indicating that I'm under 18. I don't really think that there's much I can do as he hasn't approached me or tried to talk to me; I'm just a bit uncomfortable. Any advice would be appreciated.",28Nov2020,1

637,"So I was dating this guy about 2 years ago. Well dating is kind of a stretch. We were friends and one day he said he's in love in me. I wasn't in love with him but I didn't want to lose a friend. I was and still am a people pleasure,  I have social anxiety and at that time I was suffering from depression. So after he said if I didn't feel it after some time we could go back to being normal I agreed. Well I didn't feel it. He changed the moment I agreed to go out with him. He wanted me for himself, got angry at me when I wanted to spend time with my friends. I felt really uncomfortable in his presence and slowly started noticing that we have little in common. And he was telling me creepy shit like I could hold you down and do whatever I want, sent me gore videos even though he knew it made me extremely uncomfortable and raised my anxiety. At the same time he would tell me like I'm an angel to him, how I make his life better. But he lied to me all the time and found it funny to make me believe he's suicidal. So I finally broke up with him. And the first week was fine. A little weird but fine. Then one day he started threatening me. He didn't know where I lived exactly but said (texted) things like ""I'm gonna find you and me and my friends gonna have a little fun with you"" or ""Do you think you're a good person? You ruined my life! I can't love anymore because of you!"" I was scared and crying and if not one of my friends I don't know what would I do. He talked to him and make him give me some space and time. I blocked him on everything Snapchat, Facebook, discord, steam I blocked his number. But it didn't stop him, he called me from different numbers. Joined discord servers he knew I am still a part of. And that was about two years ago. This year once again he send me a message saying he changed, he wanted to talk, resolve this whole thing, that it would help him. But I moved on long ago and have a loving boyfriend and I don't want to go through this again. But I kinda still feel bad for not wanting to talk to him. What's your take on that?

641,"I'm a 17 yo white female, and I'm trying to write a book. Ever since I started creating this story and world, I've had the ideas for each character practically cemented in my mind. As backstory, the book is about a group of teenagers who are trying to solve the many disappearances of their town. These dissapearences have been happening for 4 years, and the main characters believe the government and police are getting nowhere. Some of these characters have always, in my mind, been POC. I don't really know why, but when imagining the story, these characters came from different backgrounds. These characters live in a small town, but I still believe that these characters would live there. (I live in a small town and there are a ton of kids my age with different cultural backgrounds, so I feel like it could also make sense for the characters in my story to also have different backgrounds). My main characters are a Japanese-American girl named Shae, Shae's older sister Lanie, an African-American girl named Delia, and Caucasian characters Maya, Greyson, Atlas (brother) and Katherine (sister). My problem lies in the fact that I don't want to write these characters incorrectly. Obviously, I don't have the same experiences as a POC would, so I don't want to speak for them. However, I still would like to incorporate these characters. While doing research about it, I have found to stay away from stereotypes, cliches, and things like AAVE or basic accents. I have also read that race needs to be incorporated realistically without feeding into racism, while still allowing for the characters themselves to be fully developed and have morals/goals (understandable, and also, I feel, kind of the bare minimum). I was wondering what kind of culturally represented characters any reddit users have always wanted to see for themselves in media, and also any advice you may have moving forward with this project. I would especially like input from POC users, as it is about making the characters genuine and realistic, but I could also take advice from any non-POC users who have experience with this as well :) Thank you! 
P.s I am really sorry if any of this comes off as racist or wrong in any way, please call me out on it if it is!",28Nov2020,1

645," My ex-gf broke up with me a few days ago on our 4th year anniversary, i'm 24.  
The reason why i think she did it is because we're just overall very different people. She's extremely consciencious while i'm low on it, she's extremely socially awkward and has 0 good friends while i'm very social and have various circles of good long-lasting friends. I was her only support for a very long time and she thought that she needed to cut me out to learn to deal with shit on her own.

Also i'm kind of a mess, i'm just now nearly finishing my high school degree due to heavy depression and light substance abuse in the past while she's 23 and has been working as a nurse for a little over a year now, she has her shit together, i don't. I'm much closer to having it than i used to a few years ago, will probably enter uni next year and get a degree in computer science, but i would be poor and busy for 3 years while she just wants to enjoy life, travel, etc.

This has always been an issue in our relationship, i always feared she wouldn't wait for me, and apparently she just doesn't quite love me the way she did before, so she ended things off.

I switched my weed addiction to alcohol, i usually have a drink too many when i have too much on my plate at work, home or school, tho i have it sort of under control, i'm going to AA meetings just to make sure i keep it under wraps, i don't get drunk, tho i have a beer or two every now and then.

So yea, i'm a mess, and the fact that not even she could love me crushes my self-esteem. I'm also very ugly even tho i have been with a decent amount of women in the past, i feel at my age women just want someone with their shit together. I fear i will be single for a long time if not ever.

I'm not drinking to deal with this breakup which is a good sign, i feel it would just make it worse. I have my ups and downs throughout the day, but at night when the anti-depressants wear off i just feel really sad and i don't know how to deal with it.

I really thought she was the one, this made me lose faith in relationships and myself. And since i'm at a very difficult period in my life where i'm being overworked at my job and school, i'm starting to fall down the pit again and lose progress in my recovery.

So long story short, how do i deal with such a break-up?",28Nov2020,1

656,"Hi all,

First, cw: depression, mental illness, child abuse

I have a very tumultuous relationship with my mother, to say the least. I'm mentally ill, she's mentally ill, lots of covert narcissism and abuse, her parents abused her too (and one of them is mentally ill, they're both still alive.)  I'm sure you've heard it all before.

Recently, I came to realize I'm still insanely angry that after my mother was cheated on, she decided to neglect me for several months as a 10 year old boy. I remember walking into my mom's bedroom and all she would do was stare in bed. For months it was like this. It's funny, because I ended up doing the exact same thing 7 years later when my depression started to manifest as sadness instead of anger. Hahaha. Anyways.

When I was a boy, I thought I was responsible for my mom feeling this way. I thought it was my fault my mom didn't love me anymore, because she was so busy sitting in bed and staring at the fucking ceiling all day. Obviously, she was a victim from the prick, but you know what? I'm still mad at her. At this age, I lost all my friends and I was acting out a lot. I was literally alone and started to withdraw to the Internet to get any form of social interaction. I was exhibiting what I now know to be signs of depression. All I needed was the one person who was supposed to take care of me to, you know, take care of me.

But she didn't.

I actually think this traumatized me to the point where I was, am, and always will be scared to enter a committed relationship. Why would I ever give someone this much power over me? Enough power for me to neglect my child? I'm mad at her for having me in general, she didn't have to, but my God, imagine being a 48 year old single mother with a 10 year old son and doing this shit.

I haven't been a perfect son either, I don't want anyone calling me a ""poor victim"" or anything. I've fucked up too. At this point, I think the only proper thing to do is to go No Contact, because I truly don't think there's anything that can be done to salvage the relationship. But I want to be able to salvage it, because deep down, I will always love my mother. I'll always feel bad for her because she's also a victim of abuse, objectively worse abuse than whatever I experienced from her (not to excuse her actions, just to say she was called a ""whore"" for having her first period, got physically abused by her parents, among other things that I never had to go through and that I'm not going to share on Reddit.)

And before you say ""go to therapy"", YES, BOTH of us have been in therapy, including family therapy. I've been in therapy since I was 8, if I hear one more person on Reddit assume I haven't been in therapy before I'm going to flip my shit.

665,"It's a bit of a long story, but I set a carton of milk on the floor for just one minute. I came back and my cat had knocked it over, spilling most of its contents. Most of it seems to have gone into the carpet, but to my horror it also went into the register.

I took the cover off and wiped it as clean as I could inside, but as far as I could reach I was still wiping up chocolate milk. I improvised a snake tool with a cloth , hose, and duct tape and got a lot more of it. But I can only feed the hose a few feet longer than I can reach, and the cloth still comes out with chocolate milk.

Logic says to me I've gotten most of it as it wasn't a large carton and the carpet appears to have absorbed most of what was spilled.

It rlly hurts, being alone on the day you should be celebrating and having your own mother go away for the whole day instead of at least taking me with her, I’d be completely fine with it, but my cousin does it on important events for me and constantly says horrible stuff to me when my mam isn’t looking or shoves me when I’m near her. 

Do I sound selfish? If so, I’ll just try my best to help her, it’s just so hard to be alone for the third year in a row. If not, should I explain to my mam how I feel?",28Nov2020,1
673,"Please keep in mind all these interactions happened on discord 

I have a person that I’m online friends (we’re going to call them person 1) with they have sent me photos of themselves but he kind of disappeared a month ago. About a week ago there was a guy with a pretty deep voice (we’ll call him person 2) completely different from person 1s voice but I just wrote it off as him just going through puberty and his voice changed with a new account. Person 2 sent me a photo of himself and I mentioned how we have met before and how he changed his username so I didn’t recognize him (he didn’t but I thought he did) The “picture of him” was actually a photo of person 1 but the picture was obviously just a picture of a computer screen with the picture on it. The picture was on Snapchat so I thought he just really liked the photo of himself and couldn’t get an original copy so he just took a photo of the photo. But then person 2 started to act really sus, he didn’t remember anything that we talked about and I started to become more and more sus so I started questioning him about his name, age, race, and his opinion on things. Person 2 kept saying he was 13 then 17 then said he wasn’t sure, it’s pretty weird to not know your own age right? Then told me that he was Korean and only spoke Korean and English which makes no sense since I knew for a fact that he was a different race and that when I asked him to say his Korean name (which I knew) he could barely tell me much less pronounce it (also sus that he can’t pronunce his own name in his native language) I asked him about the photo he sent and he unsent the “photo of himself” which is extremely sus and send another photo who was a completely different person. So I’m pretty sure that person 2 is pretending to be person 1 but now I’m not sure what to do about it

TL;DR Person 2 is impersonating Person 1 and when I questioned person 2 about it he could barely tell me his age and name.",28Nov2020,1

679,"I’m 21F, so is my friend. We met when I was living in her country on a student visa, and we dated pretty much the whole time. It expired around this time last year and I moved home, so we broke up but remained friends. She’s still an important person to me and I had plans to come back this summer to see her, but border closures made this impossible. 

She confided in me yesterday that she has been experiencing severe mental health problems to the point where she considered self harm or worse. She was afraid of being committed and doesn’t want to speak to anyone about it, but knows she should. I’m the only person she has told since we know so much about each other and she trusts me, but I don’t feel like I can do anything because I don’t live in her country anymore.

680,"I'm an American citizen currently living in Toronto Canada, I've been here now 9 almost 10 years. For all intents and purposes, as it stands I plan to live the remainder of my life in canada. Moving back to the USA is an option but not anytime soon.

In Canada we have banking accounts that help Canadians grow their wealth legit tax free (called a TFSA or tax free savings account) the only time you can get taxed there is if you contribute more than your total allowance per year and all time. 

And another called an rsp or RRSP which is a (registered) retirement plan where they money you contribute each year is used to lower your income level so you pay less taxes now but pay them back later down the line when you withdraw.

Now the IRS doesn't care about any of the Canadian banking programs like the ones I listed above, if you make money in those accounts and increase your buying power you pay taxes, you pay taxes on every freaking thing. Now I've gotten into the stock market and simply put I've been doing very well thank god. The only downside is any time I sell or close an option trade and make money on the transaction I get taxed by the USA. I don't want to pay taxes in the USA, I cant grow my capital without paying taxes and it really sucks and it's kind of discouraging me from wanting to do option trading or even sell any od my stock positions cuz I really hate taxes.

Bottom line other than taxes is there any value to remaining a USA citizen? Is there benefits to being a USA citizen outside of the USA itself? Or if I can make my life here in Canada is canceling my USA citizenship worth it?",28Nov2020,1

He didn’t let anybody in our family know that he hasn’t been paying the house bills as much, even our water bill has gone up to $800, he has been packing his bags for months acting like he’s only gonna be there for the holidays but hardly even contacts me anymore. 

So god damn one track minded. The cost of our mortgage has gone up each month he hasn’t paid. It’s went from $1000 to over $12,000 now. My mom and sis found his bills since they’re here for thanksgiving until Sunday. They told me all this yesterday and even they have no idea what they’re gonna do. Only advice my sis has for me is to “focus on improving myself”. Gee, thanks sis.

I wanna blow his phone up and give him the third degree on why the fuck he hasn’t paid the damn mortgage or at least let me know ahead of time why he hasn’t but my mom told me I shouldn’t bother. Knowing that he’ll most likely lie some more or change the subject to talk about my own short comings. Unfortunately, she’s right. But I still need advice on what I should do.

Right now, I’m a junior in college who’s taking a break for now. I do want to finish one day, I’m just trying to find a school that would let me take communication courses online.

686," When do you know it is abuse? My parents and I have been discussing and fighting for some time. I’m going through some difficult time in my life, they think I don’t study enough, and I’m not using well my opportunities, and they say they want to see me succeed and they get angry because I’m incredibly talented and other stuff. (I also think I have depression, but they won’t let me go to a therapist, but that is a whole different story). We just moved to the US before lockdown, so we don’t really have friends or a life here, so we stay at home most of the day, and they have been getting increasingly angry about me not studying enough and being talented and all that shit. Today we had a fight, and my dad got really angry, he threatened me to hit me if I didn’t stopped making faces and disresepecting them (I get really annoyed at this speeches they give me and well that annoys them). I changed my face, but later as I was going to pee, I said something under my breath, my dad grabbed my arm really strong and said If I didn’t changed my attitude he was going to hit me and gave me 30 seconds. I said I understood, and he kept yelling my mom said I had understood and I went to pee. As I entered the bathroom she started yelling at my dad, and when I got out made my dad apologize and she told me that it was never okay for a man to hit me or threaten me. But then she said she was the only one allowed to hit me. When my mom gets angry she hit me but with an open palm, but sort of it has always happened. And if you ask me, is she who I am really afraid of. If I hear her footsteps and I’m doing something she wouldn’t like, my hearts start racing fast, and I get scared. But is also her who I am closest to. But when my mom told me the whole no man thing I just justified it, I tought my dad was angry and it was okay if he would have hit me because he was angry, and I made him angry by not studying. They are both amazing people, they love me and care for me, they go out of their way to make me happy, and when not fighting, I am usually laughing and ejoyign my time with them, but this situation made me really confused.

688,"About 4 years ago, around the time I started dating my common-law bf, I decided to finally change my name, as I've never liked it. Rather than legally do so, since it's expensive and a slow process, I decided just to start going by my preferred name. I introduce myself as it, put it on my resume (and put my legal first name as my middle name), and generally have never had any problems arise from it.   

However, when I met my bf I went by my legal name for about two weeks, so he first knew me as that. He was really good about switching though. EXCEPT when he introduced me to his family months later, he panicked and used my legal name (he's got social anxiety, and I was still getting used to using it myself so I felt weird correcting him in front of someone new). However, the next time I saw my FIL, I let him know my preferred name.  

Fast forward a couple years, and we end up moving back to my bfs home town. FIL calls me by my legal name, I correct him, and he seems to try to remember.   

Fast forward to covid, and we've ended up having to stay with him for a while. He's a bitter old fuck at the best of times, and thrives on conflict. I'm an easy target. So he's started to purposefully call me my legal name. I've asked him multiple times to use my preferred name, and it always causes weird tension for multiple days and nothing changes.   

It's gotten to the point where I ignore him if he uses my legal name. So he's started using it at the end of conversations, ie. I help him, he says ""blah blah blah thanks X 😊😊😊🐍""   

Which leaves me unable to ignore him, since the conversation is effectively over.    

My bf hates conflict, and won't go to bat for me (old issues, his dad is fucked obviously). I don't want to cause a bunch of drama, but this is really getting to me. What should I do? I've debated calling him by his middle name, but I don't want to be petty and sink to his level.   

He's hard to ignore, because he thrives off this shit so if I'm not reacting he'll push harder. Moving out isn't an option atm.

So my best friend (Tip) almost two months ago in early october broke up with her girlfriend (jay). me and jay knew each other and I had talked to her in the past on the phone before but just a little bit here and there. now when tip my best friend broke up with her me and jay started talking on the phone regularly for a about a month up until about a week ago and I’ll explain why we stopped. And I know it’s shitty of me to have even started talking to her but I knew the way she was getting treated and I felt bad for her. We’ve always been just friends but in the process of talking to her 24/7 I caught major feelings for her and I told her and tip about it. Me and jay were always just friends but we got really close in that time we talked. I really really love her. Now about a week into us talking about mid October tip found out and got really upset and mad which I completely understand and she told both of us stop talking to each other, but we both continuously lied to tip about us talking and said we weren’t, and I feel terrible about it. My connection to jay was so strong I lied to tip to continue talking to her ex. now about a week ago jay just started not talking to me like she was and I knew something was up. Now tip my best friend has a major crush on me and doesn’t like me talking to her ex, who she doesn’t even feel for anymore. I think tips more upset over the fact I chose to talk to jay instead of her more so than me talking to her ex so she told jay If she didn’t stop taking to me that they had no chance of ever getting back together so jay cut me off and completely traded me in. I miss her so much and now jay has me blocked on everything and doesn’t want anything to with me but I miss her so much my anxiety is awful to deal with when I don’t talk to her and I don’t know what to do.

My parents are Jehovah witnesses, and I was also when I was little. But throughout life, we've fallen off. My mom still strongly believes in being a jehovah witness, and has made it pretty clear to me that she doesnt like the fact that I'm still wanting to go to youth group in fear of me being ""influenced.""

My boyfriend insists that he's going to support me in whatever po ath I take, despite any potential problems that may face us in the future. But I know that he wants me to be a Christian. Obviously. Even though he supports me, I know he obviously would want me to believe the same thing he does. Who wouldnt? I feel a lot of pressure to do what will make things easy.

Ok so - there are six people in my house. Myself (16M) my mother, my dad, my 20 year old sister, 3 year old sister, and 12 year old brother. Basically my fathers been a drug addict all his life and it’s only been getting worse as we’ve been isolated. 

Since last year I’ve been finding needles and spoons all over the house (even heroin all over the toilet) and half of the time my dad is high on drugs (heroin and crack). He gets very drowsy, talks about random topics and doesn’t make sense. He stays up all night and I wake up to see the house destroyed and messy. My mother never gets to sleep because she waits until he goes asleep to clean up the mess. He puts us in danger by leaving the stove on (this being the main reason why my mother waits for him to go to sleep). Just the other night he was fidgeting with the heating system and electrocuted himself. I woke up to hear him screaming. He tears our room (I share a room with my brother) apart looking for money and leaves for hours after finding it. Which is usually hidden well. He would wake me and my brother up and talk without thinking. The crazy thing is when he wakes up the next morning without memory and when we tell him what he’s like he completely denies it and insists that we are plotting against him. He sold my brothers tv as well and my mother and sisters jewellery to buy drugs. 

We are all sick of him. My mother wants to leave him but can’t because we are 2 weeks away from living in a new home and this would only delay it as we were meant to move in last year but couldn’t due to COVID. He is hurting himself and everyone around him. We don’t deserve this. I’ve been taking pictures of things I found just in case I need to prove the things he does to a judge. What do we do???

Now that we have a 2mo I'm sure it'll be even worse. Without consulting me, even after knowing I didn't want them to help, he invited them to help us move into our house anyway! 

He is normally great about listening to me, but he's telling me we have no other options. We don't have many friends in the area and none that we'd honestly feel comfortable asking to help. He also says we can't get a uhaul because we're young and they'll jack up the price because of it (we're both under 25yo). I understand why he wants them to come up but with my severe anxiety, I just wish he wouldn't have told them before we talked about it.

I don't really know what I'm asking for, other than how to cope. Last time the IL's visited, I felt like the second women and my baby was his moms... she didn't want to give her up even when she was crying and hungry and obviously needing me. I'm a very non confrontational person, I really hate conflict as it gives me even more anxiety where I can faint. I don't need my baby to witness that..",28Nov2020,1
712,"Hello, so I have a four year old daughter and a two month old daughter. Before becoming pregnant with my youngest, my four year old went to school and we did fun activities, etc. When I became pregnant is when the pandemic really started and I lost my job and our state completely shut down. Since then she has been incredibly bored, but she made a friend who would play with her like every day. The friend has since moved with her family solely because of how our state has responded to the pandemic. Now she is obviously depressed, staring at the screens and playing sometimes with toys cause there is literally nothing else for us to do with her. My fiancé works over full time since I lost my job so he doesn’t have free time really and all activities are closed for me to take her to. It breaks my heart to see her like this. 

Now my parents. I had my four year old at 17, and they were basically her father figure (until my fiancé came in the picture at one year old) and had been extremely close with her until they moved back to our home state which is across the USA a year ago. My four year old always asks when we’re going to see them again, how she misses them, etc. and my parents miss her to death as well. 

I want to have my daughter go stay with them until we can move home (about five months) solely because they could bring her happiness through activities and places to go (our home state has pretty much no limitations foe the pandemic except masks) and both my fiancé and mine’s whole families are in the state so she would never be without buddies. My parents were over the moon when I asked if they would like that and 100% want her to. The longest I’ve been away from her is a week and I cried the whole time, and she is very attached to me and usually ends up asking for me after a few hours being apart from me. It would break my heart but I feel that she would have a better childhood with them until we can move back.

717,"All right guys, I am starting to think I have bit off more than a can chew.  My daughter has a friend she has been close to for the past several years. The mother contacted me mid November sayin she had 10 days to be out of her home. She is 52f, has 3 kids under 14 years old, 1 girl and 2 boys. I have realised she is a hoarder, and has a severe shopping problem. Anytime I have tried to help her, she has an excuse for everything people, I mean EVERYTHING! she only works 16 hours a week, yet when I helped her move she had STACKS of brand new clothing and merchandise with the tags still on it. I am talking thousands of dollars. I had a very traumatic childhood, which has caused me to go overboard when it comes to kids. These kids were looking to me with desperation, they had no faith in their mother. It has been 3 weeks, I have gotten in several arguments with their mom when I hear her screaming at those kids, saying awful things.  I mean awful. I feel like I thought in the beginning I could help her be a better mother, but the more I try to help, the more she fights to justify every single thing I  bring up. I am so worried about these kids, and cannot afford to just take them all in, yet I could not live with myself if they went into the system. The only other family they have is a sever alcoholic grandmother and an aunt across the country they barely know. I attache a video took of her house that I took the day I helped her move. So what you see is how her house always looked. it wasn't just because of the move.",28Nov2020,1
718,"Ex and I were together for 8 years, we have a 2 year old son. About a week ago, ex broke up with me. I packed my belongings and moved back to my parents house. I just got into the biggest fight with my dad. I told him to stop getting into my problems and to start minding his business. He declined my request and proceeded to say “I’m going to get into your problems” . I said my problems are none of your business. I am an adult so I can handle my problems by myself. I don’t need your help. You have raised me the best you could until I left the house. At this rate, we got into an argument. I said I’ve had it with my mom, my sister and you. All you guys ever do is bring up my problems. It’s already enough I’m dealing with a lot of stuff on my own and I’m trying to be the best parent I can be to my son. Remind you my dad has a 1 year old daughter with another woman. I told him you worry about your daughter and I’ll worry about my son. Dad, I don’t need you. Your daughter needs you. He says no she doesn’t. I say that’s really sad for you to say that. It’s ignorant of you. He says those are not your problems. I say then if you don’t like me getting into your problems then don’t get into mine. I say leave my room and leave me alone. He left. I closed my blinds, locked my door and started crying on my bed.

721,"I (F/23) have struggled with depression for almost 11 years. I was sexually abused when I was 12 years old and my parents didn’t have a very good marriage. Somehow, I ended up being in abusive relationships and self medicated using alcohol and drugs. 
This year, I met the love of my life and I decided to get sober. I quit alcohol and smoking pot in September and everything was going great. I was really happy. I had healthy friendships and a healthy relationship for the first time in my entire life (or at least I thought so). I had a job and I was eating healthy and on my way to achieve my fitness goals. 
I work as a freelance video editor and as a part time graphic designer. 
On Monday I got a call from one of my clients telling me that they wouldn’t pay me extra just because I spent the entire weekend working on their project. 
On Tuesday my boyfriend called me from prison and told me that he’s been arrested. 
On Wednesday, my boyfriend called me again to tell me that he has been arrested for having downloaded illegal child porn. And I can’t see h or talk to him for 2 weeks because he has to quarantine (thanks to covid)
On Thursday, my boss (from the part time job I had), told me they are going to fire me because they can’t afford to pay me. 
I broke down and and spent the whole Friday drinking. 
Later in the day, my best friend (M/23) came to my house and instead of supporting me or being there for me, he tried to have sex with me the entire night. We were really drunk. I kept crying and pushing him away and begged him to not touch me but he didn’t stop. I blacked out after a while. I asked him to fuck off and that I never wanted to see him again the next morning. 

My other friends decided to go to see him (because apparently he’s very depressed and needs support) but failed to come to see me. 

In a week, I lost everything that I had. I lost my job, my boyfriend, my friends and my sobriety.

722,"So lately I've started playing Minecraft with some friends and one of them invited over to a voice chat some of his friends that were new to me. We played for some time and then I left.

The thing is that it wasn't her, and the conversation started getting more and more akward, she asked about how I thought that it was her and I said that it was because of her voice, right there I fu**ed up because now she thinks that I am obsessed with her, but in a stalker way, so what do you think I should do?

723,"TLDR: ex boyfriend in a different state will not stop harassing me and his ex/my current girlfriend online no matter what we do. Need advice on what I can do in this situation, what kind of ways can I block him, is there something legal that I can do, or are we shit out of luck

Side note: the stalker is my current GF’s ex partner. They had dated for 2.5 months before my girlfriend broke it off with this person early this year and has actively avoided them online and in person since.

Around June, I started talking to what would become my current GF. We both have similar tastes in music we like, personality traits and overall make each other feel comfortable after both having gone through toxic relationships. The issue we faced was we were half way cross the country from one another, but luckily through the opportunities that we have we are able to see each other often. The first time this was going to happen took place in August and she came to me.

During this time, I started getting weird instagram accounts of people I’ve never knew following me. They began sending messages talking to me like normal. Then, out of nowhere, begin talking about my current GF. I immediately send this over to her and she explains that the person messaging me was her former boyfriend. Somehow, probably after having tagged me in a story, this user began using alts to follow both of us, talk to us pretending to be other people, trying to manipulate me into not seeing my soon-to-be girlfriend, etc. I do the rational thing and just block them and keep moving forward with our planned meetup. She apologies about it and explains she has kept her distance from this person since their break-up and have done everything in their power to be rid of them, especially because he now lives in a different state.

Once the day arrives for our meetup, an hour before I see her, I get a strange phone call from an purposefully hidden number. The other person on the end made a very vague threat in the form of a movie quote (specifically from Scream) saying that my life was in danger. This person proceeds to call me 5 more times before giving up. I talk to my GF when I meet her about it and explain that I believe it was him. My only guess as to how he found my number was because he looked me up and found me on some public records or found my number attached to my socials. I’ve since erased my number from my socials and I asked her for his number in case he ever calls now to avoid bullshit like that again.

Over the next couple of months, beyond our relationship really going well for a long distance one, we’ve had to deal with this guy. Every time we block this guy, he comes up with another alt account not even just through instagram, but through multiple platforms. No matter what we do, blocked numbers, blocked emails, blocked social accounts he will not stop sending both me and her messages, both harassing us and asking my girlfriend for forgiveness. We have told him on multiple occasions to leave us alone but continues to hope he and her will get back together. We come to find out he’s been doing this with multiple past relationships with a friend of his helping along with it. Today of all days was the last straw in it.

For the last week, he’s mentioned that he’s went to rehab, got sober, is solely focusing on his current relationship (YES THE DUDE HAS ANOTHER GF WHILE DOING THIS STUFF), and would just like to reach out and apologies, but we aren’t having it. We argue with him about how he knows he’s wronged us, yet continues to keep trying to reach us both, insulted him, and told him to fuck off. He begins to play the victim saying that I started this all with comments I made, but we kept our ground and after one final message blocked him again.

At this point, I don’t believe anything about what this person says and with how active he is, he will continue to harass both me and my girlfriend until the day he dies. I also don’t trust him in keeping this online only, if he’s gone this far in effort making alts and talking to us what’s stopping him from showing up on mine or hers doorstep?

725,"Hi everyone, 

I’m in desperate need of advice, so anything would help. 

I[23F] am divorcing my[29M] husband. The reason for the divorce is due to years of extreme emotional and verbal abuse from him and physical intimidation as well. We have two small kids and I didn’t want them witnessing anymore of that and growing up in that type of environment. I still haven’t filed yet, as I’ve been doing my research trying to find the best ways to protect me and my vulnerable children. But he doesn’t live with us anymore. 

There is a lot of history but here is what happened today, during this last hour:

He wants to come over tomorrow. I originally told him that Sunday won’t work for us, but he could come over tonight or Monday. He wasn’t having it, so I came to a comprise and said we could do 7pm on Sunday (an hour before the kids go to bed.)

He called me and started asking me what it was that I had going on tomorrow and that he had a right to know what was going on in his kids lives. He started asking why he couldn’t come at 6pm instead and was demanding to know what was going on. I told him that we already had plans for the day and earlier than 7 would not work. I kindly told him that he needed to respect my boundaries and that if I told him a certain time/day wouldn’t work, it needed to be left at that. I also told him that I don’t like how he’s talking to me. He then out nowhere said “well I don’t like that I have to pay $1800 to get the car out of the lot but I’m doing it anyway.” I got into an accident and the car has been at the lot.. that’s what he’s referring to and I have no idea what it has to do with our conversation. He says stuff like this often to make feel guilty about something. 

I then told him that he was being irrational and needed to stop. He then said no, that he was coming at 6, and that I didn’t have a say in it. He mentioned that we’re still married, and that he still has keys to the apartment and he’ll be coming at 6. If I didn’t like that, he said I could call the cops and they’ll do nothing but laugh in my face. 

He then hung up on me and sent me a text saying “If you’re seeing some guy or some shit I could care less. But I have a right to know what’s going on in the kids lives. Also you’re not their sole guardian, we’re technically still married and when we get divorced I’m going to fight for time with them. You don’t get to determine if I ever get to see them.”

I’m just so fed up and feel defeated. I don’t know what to do. Sorry if this is all over the place. Any advice is appreciated.

Another colleague recently found out that this guy was convicted of child abuse and served time in prison for this. This was a complete shock to myself and my colleague who both considered him to be a pleasant and likeable, yet lonely old man.

The information about his crimes is easily found online and it's left us feeling very awkward about interacting with him. After all, we are at work so can't really be calling him out on this or mentioning it at all. We feel uneasy about chatting with him since we found this out.

738,"Hi. I was recently overdrawn with my bank by -£118.33 due to 2 unauthorised transactions through my PayPal account. Only one of these unauthorised transactions from my PayPal had shown up on my bank statement,this was on the 23/11/20 PayPal Payment £254.98. 
This Payment was made on PayPal on the 18/11/20. 

The second transaction made from my PayPal hadn’t shown up on my bank statement, but according to PayPal the funds were withdrawn from my account. This was made on the 19/11/20 totalling £239.98. 
There is  a fraud investigation ongoing. I hope so anyway. I did contact my local police to give them details on dates,times,seller information etc on PayPal and the address the goods purchased were sent to in the u.k(which I don’t live in the u.k) The fraudsters were using my name just a different address. 

PayPal have emailed me saying they will refund these unauthorised transactions made! but I’m not sure if I’m entitled to the full amount which would be £494.96 because one of the transactions hadn’t shown up on my bank statement? I also believe I haven’t been refunded the full amount of the transaction that did show up on my statement which was the £254.98 transaction. Was this because some was taken because of the overdraw with my bank which was no fault of my own? when the overdraw was resolved I only had £130 in my account not the £254.98. 

I removed my debit card from PayPal and also contacted them by phone the day I noticed these transactions. They changed my email address I used for my account as it had been compromised, to a new one I had setup,and I made a new password. My bank account number is still linked to my PayPal account.

when I logged into my PayPal yesterday I noticed they had refunded both transactions to my PayPal account and then transferred funds to my bank account. But I don’t believe they have I see nothing on my statements saying otherwise. Im also now overdrawn with them(PayPal) by -£494.96. I have tried speaking to them but I was getting nowhere as I can not get back into my PayPal account again! because the two factor authentication has been disabled and that was the only way I could get in previously. When I enter my email and password,there is no option to be sent  a code by sms. Instead I get some sort of enter authenticator code which I never set up in the first place. 

I just want to shutdown my PayPal account completely and be done with it! but I’m not too sure if I should at this stage or not? because of this overdraw and the possibility of not getting the refund they said they would issue too me. Am I now in debt with PayPal? 

I have been issued a new debit card by my bank which should be arriving shortly,probably Monday. I will not be putting this new card back on PayPal! but can paypal still transfer funds to my bank? Have I just gotta wait longer until the funds have been sent to my account?

PayPal have been pretty unhelpful in this situation and I’ll contact my bank tomorrow and see what’s going on but they’ll probably ask me to speak with PayPal again! just going round in circles.

During college, I had many internships and even worked for a well-known TV Station in NYC. I thought this would make me stand out, however, I’ve had no luck. I know the economy is bad rn, but I feel like journalism jobs should be in more demand at a time like this, no? Ive applied to so many and I’m not getting any interviews. Do you think my major is holding me back a bit? Maybe they consider Journalism majors more qualified?

This  is my first post ever because I usually never talk about any of my  problems but i am so overwhelmed atm that I don't know what else to do.

So  a little back ground My girlfriend and I have been dating for nearly a  year at this point and everything has been amazing. I haven't felt this  good in my entire life and so she said about the same about herself. She  ended up moving in almost four months in Everything had been going good  until I started drinking after 10 years sobriety because I thought I  could handle it by now not knowing how powerful Alcoholism can be. On  top of both myself and her having our own mental health issues I had not  realize the hell I was putting her through. Fast forward several months  later and I find that she was flirting with her ex saying things like  ""i miss your arms"" and "" miss your bed"". I confronted her about the  message. She was right in the sense that I did snoop when i found those  texts. So I am aware I am the asshole in that regard. Even still we  talked through it from Wednesday night until last night we decided that  having some time apart would be good. We agreed that I will go back to  my mental health plan and seek a counselor. she said she was going to do  the same she has been over whelmed with college and my issues over the  past several months. She said she was going to stop talking to her ex  and be there with me when i start counseling again.  We also dumped all  the alcohol in the apartment and pledged to abstain from this point  fourth.

Today  I just dropped her off at her parents for a what she says for ""couple  of days"" but I can't help shake the feeling something bad is going to  happen. I do have PTSD/Anxiety/ and major depressive disorder so part of  my thinks the feeling of these paranoid thoughts are just stemming from  those issues. But no matter how many times she re assures me that  everything is okay and that this is just a rough patch and that we hit a  wall but she's willing to work through it. I cant help shake the  feeling that she'll either cheat on me or that she'll leave me. We do  have a plan for the next couple of days to not only keep me occupied so I  don't get too lonely but for my lead up to my initial on phone  appointment with the psychiatrist. I'm just really confused and could  use some advice to saving this relationship.

748,"\[Sorry for the length! Also, this is my first post ever, so I apologize for any formatting/etc. errors.\]

I (19f) am a freshman in college and live in a flat with two roommates (18f and 20f). I've been living away from home since early September and am a plane ride away from my family and friends. My classes are all online, the place where I live is in a Covid-19 lockdown, and I've been struggling with social anxiety ever since I moved here, so making friends has been really difficult for me. I eventually decided it was easiest to just hang out with my roommates and their friends, since they already had an established friend group full of perfectly nice people. 

The thing is, this friend group drinks, smokes a lot of weed, and does other drugs. Today, all of them except me were tripping on acid, which really concerned me\*\*. I have always valued my grades and never drank or did drugs in high school, but since moving away for college, I've gotten drunk a couple of times and smoked weed once. One of the people in my roommates' friend group offered me the weed-- he wasn't peer pressuring me or anything, but I decided of my own accord to try it. It wasn't a bad experience, but I don't plan on doing it again because I fear addiction. I also fear that I'll feel compelled to try other drugs if I keep hanging out with these people. (\*\*Just for clarification, I have no problem with alcohol use (as long as it's responsible) and am even okay with responsible weed use. It was the tripping on acid that I'm not at all comfortable with.) 

I think I should leave this friend group and find new friends who are like me and don't do drugs, but I have NO idea how to make this happen because of the pandemic and its restrictions combined with my social anxiety. I feel like if I stop talking to these people, then I'll just go back to sitting in my room alone all the time feeling lonely and depressed. Right now, I've kind of just been casually hanging out with these people to get in some social interaction, but I feel like it's a bad idea to be around them at all because of their drug use.

Should I stick it out with this friend group for now, wait until the lockdown is over, and hope I find a new friend group somewhat easily afterwards? Or should I cut these people off now, even if it means I will have no friends? Or is there a better solution? Please advise!",28Nov2020,1

The thing is, i thought i'd feel great being with her again, but i was wrong. My feelings are slowly fading away everyday, and i realised that i felt better on that time when i was by myself.

I'm a 19 year old college student pursuing a career path that my parents chose for me. At first, I never had a problem with it considering that nothing really interested me career-wise and thought it would do me some good. Then, my grades started to slip and everything just went downhill from there. To go through my parents' career plan, I have to get accepted into the program and I have already been rejected once. My parents made me retake at least half of my classes and I just stopped trying. There just wasn't any juice in me. I told my parents how I felt about it and they asked me what I wanted to do. I couldn't answer the question.

My parents told me that I just need to work harder. They know that I'm capable of doings things. It's just that I don't have that drive anymore for some reason. I have become lazy and I don't know how to turn it around. My parents recognize my motivation issues but don't know how to motivate me. They suggested paying me 200$ for every A I got in my college classes but I felt like that wouldn't work since I already live comfortably without money. They even suggested to rent out an apartment for me to see if I'll do better in an environment without them! I think that living by myself will show me responsibility and give me some motivation but I don't want them spoiling me like that. 

Anyways, I just don't know what to do anymore. I have no five-year plan. Hell, I don't even have a week's plan. I just sit up in my room all day and do chores for my parents. It sucks knowing that I have no value to society or myself.

For context, we’re in that sweet section of the middle class where either candidate would be a decent option. I understand it was much more high stakes for others, but my sister doesn’t realize that. My sister has, unfortunately, made her political identity her main identity and other parts of her character are faltering. As I said, our lives didn’t drastically change from one administration to another. She won’t refer to Biden as the president elect and always deflects any conversation we have about him and his plans. For instance, we were trying to figure out his cabinet, and she couldn’t get far before saying “well it doesn’t matter since we don’t know who has won.” She’s even mad at the Trump administration beginning the transition process.

My parents were worried and when they found them, they supported her decision to move out as long as she was safe.

I wanna blame it on being kinda long distance (had to go 2 months without seeing him *twice* since March cos COVID restrictions).

771,"**Hi,** ***upfront:*** ***I really like my brother, we can hang out and we are very good friends.***

My brother and i always played games on PC. All my friends dont play games, or they just play FIFA and nothing else. 2 Years ago i started playing DayZ and i got my brother to play with me. He liked the game but when he died he really got mad and quit the game.

He stopped playing for some days and then he came back. When we played the next time together, he was leading me through the map and we found so many poeple, it was really fun and i thought thats the greatest DayZ session ive ever had. When we played the following day we also met numerous poeple in a really quick time and he found so many guns...

I thought thats weird and asked him about it. After some time he admit that he cheated. He had a radar which showd him where poeple were, or where the loot was. 

I did not like that but i kept playing with him, cause i thought at least its no aimbot. After some sessions i even liked that he had a radar and when we played we had ""instant action"", because he knew where to go. 

But after a few days something happend: The game was boring af. Having a radar takes away the ""fear factor"", it takes away the unknown threat that is out there in dayz. It takes away the need to search for loot. For example we would start and loot up, run to the next city and while you are thinking "" i hope ill find bullets for my gun"" my brother will tell you : Lets move on there are no bullets, there is nothing good in this city. So you think : ""Whats the point?""

So after that Dayz was very boring to me and i stopped playing it.  I searched for similar games and downloaded Rust and i loved it, but i couldnt get him to play it with me. Without even playing it he said to me: ""Its a kids game, only streamer play it and the graphics look like comic. I want a realistic shooter like DayZ"" I couldnt understand, because it was so good, in my opinion better than DayZ, because it had quick base building and more objectives to follow. Those were things that we dreamd about in DayZ.

I played and had some fun but after a while i stopped playing it because i had no one to play with me and i couldnt get my brother to play with me.

Then i saw Escape From Tarkov and it blew my mind. It looked like a way better DayZ and i hopped on to that game. It was very different from DayZ, it was faster and also here you had vendor mission, so you really had an objective to play. It was more realistic, had way better animations and just way more things that added to the combat play. It wasnt a better DayZ. Tarkov was the better game, but a slightly different one.

I thought to myself: YES! Finally a game which fills all criteria my brother would want. Realistic, Fast Combat (He used Radar in DayZ to get to the combat as quickly as possible), objectives, more weapons and choices to mod those weapons etc. The list goes on. 

BUT he did NOT want to play. He said : "" Its a streamer game for little kids, i want realistic games like dayz."" I couldnt convince him and played Tarkov alone. To my surprise i had so much fun leveling up solo, i just loved the game. I even hopped in some random lobbies and had fun with random players. But after a month or so, i got bored and thought : How cool would it be to jump in a raid with a buddy like my brother. it made me sad.

After a while COD Warzone dropped and i liked it. To my surpise even my brother liked it, he hit ME up to play with him and his friend. I was ready and excited. We played the night and it was not as i expected it. He and his friend got angry when loosing. In a BR \^\^ He got angry on me, angry on his friend, searched for excuses why we lost. I always said to him "" its Battle Royale you never gonna know what happens next. "" Then it dawned to me when i saw him playing, as i was dead and in spectator mode. 

**HE WAS CHEATING**, and he had AIMBOT or something like that, you could tell by watching. After confronting him he said, its only Radar, but i knew what i saw.

After that evening i stopped playing Warzone with them, cause why would you play with a cheater that gets mad on you when loosing.

He stopped playing that game after a while and we didnt play anything together. Some times i would hop on a dayz server with him, for a night and we had a little fun, but he always had radar and so i was bored after one night.

THEN the unimaginable happend: **HE BOUGHT ESCAPE FROM TARKOV and wanted to play with me!** Dude i was so hyped man. But i did not realize that starting EFT is not easy. You know you have to learn the game for a couple of hours at least.

And as you can imagine my brother got in a raid with me, while criticizing the menu, the fact that you have to inspect things one time, before knowing what it is and much more. 

We got into Raid and he went off like an animal, i tried to convince him that he had to be cautious, i tried to tell him, there are scavs and pmcs and raiders, i tried to tell him anything about the game so he doesnt die in 5 seconds. I tried to tell him about objectives and how you cget stronger by playing and leveling up. He did not wanna hear one thing, this guy just went for it and i ran behind him. He ran up to 2 guys and started firing, i helped and we killed 2, but also my brother died. He then ranted about me being alive and that he had to wait for me to escape. I killed myself so he wouldnt leave that quick and we got into another raid. All this time he is complaining how bad this game is and how this game is nothing like DayZ. The next raid we heard poeple in the same house and we could easily sneaked behind them but my brother ran outside and got one shot killed by scavs across the street ( i think it was gluhar scavboss). He then accused the scavs of cheating, quited the game and said its trash. He then told me he had cheats on the whole time. 

Hearing that It just made me sadder.He didnt even try to have fun. And im feeling very stupid for wanting him to play with me. If someone doesnt like a game and he isnt even trying to understand the rules, he wont have any fun. 

He always cheats and therefore can not endure failure. He hates every game upfront, without playing them. I even can understand if you dont like a graphic style, but he always has this point, that he does not want to play titles that are popular through streamer. Like WTF? Thats just so stupid man. 

So why the hell do i still want him to play with me? 

I really like my brother, we can hang out and we are  very good friends. Its just this one topic, (""Cheating and trying out New Games"") where we have different views. But i honestly think he manipulated himself through cheats, sucking every fun out of every game. If a game is hard to learn, he will give up. 

My best strategy now is to wait till he realizes a game is good. But he isnt really the guy to try out new stuff so im thinking of ways to convince him. The most frustrating part is, that he will not consider anything that i bring up. I really could use an Inception on him \^\^!

**How can i get him off cheats? How can i convince him a game is worth a try?**",28Nov2020,1
772,"I am 31 years old. I have a mom and dad both in their 60's, and 2 adult siblings. I currently work as a cashier making $15 an hour, and am trying to become a freelance artist in my off hours. I live alone in a studio apartment my grandparents own. 

My siblings both live with my mom in an apartment building my grandparents own. They don't pay anything, my mom pays everything. She makes decent money and never complains about the bills, but I think she struggles and just hides it. My brother is 32 and an opioid addict. He's in and out of treatment over the years but is currently using. I just found a needle in their bathroom the other day. My sister works as a freelance artist doing commissions and making income on patreon. My brother and mother have a mutually abusive relationship. My sister has a positive relationship with them both. 

My dad lives in his late mother's house. Recently it was discovered that my uncles used their power of attorney over my grandmother to cut my dad out of his mothers will. He will not own part of her house anymore, as was originally planned. My dad has decided not to fight this. Right now he lives in the house and is waiting to see if his brothers will kick him out or not.

So, the advice I need is this...what do I do? My grandparents are beginning to pass, and my immediate family's living situations are all...kind of hanging in the balance. I would like to buy a small house within the next 5 to 10 years, and Im wondering if I should let them all live with me or if I should move in with close friends instead? 

My brother doesn't seem like he'll ever stop using, and he's abusive to me so I don't want to live with him. The problem is my mom refuses to leave him behind. So they're a package deal. My mom I can deal with but when she and my brother are in the same building its hell on wheels. They fight both verbally and physically, and I do not want to live with that. My sister Im fine living with as long as she pays her share of the utilities...but im not sure she will? If she doesn't help mom with the bills now...what will she be like if she lives in my house? My dad...I want him to be put in an assisted living home. He's disabled and can barely take care of himself, and I don't want to be a caretaker. But I also dont want to abandon him...

Since 2018 I have been seeing these random 3-6 people heading inside the outside playground area every day hours after the daycare closes and doing/selling drugs. I frequently go to the field to play football with my friends and  those people are there EVERY DAY. I've been asking other people who live in the same area if anything has been done and they just shrug, say to stay away from them and change topic. I've never seen any of them in any other scenario. I'm not sure if they even live anywhere near the neighborhood. None of my friends have ever seen them besides when they're at the daycare. Should I be concerned? Am I in danger? TIA.",28Nov2020,1

I just turned 16 so I hope that puts things into context as to why I can’t really do much. My dog Amber has always suffered from poor dental hygiene ever since we got her from a family that couldn’t care for her. We don’t know how old she is but we know she’s getting old. They told us she used to be abused so she’s always been shy and afraid. I only noticed how bad her teeth were a couple months ago and have since been trying to brush her teeth but it hurts her too much. Her teeth have a bunch of plaque and tartar and they’re really brown. Her teeth are loose and beginning to fall out and her gums are showing. I think some teeth have already fallen out. I never noticed because she likes to be alone and is always hiding in her dog house or under beds and in closets so I hardly ever see her. She only seems to be in pain when I touch her mouth or anywhere near but never at any other times. She’s the type of dog who cries loudly when she’s in pain so if she was in pain at any other time she would make it clear. I have 3 other dogs but their teeth are fine. I bring up my other dogs because we’ve never taken any of them to annual vet appointments or even to the vet in general because vet costs for all of them would be too much. I love my dogs very much but I do wish my parents would’ve never gotten so many because dogs need so much care. I’ve been taking care of them the best I could for so long but it’s really hard when I’m the only one who helps. My mom helps sometimes and pays for haircuts but that’s it. I’m alone with bathing them, feeding them, treating any wounds, etc. Considering how bad Amber’s situation is, I know her dental costs will be hundreds of dollars, maybe even thousands. She needs to get teeth removed and cleaned and I know that it’ll cost a lot. I don’t think my parents will want to pay for it but I don’t want to see her in pain anymore. I only have around $200 so I’m considering asking my entire family to not get me any Christmas gifts this year and only help pay for her dental costs instead of getting me presents but I don’t think they’ll accept. I’ve considered asking them to give her away but they’ll probably refuse because they “love” her. There probably isn’t much advice for anyone to give but anything that you think can help works, even if it’s tips to take care of her or make things easier for her. I know I’m a really bad dog owner for not taking more care of her and not having enough money to take her or any of them to the vet but I’m really trying my best. I didn’t ask for all these dogs but I love them very much and I would never want them to be in pain but here I am.",28Nov2020,1

So when she’s ordering I ask her if she could also get a stir stick for my drink because I forgot to ask for one before, she said no cuz that might make me “uncomfortable”, so I just sighed and left it but I started to tear up a little. I kept silent and seconds pass so she said why don’t we just go home if your just going to be quiet the whole time and in once again in a f-ing mood. So she’s driving home while saying stuff like how I’ve ruined the weekend once again, how I’m such a moody kid, and that if I hadn’t said that or made comments....ect and I’m fully crying but still trying to be quiet about it. When we pull into the driveway she get out but I take a minute to compose myself and calm down, and start to head upstairs to my room. So she makes a comment about how I’ll just go and stay up in my room again for the weekend by myself which is what I always do when stuff like this happens. So that’s where I am now, crying and feeling like im a horrible person, I always mess up, and that I can’t do anything right. But I didn’t mean for it to go like this, I thought I would try to say how I felt and talk and it would be that big of a deal. But there’s also a nagging thought that tells me it’s not my fault. I’m really confused and wondering if it was me",28Nov2020,1
807,"I haven’t been happy since October. I don’t know why. I don’t know if I’m depressed or just sad but I’m afraid to tell anyone  (even my parents) because I feel like they either won’t care, or they will think I’m “seeking attention” I also don’t know how to explain myself. I don’t know how to put my emotions into words. I feel like I’m just gonna keep my emotions bottled up until it goes away. I don’t know what’s happening. :(",28Nov2020,1
808,"I feel guilty when people are kind to me. If they give me gifts or say really kind things. It causes me so much pain. I'm not sure why. 

I don't consider myself to have self-esteem issues. I grew up in a very loving and supportive environment, and currently have the most amazing and appreciative partner.

Also I am very vocal and comfortable in my own appreciation for others. 

I can't afford therapy right now, but am wondering if anyone else has dealt with similar feelings? I've tried to unpack them on my own, but have never really reached anything solution/reasoning that felt accurate.",28Nov2020,1
809,"Hey all, when I(20M) was about 16 I got this back acne. I hadn't had any issues with acne prior to it, not on my face, nowhere. Since then it's really wrecked my confidence. I've tried all sorts of things:

* Showering daily

* Showering 3 to 4 times a week

* Showering hot

* Showering cold

* Washing back with tree oil stuff

Basically a whole lot. But I haven't gone to the doctor, I might do it sometime soon if I can't get it resolved.

Have any of you struggled with back acne? How did you get rid of it? Also if there's a better sub for this, feel free to point me in the right direction!",28Nov2020,1

811,"I'm having trouble trying to help others while also keeping myself happy at the end of the day as well. When I was 14, I was pretty lost at life on what I wanted to do and was pretty depressed. I became too lazy to do anything (even something like getting out of bed in the morning), bad acne health, bad hygiene, insomnia, bad eye health, etc . . . I kept telling myself that one day my life will change for the better, but most of the time it never happened and it would repeat like this until one day I've decided to do it on my 15th birthday this year. And when I turned 15, I actually just rolled with it and did it better than any of the other days.

When I did it I became a people pleaser where I would accept everything my family would tell me to do and never said my true opinion towards others. At first it felt nice because there wasn't much my parents made me do and I was still able to do my goals. My old health problems also got better. But now it feels like I'm doing activites from my parents and school where it would take from day to night, from the second I wake up to the second I go back to sleep (even on weekends, holidays, and days off). I keep saying inside that if I just finish doing these it would end for now and I will have time for myself again. But I realized that this will take me my entire life to do until I die. I have this theory that people's expectations get higher once you do better at them and get mad at you for not meeting to their impossible expectations (especially having to deal with more than one person). I've started losing motivation at school and helping my family. It might be from burnout due to chronic stress. I'm regaining all of my old problems like insomnia and keep getting distracted from schoolwork. My mother has started noticing me not finishing assignments on time and my parents noticing me being sad and bored at my life. I don't know how I'm supposed to stay motivated what feels like a job that I'm working for nonexistent wages (That means that if I want to make money for myself, I'd have to work even more of my time that I don't have) that I hate. I feel like a wagie. I'm not saying that I don't want to work, in fact a job can make your life worthwhile, I'm saying that I don't want to revolve my entire life towards a job I hate and never be able to say what's on my mind. This lifestyle feels as worse as the one when I was 14. I've switched from one extreme to another. I'm making everyone else happy but not myself.

My biggest fear in life is that my entire life will be spent working a job I hate, alone by myself, and that being the only thing I have to look forward in life is that because I can't make time for hobbies or other lifestyles. Basically, where every day I live is complete shit and as miserable as someone's life can be. And it's looking like my life is heading towards that direction. I feel like modifying this lifestyle around New Year 2021 (Not right now because I don't how to). I know this seems a lot but this is one of the few times where I get to talk to people about my actual opinions (even if it's between strangers on a computer screen).  I want to help myself but I don't want to seem like an asshole by not helping others but I also don't want to be a slave to their expectations and opinions. Any thoughts? Have any of you felt something similar like this?",28Nov2020,1
813,"About two weeks ago, I emailed the people in charge of a show that I enjoy (not a big hotshot show, they accept writing interns on a fairly regular basis) about interning for them. I figured at first that it would yield nothing, but then, about a week ago (two weeks from Tuesday), I got a response. They said they would forward my inquiry to the appropriate staff members at the production company.

Well, a couple of days after that correspondence, I was talking to one of my friends who shares my major, and he told me that one of the requirements for us to graduate with this major is a writing internship. I feel like this is important information to address to the production company. I have two more summers before I graduate, so I guess there’s not too much to be concerned about, but I was wondering when it would be appropriate to send a follow-up email to the production company, explaining that my major requires such an internship.

It’s a pretty small company in comparison to most shows, and I do know for a fact that they’ve accepted at least two interns who went on to write several episodes for the show.",28Nov2020,1

I don’t even want to go to trade school and shit. I have health conditions so military is definitely not an option.

I WANT THIS NIGHTMARE TO BE OVER. I have seen many therapist. I am not suicidal but I just don’t want to live a life like this. I don’t even know why I am on Reddit lmfao.",28Nov2020,1
