1,"So... my SIL has worked at a relatives business for many years. Due to the pandemic, the business is closing which puts her out of a job. Since she has been paid under the table, she does not qualify for unemployment or a stimulus check. The relative who is closing the business has received a stimulus check herself and has not offered any sort of severance.

I understand being paid under the table has it's inherit risks but this is her sister. I feel there was an element of trust that should have been her safety net. Especially considering she saved her sister from the bureaucratic headache of having employees.

What I'm wondering is... could she ask for a 1099 to qualify as an independent contractor, pay some taxes, and then draw unemployment benefits? Or any other advice that doesn't cause her sister to flip a switch?",12May2020,2
2,"I’ve never been in this position before so I’m asking all of you for advice. 
My best friend has been dating this guy for around a year. When they initially started she swore it wouldn’t last long. He is kind of a deadbeat if i’m being honest. Can’t hold a job, doesn’t really hangout with anyone besides her, and has no real passion or goals in life it seems like. I say this because my best friend and also roommate is a great girl with a lot going for her, and it burns me inside to see her settling for so much less than she deserves. 

They are constantly fighting. Since the beginning of their relationship until now, they have been having constant fights and arguments (almost all started by him) over stupid shit like him making up lies about her trying to get with other guys. One time someone mentioned the name of a boy she used to hook up with and that immediately sparked an argument between them. It’s out of hand at this point. He basically lives with us and I’m not even exaggerating when I say they haven’t spent a day apart since at least November. It drives me crazy. They’re cooped up in her room all the time and she’s become a completely different person. She used to be the life of the party and now is just a duller version of herself. There’s TONS of red flags. None of us (her friends) like him. He doesn’t have any friends. She has never been to his house or been in his car. And at this point, i don’t know what to do without seeming like I’m just some hater who doesn’t want her to be happy. 

I’m fully convinced she’s with him solely for the reason that she doesn’t want to be alone. She has said that before she breaks up with him that she needs to have another boy lined up so she won’t be lonely. It’s so unhealthy and I seriously feel like we need an intervention. Like sometimes it seems like they are happy, they’ll be laughing and making jokes but I feel like with all the other red flags it’s not really worth the sometimes good moments. 

Has anyone else run into a situation like this? What am I supposed to do without stepping on her toes or making her upset?",12May2020,1
3,"There is quite a lot to explain I'll just try to keep it short and simple. I (18M) ordered a bong during the 4/20/20 sale directly to my house where I live with family, in an Australian state where weed is illegal. 

My dad, thinking it was something he's been waiting for opened the package. My parents confronted me, and I confessed that I've been smoking weed for almost 2 years. They asked me which friends, and if my gf does it and who i buy it from and I denied everything. 

Now I've never had a proper job, but I worked for him monthly, on a minesight as a hygiene worker. And I haven't smoked in months as I want to get clean so I can enter the workforce. And I didn't do well in school and took the easy way through, I still plan on going to Uni but I believe that greatly dissapointed my parents already. Now here is where I stand, I only have $600 to name, and I am completely jobless as my dad doesn't want me to work for him anymore. He believes I willingly risked everything, his house, his business to smoke weed, but I am well aware of drug testing and I am a skinny boi and didn't smoke much or often and always made sure to be drug free before working for him. I don't think he will listen to reason. 

My mum is more understanding and she wants to help me. Their marriage was already unstable but I think this will lead to their divorce. My mum wants to help me but my dad said if she does she can leave home too. My gf is very supportive. My dad is currently at work and he wants all my things packed and me out of the house by the time he gets home, I have 6 hours. 

My plan was to apply for jobs and organise therapy and then stay the night at my gf's house and send him a text telling him what I've done and that I'm sorry and I only want to fix this and that I don't expect him to forgive me but I want him to at least find a time where I can talk to him so he can understand me better. I just need a place to live until I can afford to move out.",12May2020,0

As we all know, the coronavirus complicates public interaction in terms of taking in person lessons. Does anyone know any methods of learning on your own or any online resources that will effectively help me learn how to play? Also in terms of the actual instrument, I plan on getting a standard keyboard that has multiple functions for playing (I know, that is a broad statement. Forgive me im learning.).

5,"(16M) Wondering what to do with his life in terms of career

hello! i hope you’re having a wonderful day and are staying safe during this quarantine and would like to first say thank you for clicking on this post and considering to help, if you aren’t able to that’s totally fine and i hope you have a great rest of your day, For those of you willing to hear me out, here’s the dilemma i’m faced with currently. My cake day is this Friday (may 15th) and ill be turning 17 and getting prepared to enter my senior year in high school. I’ve always had the questions of “what do i want to do with my life” floating around in my head” but with the time to decide approaching with college applications less than a year away, i’ve begun to hop left and right with ideas on what i might want to do, i decided that maybe i could utilize reddit as a tool to help me maybe get a better understanding of some of the career path options i have at the moment... i hope that made sense haha. If you’re willing to help and need more information i’ll answer any questions you ask, but i’ll leave a few basic things about me to help spur some of your ideas. I love video games and anime, i’m a very sociable person and am able to work with others well, i made a 28 on my ACT and have around a 3.8 weighted GPA, i like math but have always excelled in reading and grammar assignments and tests. If i could get a job based around video games or anime, that’d be nice because i’m always told that you’ll never work a day in your life if it’s something you love, yet i’d also like to make a fairly decent amount of money in the long run, as i’d like to see myself starting a big family (3-5 children and a wife) in years to come. again, thank you to anyone willing to help, and i am very open to answer any more questions.",12May2020,1

8,"For the past while, like 2 years, I’ve had nightmares almost every night. I know it doesn’t sound bad and I probably sound like a two year old posting this but I need to know what to do, how can I stop them? The nightmares are always one of the following:

\-I’m getting killed/attacked by something supernatural and no one cares, or no one realises. Like one example, I was in class when I giant beetle-like being comes in. It had razor sharp arms. It Walks up to me, and slashes my stomach open. No one around sees it or me or hears my cry of pain, smells the blood or anything.

\-I or someone I love die in some really crazy painful way, like when my best friend fell down the stairs, and got impaled on a coat rack. 

\-I have to watch all my family, friends and literally everyone I care about get hurt and die painfully. I can’t do anything but watch..

These nightmares make me not want to sleep. I’ve kinda learnt how to accept/ignore them but I just want them to stop. 

some additional info: I’m a male. I’m a teenager. I don’t drink/smoke/do drugs. I fall asleep from anytime from 10:00 pm to 4:00 am. I have a good home life and a tight group of friends. I suffer from anxiety (I’ve been diagnosed, dw.) I’m currently not taking any medication.

9,"Hey all,

I'm 26F and live in the UK. I live in a ground floor flat and due to circumstances I've been working from home for the past 8 weeks. With the good weather I had been sitting outside and noticed a rustling sound in my hedge which surrounds my patio and protects me from the street. After a few days of this I had a look under the hedge and saw about 8 cans of sprays like fabreeze and things plus a lighter so I gathered it all up and threw it away. 

Then next day I heard rustling again so waited a few seconds and saw a hooded figure walking away. The day after I was laid out and heard it again and stood up and asked what they are doing... turns out it's a few 16 / 17 year old lads who all smoke weed hiding their stuff in my hedge... and they were pissed their stuff was missing (that I'd previously thrown away). Probably a mistake here on my part was keeping silent and heading straight back indoors)

After some thought I was going to speak to them to say I feel uncomfortable with them storing their stuff there as it's my personal space where I lay out in my bikini and they are treating it like their own space. But when I popped to my local shop there was a commotion and it was this group of lads getting aggressive with members of staff. Because of this I feel really uncomfortable confronting them to tell them to move their things as I live on my own and dont want the retaliation I could get by telling them this or just throwing their stuff again. 

They are now coming by 7/ 8 times a day now and even at 1am when I am sat in my living room and hear them outside and stashing stuff. 

I know it sounds a bit pathetic but it got to the point I didnt want to sit out on my patio as they were be there hanging round and grabbing their stuff regularly and now they are doing it late at night. At night though they break into my apartments bin storage to smoke so I hear them through my walls but that's just weird more than anything! I live on my own so dont have backup and honestly I dont really know what to do.. anyone got any ideas ? 

Thanks in advance",12May2020,1
10,"So i’m 20yo Male 1.89 meters and 138kg, and since i can remember in my life I’ve been feeling lonely, crying for attention and been frustrated with my self

In all my teenage years ( 14 - now ) I’ve been living with my father, he is a doctor (a very good one by the way) and since then i suffer from anxiety and some big self esteem problems, and by the following 5 years i go deep down on my own feeling and keep getting worse, gettin fatter, passing all day in a dark closed room, hiding behind tons of food and video games, literally not living my teenager years.

So i live with my father, i have 7 siblings, 5 from my father and 2 from my mother, but keep in mind I’m they only son, all of my siblings have different mothers/fathers. And because of it, growing up always came with that feeling of loneliness, my parents wore divorced after 1 year of marriage, since i can remember ive always been moving city to city, to live with one of my parents, that now have new families and new responsibilities, and not willingly they stopped giving the attention that a kid needs. And the rest of the blah blah drama of me “screaming” for attention that i lonely kid does.

Pass forward, I’ve lived some soft traumas (nothing that impacts me now, but helped in the  development of anxiety) 

So now i’m 14, started to live with my father and 2 other small siblings, them I’ve was already suffering from anxiety and bad self esteem, feeling a completely lonely and a completely failure, couldn’t find help any where and i tough that eat and play video games like the world was about to end, was the only good solution, when i was 16 I’ve have no real close friends, was fat as fuck and feeling a completely mess, my grades wore awful, got a nearly death experience, passing 20 days in a Hospital and got held back a year in school, that was it, for the following 4 years (until this present day) my father started to be more and more toxic towards me (he always been, making feel like shit and feel like wouldn’t care for my mother for some part of my life) he always pointed out and criticized all my flaws and things that i wouldn’t do because I couldn’t finde my self the urge to live life like he wanted me to live. And my dad is a very literal person, he always says what is in his mind, never measured words, and never understood how i feel, he always says to me whats he thinks that is wrong with me (And i agree in some points) but always he manages to make me feel small, like i’m worthless, and i do feel that way, points how fat and ugly i’m,he moks me, make me feel bad about my self, he always throws in my face every thing he does for me, just to make me feel like I’m worthless, been living this same routine for 6 years. Some say that i could just change, like be more “happy”, make some friends, listen more to your father, stop being fat and eat more healthy things, take care of yourself, be more sociable and etc, these tips things.

But just from the last year to now, ive started to know my self better, understand my self more, be more acceptable with who i am and the things i like ( i’m Bi ), understanding more about the feelings I’ve have trapped inside of me, about my owns flaws and mistakes, because my hole life I’ve always have been carrying that feeling that I’m different, like i can’t fit in any place or friendship, like i know some secrets about life that most people don’t know, it feels like they all live in some kind of bubble and I’m the only person i know that is out of it, and i feel completely lonely because of it, I’ve never knew people that can fully make me feel like part of something. Those feelings got more intensive when i started to watch some videos from a Guru (Sadhguru) and eat Psilocybin Shrooms, I gained such beautiful knowledge that is and will make me a better person

But the Key point in all that mess is: I have a alcoholic Father that always make me feel shit and horrible about my self, making me having no willingness to live my life correctly and always making excuses to continue this life, to not change the routine that i have ( wake up, do some chores and passing all day laying dawn in a bed sad and sick of it playing LoL, until night comes and i go to sleep ) that I’m completely sick of it, but i keep making excuses to not change. I’m fat as fuck, feel pains all over my body because of it, smoke weed every day to manage to go trough the day, have no goals in life, like i have no ideia what to do, i fucking know the things that i need to do to chance, but I’m a mess and I’m completely lost in my life, every day passes and i have to continue to live this toxic routine, that I can’t take it anymore, i wanna to fucking live right, feel like a decent human been, but FUCK ME! i’m to used to this life, is the only one i know, some times i just one runaway and live like a Hippie, no worrys, contemplating the universe, going city to city, make new human contacts, live a life of spreading love!!

15,"I found this turtle when I was a child and I've cared for him by myself for over a decade. He's a big strong boy now but unfortunately due to my negligence he's sheltered and I don't feel like he could survive on his own in the wild. On top of that even if he could, his species of turtle is apparently invasive where I live so the ecosystem would suffer. He's a super cool guy and I really want to keep him around but I have no where to bring him and with the quarantine my money has gotten funny to the extent that no one is laughing anymore. I'm moving because I can no longer afford rent and my new place has a no aquarium policy.   


It was selfish of me as a child to take him out of element and bring him into my home. What's even more selfish is that I want to keep maintain contact with him somehow. My plan currently is to put his tank and stand materials in my closet at my new place and keep him a secret. He's in a huge 60g tank but the filter is silent and I doubt it can be heard through walls/in a closet. But if I get evicted from this new place I'll seriously be up shit creek without a paddle.    


I can't take him with me and I can't let him go because he'll die/be invasive. What should I do? I know I'm a piece of shit for abducting a baby turtle and then turning around and trying to get rid of him, but I want him to live a happy life, not be some secret in a closet with his only warmth being a heat lamp. He deserves better than what I can give him right now. I did not forsee any of this.",12May2020,1

22,"Long story short, I just graduated college (22) and I don't have a driver's license. I have a valid learner's permit and my dad is currently teaching me, but when I was learning in high school I got into an accident and it scared me off driving for a while; not to mention I went to school in New York City, so I never really had the need for a car. I should have taken a summer to learn, but here we are.

I'm moving from New York City to Florida in August for a job contract, and suffice it to say, public transit there doesn't hold a candle to New York's and I need to be able to drive. I'm not worried about learning, as I've gotten over my fear and am making good progress. However, with COVID-19 effectively shutting down New York State (and all the DMVs), I can't schedule a road test for now. New York is still ""on pause"" until June 6th, and that's a date that's already been pushed back and will likely get pushed back again. While I'm comfortable waiting until late July to take the test, I have to have a contingency plan just in case I'm unable to take a road test and get my license in time.

What should I do? My current idea is to bail on my current apartment plan and get one where I can use public transit for the time being, sacrificing a great location and roommates and having to rely on a semi-reliable bus system.

My friend who is moving with me is in the same boat as I am, and her plan is to take uber pools and carpool until she can get her license in Florida. While that's not a terrible plan, I don't think I have the funds for that.

My brother's (who lives in Florida) idea is to change my residency from New York to Florida, move down early, and take my road test there. Florida is opening up a lot faster than New York and the road test is much easier there, but it's a complicated solution. Not to mention I risk possibly failing my road test after buying a car and moving somewhere where I can't use buses. Of course, I'm preparing best I can and hopefully WON'T fail my road test, but I should have all my bases covered.

What would you do? Are there other opportunities I'm missing?",12May2020,1

Let me just say sorry in advance for grammar and formatting. I am a native English speaker but not a great one. For the past 24 hours I’ve been filled with the most intense dread I have ever felt. I can barely eat and have been brought to tears multiple times and nothing I do can distract my mind from what it’s feeling right now. It started when I was going to bed last night and while laying there and letting my mind wander, I thought about my parents it popped into my head that they’re getting older and that sooner or later they’re going to die. As am I and my Partner and everyone I care about. Then it occurred to me to think of what happens after death ( I know that we can never really know but i have always leaned towards being atheist) I started to think what it meant to die in a world where there’s nowhere to go. What it meant to cease to exist. To have your memories and thoughts disappear. To no longer be able to hold the ones you love or even think of them. It seemed so cruel and now I can’t get the thought out of my head. The terror of non-existents is what I’m really afraid of. I don’t know what to do. Who to talk to. What to say even. It’s the only fear I have and the worst part is that I can’t just shrug it off and force myself to believe something different like I can with normal intrusive thoughts. Any words of advice or wisdom would go along way. 
What you should know about me: 24M, have been medicated for anxiety (Zoloft) before but it just kinda blunted it and didn’t stop intrusive thoughts at all. That’s all I think.

At first, I didn't really have any feelings for him and I told him he needed time to clear his head and he probably is just hurt. But after a while, we started talking again and I ended up having feelings for him, I don't know how it started but the feelings were intense. We think alike so much it's crazy that we are like the same person, we have the same opinions about almost everything, it's also crazy about how much we are both physically attracted to each other, it's insane. I think we are both physically and emotionally attracted to each other. But I still can't help but obsess about his ex, I know he was serious about her and it was his first love. It just doesn't make sense to get over her in a few months. Also, I'm really confused about what I feel as well because when he confessed I was still not over the guy I liked, and before I get really really jealous over stupid things, I thought I'd be the jealous type. But since we started dating, I never get jealous even if I try. This is because he never gave me a reason to be jealous, and I know he's loyal. However, these thoughts of his ex being hurt or him missing her keep lingering to my mind. I just told him I want for the two of them to meet just so they could catch up, he didn't want to do it because he thinks it's cheaty and wrong. I insisted and he reached out to her. Now, I know there's possibility they would miss each other and get back together but this is what I wanted to know - to make sure he won't regret breaking up with her (yes he was the one who broke up with her and tried to get her back). Anyway, I don't know what to feel now. I wanted to cry but I can't, I know there's a chance I'd be hurt but somehow I don't feel jealous. He told me he doesn't want to date her again and meeting her would be a waste of time and money, he said it would be just for 10 mins to ask her how she's doing but I told him that they should eat and catch up. I don't know what's going on with me, I must be crazy. All I want is for him to be happy, I know he seems happy with me but I would never really know how he would feel about her until he sees her again, the last time they met he has feelings for her and I'm sure she did too.

33,"
My girlfriend sadly lost her father last year. He was a great and hard working guy. He owned two pretty successful bread routes that he ran by himself. Since he’s passed they’ve had someone running the route but he recently moved and her brother has been doing the route. He had to go back to work last week and I was left with the route and only a few days training.

Most people think “bread route” and think about a person bringing a couple pieces of bread into a deli. It’s not that simple. First off, I have to wake up at 2:30 AM and drive 20 minutes away to be where the box truck and bread is picked up. I have to load the truck with over 100-120 crates of heavy bread that are stacked about 12 high . Then I have to drive another half hour to the location of the route. I get to each place and have to decipher how much bread they need when I have little knowledge about this. Also while using a handheld computer I have little knowledge of. 

Grocery stores have huge orders I have to pick, constantly up and down grabbing bread and loading these big blue crates onto a dolly....rolling it into a store and checking in with a manager.  Then I have to stock the shelves which I always assumed the supermarket or deli did themselves.

I’ve been getting off at 4-6 o’clock everyday. I can’t do this and don’t know what to do. I don’t want to look like a piece of crap to my girlfriends family but I can’t continue doing this. I got home at 630 PM today and left my house around 230 AM. I don’t think there is any amount of money that would make me actually want to do this.

Long post btw

I hate my father. I don't exactly know why but I dislike talking to him and generally just hate him.  sometimes I feel like I could pick up a kitchen knife and slice his neck open with it. 
Like I said, the odd thing is I never know why. My twin sister doesn't talk to him at all but there's no reason so I'm assuming it's just part of growing up. 
Ive also found myself bullying and picking fights with my mum because I'm feeling particular frustration or hatred for my father. And I feel really, really bad sometimes because of this. (My mum isnt a saint and we've had problems which I won't get into unless prompted).
When I was a bit younger he did a MAC address filtering thing on our internet to stop me staying awake at night and when I first realised I went into panic mode, it was stupid but I realise now it was because of the fact that I wasn't in control. I was in a shitty mood and hyper aggressive and ""fight prone"" around that time before I eventually managed to find a way to manipulate them into stopping my internet restrictions. 
We've also had physical altercations, where nothing serious has happened but the thing that baffles me is that, even though I'm highly trained at martial arts and have beaten people larger than my father in fights, I can never seem to bring myself to attack or incapacitate him. Which, I feel is making my need to always be in control worsen. 
I'm constantly in aggressive moods when I feel I can't control something or something is out of my control, very rarely, making me feel twinges of ""suicidalness"", as in the feeling of extreme depression and hopelessness, although this is always temporary. 
I'm always wanting to just beat the daylights out of him and kill him even though he's done nothing to deserve death. Im shy/ scared to ask things from him even though he's always fine with getting me anything I need or doing anything I need him to do for me. 

And before you say so I'm not some sociopathic freak, but he's the only person I can't ""control"", well, using my physique at least, and often think of scenarios where I crack his jaw and stand over his bleeding mess of a body.
Whenever we get into direct altercations, I end up crying, but not because I'm scared, well, I just can't explain it. I'm worried that next time we do get into an altercation I'll lash out and hurt him very very badly.

36,"Hello Reddit I need some advice. 

I (21M) am currently a college student struggling with college. I am basically not doing well and just barely being able to stay in school(grades wise). A few things about myself before I really get into the advice wanting. I have insomnia because I used to get super anxious about my grade and getting yelled at. I was born into a very religious family who came from another country. My parents basically won a lottery for their visa and came here to make a living. They came here and had me. This makes me a first generation immigrant (I think). My parents worked very hard and would raise me and my sister. As well as send money back home to our extended family. Now this ment that we didn’t have that much money. 
Now, Growing up my parents were all about grades and religion. (They were also very controlling although I didn’t realize til later in life) Growing up, I could keep up with their expectations getting straight A’s and going to religion school, thing is I would get berated for even the slightest of things. An example is in elementary school we had a plus minus and check mark system where we were graded upon that. I would have majority pluses with some checkmarks and still would get berated. An 89 is not good enough type thing. They would also make snide comments about everything and really just shit on anything I had an interest in. “Why are you reading a novel when you could be reading your textbook.” Or “All you do is play games” (One I hear everyday but not to my face is “He’s playing video games, never will be anything”). My mom would try to sneak up on me while I am studying. If I was studying, I would get a sarcastic “Oh are you studying? Really?” Or If I was doing anything that is suspicious to her she would yell for my dad saying I was playing games. My dad would often get irrationally mad and break things. They basically has a multitude of rules and enforce all those rules. A lot of mental abuse. Some physical. As the years went on I started to care less and less about grades and started becoming depressed. All the abuse was just getting to me and I started to lose motivation cause my grades to slip a bit but still B range. As the years passed, we have butted head a bunch of times. I have gotten kicked out, told I was no good and a bad son, etc. I was planning on using college as a way to move out. 

My parents being the very controlling religious people they are told me I was not allowed to dorm and had to commute an hour and a half to school via train. I argued but to no avail and started the semester commuting. Not being able to sleep at night I would get 2-3 hours of sleep. getting up at 7 to catch the train to get a 9 am class every morning. Plus when I had test it was earlier as I had to get there by 8 am. This mix with no sleep made it hard to stay awake and focus. During my high school days I would power through the day and crash when I got home, but I couldn’t do that as my college does trimesters instead of semesters. Meaning I had to stay up after coming home and study classes. My grades started to slip and I was just barely able to get good grades. Two “semesters” in and I was places on probation. I soon entered a cycle of barely passing getting taken off probation before being placed back on it. This lasted for two years before I convinced them to let me move closer to school to really get back all the time I was losing to commuting. 
Fast forward to just before the quarantine,I took a semester off to move out and get situated. After moving out my relationship with my parents improved ten fold. They started acting like supportive parents instead of just shitting on me. One my break was over, I went back to school saw major improvements to my studies and was getting better grades...until I hit midterms. I flunked two out of three. I managed to pass the semester. As I am now in quarantine still flunking courses and overall not doing well, I was thinking of dropping out. 

If you have read this far, thank you. Now is the time for my advice asking. Should I continue college? I still have three more while having “finished” three. I have been debating dropping out because I feel like it is a waste of my parents money. I simply do not want them to spend it on me when I am not showing results. What I want to do is work full-time while figuring out what I want to do. I realized a lot about myself during the break I had and one of them is that the time I have in a trimester is not enough for me to be able to learn. I am going for Electrical Engineering, but now I am not sure if I want to be an engineer. 

Should I drop out?

I understand that this might not have the severity of family issues but I would very much like to take this very seriously. My parents are going to buy me a new phone once I graduate (which me and my class will never get a physical celebration). I have spent weeks studying the best phone for me and I have narrowed it down to 2 phones: the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 coming out this August and the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max. I am spending a long time studying this because I need this phone to last me a very long time. I have decided on the Note until now, when I considered the current state of my family's phones: they all have iPhones. The Note may be a bit faster and have a 120hz screen, but the iPhone has FaceTime and typing support. If I get the Note, I would get a faster and bigger screen with a SD 865 but if I have an iPhone I get good haptic feedback and I am able to communicate with my family in a simple way. The fact that I am so split on this frustrates me to no end and I need a second opinion. So which one should I get?",12May2020,2
42,"Hello, I am a transgender man (19) who just finished his second year of college for reference.

At the beginning of this past school year (fall of 2019), my best friend (let's call her Holly) who went to high school with me decided to room with me for the school year. She would be a freshmen and I would be a sophomore in college. We decided this six months prior and agreed that it was a good idea. Over the summer of 2019, I came out as transgender and began my transition. This is when things got weird.

Holly began to flirt with me as I transitioned, she would compliment me and ask to hang out all the time. She began to text me during every free minute she had. She would text me until she passed out at midnight, then would text me again as soon as she woke up in the morning every single day for about three months. She always went to me for comfort and even at times she told me I was her rock and that she wouldn't know what to do without me. 

Once we got to school and we both moved into the dorms together, Holly began to act even more bizarre. She would want to sleep in the same bed as me every night and would ask me to put my arms around her, so I did to comfort her. Later, I found out that she would actually sleep half naked with me and that struck me as very odd. She would call me handsome and cute and told me that she would ""never leave me"" because I was too important to her. I began to develop feelings for her during this time and I thought that she felt the same way because she sometimes even told me that she loved me. 

One night, I walked in on her with a random guy (we can call him Philip) ""giving her a back massage"" (her words) in her bed. I left the dorm upset and stayed with a friend that night. Holly begged me to come back, saying that she was sorry and that she had no feelings for Philip. She assured me that she kicked him out. She said that she was crying and scared and felt alone and wanted me to come back because she wanted someone to sleep with. I asked her that night if she had feelings for me and she said no. I asked why then did she have me sleep with her and say that she loved me. She said she just thought that's what friends do (she didn't do this with anyone else to my knowledge). I called bs and told her that I felt used. She said she didn't mean to use me but I think that's a lie.

There is where a guy (let's call him Dave) comes in. Dave is a 19 year old transgender man just like me. Well, Holly started dating Dave almost immediately. When she did, she cut ties with me entirely. She moved out of the dorm away from me and ghosted me on all platforms. I haven't heard from her in 8 months and Dave refuses to speak to me as well. 

I was crushed, my best friend of 5 years had suddenly decided that I was no longer going to be a part of her life. I felt that she used me as a substitute for a boyfriend until she found someone better.

I want some advice on how to heal from this, I want to get over what she did and move on with my life. Does anyone have any advice? I also want to know if I'm overreacting or if my feelings of being hurt are justified. Thank you.",12May2020,2

46,"I was inspired to write this after I saw a post by someone else who went through a similar experience on either this sub or a similar one. When I was about 6 or 7 I was hanging out with a boy around my age. As many little kids often do we played the ""doctor game"". Being curious little kids these exams would often be quite extensive and would entail one of us getting naked and the person playing the doctor would poke around with our genitals or buttocks.  One day this boy brought up the idea of involving my little sister who was around 4 years old in this game as the patient.  My sister was reluctant and did not want to participate and we forced her to. She was screaming and crying and I remember holding her down while my friend was stripping off her clothes.  My mom caught us in the act, sent the boy home and had a very stern talk with me. I remember I could tell by my mom's face how seriously I fucked up and I remember feeling so much shame and just crying. I never saw that boy again and last I remember him and his family moved to New York.  I know that I had no sexual motive. I didnt know what sex even was at that age but I cant help but think that I scarred my sister.  I know that she probably doesn't remember but she has gone down a bad path in life and I sometimes worry that I mightve subconsciously assisted in her struggles in life. I dont know how to fix what I've done and I cant even apologize. I just know that even though I was young I was a terrible older sister for participating instead of protecting her. I just dont know how to forgive myself when what I did was just so fucked up.

50,"I just want to preface this by saying All my life I never had to deal with any physical manifestations of anxiety ( despite both my mom and brother having chronic anxiety ) up until I reached college.  We all thought I was lucky and wasn't burdened with any anxiety disorders because I was fine all through middle school and high school and never had any physical manifestations of stress/anxiety whereas my older brother was riddled with anxiety growing up, and had major abdominal issues and was diagnosed with IBS and even eventually put on Zoloft. Now I am a junior in University and the mornings are awful. Everyday I wake up around 5-6 AM with dull stomach pain in my upper left abdomen which prompts me to smoke a bowl of weed to relieve the nausea and then i fall back asleep for a few hours and wake up at 9-10 AM feeling groggy and then my day starts. Thats how its been everyday basically for the last year and a half.  It seems the only way to numb the pain is to smoke weed and obviously this is not sustainable in the long run when I have graduated and have a real job. I want to stop this cycle of waking up every morning feeling sick and even having to gag/cough in the bathroom and then having a smoke until my stomach is settled. I try to meditate as much as I can which probably round out to being once every other day for 10 minutes, but i still havent noticed real improvements.  On the other hand, I know I could go on an antidepressant like Zoloft and the pain would likely subside but Im not sure I like the idea of being on a heavy psychotrophic drug that could permanently alter my brain chemistry and personality.

Where do I go? My degree is photography but I have experience with children back home (they're my siblings but 3 have a disability) when I was in school I assisted with some kids who couldn't work in a big class setting but I'm 23 now, I doubt they care about my high school things? 
Can anyone point me in a direction of how I can search into training these (preference is not a degree bc no more student funding and well I need to earn first)  maybe get paid too? Give me hope.

I thought I wanted to do photography I don't anymore, it's fun but not for me to work in. Please don't criticise this. I appreciate my degree regardless. 
 

TLDR: my degree isnt the area I wanna work in, how can I train and maybe earn to become a teaching assistant, work with special educational needs, or within the system to help those who have been hurt ✨",12May2020,1
69,"I had an amazon refund that was sent to a bank account that I closed. I asked amazon if they could change it but they said it was too late and my bank has to deal with it either by giving me a check or rejecting it and giving it back to Amazon. I called my bank (Wells Fargo) and they said that they won’t even receive the money and they can’t do anything about it, and told me to talk to Amazon again. I have been back and forth between the two for the last 3 days and nothing has been accomplished. It’s a back and forth “Oh it’s their problem”.

70,"I'm a girl and English is not my first language, I'm sorry

The first relationship I've ever had was with my actual ex boyfriend, it lasted 7 months, he did things to me that I didn't want to, he did put his hand on my pants 3 times, all those times I couldn't scream or say no, I was static, I couldn't move, it was the worst feeling of being able to do nothing, the third and last time I took his hand off my pants and I didn't say anything.

We kept together, I thought it was all my fault and that I wasn't being a good girlfriend, it was hard to look at him sometimes, at that time we only see each other on Saturday's, so those things happened in 3 weeks straight.

Other situation happened at his home, he took off my pants and started to .... do things with his mouth, I didn't want to, I was afraid, I said low in despair 'no' 2 or 3 times and he just didn't stop, so I screamed. His mother entered in his bedroom and made him go away, I was crying and trembling, she calmed me down and hugged me saying everything was ok, I stayed at his bedroom alone till my mom pick me up, I didn't see him when I was leaving.

We were still dating, I can't tell how I survived looking at his face and kissing, hugging him all this time, we never talked about that, the thought of ""nobody loves me, nobody will love me again"" made me keep on with him. He was also very abusive not letting me see my 3 only friends. After crying, cutting myself and being depressed, I decided that I would rather die than keep on this. I broke up with him and I kept all this thoughts with me.

Some months later, I started dating my actual boyfriend, he was my best friend, he is awesome, were together have been 10 months, but I never told him about those things that happened in my last relationship, and I didn't want to talk about this, never ever, the problem is that I always said that nothing happened.

He do things like, say kidding that I'm a slut do make HIMSELF bad, because I always said I never did anything in my last relationship, and he never believed me, he is very jealous.
I stated to cry, he asked me if everything was ok, I told why I was crying, I remembered about all the harassments.

He was chocked, I was crying a LOT, he said everything was ok, that's on the past and that I'm with him, when I calmed myself down he started to get mad, not yelling at me, but saying things like how I lied to him when I said that nothing happened and telling how he is suffering thinking about what he did to me.
He didn't really care about me, he was asking if I liked it, if we had sex, how I let him do this, and started to victimize himself, saying that I lied about he being my first time, he was my first time, he was mad about other guy touching me, but he kept saying that he's not my first time.

I think telling him was the worst idea I could ever had.

He is mad at me because my ex abusive boyfriend did things to me that I didn't want to do (I can't even say if that's rape), but in no time he asked how I was, and now I'm remembering about everything that happens, I want to fucking cut myself and bleed to death.

He even admitted that he didn't cared about me, he was only worried about me not being his ""first time"" and lied for all this time, he said that his jealousy is greater than his concern for me, he really said that when I asked why he is mad and if he cared about me.

We're figuring it out, he said that he did his best to keep himself on control for the rest of the afternoon, that he care about me, but I need to understand his point.

Things to let you know:
The harassments happened a year ago.
I won't be telling my mother or family about what happened.
I won't break up with my actual boyfriend.

My first question is, why do guys care so much about being the first time of a girl?
(remembering again, my fist time was with my actual boyfriend, not with the abusive one)

Second, should I be more understanding? How?

Third, how can I forget all the harassments without a psychologist?",12May2020,1
71,"I’ve been talking to this guy for the better part of a month, everyday all day and every few days on the phone for hours. I discovered yesterday he’s newly out of a relationship and while he’s told me pretty much everything about his life, he’s managed to leave this major detail out. I thought it was unusual he’s seemed to avoid talking about romantic pasts all together, he hasn’t asked me about mine at all. We’ve talked a bit about it, but nothing about past relationships, more so our views on dating in general. I’m not sure what to do, I’ve enjoyed getting to know him, but I won’t be used as someone’s rebound ever. It’s been harmless for me, but have I invested a lot of my time talking to him? Definitely, so I feel like I do deserve to know what his intentions are with me. How can I find this out? Should I directly ask him? He tweets regularly about relationship type stuff, seeming to still harbor some ill will towards his ex, so anyone with a brain would be able to put it together. I don’t really feel like carrying on talking to him at the pace I’ve been without this being cleared up.

I feel shitty, overall like he’s not divulging some key information that I feel like he really should. He’s been consuming a lot of my time and I don’t think that’s right.",12May2020,1
72,"Full disclosure I am not a bio mother (im a 32 yr old SM of a 16 yr old girl) and currently but I am thinking very hard about trying to become one soon. I suffer from Cyclical Vomiting Syndrom (CVS) which is brought on by use of weed. I have quit and have no intention of starting again though so weed isnt an issue. However, CVS means I have puked for days on end with going to the hospital for a couple hours to a few days as the only cure.

My last attack I was puking up blood with 12 hours of starting. I was a terrified mess. I am now terrified of taking any pills because my gag reflex is so bad right now a tylonal makes me puke. I'm afraid if I start puking I wont be able to stop. Thinking of becoming a mother I thought about morning sickness and I'm terrified of going through it.

I cant use my mother's experience of childbearing as we have very different experiences with periods. My mother never got cramps and I get ones where I think Freddie Kruger is trying to claw out of my uterus. My periods are bloody and end quickly, my mother has spotted most of her life.

I've been reading posts about woman having morning sickness their entire pregnancy and I just dont know if I can handle that. I get oral thrush after puking a couple times let alone every day for nearly 9 months. Does anyone have any advice on what I might expect or if its worth putting myself through that? I'd love to talk to a doctor about it but with COVID going on that's not going to happen.

By putting myself through that I mean not being able to eat solid food, taste anything, and possibly living in a hospital for my pregnancy. I've always wanted to have a child of my own and meeting my SD 6 yrs ago made me want that even more so. I would love to feel something grow inside me and to be fully responsible for that new being is awe inspiring to me. I do realize I can adopt and/or foster which would be fine but not what I've dreamed of since I understood I could be a mother.

i may just be very empathetic, but the one thing i dont understand about other people is how they cant understand things, including me. i feel so alone because nobody understands me. if i do make it i want to become a therapist. even if i may suffer my whole life with my own problems, maybe i can help others to not feel like i do rn. if choose to exist i need a valid purpose.

another thing is that ive never loved anyone before. i doubt ill ever find love. i cant connect with people because every time they do one thing wrong it sets off a red flag in me and i cant forget about it. i guess my vibe check is just too strong. 

at the same time i could just be extremely stupid, because if i was that smart i would know the answers to all my problems right? i was was so smart i would know how to make it better and just be happy.

so a while back i decided to just make the first move and dm my crush. i didn't go into this with high expectations as i was simply hoping to talk to him a little bit, get to know him etc. 
i thought it was going pretty well but then he started sending me mixed messages. he's kind of known for being problematic and although I'm not sure whether he likes me in that way, I think he decided to push me away because he's very self aware.
his ex told me how, when they were together, he could be a major asshole to her for no reason sometimes and that he loves to lie about anything and everything.
i think the mixed messages came from him knowing that if we got close, he'd probably end up hurting me. maybe he thinks i 'deserve better' or something. but i felt like he also wanted to get to know me.
i don't like anybody else and i don't want anybody else. I'm really sad and disappointed about the whole thing and it doesn't help that I'm already so insecure.

he was a total creep(imo)first time I met him, he made me sit on his lap and read him a book. I kept trying to get off but he made sit on his lap... afterwards I went upstairs

my mum left him home with him and my siblings , he even picked us up from school. he acted very perverted to me. 

these all the weird things he did to me:

\-when I was changing into my home clothes ( I came back from school) he kept on trying to see me change , I had to push him out my room

\- he touched my ass when I was bent down putting something in the freezer.

\- when I was having a bath , he came in and had a toilet and was staring at me.. 

\-he put his tongue in my mouth and forcefully kissed me (the way parents do) I tried to push him off but I couldn't get him off.

I did end up telling my mum, at first and she didn't believe me at first and continued hanging out with him and bringing him home but eventually stopped.

my mum stopped talked to him and haven't since. we moved to a different area but I have seen him on the bus several times...

93,"Hey guys, so I’m the eldest son in a family of 4. We’re a fairly normal and stable middle-class family. My parents are cool, supportive, and even caring when they need to be. However, me and my sister’s relationship with my dad haven’t been so smooth sailing. I think that he wants us to look like those image of the “happy ideal family” and everyone’s close with everyone. I actually want that myself, to have a family that you could truly feel you belong with, to have a home where you feel like you don’t face any pressure. But in doing so, I feel like he forgets that we need our own private spaces.

I can’t say I agree with his method because I have empirical evidence against it that is going to a high school away from home. I live in an apartment my parents bought and see them about once every 1 or 2 weeks yet my relations with my family (dad, especially) seemed to improved drastically. So I think that the more space we each have, the better it will be.

Another thing is that i feel like me and my sister are the “quiet” type where you should approach them when you want to talk to them because the other way around rarely happens. Yet my dad seems to expect us to always start the dinner conversation, actively try to fulfill his image of the “happy” family. 

I would just like to mention (but don’t take this too seriously, because it really is not) that my dad gives off this certain “stern” atmosphere around him that’s sort of intimidating and hence not easy to approach.

95,"Sorry for the long confusing title.

First off and most importantly, this question is completely irrelevant to what my politics beliefs are. It has no bearing whether I am extreme left, right, or smack in the middle.

So, I care about politics because I care about my family, my community, and my country. I understand that the most important thing I should do is to vote. Not just in national elections, but local elections as well. I do that. However, I fear that I'm not doing enough. At the same time, I have very little time to do further on top of full-time work, family, and part-time grad school. Among close childhood friends that I absolutely trust, we occasionally have political discussion. Really good ones too. Totally respectful, totally objective, and never hard feelings after. Our opinions usually remain the same afterward except on rare occasions, but that's okay. Doing the same with almost anyone else never works however and I know it's not a good idea anyways. Doing that online is even worse. I've ""argued"" with people online recently and honestly, only person to blame for getting annoyed is MYSELF. It's such a childish thing to do and absolutely achieves nothing against probably some bored teenager or a grown-child somewhere.

So I told him to not think that cuz it’s not true. So yeah and he keeps saying “Yeah I just want to be friends.” Like I heard him the first time. Im surprised he still wants to be in my life. I told him that we are already friends tho. And he said yeah he just wants to be friends. He told me this so many times idk why he keeps saying it. Like I heard you. Why? Does he keep saying it?",12May2020,1
102,"A year ago I was casually involved with a guy. Things ended, no hard feelings. He now has a live in girlfriend and a baby on the way. I’d like to send a gift, possibly anonymously. Is it a nice gesture or creepy?",12May2020,2
103,"*inhales deeply* 

Okay. Here is what happened.

So I’m a 22 year old F and my (was) best friend is 21F.

My friend, let’s call her April. Invited me to her party down the road. (We are neighbours)
I was really excited and went around to her house. She was very drunk and after talking for 5 minutes, asks if I could get her more alcohol. 
Me already under the influence, said no, to which she responded with, “get your mum to buy some, I’ll give you the money.”
At the time my mother had a 3 hour car journey to get back to her house and I didn’t want to bother her but April kept nagging me to do it, so I texted my mum and politely asked if she could get some alcohol for April and I to drink, to which she happily agreed.

Here’s where shit hits the fan...

I tell April that the alcohol is on its way and then a car pulls up at her house with two of her friends.
April decides to stagger up to the car and tries to hop in it. “Let me in bitchess, I’m coming with you guys!” She yells before climbing in through the car window. The driver, obviously annoyed, gives me a concerning look so I walk up to the car window and said, “April, they don’t want you in the car. Get out.” To which she responded with, “f*ck off c*nt, you’re so annoying, just leave me alone.” To which I responded with, “don’t say that? My mum will be here in half an hour with the alcohol, why are you leaving in the car?”

She then mumbles “whatever.” Before the driver ends up leaving with April in the car and everyone else at the party hops into another car and decides to follow them.

I texted her, “when will you guys be back?” To which she responded “20 minutes.”

So I waited... all by myself...not for 20 minutes... But an hour.

I decided to wander down the road looking for them, but I couldn’t find them anywhere.

I then got a text from my mum saying she dropped the alcohol off at April’s house and so I wandered back to April’s house to find the car she was in, parked in her driveway. April stumbles out with the alcohol my mother got for her and so I said, “where is my alcohol?” And she replied with, “in the fridge, Oi guys hurry up!”.

I go to walk inside to grab my alcohol and I walk back out ready to party and.... yup, you guessed it!

They were gone.

So I sat there.... and waited for another 40 minutes... wondering where they went.

Angry with tears in my eyes, decide to walk down the street to my other friends house and I cried. I sat there telling them what happened and they comforted me.

BUT WAIT! 

This is the icing on the cake.


When my friend drove me home. I walk up my driveway to find everyone from April’s party at my parents house. Partying without me...

I walked up to April and yelled, “you left me behind!? All I wanted to do was hang out with you and you left me behind?!”

April severely drunk, lies in front of my face and says, 

“bro, I told you we were going to your house to party.”

So my question is...

Did I do the right thing un-friending her? Or am I just being childish?

105,I work in a small town with lots of elderly people as a server. We are doing to go orders only. The girl I worked with last week was coughing so much and not covering her mouth and was licking her fingers to separate plastic bags for customers food. I told her she should not do that and she responded by saying “what are they going to do lick the bags”. I would report it to the manager but unfortunately it’s her mom. I could report it to the owners but they probably would tell the manager and I don’t want drama!!! I thought about reporting it to the health department but I’m scared about my information being released since something similar just happened in WA state. Idk what to do. Please help :( I feel a responsibility for the lives of the elderly in my town but I’m not sure how to handle this,12May2020,2

110,"I have spent my whole life trying to get people to like me and putting on a persona that wasn't truly me. I made a ton of friends and became very popular and I absolutely had a nervous breakdown from being so performative and hating myself on the inside. I started going to therapy and taking antidepressants and now, one year later, I'm feeling better than I ever have. I tried reaching out to my old friends but they're hurt that I left them when I had my breakdown.

The thing is, I didn't tell them I had a breakdown. I don't like to tell people personal details. So now these friends think I was just selfish and shitty and acting overdramatic. I put on a happy face but in secret I was self harming. 

Anyways, how do I approach these friends without explicitly talking about my depression? It just sounds like a lame excuse...ex. sorry I didn't reply to your text I was depressed.

113,"I (female) don't know what to do. I've realized very slowly that my boss is orchestrating psychological warfare on me and my coworkers and I'm feeling very trapped. I'm going to do my best to be clear, but this has been developing for the past year now and it's hard to detail it all. 

Background: I work as a contracted member of management for a food and nutrition program in a long term healthcare setting. So, while there is a building of many people I have only 2 actual coworkers (1 male and 1 female) and a boss (female). One of my coworkers (female) shares the same job title as me, but we have separate duties though sometimes our work can overlap. As personality types we are as different as they come which can cause friction. This friction is worsened by my manager. This has taken me far too long to pick up on, but I've noticed my boss seems to thrive on causing internal conflict among the three of us subordinates. She constantly plays us against each other. Each of us is only given so much information and someone always is on the shortest communication line. Example: before I left work today to ugly cry my commute home, male coworker was sent an email by boss with a new management schedule. No one else was on the email and he was simply instructed to hang it up in the building. This schedule included changes to my days and hours, but I wouldn't have been informed if I hadn't been in his office when the email came through.

Male coworker (MCW) and I have been on the site for around a year longer than our boss or other teammate.  As such we had spent a long time alone together with no one else in our side (contact vs. client employees).  We got along well, bro-ing it up about video games and other media while making it through the work week.  However, several months ago it started with male coworker going on tirades about how it's unfair that there are 2 of mine/female coworkers job title and that one of us should be ""gotten rid of"" so he could have an assistant. The reason there are 2 of us is the workload for our job title is at minimum 2 FTEs. He was implacable over this and acted in such a hostile way to me and female coworker (FCW) that I should have consulted HR for hostile work environment  but I'm too non-confrontational and I couldn't bring myself to cause a problem plus I thought him a friend.  FCW is made of sterner stuff and can shrug these things off whereas I allow my insecurities to rule and become consumed.  After a couple months of this his behaviors improved and we were again chill working buddies. I now think in hindsight this was fueled by our boss. There is no reason for him to care as FCW/mine jobs do not overlap with his. 

Next,  about 6 months ago FCW becomes impossible.  Actively works to downplay anything I'm doing. Self promoting herself above the rest of the team to our clients. Cutting me out of my own projects, and so forth. As I said, we're very different and she's much more outgoing than I am and far less awkward. It seemed like a natural progression for a person of her confidence level to me at the time, she'd been around for 6 months at the time and I figured she was just really comfortable in her environment now.  Which isn't to say I wasn't deeply bothered, I kept trying to have our boss help define boundaries in our positions to reduce friction but I was mostly motivated by my need to lower my anxiety about being replaced. All the while, my boss is calling me constantly. It's not unusual to receive 15-20 phone calls in a day that she's not even in the office.  Calls after hours, long calls an hour or more multiple times a day no matter how inconvenient the timing.  Always rambling but impossible to get off of.  The calls during this time are all focused on me knowing that ""FCW is not your friend"", ""you need to hold her at a distance, don't trust her"", ""don't give her things, she'll take more than given"", etc. This isn't my nature, I just want everyone to coexist and be happy and have minimal conflict. But after months of this message, I got beat down and was doing what she said. Limiting conversations with FCW to essential only, not crossing paths as much as I can, jealously guarding ""my"" job territory. I became a horrible person to her. I claim no innocence in my actions, I sucked hard. I now suspect that FCW was receiving similar phone calls regarding me and how she should act toward me. 

Fast forward to last week in which FCW is rightfully upset and is threatening to quit. Get called into the office for an intervention. It was posed by boss as ""I need you two to come together and work on your differences"". She made us write ""I"" statements addressing the issues we have with one another and we were supposed to be in this mediated session.  It in actuality was an hour and a half beat down about how everything is my doing and I'm the one that needs to change and pretty much none of my issues were ""valid"". All the while boss keeps saying that no one is being replaced and she needs us both, etc. I feel very targeted in the past days and my gut feeling is that any of us is anything but secure. I seem to be the unwanted one right now. 

The past days have been miserable.  I'm now no longer receiving calls from boss, I have no information for the day to day things. I know this because coworkers keep asking for my input and I have to tell them I have no idea what they are talking about.  I feel so stupid constantly. When she does call, I typically miss it (see previous comment on the invariably bad timing of these calls), I'll call back in under 10 minutes typically. She's rejecting all my return calls, however,  sending me directly to voice-mail. She called me 9 times on Sunday and I called back the first 3 for her to tell me that she didn't call me. ???? I didn't return the rest. 

I apparently took too long on a task (delivering mother's day packages) and when asked why it took me longer than expected (I spoke with all the recipients to let them know they had a package and who it was from) my explanation was shut down with ""you care/do to much"" and I should have just dropped them off with no further actions.  Our residents are in long term care facility with no access to their families due to covid and I'm supposed to think that taking time to talk to them and read them their cards is too much? A lot of them have really bad eyesight, memory difficulties, or both! We're a hospitality company ffs. The next day I took too long on a vaguely defined task that FCW hadn't finished and she asked me to wrap it up, it apparently had a deadline for immediately this AM but I wasn't told that, so I was finishing it around 10 when boss was real hostile about it. I can't ask questions about anything because the vibe I get is ""that fucking cunt and her questions"". 

My self confidence, sense of belonging, and sense of security are toast. I'm definitely creeping around like a beaten dog, but I am afraid of when the next emotional whiplash and feeling that I'm a disappointment will happen. The covid crisis means that there's nothing out there job wise to move to and I'm a single earner, there's no other income for me to fall back on.  

A few other things I've noticed now that I'm the out kid is she seems to enjoy making jokes that clearly make me uncomfortable. She always cuts me off in conversation in belittling ways to the point that I now rarely put effort into being a part of the discussions. She makes frequently upsetting racist comments (our staff is largely black, we're all white) but justifies this as she ""knows a black friend who agrees"". She also makes homophobic comments but then justifies it as ""she's bisexual so it's not homophobic"". I'm queer, but as we're in a very conservative part of the country I'm not out to anyone outside of my closest friends.  So, that's awkward. 

I do not know what to do. I'm really afraid of retaliation from her if I say anything. I don't feel I can talk to my coworkers about this because I'm not confident they see what I'm seeing and they might rat me out as they are both in current good graces. I have warm relations with both of her direct supervisors but in my past experiences neither would react in a constructive manner for me. Every direction I turn looks like more conflict and none of it seems it would go in my favor. I feel I have lost the war. 

Tl;Dr: I suddenly fell from my boss's good graces and I just realized that she might be a horrible person who delights in pitting her team against each other. Also, I'm afraid for my job (that I need) and am suffering extensive emotional pain due to work. 

I really need advice on what I should do.",12May2020,1
114,"When I (F) was 16, I made friends at a community center with an older crowd (18-23). The center put on an overnight getaway for the youth every summer, and usually the 18-23 y/o would act as councilors and supervise the youth during the day and at night in the bunks. My councilor was a guy (22) from my friend group and another person who slept through most of his duties. As far as I knew, the friend was in an open relationship with his current partner (23F). I thought this because during a previous overnight trip, he had engaged in a sexual relationship with another friend of mine (15F) which lasted about a month. She explained to me that he and his partner were in an open relationship and his partner had established simple rules: 
1) she is told with who and what (to an extent)
2) Nobody from the friend group know, bc she didn’t want her relationship out there like that 

While away at the camp, I was dealing with emotional turmoil due to recent CPS involvement In my home life for neglect. As a result, I was having frequent panic attack, which would result in difficulty breathing and uncontrollable shaking. The person at the head of the camp asked the councilor/friend mentioned above to watch me and keep me company when I was having panic attack and couldn’t sleep at night. On the first night, he kissed me. I kissed him back; I had a small crush on him. Each night, he kept testing my boundaries, until eventually he slept with me. He explained to me the rules of his relationship with his partner, and they were identical to the ones I’d already heard. I didn’t have a reason to question him. I maintained a sexual relationship with them, and relied on them heavily for emotional support and comfort. He would make me feel safe, and would support me when I was scared/anxious. I fell in love with him. 10 months later, I received a phone call from his partner asking to meet bc his previous lover was making allegations of rape. I was horrified and agreed. We met at a park, and throughout the course of talking, it was revealed she knew nothing of his previous relationship or his current one with me. I was stunned and heartbroken. He was supposed to meet us at the park, but showed up two hours late bc he knew the cat would be out of the bag. When he arrived, he confessed that he had lied and told me he loved me to keep me in a relationship with him, all the while planning marriage and a family with his partner. I felt terrible for causing his partner pain as the girl he was having an affair with, and I feel like I’m to blame for not asking more questions. I just trusted in him so completely, and I feel like an idiot for allowing this to happen. I’ve had people blame me for what happened, and others who say he preyed on how naive I was. I don’t know what to think, but I feel like an asshole for hurting his partner. AITA for not questioning him and verifying what he told me ?",12May2020,1

116,Long story short I am very attracted to my sister. It started when I accidentally touched her boob while saying goodnight and escalated to me fingering her and putting my dick between her thighs while she is asleep. Except the first and last time I did the thigh thing she woke up a few minutes later and went to the bathroom and mentioned jokingly that she had woken up to me lying beside her in the night. However she was in one of the best moods I’ve seen in a while the morning after and has been more physically playful with me since. I need help I’m not sure if she wants it or what she’s thinking. Any insight would be great. Thanks,12May2020,0
118,"i'm not sure what i'm expecting from this. i'm at the point in my life where i don't think any form of help will do anything for me but i just wanted to give it a shot. maybe just to let myself vent even if no one sees this.

ive been diagnosed with depression and anxiety since i was about 16. i always knew something was wrong with me but it took a lot of convincing for my mom to finally get me to a neurologist. 

anyway, i've hit a road block. i'm 18 so a lot of this stuff may seem stupid or childish but it's what i feel. it's hard to even start my rant while making any sense. i always think about killing myself but i always told myself id never do it. im too scared. i could never hurt my mom like that. my friends would miss me. but now i've hit a block. every time i even get the tiniest bit sad, i go into a depressive episode where i want nothing more than to hurt myself and actually kill myself. i have strong urges now that i never had before.

one of the reasons why this is happening is probably all just in my head. i feel like my friends don't give a shit about me. and maybe im the asshole thats being an attention seeker but every time my friends need anything, i go above and beyond to help. i text long messages telling them im there, i make things to have them smile, i check up on them. it may seem stupid and materialistic but here's an example.

my friends dog died a few months back. she has depression and i was scared that she would go into bad episodes or whatever else so i decided to make a huge gift bag with drawings, notes to tell her i appreciate her, her favorite candies, etc. i made sure she was alright. i went through a pretty traumatic experience on christmas where my grandma died and i saw her dead body and i dont remember my friend saying anything to me about it. 

when i tell her and my other friend things, in our shared group chat, she always just reads the messages and never responds. i told them both that i think ive been molested in the past because of personal reasons and she just read the messages and acted like i never said anything. every time i go to her because im upset about something she just leaves me on read or delivered and doesnt bother responding. although, my other friend was nice about it and i appreciate her for it.

another example is my birthday. none of my friends told me happy birthday except for the friend that i mentioned earlier that was nice about me thinking i had been assaulted. (sorry thats probably confusing)

but, the other girl (the one that left me on read) didnt tell me happy birthday at all until on my actual party after my other friend said it first. almost like she needed to be reminded even though she was at my party. she had even made me push my party back because she had plans. i told her months in advance but then she suddenly had plans and tried to push me to just have my party with me and the friend that had been nice to me. it felt like she didn't even want to go.

none of my friends check up on me but i check up on them all the time. ive started to stop because ive been so unmotivated to even bother. i know its probably selfish but i just want someone to ask if im okay for once and actually mean it. ive been there for my friends so much and they act like they just dont fucking care when im upset. 

the friend that had been weird to me had even told me i dont have depression as bad as some people do when she literally knows nothing about me. i put up a professional front but i still have major depressive disorder and it just made me feel so invalidated. the exact event was that i had gone to my teacher because i needed to have some time to myself and after the class was over, my teacher had told me that i dont look like i have depression. that ""a lot of people in my classes look unstable but you're not one of them so i was worried when you came to me."" i told my friend this. i said ""im so stable yet i go to therapy and want to kms every single day"". my friend said ""youre a lot more stable than a lot of us tbh"".

that really rubbed me the wrong way so i tried to open up to her and let her understand my depression but she didnt have any interest. she'd always be too busy to talk to me about it. she, again, left me on read and acted like it never happened. maybe im just being dumb about it?

my mom has also started to lean on me more. she had a surgery that fucked with her head so shes been leaning on me for about a year now. i try my best to help her. i listen and give her the best advice i can provide. but when i try to open up to her and get stuff off my cheat, she always turns it about her. ill be ranting about what my sister did that day that pissed me off and she will start ranting about how she makes her so mad and how she cant stand her. yelling about how she needs to help more and not listening to me at all. 

she also tells everyone what i tell her. she texts my sister everything i tell her and today she found me crying before i could hide it. she then went and told my dad that im crying and she doesnt know why (in a pissed off voice), thus sending my dad to ""check"" on me where he then starts screaming about how everyone hates him. (hes mentally abusive and makes my life a living hell)

i dont know what to do. i cant afford to move out yet and idk if i should drop that friend. we have planned so many road trips and stuff but idk how much longer i can deal with such a one sided relationship. i also used to have a crush on her so that makes everything so much better. especially when she indirectly calls me ugly. 

anyway!! this was a lot but im glad i got it out. i go to therapy but now with covid-19 i cant see her for a while and my anxiety would kill me if i tried to video chat with my nosy family around. (plus just video chatting in general) my mom refuses to put me on meds because she thinks itll make me stupid and lazy but my depression is already taking care of that so how much worse could it get?? 

im trying to think of my future and the career and life i could have if i keep going but i sincerely cant see myself doing that. i dont think its a good enough reason to keep living anymore.",12May2020,1
119,"My ex broke up with me a about 6 weeks ago for reasons that did not make sense. For example, he said we were getting too serious too fast, but he was the one who introduced me to his family shortly before dumping me. The meeting went well even. He gave other reasons that made no sense to me, but I did not beg or ask him to reconsider. I respectfully accepted his decision. He immediately started seeing a therapist for the first time in his life and wanted to be friends. We tried that, but it didn't us work for me because I still wanted to be more than friends. I told him some things I thought he should work on with his therapist and that friendship wasn't working out. Long story short, he revealed that he actually broke up with me because he felt down and unworthy of me and like he was bringing me down with me. He said he regretted the breakup. I said that I wish we could start things again but only if he worked in therapy, I healed, and we both understood this relationship would be new. He agreed and said he would be open to that. I told him that I was going to block him for the next month but that he should send me a text if he was interested in starting something. 

I have had him blocked for the past 2 weeks. I miss him dreadfully. I saw his profile on a dating site, but I didn't think much of it. I'm not over him and I'm on that site, too. I think judging him based on that is unfair but worth mentioning.

121,"I’ll try make this short and sweet.

Firstly, I should mention nobody else apart from her drinks alcohol, so i’m certain it’s her finishing all the bottles.

My mum loves alcohol, I can’t remember the last time she hasn’t drank it. Our recycling box is collected every monday, and just last week I found 10 wine bottles in there, all finished in under a week. It truly does bother me, my family have tried to speak with her and she said she will give it up for a month to prove to us that she isn’t an ‘addict’. On the second day I caught her at night in the kitchen with a bottle in her hand.

Almost every night she struggles to walk down the stairs, and when she walks into the sitting room she stumbles, bumps into walls and her speech is slurred. I’ve got a 13 year old brother, and it’s really affecting him too.

Just today, a package of 9 wine bottles came addressed to her. On the receipt it mentioned a subscription, so I can only assume that there’s going to be boxes of wine coming in every week. 

Is there anything I could say to her to make her change her ways? I’m worried about her and I don’t want this situation to escalate before it’s too late.",12May2020,1

I keep warning her against what she’s doing and telling her she needs to understand the consequences of this: not only if anyone finds out about what they’ve done, but also what will happen once she leaves for school. I know she can live her own life and it’s not really my business. But I want to be a good friend and help her. What should I do?",12May2020,1
125,"Hi guys,

I’m 23, and about 1 week away from completing my bachelors degree in Chemical Engineering.

I have come to the conclusion that I do not want to stay within the Chem Eng industry for my future career. I would like to start my own business and work for myself whilst focusing on making money through my hobbies. However I understand that I need money to make money. Another note, I am eagerly wanting to move to London or out of the UK for my next stage in life. I need a change from my home.

So my options:

1) move to London and study Quantity Surveying   Masters at a standard uni. Starting salary is £30k. After becoming chartered (after 2 years of working) the salary will go up to £50-£60k. Abundant of jobs available in this sector.

2) move to London and stay within the chem eng or energy field and study at a top uni (UCL/Imperial). Hard to get a job and it’s gonna be a tough masters course. But could be a very useful degree within the future, especially at a top uni. (Or is this my ego talking?) 

4) compete an online teaching course over the summer and move to another country to teach English as a foreign language. Some countries within the Middle East pay ~£40k tax free annually. 

I plan on working for 2/3 years then put enough money aside to begin my business. Doing a masters means 1 year less of working.

I don’t know where or what to do next. Or even if these options are wise to do. 

People who are in similar positions, or were in similar positions; is it wise to earn as much money as possible whilst young so it sets me up. Or should I carry on studying even though I have no intention to stay within the sector no more than a few years. 

Any advice from elders would be appreciated 

Thanks in advance :)",12May2020,1

127,"Boy this is going to be a long, I don’t know if I’ll be able to finish it because it’s emotionally draining as heck go type this all out!!! :,) 

I’ll start off saying that I know this will seem so utterly stupid, trust me I beat myself up about it all the time ahhh.

This started in around 2017? I met 2 people online a guy (20-21) and a girl (17-18). We became friends and got closer and closer. We were friends for about a year and a half my friendship with the guy probably lasting 2 years? (Met him in advance.) I would like to add I’m a very mature person I even taught them lessons and how to be better people and go about life calmly. Something else to get very clear THESE PEOPLE WERENT PREDATORS, I will not pretend that they were worse than they already were to me. That sure does say something doesn’t it ha :/? Anyways as someone who in a very odd way was inherently emotionally neglected as well as emotionally abused (multiple times, from multiple people) having two older people who seemed to care about me, listen to my struggles, and be there for me, UH hello this had me VERY excited and happy. I had a support system, some people who cared who I talked to daily for the whole duration of our friendship. I became attached very quickly, and that attachment only grew with time. We even spent New Years Eve together 2017-2018. I called them multiple times, both together and separately and I always talked to them and by the time we were well into our friendship they both considered me their little sister and I considered them both my older siblings, the ones I never had lol. 

Anyways we’re gonna start going downhill now. So they got together April 2018, I was VERY excited lol, my two best friends together I was very happy! But as naive as I was I thought our dynamic would totally stay the same, I was still 13 at the time. Our dynamic changed, and they eventually grew more and more distant, especially the guy. I became very confused and hurt, I had abandonment issues and trust issues and now these people that told me they would never leave seemed that they could be leaving? I chose to calmly confront them about it, I asked them what was going on, if there was anything to do that I could fix this? Each other time I was told, “It’s fine, we’re not leaving you.” And than the behavior would continued, mind you I confronted them like this about 6-8 times. Until I finally said: “You’re not listening to me! And it’s incredibly frustrating.” And left it at that for a while. (Something to know is that I had and still have a major guilt complex, I am such a self-blaming person. Someone is mean to me I spiral for days and try to make it up to them, even if it realistically had nothing to do with me at all.) So after I said that, I felt like shit, I thought I was so awful to them and that I owed them an apology. So I apologized to them both, the guy answering in a more short way that I can’t remember much about, and the girl forgiving me and than saying something along the lines of: “You just need to be carful because you’re words can hurt people.” I got a bit upset, I said I meant what I said I just regret that I couldn’t have handled it more calmly and that I’m sorry they were hurt but it was the truth, they weren’t listening to me. We discussed, and I say how bad I felt how I felt our friendship was slipping away from me and I was so confused. She said: “I won’t pressure you take you’re time, I’m here if you need anything.” Or something along those lines, I said “Imma think, dw.” I was guilty for the telling the truth and I needed time to figure this out. A month later I’m calling a friend discussing how much this is tearing me up inside and how I want them back I just don’t know how to reach out. She made a group chat for me, and I thought the guy reached out to her this happened through miscommunication. We talk, it’s awkward, and the situation is dodged. The girl continue the problem I apologize and say my peace. No response, I ask how we expect to work this out if no one is responding and she goes off on me. She tells me this is my fault, I should and should have been handling this better. (Basically the main point of her message with more small things she went after that aren’t worth bringing up tbh.) I fall apart my guilt is SO bad as soon as I read this message all my fears are coming true, I feel like the worst person alive and that I need to apologize for all the terrible things that I’ve done. So I do that. She responses, with the guy not saying anything mind you, and says how I failed to see the point, saying basically again this is my fault and that the friendship is over. I read this message on the school bus, and I get home and start sobbing, again. I respond saying I respect their choice and that I’m so sorry and that their right, it was all my fault. I was wreaked, and than the spiraling begun, I reflect on our friendship constantly at school barely paying attention, I refuse to let it go, I’m so confused and yet I hate myself more than ever for being such an awful person, and go from questioning why and hating myself for even wondering. I become extremely dissociative at school I go through the day feeling nothing, and than I go home and cry when I can. I even reach out a few days later trying to fix it, and apologizing even more, they told me they appreciate my apology but they rather not be friends. (The guy said this, I left the chat before the girl responded, I became pretty fearful of her after she announced how it was all my fault.) 

New 8-10 months are filled with so much confusion anger and sadness, I felt so much guilt, and I hated myself; sometimes I hated them, and than felt guilty about that. It was just, I can’t express how those months felt, TW I believed I deserved to not live because I was such an awful person, I believed no one can truly care for me if they knew who I was (because they did) and that everyone would just leave me. And that’s just a fraction of it, because of the event, and the spiraling I have developed an attachment issue, Fearful Avoidant. I had this kind of before but after this it got SO MUCH WORSE. Even to this day when I get close to someone I emotionally shut off, and especially in emotionally intimate events I completely turn off. I can’t trust people, I self-isolated without me realizing for so long. And eventually I asked to talk to them June 2019, asked to talk this out on call and hear what I did wrong, and trying to express what happened. 

All I can say is the basically still blamed me, and said what the girl said before in October 2018. Not funnnnnnnnn, I got more mad afterwards. Less confused, but my mix of emotions remained the same.  I think I was better at understanding that maybe this wasn’t my fault. And in August 2019 I started therapy and this issue was something I really needed to address and I did, I’ve talked to so many people about this trying to show myself in the light that I saw myself for so long, and everyone told me it wasn’t my fault. My previous therapist did that. And I got some help, I better understood that maybe I wasn’t to blame, I know I made mistakes but I never deserved what happened especially as a 14 year old. 

So I continued life still unable to attach to people, with episodes where I relived it, times I tried to cut other people off emotionally before they could do worse to me. I was paranoid, scared, I still am. (Mind you when they first left I had many nightmares about it; one even where I was murdered by the girl for all the terrible things she said I had done. My OCD even got much worse after their leaving, where I barely slept, though my OCD was school based I don’t think it’s surprising that after this event it got much worse.) 

So I still dealt with it, I still hung onto it, still had flashbacks, feared nightmares, still can’t and couldn’t be attached to people for more than a week without emotionally turning off without my control, and I was better. But I was still very much effected, I was still and I am still very hurt. I’ve been told that my whole brain now sees relationships as a threat, I don’t fear abandonment as much as I fear closeness. Mind you I made a point to never lash out because of this, expect for being angsty towards my parents I guess. (Who have no idea this happened.) when I emotionally turned off I made a point not to show it, so no one else but me got hurt. I would actively search for a person who I wouldn’t turn off with, I would start new friendships ride the high of feeling safe and than be tossed out in the cold again. It sucked. Anyways I’m still dealing with all that. 

So what’s changed, well the girl messaged me May 7th, and damn was I shocked, as soon as I got the message I sobbed as the big baby I am. She took the blame; she said she was sorry and she said she had hoped that I had gotten over it and that I had good friends in my life. I eventually was able to respond after a weird panic attack, and thanked her for the apology and asked to call her and try to talk it out a bit more, she declined because of her guilt. And we talked a bit, I think I was a bit overly nice because I felt bad that they were guilty, and oddly I was a bit excited that she messaged me while also hurt, angry, surprised just the whole package man. I wanted to be mature and I wanted to be nice and I kind of regret it a bit. She eventually asked me to forgive her and the guy, I said I didn’t think I could do it yet, and again to my surprise she said she understood. I reframed form going deeply into the impact this has had on me, and I said I would message her once I had forgiven her: and we left things. And I felt weird I was dissociative again and had breakdowns again, I felt like I owed them forgiveness, and that it shouldn’t affect me anymore. I also just felt like telling them all I’ve been through? I want them to understand their impact, especially since she seemed to only feel bad since she was older. IDK ha, I still feel bad about it but my friend said it’s like someone punched me in the face and than said sorry, they would still have to see the damaged in a physical form, mine was just emotionally. And I’m confused and I feel so many things, especially since I had many versions of these people in me head. (Ones I loved, ones I feared, ones I hated, you name it.)

And now I’m here still hurt, out of therapy, confused newly 16, and unable to be sure how to deal with all of this. Any advice would be so helpful. And if you read all of this thank you, this is my first reddit post and I’m only doing so because my friend thinks it’ll help me to get advice and support from total strangers. And please If you have anything no nice to say, trust me I’ve thought that and worse, don’t waste you’re energy I don’t think I can feel more guilt.

Anyways thank you and I apologize if I said anything wrong cause again this is my first post. And uH sorry for spelling / grammar edits, too tired to re-read this. Writing this already made me pretty emotionally drained.",12May2020,1
128,"My girlfriend had cooked me some chicken strips on the 9th, and I only took one bite before my stomach became immediately upset and I felt as if I was going to throw up. I called in sick to work and slept all night. On the 10th we had a barbecue and I tried to eat a hamburger and I had the exact same results as the chicken strips. On the 11th I decided to experiment. I had some Lipton chicken noodle soup and I ate that fine, I had a hotdog which yielded the same results as every other meat, and I had a grilled cheese sandwich. Everything worked out except for the meat. Literally almost the moment the meat enters my stomach it feels as if my body is trying to get rid of it.

129,"You are a transfer student and you have two options

A) University #1

A great school, 2nd best in its state. A 15k per year scholarship BUT it only last two years. This school is competitive to get into, 33% acceptance rate, and 22% acceptance rate for transfer. Rigorous academics, amazing city, great party life, beautiful weather all year round. Seems like the perfect fit BUT this scholarship lasts only for 2 years when you still anticipate atleast 3 years of academics ahead.

&amp;#x200B;

B) University #2

A pretty good school, known for its amazing location in an iconic (but expensive city) and very diverse. A 15k per year scholarship that lasts beyond two years. 66% acceptance rate and unknown transfer acceptance rate. People say it's very small and close but also not much school spirit. Amazing location, lots of life around with great weather. Has a 5 year program to get a teaching certification and double major.

I am SO conflicted, I don't know where to turn to and who to ask for help. If this was you, where would you choose? University #1 and just figure out my final year how to suffice that 15k?

130,"Hi guys. I’ve been having roommate problems because of the shelter-in-place order. I live in SF, CA btw.

Long story short, my roommates keep having guests in the apartment and I voiced my concerns. I asked them not to have them, but they kept ignoring me. Today, one of the roommates did something that was something that proved she did not respect me at all, and I really started to want to move out of the place.

I am not on the lease, and it is already pretty sketchy that I am living there (I found out this very recently). But the lease will be up in August, and they seem to assume that I will be sticking around till then. 

After the disrespectful gesture, I started to look for places and found a pretty good one that fits my needs. The one problem is, they are looking for someone to move in starting from June. 

Should I just leave my current apartment? I am thinking of giving them a 30day notice before I leave and pay the rent till then, but I don’t know how would they react. 
I am also concerned of the safety of the people that I will be moving in with. I don’t want to harm others by carrying them in the virus, if I had it on me.

TL;DR; Current roommates doesn’t follow shelter-in-place order and ignores my concerns. Want to leave apartment, but also concerned about health of the people of the new place through me joining them. Also concerned of how current roommates would react to moving.",12May2020,2

134,"Sorry for the long post, but Being an outside party I’m going to try to explain the situation as best as I can in hopes that someone with more legal knowledge than myself can help. One of my best buds (20M) was recently separated from his girlfriend and the fight over their child has been brutal. With no prior/current evidence or suspicion of child neglect/domestic violence, she was able to place a protection order against him for her and the child. Not seeing his son has been breaking him down mentally, and after tonight he has started telling me he has no will to live, and as a helpless friend it is truly shitty to watch my friend get beat down by his ex.  

They were together for 3 years prior to the event that occurred 3 weeks ago. They have been happy together the entire time (from what I’ve seen and what he’s told me) and about 4 months prior to the event they moved into a property owned by my friends parents. I wasn’t around very often at this point as he was busy building his family which I totally respect, but we kept in touch over Xbox and messenger occasionally. He randomly called me completely broken down the day after said event and the rundown is this
“
Girlfriend cheated on me last night. She had a very snappy demeanor from the moment I got off work, and eventually at 9:30 she told me I needed to go to my parents because she needed a night alone with her son. I was skeptical but I packed a bag and chose just to leave it be and let her have her space. Was at my moms watching Tv when around 11:30 I got a notification that our ring doorbell had been disconnected from WiFi, and I knew something was up because that is the 1st time it’s disconnected since we moved in. I drove Over to see what was up, and there was a random car in my spot. I started walking up to the door when I saw her silhouette rush to the front door and flip off the porch light (she knew he had arrived because Friend drives a loud truck) and she proceeded to pin the door shut while he was unlocking it and screaming that he needed to leave. I decided I wasn’t having it and jumped into the backyard to slide through our bedroom window (which is the sub ground level of the house.) She left our son downstairs unattended crying. I rush up the stairs and find two guys, one not wearing a shirt, who she’s yelling at me are “just friends hanging out” and I tell them to get the fuck out of my house. I began to pack the baby’s bag up because I definitely wasn’t going to leave him their after that, and she smacked the shit out of me. I still have the photo of the handprint on my cheek, but the police told me I was too rosy for it to be used in court. As I was walking down the stairs, she was cussing me out and standing in front of the stairs, so I brushed her with my shoulder trying to get by and I got the fuck out. Apparently she told the police I hit her and that she didn’t call the cops right off the bat because she was afraid to get hit again.” 

Now I know this friend well, and this point in time he lived for 2 things: his son and his girl. He wouldn’t fight anyone, so I know for a FACT he was not hitting his girl, and most DEFINITELY not his son. When the judge asked if she had ever been hit prior to this incident, girlfriend replied verbatim “he’s never touched me or his son”. But him having proof of being assaulted and not being taken seriously has blown me away. They’re just trying to fuck with his head to make him look like a bad parent now. In the past month he was supposed to have seen his son numerous of times with a court approved supervisor, but do to Covid he has only been allowed to see him twice for 30 minutes a pop, supervised by non other than girlfriends weak excuse of a man that she calls stepdad. Stepdad berates my friend with negative comments and makes the entire situation terrible, but this fact was glossed over at there most recent court hearing. 

I hate to say that the court system is prejudice against men, but I’m literally watching my friend catch the shaft for being a “bad parent” when I know for a fact that he was the primary earner and the primary caretaker at that house. She has been granted a public defender while friend struggles to pay his lawyer. I know this is a lot for one post, but what can I give to my friend as actual useful advice or solutions, rather than just support? At this rate, she is going to completely crush his spirit and I’m so afraid of not being able to get him back. 

Tldr; friend is being mega shafted in court after girlfriend made false abuse claims over an argument that she started after cheating on him while leaving their child in another room.",12May2020,1

137,"Last year I \[16M\] fell for this girl \[16F\]. I was certain she liked me too. She would come sit with me in the library to study, just the two of us. She would laugh at all my jokes. She would try to find the closest seat in the classroom to me. She would chat me up and act super bubbly and sweet, she does not act this way around most people. I thought I was the luckiest guy in the world. She was smart, funny, athletic, a great musician, and incredibly pretty. I built up the courage, and after 4 months of her acting like this I asked her out. 

I said ""hey, do you want to go out sometime? For dinner or a movie?"" She responded, ""oh, do you like me?"" I said that I did, a lot.  She said, ""while to be honest I think you are really sweet and great, but a little too short."" I was floored I was 5'10"" and this girl was at most 5'6"". I asked why the height was a problem, and she said, ""If I wore heels I would be taller then you, that is the problem."" I said that I understood, and moved on.

It is a year later, and I am 17 now and was fortunate to have a growth spurt in the last year. I'm 6'0.5"" and gained a fair amount of weight (muscle not fat). Even though I said that I moved on, I really didn't. I love this girl, the way she talks, the way she laughs. My brain goes numb around her. I can't get her off my mind. My question is whether I should ask her out. I'm taller now and she is the same height, I can't imagine I'm too short now.

142,"I am a Latinx woman of Uruguayan (mother), Colombian and Dominican descent (father). Now, my father is a brown-skinned man and in the summer he's often mistaken for African-American. He's an immigrant and not extremely educated on current race/ethnicity convos, so he just identifies as Latino v Afro-Latino despite hailing from a town near the Haitian border, etc etc. Now, I've always felt that I was white passing - unlike my sisters, I don't have their curly, more textured hair. I am the palest of the family. Even other Latinx will often mistake me, here in NYC, for an ""American"" or a white/caucasian person. Mostly, people just find me racially ambigious.

However, all my life I was raised by my family being told we weren't white- and we felt that way very much. I've seen anti-black racism against my father and brown sisters, even within our urban communities. I've been followed around in stores, told I don't belong in my prestigious uni, and experienced microaggressions all my life. I've experience anti-latino discrimination and, aside from my lighter complexion and hair, I have my father's wide nose, I have my obvious latin accent from learning English as a second language. I've never, ever felt like a white american or a white woman and I have never, I think, been recognized as such.

Except for now. Months ago, an ex sub-tweeted me on twitter when I said ""we women of color"" (re: Latinx and Afro-Latinx women) and told me I'm not allowed to say that because I am a ""white person"". This was never an opinion she expressed when we were dating. She said just because I'm  hispanic doesn't mean I'm black or afro-latina and essentially called me a racist. I was shellshocked. As a Puerto Rican who identifies as a WOC herself, I was stunned- so many of the Puerto Ricans I know are whiter looking than I am! So many of them literally hail from Italian and Spanish ancestry! Meanwhile, my Uruguayan grandmother was considered a ""black woman"" (obviously this was incorrect, but the anti-blackness in Uruguay prompts absolutely disgust) for her darker, more typically Brazilian features and my father is literally a brown-skinned dominican man.

Was she right? I am so confused. I have heard it said that Latinx is not a race, but aren't many of us Latinos a mix of Afro-Carribean, indigenous,  european, etc? Isn't the entire concept of the latinx ""race"" one in which there's actually been so much mixing of races and ancestry that describing some as white or black isn't true to the reality? No offense intended, I'm just so confused.",12May2020,1
143,"Sorry for long post, but this needs background.

 I've had my braces on for a little bit over a year now. I had them put on when I was 16. My mom chose the ortho and settled for a shitty little place that operates horrendously despite being a part of a larger health organization. Claustrophobic, uncomfortable waiting room, uncomfortable operating rooms, incompetent staff, extremely limited schedule. The minimum wait time is guaranteed to be 3 hours. On one occasion, they *deliberately* delayed my appointment by about 2 hours so that I would be the last patient they would see. The procedure took less than *fifteen minutes*. We could only schedule appointments on Tuesdays and Thursdays. No explanation for this. 

I've been miserable the whole time. I had TWO [expanders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palatal_expansion#/media/File:Hyrax_rapid_palatal_expander.png) in at the same time for more than a year, and when I went to see my dentist during that time they couldn't believe I could still eat. Once, one of the nurses was helping the doc cement some brackets back on and fucked up the alignment, but didn't say anything. He had to come back in and *rip the brackets off* to glue them on correctly. On at least three separate occasions, I've had a doctor put in a wire incorrectly and I've had to readjust it myself or just put up with the pain if I couldn't do it. I've broken so many brackets that at this point I'm not sure if I'm the one who's fucking up. 

Now, because of the pandemic, I haven't been able to see my ortho. I've missed at least three appointments. I was getting really close to the end of my treatment, but this is going to be a major setback, especially considering I've broken three brackets, two of which are the rear brackets that pull the teeth, and I swallowed one of them. We have orthodontic cement on the way so I can (try) to reattach the ones I still have, but without that other rear bracket there's bound to be some issues and I can't find any replacements online. 

I'm just tired. I'm really, really tired of dealing with this shitty ortho. I missed so much school, had to deal with so much bullshit from my teachers and the doctors, and to be honest I think it's fucked with me psychologically. I just wanna say fuck it and buy the pliers and pull them all out. I did some research into this and apparently it's not a good idea cause it can fuck up the progress you've made with your straightening and will likely be painful, but like I said, I've had them rip these suckers off before because of the incompetence of others. I know it's going to hurt, but keeping these shits in is going to hurt more, and at this rate I don't care about having straight teeth. I want my fuckin mouth back. 

So, the **ACTUAL** question I have is: if I were to remove my braces on my own, would we be responsible for paying for the rest of the procedures that WOULD HAVE been done? Could this cause some kind of legal issue in the vein of ""interference with the procedure"" or ""withholding payments""? Is this even my best bet?

I wanted to ask here before I contact the organization directly, because, tbh, I trust internet strangers more than corporations. Also because I trust that there are folks on this site who have done this and actually know the consequences.

145,Before I start I am a 27 year old male with a disability (wheelchair). Since this outbreak started I have not been very active as much as I was. Normally I am in the gym 3 to 4 times per week to keep myself active and lose weight. I would roll around and stay active but my doctor ordered me to stay home because I am considered hi risk. Any suggestions on what kind of excersise I could do?,12May2020,1
147,"I'm pissed as I'm writing this and made a reddit account because my friends are no help in advice.

I come from a toxic family. My father was abusive, my mother was the same way to her children (she became what she claimed she'd never be) sometimes was complacent in our treatment. Either way, I've had a rocky relationship with my family and regarded as the black sheep because of it. I've suggested we mend our traumas through therapy or self awareness of the ways we hurt each other, but they have done nothing but dismissed me or made me feel like I'm the crazy one. My friends have been witnesses to the madness that goes on in my home so I feel less crazy about it.

My mom yells-ALOT every moment she gets a chance to complain, she will take it. I can't even have my zoom meetings unmuted because theres always yelling. She also will bang on the doors (which she just did before I got fed up and wrote this post) and my sister (31F) is her best friend and laughs at the fuqery. I get called nasty, useless, a bitch, a whore. All my friends who have taken me in before when I was kicked out, they're all whores to her. I'm told at least 4 times a week to go live with my dad and every piece of change I get, it has to go to her. I'm going into my senior year of college and have only saved 2K from my years of working minimum wage retail. When she first kicked me out and I went back and forth getting my things, she condemned me for letting her kick me out and told me I was stupid. When my aunt was living with us and starving me in high school, she told me I deserved it for not telling her about it even though we'd get in worse trouble when she went to work. I developed a eating disorder because my family made fun of my weight (I was literally skin and bones with a slight pudge) and I've developed body dysmorphia into my adulthood. 

I'm not without fault. I use to do chores in highschool, but in college I would commute 2 hours to and from school work until 11 and would come home around midnight everyday (even weekends) so I couldn't do my fair share of chores anymore which made my mom upset and call me lazy even though I've explained my daily schedule to her. I would give her money, but my checks are less than $200 (part time, minimum wage) and I can barely eat off that alone.

When I went through depression and let my room get dirty. I cried every night and let my mind drift into darker waters, but she dismissed me as dramatic when I spoke to her about it and yelled at me about my room even when I asked for help cleaning it. When I was admitted into the hospital for stress and being overworked, I was yelled at a day later about wasting her time to pick me up. 

My sister is exactly like her in every way, but shes more arrogant and haughty. I always almost come into blows with her because shes condescending in every way she talks to people. She called me a peasant in front my mom who didnt do anything to stop her. 

She let my little brother push me and get in my face and when I defended myself, she hit me instead. That situation alone happened yesterday on Mothers Day.

Going through a pandemic with a family like this has made me stay pent up in my room and wish that I had the means to move out more than anything, but I'm so afraid to because I only think about how she says I will never make it out here alone and a big part of me believes her. 

I dont know what to do. I dont make enough money to move out, but I hate every second of being here. In your responses, I only ask you be respectful since this is still my mom. That's my only request.",12May2020,1
148,"Hi, recently I’ve become worried and don’t know what to do. My (22F) best friend (24M) has begun dating and I’m scared of losing the friendship or us drifting apart. I understand that when friends get into a relationship they’re going to be distant but the thought of even just being a little distant scares me to the point I’m crying all the time. We’re extremely close (calling and talking everyday), and he’s never dated before so this isn’t a situation we’ve encountered. I’m also scared to bring it up to him because I’ve previously had a crush on him and I’m afraid he and his girlfriend will take this as me having a crush. 
I don’t have many other friends as they’ve all moved to different countries and he’s the only person I have nearby and see everyday, he’s my family. How do I get used to sharing my best friend and what are some activities I can do to keep occupied? Any advice is welcomed",12May2020,1
149,"I lost my grandmother about two years ago. She was in her late 70s and survived breast cancer, a brain aneurysm, a cracked skull, and had been in and out of hospice. She was well for a while but very sick and in a lot of pain before her final days. I saw it coming, and that gave me peace.

Today, however, my friend called me to tell me that our mutual friend, her ex partner of 6 years who I had grown to love, took their own life four days ago. I am devastated and feel like every “normal” thing I try to deal feels wrong. I feel resentful of being so happy the past three days of blissful ignorance. I’m shocked, I feel numb at times and at others I can’t stop crying. 

My friend was 24 years old. Me friend and I admitted to one another that we have also felt suicidal since quarantine started. Now, thankfully, I could never imagine doing something like this willingly. 

I do not know whether I need advice on dealing with grief, other than waiting it out and avoiding the “I could’ve, should’ve, would’ve done things differently”. But if anyone reads this just know that you are not alone and to check on your friends and family, even if they seem well.",12May2020,1

If I don’t watch myself this will negatively affect my life as a lot of the information I’m sharing has to do with how people close to me are treating me. They run a business and if this gets out it could make my life difficult and they will come after me. Although they made decisions, I will have to pay.

151,"So this semester was a pretty funky one, so I decided to pass/fail all my classes. And I am normally an A/B student, but I come from a family of overachievers. My mom and my sister were both valedictorian, and my mom went to MIT and got straight A’s there, so I’ve always been the odd one out. Like I’ve always been afraid to come home with my grades because even an A- isn’t really good enough for my family. And this semester I was taking linear algebra and I was really struggling with it, and because everything switched over to online learning, I didn’t have access to tutors anymore. Additionally, the professors decided to increase the difficulty of things because they didn’t want people to cheat, and they gave us no extra time to take exams. Like an exam that would have taken 3 hours in person we had to take in 3 hours, despite the fact that we had to upload our work, which took a lot of extra time especially for those with slow internet like me.  And I guess all that just combined in the worst way and so I failed the class. Since it is pass/fail, I don’t think it will impact my GPA, but the class is a graduation requirement, and it will show up on my transcript. And I don’t know what to do. I don’t feel like I can tell my family about it, and I don’t really have room in my schedule to retake the class, so I am going to have to overload on classes, which is going to make things even more of a struggle.

In a lot of cases it's trivially easy to find the real girl's profile, like just a couple of minutes. Not that I'm the internet police, but there's something particularly disgusting about plastering someone's everyday photos next to a bunch of sexual text, and in a lot of cases these people will go into graphic detail about pretty extreme kinks and stuff they want done to them.

I don't know what laws are being broken but I think these people should be stopped, I just don't know the best way to go about it. I feel like the girls deserve to know their photos are being used, but I'm a little afraid of my own identity getting back to the catfishers and putting me in danger.

I (17F) drive a 2011 Chevy Impala. My driveway is on a slight incline, so I have to back out, turn, and then I'm on my way.

To see my boyfriend, I have to back out, turn, make another turn to get on the main street, and then I navigate through town before I get on a highway for about ten miles. Then, I'm in town again, and the rest is easy peasy.

We'll probably just drive around for a bit or maybe go to his place. Then, I'll be on my way back home.

I'll be seeing him at around 1:30am, if all goes to plan.

I called and emailed to ask if they were sure it was in-person since our state was under stay at home orders. They said of course the interview is in person as they are considered essential. I got a little annoyed but responded with what I thought was a well thought out email. 


I wrote *""this job is an essential service but job interviews are not. Additionally, [the whole field] has been moved to an online format, interviews could be as well. 
I'm put in a position where if I say no to the interview I'm not a dedicated potential employee but if I attend I could get sick either at [the site] or on the drive up (for instance at gas stations). 
Not only is it* technically *violating state guidelines [where I live] is asking residents not to leave the county. And [neighboring county] sheriff is pulling folks over. Even if I took the risk and wore a mask I may not even make it up there.  
Thank you for the interview offer but at this time I will be unable to attend. I am truly sorry for the late notice. Best of luck on your job search.*


The hiring manager responded with *""sounds like the restrictions in your county are much different than what is in place in our county.  Had I known this earlier, it may have been possible to set up an online interview.  Thank you for your interest in the position.  I wish you the best of luck.""*


I interviewed for two other jobs but didn't get them. I just saw that the position I would've been interviewing for still hasn't been filled. I'm now in a place where I really need a job and thought at least one of the other ones would pan out.

174,"This doesn't just apply to my friends. It's not a one way street. I just need some help. 

I have a group of friends that tend to have a inner circle instead of it being a whole blob. And it seems 1 or 2 people sit in the inner circle. Every time they have to leave, everyone else does. Every time they hate someone, everyone else does. It seems plain toxic to me. But I, as said it's not just them, have fallen to this. I have avoided those they hated and left usually when they left. Not so much leaving but avoiding, for sure. And I regret that. 

About two months ago, I had broken down and starting cracking down on them. Knowing their dynamic, they'd talk about people's outrageous actions like probably if they had the chance to laugh about my anger outbursts they would cause it's really bad. But basically I had been texting them to ""talk shit about me"" or ""bash my attitude"" and other related things. Just in general trying to get them to do what they'd usually do behind my back and once again though through assumption. This however easily got turned around because probably the only friend I trusted with being honest with helped me open up a bit more and my days of holding in everything went away and it helped me be more open.

And everything happening recently is probably just me cooling down from switching my attitude so quickly as in letting everything be open instead of holding it in. So my friend suggested it was just me cooling down. And I definitely see that. Everything that angers me recently is stupid stuff. I make assumptions, I can burst out, but the key problem is once again my assumptions. Like I'll assume if no one is in a call with me, they're ignoring me. If no one's playing a game with me, they're ignoring me. And I will admit I tend to stalk them on game platforms and see if they're online. I'm not going to excuse my actions because it's ""for my own insecurity"". Someone's privacy is not something I should be looking at but mainly the extent is just simply to see if they're online. And that's usually where I make the assumptions. I tend to put two and two together. My friend just got off but our mutual friend is online but in a group. That's where I put it together they're playing together. And where my exclusion feelings come in. I feel left out. Or they're playing a game and say ""we're not calling"" but in my mind they are. And once again, I feel left out.

A little backstory why I seem so stalker like is simply because I have attachment issues. Being abandoned by your birth mom doesn't help at all. And given I didn't remember at all, that knowledge that I was abandoned probably affected me as a growing adolescent. So I tried the only thing I knew would keep people with me. 

Try to spend as much time with them as I could. 

This once again isn't an excuse but just a reason as to why I might be acting that way. I feel bad that my friends have to deal with this but at the same time the assumption they're ignoring me ignites a flame inside of me that angrily yells ""Tell me about why you're ignoring me instead of just doing it!"" or ""Tell me what I did that angered you!""

I had tight friends and amazing relationships. We experienced new things together and had no worries. Life was what I wanted out of it.

Back then, I felt like I could die and be happy.

Now I feel terrified and empty because the magic is gone with those times and many of the people.

I’m hung up on those magic times I spent with the people I love. Many of those tight friends grew to be toxic people that I cut out. The relationships ended. I’m always stressed and overall unhappy. I haven’t been happy in years.

Now my life is not bad at all, and arguably pretty great. I’ve dated very high quality women since, I still have my tightest friend, I’m doing work that I’m passionate about. But none of it makes me happy.

I know I’ve been feeling this deep down for a while, but after being completely alone for two months during this pandemic, it’s really made me reflect.

I’ve now recently been able to see my friend and parents (safely of course) in person. Got to see my dogs that have been living with my parents. I’m making great progress in my work, been writing music and learning a new language very fast.

But I am just empty.

I’m seriously missing one of my long term exes that I had a particularly passionate relationship around that magical time (she’s part of why it was magical).

I try to tell myself that it’s just the times I associate around her, and I know I’ll be able to love someone else (and I have since, just not as intensely) but I know I’ll always love her.

I talked to my friend about it and we both feel just unhappy, missing those good times from the past.

It was the golden age.

How can I have a second golden age? I don’t want my life to peak in my early 20s and just coast on by till I die. I want to build up and have new magical experiences. I want to feel that same passion for life as I used to.",12May2020,1

183,"I need help, But I need advice how to go about ending a friendship.
Also not amazing at writing 

Back in middle school I became “friends” with a girl out of feeling pity on her. She’s never been cool had no friends.  She was.. is kinda different.. She was getting picked on for  whatever reason kids are assholes... i stuck up for her because she didn’t deserve it. (No one does) I’m not going to go to deep into detail but I let her sit with me and my friends and stuff durning lunch. My friends couldn’t stand her and she didn’t feel comfortable because she couldn’t relate to them. so eventually it turned into me finding different ways to make her feel less alone? 

it gradually got out of hand she started stalking me, calling my house phone multiple times a day I had to ask mom to say I was busy she would ramble for hours about church and god (I’m atheist and have been for a long time I didn’t grow up with religion) I brushed it off because believe what you believe I won’t judge. She triedcountless times to take me to her church I caved once but I really didn’t want to I ended up feeling sick and had very creepy vibes at her church.. it felt cult like. I’ve been to other churches before that for weddings and funerals and never had those weird vibes before. 

Her mom was a very... interesting person and like controlled every aspect of her life she couldn’t do things normal kids were doing like watching anything PG -13 and at the time that was basically our age. She still watches veggie tales.. she couldn’t listen to rock music and kinda just forced to be a child forever. 13 years later she still lives at home and has a curfew of 10pm talks like a child, very immature. She’s been driving me insane for years. 

I’ve tried to set boundaries but she’s the same kid from middle school she stalks my Facebook my Instagram my phone she sends me links to stupid things she spams me with dumb stuff she comments on absolutely anything I post and is kinda socially awkward she compares herself to me and gives back handed compliments. She’s belittled me trying to over come my eating disorder by telling me how much weight I’ve gained and how she’s skinnier than me now. Like that really triggered me.. I’ll post a photo she will comment  “ oh your hairs finally growing out haha mines really long it just grows so fast”  I’m getting tired of her stalking me and spamming me and doesn’t get the hint when I tell her “sorry i don’t wanna talk right now I’m not in a social mood” and she’ll still spam me. She will comment on everything and if I don’t “like” her comment or reply she will be like “hey I commented on your post did you see I said this wasn’t sure if you seen” and send a picture of her comment. 

I’m just overwhelmed and I’ve tried countless times to end this friendship because it’s just never worked out tho because I feel guilty and it’s been far too long I’ve went years without talking to her (when I was in a abusive relationship I couldn’t have social media’s) and the second I reopened it she found me on EVERYTHING. And I tried to unfriend  her she’s find a way to message me and ask about it and i would have to lie and give a bullshit I was cleaning my friends lists out and must have accidentally deleted you.... I ignore 90% of her messages give short reply’s and I still get 20 messages a day  with dumb stuff that I don’t relate with.. 

Not that it matters I’ve always been alternative and our “friendship” was always weird to many including me but I wanted to give this poor girl a chance. Now we are in mid 20s I wanna finally cut the cord.. because it’s never been a good fit I can’t say she isn’t a nice girl and I could care less at how she chooses to live her life But I don’t want to be part of it. I don’t want to hurt her feelings but I don’t want to keep this going the rest of my life over guilt",12May2020,1

193,"Me and my cousin were really close when we were kids. She’s 3 years older than me. We’d play together all the time. I don’t remember how old I was or how exactly long it went on for (approx 2 years) but she used to teach me about sex. I was definitely under 10 years old, and very very innocent. She used to play games with me such as house, and make me get into bed with her. She didn’t touch any private parts, and I didn’t have breasts yet  but she did touch me under my shirt and move her body right against mine, and tell me to “dance” in bed. She would make me tie my shirt into a bra. I didn’t know any better because I was a kid. I guess one day I realized it was wrong and I told my mom. My mom told her mom and then we stopped talking. To this day we barely even say hi. I know this wasn’t rape or assault, but i know it traumatized me because there’s not a day that goes by that I don’t think about it and get flashbacks. She messed up my brain and I became aware of sex and sexual things at a young age. Even after we stopped talking, I picked up on the habits she taught me and tied my shirt up and told my school friends about sex, and even made up scenarios with them. (I know it’s disgusting) I didn’t realize it was wrong, or I guess I subconsciously used that as a way to protect myself? Or justify what she did? But after a few years, it started catching up to me, and I realized how wrong it was what she did and how she infiltrated my mind. now I am a very insecure, closed off, shy, and unfulfilled person, and I’ve been struggling for years and years to heal. I’ve turned to repression, and it’s not working. I tend to self sabotage. I am afraid to show anyone how weak I truly am. Any words of advice or anything is helpful, I am deteriorating.

195,"A friend of mine paints. She used to take orders and have clear pricing for her work. She would paint for me for full price (which was a reasonable one), or sometimes at half or no cost at all as for a friend. Then she moved to another country that has more expensive costs of living (which likely resulted in the described below). She stopped taking orders, but would take them if you asked. So I asked. Then, I asked how much it would come out to. She said, we’ll see after it’s done.

I assumed that it meant that it wouldn’t be a lot. It came to me as a huge shock when she asked for 3x the amount I could EVER imagine. If I’d known that it would cost me a quarter of my monthly budget, I would’ve never gone for it. 

I didn’t argue, because either you just pay, keep the relationship and never do business with her again, or you bargain and lose the relationship. I chose the former and paid the amount she asked for.

However, as I’m thinking about it more, the more ridiculous the situation seems to me. I specifically asked how much it would come out, and she didn’t provide any estimate. It’s my fault I didn’t insist, but I had no idea she would charge me this much, because she never has before. She doesn’t have pricing outlined publicly anymore, so nothing to argue against. 

Well... I guess my question is, when I receive the paintings, is it appropriate to say that although those are worth it (psych), next time I would prefer us to discuss this kind of thing in advance, because I did not expect it to cost this much? Or should I really let it slide and not bring this up and not do business anymore? I kind of want her to know that it REALLY hurt my wallet, but I don’t want any major conflict and bitterness afterwards. It’s not like she’s gonna refund any way.

I know it sounds very minor, but I’m really conflicted here. Need some non-emotional side opinion.

P.S. Just in case - it’s not exactly painting, but a different form of crafts. Just used painting as a hypothetical example to make it simpler.",12May2020,1

My mother is as liberal as they come and frequently calls me a “capitalist bootlicker”, says that I’m racist because I don’t support Black Lives Matter, says I live in a bubble because I don’t support high taxes. Issues have gotten worse and I have been told I could be kicked out of my house at 18 and without support so that “I can get my wake up call and see how the real world works”.

198,"This is kind of embarrassing and extremely frustrating. I (F21) was told as a teen I was just lazy, but I don’t know how to break the cycle. I wake up late, and am always tired and lethargic no matter how long I sleep. My day usually starts with a couple cups of coffee to get me moving, and I’m able to function for a couple hours. I think how awesome it would be to get up and clean, or make a meal, or showering and getting out of my hoodie and sweats, but by the time I get up to do it, I have no desire to do anything anymore. Doing simple tasks like cleaning the kitchen can take over an hour by the time I finish, and I hate every minute of it. I do like living in a clean home, and being clean, and although my mind knows what to do my body isn’t interested. I feel like I’m in a fog most of the time. I do enjoy people, and feel relatively happy and content with my relationship and where I am in life, but I struggle. I don’t like getting up and going to appointments, or the store, or going to a friend’s house (if they come to mine for an hour or so it’s fine, but then I just want to go to bed lol). I do online college courses at my own pace (and did before COVID), and have a daycare out of my home. Don’t worry, the kids have plenty of toys and their needs are excessively met, they are provided full meals, activities, nap times, guided in hygiene, etc.. Ask me though to go to the park, or take a walk to the library or pool, 9/10 times I just cannot get myself to do it. By the time they leave I’m pooped, and am more than happy to sit alone on my couch or rest in bed, or maybe take a bath (I don’t really shower unless I’m in a hurry).

199,"Hello everyone.
This is going to be my very first reddit post, so sorry in advance if I do anything wrong.

That said, I think I am panicking.

I'll give you a brief backstory about myself, for context. I used to be a very very very shy kid, the kind that never talks and pretty much stays on its own. Because of this, I didn't have many friends and I always felt like I was a nuisance to the few ones I had. Fast forward to my teenage years, where I struggled with depression and often times I didn't have enough motivation to do... Anything at all. I tried to make this all change when I turned 18. I told myself: ""This is not who you truly are"" and since then I've been trying to always make my life better. I must say, I've made some big progresses. I have a lot of friends, plus a small circle of them which I'd do anything for, and recently, I even found love. Everything started to get in place, but now I'm in trouble. After getting my life together, I have to keep it together. I'm 21, unemployed and currently in Uni. Only thing I should think about is graduate and get a job, other than my personal life. But it seems like demons from the past started to haunt me again. I can't find the motivation to do anything. And since the lockdown started (f u, coronavirus) it got even worse. I just kind of wake up, do nothing all day and go back to sleep.
And I swear, I don't want it. I really don't.
I want to find the concentration to study, I want to have the right will to get a good sleep routine and I want to get back to working out. But at the same time, I feel like I can't.

With that said, I can't lose the grasp of it all, for everything I've done, for the people I love and for myself, I have to make things work. I just don't know how, as of now.

Thanks in advance to anyone who's going to give me a hand, all help is appreciated!

200,"Ok so to make things clear I do smoke weed only but outside. I bought plug in fresheners for the bathroom which we share and my room that I rent out. I even spray 2 types of air fresheners everywhere I go if I just got done smoking outside. I go in the bathroom to wash my hands, spray around and leave, she immediately goes in just to smell the room. She then tells her husband and he knocks on my door ""are you smoking?"" Almost every other day. Same answer every time. NO I DO NOT SMOKE IN HERE (Opens door to show them).

Each time its like a brain reset for the landlord ""Ohhh it must be coming from your clothes then."" With no suggestions or anything afterwards, it ends there then it resets the next day to ""Are you smoking in the room? ..... Oh it must be on your clothes"". They don't provide me a washer and dryer here, its all landromat so I try to just freshen it up. Nobody smells me at work yet over here at home its fucking crucial. I went off a little yesterday and they got into a power trip charging me for all the stuff they didn't charge me for before that we shared. I know the answer would be to ""Leave"" but there is literally nowhere to go here its too expensive to live anywhere near my job except for in a car.

I'm thinking next time they accuse me I will offer to call the police to search the house for weed. The owners will not like it because they do shady business with people in the shop they own which have resulted in multiple raids in the past that landed them in jail while I'm at home being accused of the crime of smoking medical weed and smelling like it.

Both schools have the major I want but here's the issue. Northwest vista is a community college so enrolling will be easy while UT Austin, I need 24 hours of transferable credits so I need to enroll to two community colleges to gather enough credits to even qualify to ask for a transfer. I would need to take out a student loan to pay for one community college. 

Northwest Vista is a guarantee while UT Austin is not. I can start going to Northwest Vista right now or UT Austin in the near future. I prefer UT Austin but if I don't get accepted then that hard work will be for nothing and I will end going to Northwest Vista anyway

212,"Hey all so here's my situation.
I'm working night shifts and due to the lack of job perspectives, I decided a year ago that I want to learn programming as I always had a thing for tech and computers. I'm currently doing a university degree in computing and IT (part time, online) and participating in a giant bootcamp part time as well. The bootcamp lasts 10 months.

Because of the current covid situation, I realized that I need to get a coding job ASAP. The bootcamp offers career services after and they're quite famous for successfully employing their students in the first 2-6 months (there's a money back guarantee if they won't do it after 6 months of graduating). 

I took the option of transferring to full time so I can finish it in July(I think?) rather than October so I can crack on with job searching. 

However...I'm supposed to start the full time schedule soon and even though I'm quite good with handling stuff and pressure when it comes to working and studying, I'd like to see if there's any good advice on how to manage the three: work + bootcamp + university. 

Worth mentioning: working night shifts allows me to use my laptop for coding for about ... 3/4 of the night. 

Also worth mentioning, I live with housemates that are noisy and can't do much about it because I have a problem with one of my ears and can't fit an earplug in it. It's worth mentioning because when I'm tired and can't sleep (sometimes I sleep for only 3-4 hours a day), I can't code or study either.

My approach is to grind through the pain as it will end quickly and without appearing a self-absorbed asshole, I have past proof that I can handle it -- however I am 99.9% sure I'm missing important things that could make my life easier.

TLDR; I need advice on how to manage the job, a bootcamp and a part time university degree whilst not getting enough sleep.",12May2020,1
213,"Yes, as stated in the title, I (19f) moved out from my parents home into my own small house not too many blocks away. Luckily! Phew 

Some background information about my current situation is that I’m basically being forced to adult. And that’s never fun! :(

But this huge step in my life is helping me and my situation back at home which made it impossible for me to focus on my college classes and work in my job as a peer counselor at my college. 
It’s been extremely stressful trying to keep up with my online classes from home because of a personal situation involving a mentally ill family member that has made staying at home during quarantine very difficult for all of us. It has especially taken a toll on my parents’ health. 

My parents and I are both paying rent for this new place, which I cannot afford on my own! This 1 bedroom house will be my new home and a safe haven for either one of my parents to escape to when they feel too stressed at home. It is now a place for us to relax and take a break from caring for said family member. 

Its been extremely hard on everyone. I’m pretty sure anyone who has gone through something similar can relate. What has really surprised me through all this was the lack of compassion shown by everyone .  Many of my professors and supervisors denied me extended deadlines or test accommodations. It’s amazing how little we are all educated about the extremes of mental illness. In the midst of all this, the last thing on my mind was turning in some stupid  math exam while I have to worry for my family’s lives. I’ve been getting a taste of the real world little by little as I’m being forced to grow up due to my situation. I’m thankful for the support I have now, and I’m also ready for anything else life has to throw at me.

He is the nicest guy I have ever been involved in. He goes back to college in august which is a few hours away, and I am moving to Hawaii in December. This obviously meant we had a lot to talk about. When we had our talk we came to the conclusion that we were going to just vibe until he goes back to college. In the beginning things were really great. We would hang out almost every day and when we weren’t hanging out we would Snapchat throughout our days. Lately it’s been a lot different. He doesn’t ask to see me as often and he leaves me on delivered all day. It seems kind of careless that he doesn’t take five seconds out of his day to respond to me now, but when we do hang out it feels special. I’ve never felt this way about someone before and I think I might be falling in love with him. I’m not sure what to do at this point. Ever since we had our talk I’ve gained this insecurity that he is with me because of feelings of obligation. I’m not sure if he is with me because he wants to be or if he’s with me because he feels bad. Pls help :/",12May2020,1

220,"Hi everyone,

My primary care doctor has significantly let me down and I'm lost and don't know what to do in this situation. 

I've been taking Zoloft, which is an SSRI, for over four years now. I get this medicine filled by my primary care doctor because my therapist and psychiatrist agreed that I was functioning well without the continued need for additional services beyond medicinal. I've been getting this filled by my PCP for a couple of years now. He fills them on a yearly basis so I get the first month + 11 refills, and he authorizes the new year of refills by phone appointment since it is well established that this medicine works well for me. 

Well, this month was my last month of my current script. Two weeks ago my pharmacy let me know that they had sent in a request for an updated refill authorization from the office and had gotten no response. They suggested I call the office early since the world is hectic right now. I called that same day and left a message with the nurse explaining the situation with the pharmacy and requesting a call back. I didn't get a call back, but two days after I did get an automated text from the pharmacy saying the doctors office had denied my request for refills because I needed to come in for an appointment.

I called the nurse again, left another voicemail explaining the text I had recieved from the pharmacy and requesting a call back about the issue of an appointment. I am immunocompromised and was hopeful they would agree to a phone appointment because I'm scared of being in a physical medical office right now because Covid-19 cases in my area are sky rocketing. She never called back. At that point I was getting very concerned because I was starting to run low. So I called again and spoke to the front desk instead who told me the nurse was in and they'd let her know to call me immediately. I was relieved.. until she still never called me back. 

I've now been out of medication for several days. The withdrawals are horrible. The brain zaps feel like I'm glitching in and out of reality and a particularly bad one yesterday resulted in me taking a pretty bad fall in my kitchen. The mood swings are like whiplash and I cried myself to sleep last night for literally no reason. I've had horrid migraines and even body shakes. I'm trying very hard to just go easy on my body and convince my brain that this is going to eventually pass, but it's hard, and very scary. It's been years since I've been without this medication. 

I still have received no word from the office. No calls, no texts, no emails, nothing. The front desk says she is there but she just refuses to contact me and now I'm paying the price. I understand that the pandemic is making medical offices extremely busy and stressed but this is insanity and I have no idea what to do. I've tried calling a few offices around here to see if anyone would accept a new patient but no one will until the virus is under control. At this point I have no idea how long I'll be without my Zoloft. 

I'm scared, confused, and my brain isn't working right. I'm sorry if I'm rambling. I don't know what else to do, so I was hoping maybe someone here would have advice, either for dealing with the office or for handling the withdrawals of dropping cold off an SSRI.",12May2020,1

224,"First time reddit poster, I’m stewing over the conflict and would like someone else’s perspective.

My wife works in personal childcare in a large city in the US. The family she works for kept her working through Covid.

We are now 8 weeks in and have followed their rules for staying virus free. This has included not seeing our family and friends, avoiding stores, and most public places besides gas stations and grocery stores.

The state is expected to open non essential businesses next week, and I’d really like to go back to a somewhat normal life by taking the precautions the state has recommended. This includes staying home when sick, covering face, washing hands, and groups smaller than 10.

Wife’s employer argues that I’m putting them at risk by seeing other people at all, and if we need to stay isolated or else they will have no choice but to ask my wife to not come in at all, and they’veimplied that she wouldn’t be paid.

My wife thinks they are being unreasonable, but I don’t want to be the reason she loses her job. Do they have the rightin this special situation (pandemic) to tell me what I can and can’t do?",12May2020,1

227,"Recently, I have been in the sub Reddit and I was talking about me not talking to a particular friend at the moment because I felt like they were being weird in the sense that they can go and hang out with others but not me. 

this has nothing to do with that. But, I have recently got into some more from trouble when I ... let me take it from the beginning..

Sometimes I get really in my own head and I get depressed sometimes and I cut off all means social media I blacked out my Instagram, my Twitter and my other social media websites. when I left I said whoever has my number is more than welcome to text me but I’m not gonna lie when they were texting me I wouldn’t respond back because I turned off notifications to my text messages because I just really want to like be by myself if that makes sense. So a week goes by and my friends check up on me and we’re going to call them Pam and Sam. Pam and Sam are my one of best friends right now. 

I have trust issues if you go back to my other post you’ll see why it was because something happened with other friends and I was very vocal about this with Pam and Sam and very transparent with them about my issues with trusting new close friends. During quarantine me and Pam have been hanging out by ourselves because we live by each other and we don’t go out so we will just go to see each other and hang out. before quarantine Sam used to hang out with us but when quarantine started his aunt said that he cannot go out anymore. 

multiple times me and Pam would is hang out at her house by yourselves and we never ever got mad at Sam for not being able to hang out. But this last week I haven’t been talking to them much because of my whole thing of me being by myself but I told them that.. But I was talking to my best friend of 10 years because I just feel like she’s the one I can go to for stuff like that. I’ve only known Pam and Sam for like six to 9 months. But we’ve grown close and stuff because we hang out every single day. I started getting in my own head and being like standoffish and I told them I was talking to only my best friend for this time because I just need some time to myself they were understanding they were like checking up on me but I didn’t get the messages because my notifications were off and then Sam text me and was like “do you want to hang out at Pam’s house?”

now I have no restrictions I could have went but the thing is a lot of things were happening to me and one of the things that had happened to me was my bank account was cleared. I didn’t tell them that my bank account was cleared because I just didn’t feel the need to probably because of my issues. But I told him I couldn’t go and I came off as rude even though I didn’t mean to come off as rude looking back it was rude but I just didn’t know at the time that it was rude. The reason why I needed money was because Sam was sticking out of his aunts house technically and he he could’ve drove me there but I just I was on that exercise Curity just in case I get stranded there so I need like money for a Lyft if I have to take one. Plus, Kim doesn’t usually have food at her house because she doesn’t go shopping as much anymore so we order food and I just didn’t want them to pay for me.

While they’re hanging out by themselves at Pam’s house my best friend (who is also my aunt sister so she’s technically my aunt) came over to visit and i was posting pictures with her because she recently moved back to our hometown from alabama so I could have looked like I was actually ditched them to hang out with her even though I wasn’t. She came over to see me and like the whole family because we’re all family. But I could’ve looked like I was ditching them taking out with her or even that wasn’t the case. 

Like I said earlier every single time you and Pam would hang out at Pam’s house by herself we never got mad at Sam for not being able to come out or even if you didn’t want to come out we never got mad at him and stop talking to him and like was a live towards him. But this time they started being a loop towards me and not talking to me after I get back on line in social media and stuff and I asked him I said where are you guys mad at me or did I do something to you guys and they just left me on seen... 

I said in the beginning that I was being rude a little bit. But it wasn’t on purpose I didn’t mean to come off as rude even though it seems rude because in text messages because you can’t always hear the tone of voice. So I made an apology video on my Instagram and they seen it and they didn’t say anything but they seen it and I put it on my Snapchat too and they seen  it there. I was apologizing for being rude to all my friends because a couple of my other friends were texting me to tell me that I was kind of being rude and I was like “oh no I never meant to be rude..” But they have just not been talking to me and have been ignoring me and I feel like really sad about it and down in the dumps again because I really do love them and I never meant to hurt them or anything like that so I just need advice on what should I do should I leave it alone and come back to later or should I like try to go out of my way to talk to them and let them see that I am sorry? I guess or like be persistent ... I never wanted to hurt them?? 

I don’t know why but I feel like this is important information to go on there too but me Pam and Sam all were at Pam’s house one night before quarantine and we were drinking and Sam got pretty drunk and he asked me to kiss him and I declined. I told Pam about this but I told her not to say anything to Sam because he was drunk so I feel like it was not a big deal because drunk people do stupid stuff all the time. Pam has said that she was going to bring it up but I told her not to and in a drinking game later on she tries to make me text him about that night and I say no so maybe they were saying something about that???",12May2020,1
228,"Okay so I’ve been feeling really bad about this for the last few hours. So I met a new girl a few weeks back and we hit it off. Long story short, she invited me over to her home and I went over to spend some time with her. 

I arrived to her house and found that she lives in a mobile home that is in a somewhat unsightly area. I’m not a prejudiced person, and I try my hardest to own up to my biases. I noticed that all around me were dilapidated mobile homes, broken cars, and garbage. The area just seemed questionable in general. 

I approached her house and she came outside to let me in. Before I could think about it, I asked her if my car would be safe here. Immediately I felt like a total douche bag. I quickly apologized and simply said that I just don’t want my car broken into. Now she’s telling me that I’m rude, ignorant, and self centered. I really didn’t mean anything by my comments! I work really hard for what I have!

230,"I'm 21, I went to a community college straight out of HS. I didn't like my major so I switched after the first semester into History, which is something I genuinely enjoy. I did online classes and tried to work a full time job at the same time and lost track of my schedule and failed a couple of classes as a result. No one to blame but myself, I know this. I attended college on campus the second semester because I thought it would be better for me turning things in, and it was, but it gave me horrible anxiety. I suffer from GAD, agoraphobia, and a little bit of social anxiety, so attending school at an actual campus was a nightmare for me. I was never really into school though, I only went because people made me feel as if it was my ""only"" option. I've ruined my GPA and am no longer eligible for financial aid as a result of my last two semesters, so it would be very hard and expensive for me to go back to school anyways. 

I don't really have like a ""I want to do this with my life"" idea floating around in my brain. I'm decent with computers, I've had one since I was 7, so it just comes naturally. I don't know how to program/code or anything like that. I think I would love an office job where I could like, file data? Kinda a monotonous job of just like.. filing inventory numbers or something. But I don't know where to go about finding this kind of job/whether it even exists/if it would be sustainable as a career. I'm not looking to live rich, I'm looking to live comfortably. Not paycheck to paycheck, but not flying to Australia on my day off. I'm very good at saving money on my own, even with a minimum wage job I've managed to accrue a couple thousand on my own since I was 18 (because that's when I told myself I'd start ""caring"" about money) that I will only pull if I deem it an ""emergency"" (car repair, vet bills, etc.)

231,"Please don't let this post die. 

First of all, this is a loooooong anecdote to read, so if you suddenly stopped whatever you were doing to pay attention to my story and hopefully help me gain some fresh perspective, let me tell you that I truly appreciate it and I'll take your answers into account before making my decision. Thanks in advance strangers.

Everything started about three years ago. I was at home and suddenly I had the determination to start doing exercise because after finishing studying my engineering at college I just felt like I wasn't doing anything for my body (devoting my time and life to college resulted in not having the chance to have fun, especially because it was life-absorbing but worth it 'cause you know, it paid off). and I just had this crazy idea of going to the gym as soon as I thought of it. So I just got ready, grabbed some money, and headed to my target (that's the way I am, I envision something one day and if I really want it, I start doing it).

So I met this man (oh yes, the source of my problems). At first glance, he didn't seem like a person you would trust, but I felt so attracted to him that I just overlooked my gut. Physically, he looks exactly like Jon Hamm but with a glorious body and beautiful arms. He was the first person I met there, he helped me register, we kinda flirted. He said that the owner wasn't there but he would do the paperwork in his place, but I responded like ""you look like the owner"". After I said that he smiled and silently gave me the ticket of my subscription. He made a mistake when typing my name on the ticket before printing it out as he was giving me information about how things worked there, I noticed that and told him about said observation, he replied to me by saying I made him feel nervous, I just ignored it and started doing cardio. After a few minutes, I saw a beautiful lady in her 40s coaching people inside; I rapidly assumed that she had something to do with the person I met. And I wasn't wrong at all. Turns out they were a married couple with three children, two of them were around my age at that time (I was 23), and a 12 year old girl. And of course, he was the owner of the place.

As the days and months went by, I figured out many things about them. Since it was a family business, I got the chance to meet all of the members of what it looked like a strong and imposing family. 

I consider myself a pretty attractive woman; beautiful face, long hair, my body has always been desirable by many people including women (nice curves and proportions and everything is where it should be). And on top of that, I'm extremely good at talking to people, I have a certain magnetic vibe that allows people to talk to me and to feel comfortable when I am around them. I also see myself as a caring and loving girl, that's how my close friends and family describe my personality and I agree with them. I am very sociable but pretty selective. I know how to talk to people but that doesn't mean that I trust them. 
What I'm saying is relevant to this because of the way I knew almost everything about that family.

They liked me, they trusted me, they talked to me a lot and we got closer. As I was forming a nice bond with all of them, I felt more and more attracted to this man (let's call him Joel). But again, there was this feeling of not trusting him so present inside that I tried to avoid thinking about him the way I was (you know, I wanted him to fuck me so bad). I always pretended I didn't like him and I tried to avoid talking to him more than needed, I would ask him a few things about they way I was lifting weights and that was it. And that's what had happened over the course of two or three months.

That wonderful routine of working out and talking to nice people had stuck with me for quite a while and I embraced it. I loved it and didn't think too much about Joel. I used to go in the afternoons because I chose another career to study and started working in the mornings as well.
So one night, I finished working out, said goodbye to my acquaintances and left the place. The good thing is that my house wasn't that far away so I just had the chance to do some cardio on my way home instead of driving. 
But before leaving, I noticed that Joel had left before I did.
I started jogging and after passing by two blocks, I saw him standing and looking at me, he smiled at me I stopped to say hello. I got a little closer to ask him what he was doing there, but all of a sudden he wrapped his arms around my body to make sure I wouldn't escape and he kissed me. I didn't do that much because I didn't want to be kissed, well, yes I wanted to since the first day I met him, but it felt kind of awkward to me because I wasn't used to his wild and wet way kissing. So yeah, that shit happened. After kissing me, he asked me if I wanted to go inside his house (one of his houses). I just said no and told him I had to leave. We said goodbye and I continued my way as normal.
The next day I pretended that nothing happened and worked on my routine as always. I talked to people like I normally did, and he was there, he was looking at me and I couldn't help but feeling kinda nervous because he was around. So I realized I sort of felt for him. I really wanted him to kiss me again. I really wanted to experience being with him and I wanted to see how everything would end. That's how this thing started.

After a few days, I left the gym and I noticed that he was inside his car, he chased me and stopped to pick me up. As soon as I got in the car we started making out. He really wanted to fuck me and I got really horny, I just fell for it. Kiss after kiss, touch after touch. Everything felt so good, so wild, every frickin' time I remember that night I still get wet just by thinking about it. He wanted to take me to a place where we could have sex. But I said no. I was just playing with him but it was late and I had to get ready for the next day. So he drove home, he hugged me and left. After one week we were able to finally fuck properly. His pp is loooong and thick and his body naked looks even better than with clothes on. What can I say? We looked good together, and we did many things together without his wife even noticing. Without anyone around even thinking about it. It was perfect alibi for us. I truly enjoyed it. That's the way we lived for almost a year. I started feeling something towards him. I fell in love, I got to the point in which it wasn't only about fucking. It was about the conversations we had, it was all about feeling that he really cared about me and of course, his personality, which is pretty similar to mine.

I have to point out that as our relationship (whatever the fuck it was) started getting stronger, his marriage started to fall apart. I would often see them argue or some times they didn't even talked. She started to behave in a very shady ass way (it doesn't matter who was in front of her), but she treated me well. And there was another exception to this behavior, it was one man of my age that was a good friend of that family. But they behaved in a strange way when they were together, they would exclude me from their conversations and he would give her many gifts like bracelets and cakes. At first I didn't pay too much attention to that. But their odd relationship made sense after a while. 

I also want to say that at some point I met Joel's mother and she was around almost all the time. She and I formed this beautiful friendship and we both loved each other. We would go out for dinner, or we would go to dance, I was usually kind of her secretary and I would help her with some stuff and vice versa, she would take everywhere and she would trust me her intimate and delicate secrets. She loved me and she knew about my relationship with her son. She would talk to me about everything in their life. She mentioned that Joel wanted to be with me, she also mentioned that he didn't want to have children again but when he met me I changed his mind. And I confirmed what she said because he actually asked me once about how I would take an unexpected pregnancy. I just said without even thinking that I would abort. But well, I gave that answer because what can you get from being the other woman instead of being in a formal relationship, right? After a while he insisted, he told me about his desire to have a baby with me, he started talking about living together with me. And his mother mentioned that she didn't like Joel's wife. In fact, she hated her. Thet had been together for more than 20 years but she never trusted her, not even once. And she wanted me as a part of their family.

So, as I was telling earlier, this couple's marriage started to fall apart. He was suspicious of her and her behavior and his children stopped talking to him, in fact they started showing certain tendencies that a psychologist would detect as not normal and necessary to be treated by a professional in therapy. 
This gorgeous 12 year old girl really liked to be with me, and tried to avoid being around her mom at all costs. She even felt scared any time she showed up. Things started to be fucked up.
I was just a witness of the fall of this family. And not only a witness, but I felt guilty as natural.
After I saw how each other's attitude gradually started to change, Joel and I started to have some problems as well. We got to a point in which we stopped talking. We had our own problems, so we stopped. But his mom never stopped talking to me. She would tell me about their problems and how shitty the situation went in their family. Joel didn't want to continue living with this woman and she was just spending so much money on things he never saw in his house but were reflected in his credit card. As that was happening his children detected a monetary gap between benefits and the cash register.

Joel and I stopped talking for a few weeks but then he approached me and asked me if I was able to find information from a cellphone he got from his wife (I'm a software engineer), and I said yes. I unlocked it, I saw that she deleted messages and many shits that I was able to get back after working on it. So I could find out that she was cheating on him with not only the man I mentioned earlier, but with other four or five men as well. I recuperated many recent messages, pictures and calls.
So I sent the information to him. And that was it. That was the end of their relationship. But this shit gets even darker. She was torturing this little girl by raping her with this man who was supposedly a friend of the family. And not only him, but she would fuck with other men and take them to one of their houses along  with HER DAUGHTER to rape her. And it was happening for YEARS. So she was traumatized but she never mentioned anything until the day that Joel discovered all the truth about this bitch. He forced her to leave his house, and nobody saw her again.
She was also talking shit about her husband to his other sons and all of them were planning to escape thanks to all the shits that she told them about Joel. According to his children, she never mentioned anything about me.
So at the end of this problem, he was looking for an excuse to leave her and vice versa. But this twisted bitch had a different intention and a REAL mental problem. She would also combine food recipes with some other shit when cooking for him. She apparently wanted to kill him? I don't know but according to Joel, he started feeling better as he stopped eating from what she was making at home, he would often feel sick and nauseous, and had some other symptoms after eating what she would make. That started happening that year.

So this shit happened, and Joel just couldn't handle it, it was too much for the family to handle. It was too much for them to realize that the real source of the problems was his wife and not him. His thoughts were only focused on one thing: killing this woman. He really wanted to kill her. But since that day, nobody saw her again. He tried to contact as many people as possible, he desperately tried to find her. But she and her lover ran away together. So I was the only the person on Earth who could make him feel better and I was the one person who could calm him down for a bit during the day. I tried to help him as much as possible with all this situation. I told him that he should focus on his family instead, because all of them needed each other. Btw, that same day he found out about the truth, he closed the gym (he was getting tired of it and he just wanted to be free from that, and what had happened turned into the perfect excuse to do it).

After one month, he kind of felt a little bit better, I mean, he was desperate to find her but I sort of managed to make him feel better. He also focused on his daughter because she really needed help.
After some time he started talking to me about all the plans that he previously mentioned to me. That he wanted to be with me, that he wanted to have children, and that he loved me. At that time I started trusting him, and I realized that I wanted the same things. I really wanted to have a baby with him and I wouldn't mind if we spent the rest of our lives together. So we started making it formal between us. It was too early to talk about me to his children, so he didn't. And I didn't say a thing to my family either. It was just between us for now.

The last day I saw him I discovered that he was in the house of a woman, I tracked his location and found out. So I called him many times until he got out of the house and told him to pick me up because I wanted to talk to him. I just got jealous and my trust disappeared. I asked him what he was doing there, he said that the woman he was visiting needed some help with a car that she wanted to sell. But the reality was that he used to fuck with her before we met. So what the fuck was he doing inside HER HOUSE when we started planning our life together? That really hit me hard. And I told him that if he really wanted to be with me that relationship with her and any other woman had to stop. So he said yes, he drove me home and he left. I never saw him again. Not even a call, not even a message, all the family left. They even changed their phone numbers, there was nothing, not a single trail. I couldn't even contact his mother. And on top of that, they don't like social media, none of them. He didn't even have a FB account. I was the only tech-savvy there.

So what about our plans? What about all our future together? What about the formality? What about our future baby? There was nothing.
He didn't say anything, he left and I just got depressed for one year. All that year was a mess, I just wanted to be at home, I didn't want to eat, I didn't want to work, I was just dead inside. And nobody noticed it because I am good at hiding those things. So I just had myself. I stopped seeing my friends. I just wanted to be alone. No addictions, nothing like that. I didn't even try to fight my depression.

Probably one of the things that kept me alive was my family, my nephew and my niece that I adore, my loving mother and father and my siblings. They kept me alive. Nobody knew about what I had inside my head, but they really helped. 
And most importantly, there was this feeling inside of me of him coming back that helped get through this. There was still hope. I didn't do things wrong and the circumstances were awful. So I thought that all that shit made them move to another city o some shit like that.

After that year of suffering and telling myself that he would come back, I just gave up on that stupid fantasy. And that moment I gave up on him, I started to do things for myself; I started going out, I started meeting new people, I traveled around the country, I went to concerts, I started working more, I earned lost of money and I started to feel better, I gave up on him but I really started to enjoy my life and I did many things that make feel proud of myself because I was truly successful at what I wanted to do. I also met other men and I gave them the opportunity to go on a date and to share a little bit of our lives. It was good, I'm not gonna lie, but I never felt anything, there was attraction, yes, but that was it, we would fuck (I had to fulfill my needs), but the next day I didn't feel anything except for sexual ""satisfaction"". Those men would contact me after because they wanted to see me again, but I said no and goodbye.

 Even with those good things happening to me I would just spent a good part of my time thinking about Joel. I gave up, but I was still thinking about him. I wanted to know if he was still alive, if he was ok, I wanted to know if his mom, his daughter and all his family were alright. The answer to many questions like why he left and why he didn't tell me he was leaving was never answered. I just wanted the best for him and I wouldn't have minded if he was dating someone else as long as I knew it. After almost a year, he found my FB account and sent me a message (I don't usually use FB but every month I check my messages, I don't even have the app installed), so after a trip to a concert (Muse was touring but they went to a different city in my country so my friends and I bought flight tickets last October and went) I checked my messages, and I just found out that he sent me a message, the thing is that he created an account and found me. We chatted for a bit and he told that he and his family were living in a different city (I wasn't really surprised). I was glad that all of them were doing well, specially the girl, they took her to therapy, and she started feeling much better. She's a badass girl. She's kicking it.
He asked me if I was dating someone else, I said no and he told that he wanted to see me, to talk to me and share his life with me. I blindly said yes. So after two weeks he came to the city and I saw him, I saw his family (they attended a funeral), he introduced me to all his relatives as his girlfriend and his family I knew were happy to see me, and his mother was there, too. He told me about all those plans that we had together, he invited me to live with him and spend our lives together. And I said yes. That was all I really wanted. I'm young but that was all I wanted to do, and what a better person to spend my life with than him.

So I talked to my mother, I told her the essential information (I mentioned the huge difference in age) but she was ok with that, my older siblings didn't agree with my decision but they didn't interfiere and my dad was ok. I asked him to give me some time to get ready (by that time I had gotten two jobs) and I wanted to leave things the right way. 
Months went by and I just started to sense his irresponsibility again. He didn't answer most of my calls, he disappeared for a month because he was working, I saw him twice and then he disappeared again. Then he would come back to say that our plans were still intact but he was busy. That's what happened until last March (this was days before the lockdown in my country), I wanted to see him so I invited him to a trip I was planning to take because I needed to pick some documents in a different city.

 He said that there was no problem with that and that he was glad that I invited him and that it was unexpected. I asked them to confirm because he was busy and I had to organize all my stuff before leaving, he said he would confirm in three hours. He had me waiting for more than six hours so I called him many times. He never picked up the phone. I texted him saying that I wanted to confirm if he was going with me or not so that we could buy the flight tickets together, I wasn't rude at all, but he took it the hard way and got pissed because all I wanted was to confirm and do things TOGETHER. He said that he wasn't going with me and didn't answer my messages afterwards. That wasn't my intention. I didn't mean to make him feel pissed. So we didn't talk for weeks. I tried to contact him many times but successfully failed. Then I contacted his mother, explained the whole situation to her and she said that she would talk to him. She did it, she talked to him, they went to the city to visit me and he told me that they were going to take a trip together due to some businesses but he would come after that to take me to his house in the other city where all his family lives. I said it was fine. They left and I waited for a month.

We went to live together to his house but it only lasted one week. ONE WEEK. He promised me that we would do everything together, he promised me that we would work together. He promised many things. So when we arrived we had a blast the first day, they gave me a little tour of the house, I took my stuff to our bedroom, we got together, his family accepted me, we fucked that day. We had a wonderful time together. The next day he got drunk while I was working (yeap, home office, I kept my jobs just in case, it was the perfect time to work from where I was, and the perfect time to leave, thanks quarantine) and started to listen to music alone, he was enjoying his drinks. So I finished working and went to where he was, he was sitting and from what I saw he started getting emotional. He told me about how he felt and some other less important stuff about his life. But then, all of a sudden, he asked me about those almost two years without knowing anything about me. I was going to answer with all my honesty and tell him all I lived but then he stopped me to tell me that he asked a friend of his to watch me. He was told that I was dating someone else at that time (which is true, I dated like four men during that time). After he asked me, I was going to tell him what happened (I didn't really have to because it was my life and from the moment he left without telling me I was in all my right to do whatever I wanted, those two years would have been totally different if he had the responsibility to tell me that he was going to abandon me) he stopped me and told me that he didn't really want to know. Then he fell asleep. I was waiting for that exact opportunity to tell him how I felt, but unfortunately he stopped me and I lost my chance that day. Then he woke up, took a shower, we had dinner and went to bed. We talked, we fucked, and when we were doing so, he got a phone call from a WOMAN. He ignored it and we continued but he was kind of distracted by that call and he didn't cum. As a result of it I didn't cum either. I kind of ignored it as well and I didn't ask him about her. I just forgot. But the next day, his mother invited me some drinks and we got drunk. We talked about our lives, she had questions, I answered with honesty, then Joel came in and I told him to sit next to me so that I can answer to his question of what I did during that time skip. Everything you readers know is what I told him; how I felt, how I gave up, how I started doing things for myself, how I dated some other guys and how much I still missed him. He seemed to understand. And his mom was comprehensive and she even cried. I cried while telling them what happened. I actually thought that he was going to understand what I felt and love me even more. But that didn't happen. He didn't like what I said (he didn't like my FUCKING HONESTY for God's sake). So we went to sleep and problems started coming and coming.
The first day we discussed about working on our own projects together, I told him about my vision and ideas, but he was thinking about another idea that he had. So the following days he would spend hours talking to people on the phone about said idea. He was arranging everything but he never included me. I tried to get close to him to support him in what he was doing but got mad and said that I was trying to dominate him and that I wasn't useful for what he was going to do. That hit me hard. We were going to make plans together but he just excluded me. That made me feel disappointed. I was just trying to lend a helping hand.
That same day he started to act suspiciously. He was using one of his cellphones to text someone, and then he left the house to talk on the phone. After a while I followed him and saw that he was talking on the phone with someone, I didn't get too close and kept my distance. When he finishes talking I asked if he was talking to this woman from the other day and he got pissed. He really got pissed because I asked that. But he didn't even explain anything about her, he just got mad and started to talk nonsense.
Then he calms down and we come back to the house. After that, we didn't talk too much. I got even more disappointed. I definitely didn't like that. It made me feel like he wasn't taking me seriously. The next day he woke up after me, he saw me cleaning but he asked ""what are you doing?"". I answer like ""what you see is what doing"". That just came out of my mouth (probably because I was still mad at what had happened the night before). And he took it like the worst response ever. He mentioned that if one of his children had told him that, he would have slapped him in the face. That intimidated me, I apologized but it was too late. He didn't talk to me afterwards. That same night I wanted to talk to him about the situation and we almost ended up fighting. As I sensed it, he almost wanted to kill me. He misinterpreted everything I had told him and he was pissed because I started crying. I told him that I would leave the next day and left the room. I basically ran to his mother's bedroom to tell her about what had happened and she said that if that was going to happen again, it wasn't convenient for me to stay. She also said I was being too kind to him and if it were her situation, she would have left already.
The next day he drove me home, and he said that he wanted to take me to another place for a month, he also mentioned that there were many things that he didn't like about me and he would expect me to analyze it and then would come back to pick me up and leave where he wanted to go.
I wonder what he didn't like about me. He didn't like the wonderful way I treated his children? He didn't like how organized I was? He didn't like that I helped everyone clean the house? He didn't like that I asked him to to tell me what he wanted from me? He didn't like my honesty when I got drunk? He didn't that I asked him directly about that woman that insisted on calling him? He didn't like that I wanted to support him with what he was doing? He didn't like my vulnerability of crying when I wanted to be honest about my feelings? He didn't like that I wanted to hug him when he was talking on the phone? I don't know what kind of shit he didn't like. 
I accept that my tone was rude when I answered him ""what you see is what I'm doing"". But that's it, I don't fucking know what else he didn't like... Since he left, he hasn't answered my messages (he just read them). And that's it. (He tends to avoid our problems and after a while he comes back).
I would like to talk to him about how I'm feeling right now. I want him to explain to me me if we're still going to continue or not. I want to tell him that I want to give him another chance to do something better as long as he stops talking to that woman. I want to tell him how disappointed I felt with all this. I want to define if we still continue or not. If not it's ok, even if I get fucking depressive at least I will know that it's OVER and will definitely change a lot. I don't want to feel the same uncertainty that I felt when he left me two years ago. I can do whatever I want, and now I feel so capable of looking for him to talk about this. It's been more than a week since the last time I saw him. I don't know where he is, but I'm sure I can find him now. He cannot escape this time. I'm tired of waiting, I'm tired of letting him decide when I have the right to decide what I want FOR ME NOT FOR HIM.

236,"Was I sexually assaulted? TW, CW

I’m so sorry if this is the wrong place for this but I need opinions.

I’m a 21 year old female.

When I was in late elementary school, somewhere age 8-10, we got a pool. My brother who is two years older than me (10-12 at the time) and I would play in the pool and it was awesome.

I honestly can’t remember how it started, but one day he came up with this new “game” for us to play that he called “love center” which makes me cringe and also makes me feel like this whole thing is a joke and I’m just stupid.

Basically, it consisted of us going to the center of the pool, and both of us going underwater where we couldn’t be seen. I remember at some point (I think this happened a few times/a few different days) getting uncomfortable and trying to stop it from happening god forbid my parents saw, and he assured me it was safe to do because the location in the pool couldn’t be see from inside the house.

He would push me down to the bottom and put himself on top of me. I think he exposed himself to me, and asked me to do the same. He would rub himself against me. All while underwater. Like basically intercourse with clothing.

I didn’t know how to say no, or to say no, but all I know is I didn’t like it and it made me feel dirty and uncomfortable. But I never said no and continued to let it happen. I was too ashamed to tell my parents then and still am. If I had to make a guess, if I told my parents now 10 years later, they would tell me he was probably just going through puberty and to write it off because what can we do now. And the fact that he is my brother, who knows. I don’t know what this could do to my parents if I told them.

I don’t feel as if I’m traumatized, but it’s never left me. I don’t know if I need to speak to a therapist about this, or if I’m okay. For all I know it’s causing more damage than I realize. I don’t know if maybe some of the things I do or the way I act could be locked up in this experience.

I don’t know if one would even consider this sexual assault or abuse or whatever it may be due to the fact that we’re brother and sister, or our ages at the time, being elementary/early middle school age. That he was just going through puberty and had questions and feelings he didn’t know how to handle, but he handled them on me. 

Please help me. What do I do? What was this?",12May2020,1

241,So I live in New Zealand where we only have a small number of venomous spiders. I don’t have any experience with this kind of situation. About an hour ago I noticed a medium sized black spider with a white dot on it abdomen. I thought it looked like a white tail but I wasn’t sure so I left the room to look it up. I confirmed that it was a white tail but by the time I got back to the room the spider was gone. There’s no way for the spider to leave the house from that room so it must still be here somewhere. The reason I’m worried is white tail bites can kill cats. I have a lovely cat who spends most of his time inside. If he saw a spider of this size he would definitely try to play with / eat it.

I truly believe it's due to the complicated relationship she has with her girlfriend.  We seemed to have smoothed things out the past couple months but I'm just so frustrated with the relationship shes been in the past year and the negativity it brings .  Just to clarify we are both women but shes lesbian and I am straight.

Background :

We have known this girl for a few years and she was a mutual friend. She has  Always been jumping in relationship from guy to guy and living with them very early on in their relationship. She has never been dependent on her own. She was raised a only child and comes from a very wealthy family. She constantly let's her bank account go in the negative and daddy puts $500 in it to replenish it like it's nothing. And she dates these shitty guys to help her get"" by ""on her own. Shes always had a alcohol issue she just gets to fucked up and she falls, slurs her words , shes been kicked out of bars before been refused more drinks by bartenders,  been arrested and even one time she physically assaulted my best friend when she was drunk (they were friends at this time). Shes is a crazy drunk.

Story:
 About a year ago she  left her boyfriend who she was in a toxic relationship with and got her own apartment and was doing very good for herself. It did not last long. She quit her well paying job at discover because she did not like it anymore and she sat on her ass unemployed for around a month then got a job at a appartment complex showing rentals. She took a 25% pay cut and went from working 40 to only 30 hours a week. All during this time she quit her job her and my best friend started hooking up.  It was so weird because she has always been with men. Eventually a couple months after they started hooking up she could no longer afford to live on her own because she was behind on her bills by a month and was no longer making the money she was making. So due to that she moved over 3 hours away up north in the state we live in because that's where her parents live. 
When she moved up north my best friend and her decided to make their relationship official. She promised my best friend she would work hard and save up a bunch of money to move back to the city to be with her so they would not have do the long distance thing more then 6 months. It's been a year now and she has not done shit but wake up at 3 pm in the afternoon get drunk and high as fuck on pot then stay up until like 4 am watching netflix and repeat every single day. The reason we started fighting so much is because my best friend the most amazing positive person I know just would lay in her bed depressed and miserable because she never gets to see the ""love of her life"" (this is her first real relationship) because she lives over 3 hours away. Her girlfriend wants to just come down and stay at our place for 4 days at a time and lay around and not do shit every other week to just chill with my roomate and I'm just not having it. I'm not going to have some lazy ass girl stay with us part time every month because shes dating my bestfriend it's just not happening. She makes my roomate spend all her money to pay for all her food while shes down in the city and shes a shitty fucking house guest as well. It's not cool. And it's not cool that shes lazy and does nothing with her life then get drunk and high and live off of her wealthy ass family and expect it to be chill to vacation at our place whenever she pleases. It's just so sad to see this girl impact my bestfriends emotions to the point she gets so depressed she cant even get out of bed because she misses this lazy bitch so much. 
My bestfriend and I were both raised by single mothers and we know what it's like to work HARD. We have done it for years without relying on other people and we certainly dont come from wealthy families that can just spare 500$ to put in our bank accounts every 2 weeks.  That's why we have been fighting alot the past year because I dont want her lazy shitty house guest of a girlfriend to stay with us for days on end. A couple days a month is chill but she cant be staying here part time. My bestfriend understands that but now her girlfriend is about to move down and i just know I'm never going to see her anymore because of this girl and I guess I'm just upset because I have got use to having her around throughout the week and maybe just not seeing her a few days a month when she goes and sees her GF or when her gf comes to visit occasionally.

The most fucked up thing about this is her girlfriend has not been working and filed unemployment because of the corona virus and is getting 2900 a month in unemployment and that's how shes moving down is by saving her unemployment checks and her dad is giving her like 5000 so she can start her life back up again in the city. This girl has not worked in a year and shes getting all this money for NOTHING. My bestfriend and I work our asses off to make ends meet. And she gets a fat check for being lazy bitch. I'm just so annoyed that she has complicated my relationship with my bestfriend/roomate and she has been rewarded for being lazy as fuck for a whole year and this is how she moves back to the city by getting a hand out. I just feel like of she truly loved and cared about my bestfriend she would have been motivated on her own to fucking work and save up her own money to move back down a long ass time ago instead of putting my best friend through the most depressed time period of her life since I met her. Fucking ridiculous.",12May2020,1

When we’re in school we can laugh together and talk about school things and the environment, but over text or snapchat I don’t know what to say. Even my 3 good friends from chemistry I hardly speak with anymore because of the pandemic. I feel like when summer comes around and the social distancing stops, I’ll have no one to hangout with or talk to. I’m drifting apart from those “school friends”. I feel like I’m the only one that cares about our relationships anyways since I’m the only one that ever reaches out anymore during this pandemic. I’m not sure what to do. Do I even try and contact my friends anymore? Should I just be content with my one best friend and hope to meet new people next year?",12May2020,1
254,"Hi so someone said something to me recently and it made me feel really weird about these things that happened when I was little like 8-10 years old. I was friends with my neighbor who was 3 years older, so she would’ve been 11-13 during the time we were friends. Anyway I can’t remember a lot but we used to play games or do dares where I would have to take my clothes off. And it was only ever me, cause if I dared her back after she wouldn’t. And I remember we made this fort outside and were playing in there one day and she had me lay down and ""examined” me…and like I know little kids (like preschool) play doctor and stuff but is it weird that it was a 13 year old middle schooler and then a 10 year old? I never felt like I was being forced to do the stuff, but looking back it makes me feel slimy that we were doing that at that age. We stopped being friends when I was almost 11 just cause we grew apart, but we are still neighbors.

I don’t want to call it abuse or anything like that because I went along with it too. But basically I’m just wondering was that weird/wrong and should I feel weird? Or is it fine and I’m just being extra about a normal kid thing. Thanks, I’ve never told anyone else cause I don’ t really think about it, but I just can’t ask my friends something like this. And I'm sorry if this is the wrong place for this, i'll delete it if it isn't allowed.

TLDR: My 13 y/o neighbor used to make 10 y/o me take my clothes off/play doctor and I am wondering if it was weird or a normal kid thing...",12May2020,1
255,"Recently came upon a video on YouTube that made me realize a girl I was seeing a few weeks ago was very manipulative to me and I'm really the only one who could have recognized it. It took/is taking so long to get over her, but now that I realize how manipulative she is I'm starting to feel a lot better. 

Some of the things I found true for me:
1)at first they act like they care about you and they are very lovey, but if they recognize that you are quick to trust and care about them, they begin to pull back and make you feel like you've done something wrong 

2)they often play victim even if they aren't really, they want the attention from being the one who was hurt by something. For me this was even stranger because I wanted to comfort her, but when I would try she would make me feel like I was crazy for wanting to be there for her when she made me feel like she needed someone. I'm a big homemaker myself, and when she was sick I went to make her soup from scratch and I don't think she ever said thank you, instead of saying thank you she kept saying ""you didn't have to do that,"" which is very different.

3)they almost always act like nothings wrong even when you are frustrated with them, mad at them, or sad about something they did. The girl I was seeing never apologized for anything, and always made me feel like I was the one who needed to apologize, even if I was mad or sad about something she did to me, I would end up apologizing because I felt like I was hurting her feelings by having my own

4)if you care about someone easily, you'll feel like you have to over extend yourself to make them feel better or feel like you care. She always tried to guilt trip me by telling me how bad she feels about her life, how sick she feels, or how behind she was on chores or school. I always offered to help where I could because I feel like relationships are a team, your problems are mine. Even if you don't think they are doing it on purpose, if they always make you feel like you have to jump to be there, something is wrong.

5)they never really want to communicate clearly, effectively, or truthfully. As the weeks went on she became less and less responsive to me and every so often I would try to check in and be like ""hey is everything okay,"" but it would always be something like ""yes! Everything is great"" or something that made me feel like I was overthinking it. I kept pushing to talk because communication is important to me, and eventually I got her to say ""things are just going to fast and I think we should slow down"" which was exciting to hear because it felt like she was communicating finally, but then after she pulled away even more I talked to her again and she said ""I think we should just be friends."" It took literal weeks for all of this to come out, and the whole time she would keep making me feel like I was going crazy by saying everything is fine and also not making any effort to talk with me. Another thing she did was, when I would try to make plans with her, she would be the busy one, so I would say let me know what time you want to go out, or let me know when you're on your way, or let me know when you want to come over, and instead of actually letting me know or telling me she couldn't, she would just not text me at all. She would always make me text her about plans even if she was supposed to make them, there were a few times that I was actually fully dressed, showered and ready to go, and all I needed was a when and a where and it never came. On a whole she was very flakey on plans and I never really came first unless she wasn't getting attention from others

6) they really just love attention from everyone in any form and every form. This girl often put very sexual pictures on her Instagram or snap story, for her thousands of followers. I definitely have nothing wrong with expressing sexuality, but she never sent them to me, they were always just public posts for everyone and it seemed like she didn't really care if I commented or not. Additionally, she wanted me to follow her finsta where she posted all of the things she was sad about or hurt by, but this also had a ton of followers and she never read or cared about my comments here either. Overall, I was never sure how to be there for her, it seemed like she wanted attention from everyone for being so attractive but also from everyone for her being so sad. And when I tried to give her all of this attention, she couldn't have cared less, didn't respond to my texts or comments and made me feel like nothing was really that wrong.


7) she would always say that she was there to talk if i needed to, but when I actually needed to she wouldn't respond. It wasn't like later in the day or week, it just wasn't at all. I would be in a really bad place worried about her trying to figure out where we stood, and she would just say absolutely nothing and would not answer calls.
8) she was always very fake nice around my friends and family. It was always kind of look how glowing I am and how cool and quirky I am, my roommate and I were actually talking the other day about how when he met her he felt like nothing she said was genuine or real, my sister said the same thing. I think it comes back to the attention thing. They'd rather lie about the person they are to appear as someone who is edgy or cool than be themselves.

I hope these points are helpful for everyone here, manipulative relationships really hurt no matter how long they are. I never felt like I was enough, and I have woken up every morning since wondering what I did wrong or if I could've done something differently. The more I think about it, the more I realize that I was being manipulated, and that I'm probably a pretty easy person to manipulate.
My advice here is that if you are constantly feeling like someone doesn't actually care about you, is abusing your desire to care about them or for them, and doesn't put you first in any context, you're better off not with them.",12May2020,1
256,"Some background... I’m 31 year old single male with an 11 year old son. About 6 months ago I left a job where I was miserable. I was traveling ~50% of the time, the company was filled with office politics and bullshit and I felt the future of the company was in jeopardy. Even given all of that, I wouldn’t leave. I felt obligated to the company and also was afraid that I would fail doing anything else. Was I carried by the people around me? Who knows. Finally convinced myself it wasn’t worth it. I needed to put me first for once. Well, I landed what I thought was a great job. Travel was limited. The company was smaller but business was thriving. Nothing about the job scared me. Things started out great. And then COVID happened. And work has been insane ever since. I’m new at this company and I thought I needed to make a name for myself and have taken on a ton of work. I did this for the last 9 years at another company. I can do it here, right? Wrong! I really need some more training but I’ve taken on too much and I’m getting right back into my bad habits of putting my career first. I’m in over my head and I can’t figure it out. I need to talk to my boss but I’m afraid of the repercussions. I have a kid I need to support and need to pay the bills so I can just pretend like that isn’t real. If I could kick 19 year old me in the balls so hard he can’t make babies until he ha his own life figured out, I probably would.

257,"So this kinda needs backstory first...

There's an old video of me from around 3 years ago where I took part in a science program for young teenagers. The video is nothing special, we all had to present a topic we were interested in and talk about it for a few minutes. I chose genetics and my video is a rather shitty explanation of how punnet squares work. It's on YouTube and has been for years now. Unfortunately, searching up my name leads you to find it. I probably wouldn't care if this was all the video was but I have some issues with anxiety and after stuttering my way through the video I vividly remember having a panic attack afterwards. Because of that I don't really like when people find the video if I know them.

Okay now that backstory is done, here's what happened.

My friends and I have a dumb discord server where there's a specific role that traps you in one channel (you can only speak in that channel). The admins and I sometimes put people in there for a few minutes and it's kinda just dumb stupid fun. Today one guy got sent in there for a bit and after about 30 seconds he decided to inform me that he had a video of me talking about genetics, meaning the video I mentioned before. He started spamming that he had a video of me in the chat and i panicked and kicked him from the server temporarily. I explained to him that the video he found has a lot of bad meaning for me (I pretty much told him exactly as above) and asked him to please never mention it again. He messaged me, clearly thinking I wasn't serious and threatened to send the video to all my friends. I tried explaining it again because he wasn't getting the picture but he kept going anyways.

I know he was probably joking but it really got to me. I sent him the invite back into the server and he told me that if he got sent into the joke role again that he'd send the video to the chat. Pretty much like blackmail I guess. After that i told him to fuck off and some other stuff. I'm a bit worried that I overreacted. I haven't spoken to him since this morning when it happened and I just don't know how to explain to him again what that video means. He's always been one of those people that just jokes around and never takes anything seriously. I'm just worried that he'll threaten to send it into the chat again.

Does anyone have any advice on how to tell him (again) how much that damn video means to me and how to get him to understand that threatening to send it when we joke around on the server isn't okay?",12May2020,1

so, to the point of this: is it wrong to promise her everything’s gonna be okay? it helps in the moment during some of her panic attacks, but i can’t help but feel like i’m lying to her, considering i’m very much a pessimist and don’t believe that everything’s gonna be okay at all, but i’m okay with that fact and she’s not, if that makes any sense? i’m not sure how best to help, is what i’m getting at. any and all advice is appreciated. thank you for reading, if you got this far.",12May2020,1
263,"I have been voluntarily helping my friend find housing. She will not have a home by Sunday. She has no car, partially illiterate, and only income is disability.

I have offered her help by talking through the logisitics and tips and advice on finding housing when your time is very limited (In the past I have slept in my car and was at risk of homelessness too). She lives far, but there is a lot public transportation where I live for her to get around. I offered that she could crash on my couch on the nights of the days she does interview and room tours and if she is able to sign a lease/roommate agreement for next month, she can crash at my place until she can move in. 

Problem is she keeps putting room hunting off. She'll be like thanks and then the next day calls me again, she has overcomplicated things and we're back to square one. She overthinks things. Ruminate. She'll go on angry tangents. She'll rationalize procrastinating. She fixates on her things she has accumulated off the streets. She even rationalize risking her length of stay so she can look through her boxes and boxes of stuff.

This feels like a part time job. I feel like I am the one who is looking for a room now. I feel like I am carrying on her stress. I have a headache and feel totally burned out by her. I still have to work and have my own set of responsibilities, I have other things and she totally forgets that. She forgets that I am voluntarily helping her, this isn't my job, but she talks to me as if it is.

I didn't yell at her, but I definitely got frustrated and told her how she is behaving. I told her I love her and I want to help her, but she isn't helping herself. And what was the point of helping her find a place if she doesn't even try?

First time poster. Long time reader. On mobile sorry for any mistakes. 

I (21F) and my bf (26M) we’re chilling out for the beginning of the quarantine after our spring break vacation. We were hanging out for about three weeks when I talked to my parents you know updating them that I was alive when they insisted I come home. 

Now I hadn’t been home since Christmas due to the circumstances of my college. So I can understand that they wanted to see me. 

Thing is, I prefer to be with my bf who lives about 2 hours away. He’s fun, nice and chill, and there’s no expectations of me with him. I can be myself. At home I have three younger siblings and of course my parents who all have different expectations and while I may not have chores here like I used to when I was younger it’s still not as fun as my bf’s place. 

I came home because I haven’t been home since Christmas. I’ve been here for just over three weeks and if I’m being honest I haven’t enjoyed the time. They aren’t mean or anything of the sort. I just don’t enjoy the time in the same way. They’re lovely people and I do enjoy being with them in small doses. 

Also I try not to hold it against them but because they moved I don’t have a room or bed of my own. I sleep on the floor of their pseudo living room.",12May2020,1

He and his family were generous and supportive enough to let me stay until I got a decent place. He’s still my best friend and we’re planning to spend the night with each other when we hangout(him at my place or I at his). He helped me load/unload/organize my stuff, we got dinner, hung out for a bit afterwards and then came the time for him to leave...I felt the tears coming but held them back as much as I could, since I had already cried this morning. 
So here I was, calling my mom living states away, to cry and tell her how lonely I feel and that I miss him already. Which made her sad seeing me cry so I cried even more.
How do I help myself feel less lonely? Yes, I have roommates but they’re not moving back until the end of May or so because of COVID-19. 
I’ve been playing video games and talking to friends to keep from crying but I still end up breaking down. Him and I have agreed to stay in each others lives and see what happens later on, so I shouldn’t be as sad but I am. We’ve been texting since he left my apartment but damn am I hurting.

To start, I think maybe I've always had a problem with executive dysfunction, but it's absolutely gone too far now. My university is online now and it started off alright, I felt like I wasn't doing enough and overdoing it at the same time. It was also hard to keep track of all my classes without a fixed schedule. But now I'm behind on so many assignments. My professors know I'm having this issue and I've reached out to them. They all understand that some of us are having motivational issues and are flexible with giving extra time for assignments. But I just feel terrible about it. I've always needed pressure to get things done, but now it feels like there's nothing actually due and there's no pressure. My sleep schedule has also shifted tremendously because I can only get work done at night. Maybe there's a pressure to get everything done and go to bed, so that's why? So I often stay up until the sun rises. It's making me feel like I'm failing at everything, and at the same time like an underlying problem is now becoming severe, so maybe I was always failing.

276,"I’ll try to be short. I’ve never really went online to ask for advice, but i honestly don’t know what to do here. 

my parents have been very little supportive in my and my sister’s lives, even less involved. my sister and i basically rely on each other because talks with our parents usually end in lectures or criticisms, but my sister has more to talk about since she’s older (a lot of pressures and responsibilities on her). i’ve seen her go through a lot both outside home and both in our home that have most likely affected her deeply. 

anyways my sister’s in college but she’s trying to transfer to a more expensive one out of state. at first when she suggested the idea a few months ago my parents were fine, maybe even happy for her to suggest it, but now looking at financial costs they’re starting to lose support. my mom especially will take a hard hit with the parent loans, which i acknowledge is a concerning thing since my parents are in their 50s and i don’t want them to have money problems to the end. but the way they’re treating my sister is overwhelmingly unfair. 

my sister went to a state college first majoring in film. our parents were worried, and due to the pressures of them and other factors, she switched to business, because of talks from her parents to be ‘practical’. she was also unhappy there, she then switched to something else. now she wants to go to an out of state expensive college. it may sound like she’s asking for a lot but i know personally that she’s never been able to take such a risk in her life before. she was passionate with film, but dropped that for ‘practicality’, and to this day she still wonders what would’ve happened if she stayed. even choosing to go to a college in our area wasn’t big of a risk; still she tells me often she hates being at home, having to commute to college, not fitting in here. 

a recent night my parents brought up the topic of her transferring all of the sudden, and they went off on a long lecture about the kind of debt she and them would be put in. the talk stretched on into how she could get a pharmaceutical degree or something like that and that would be better, which i nearly scoffed at. they repeatedly told her to think ‘practical’ about pursuing her passions but they’re entirely wrong about that. the major she’s doing (advertising) isn’t her passion, she chose it knowing that it would fit her in a way that she would like doing it and could still make money over film and music and other passions she has. 

she left saying quietly that yeah, she’s not gonna transfer anyway. then they brought the topic to me and how i would have to be ‘practical’ and think the same thing. 

i’m emotional concerning serious talks with my parents, it’s dumb, but i think it’s just the fact that talking about something so serious is scary. i was crying but i finally confronted them, saying it was unfair of them to talk on and on without asking her what she wanted. i could barely explain myself and i could understand my mom saying how much of a risk she was taking, but as i went upstairs in my room i was thinking about all of the times my sister missed all the opportunities and risks to please my parents and meet their expectations. she’s done it for so long she’s sick of living her in this house. 

this is why i think money issues should never be put on children, no matter the age, because the more you put it on them how much their life costs to you the more they think they deserve less. but i want some advice because i have no friends to get it from. is my sister right in wanting to go out of state? am i right to defend her? are my parents right to not let her transfer?

i know i’m not involved in this conflict in any way, and that confronting my parents was not my business when it had to do with her, but i just want some advice if that will set my mind straight.",12May2020,1

278,"I am 23, my mom is 60. Her and I have always had a complicated relationship. I was raised by her and lived in her house with her boyfriend growing up. I was put into foster care because of her and her boyfriend. The way I feel about my mom is complicated, but I try my best to figure out why I feel certain ways about her. 

I get defensive and irritated when I talk to her. Walls go up instinctively. She's unbearable sometimes... manipulative, mean, and controlling. But she's old now and quite frail. She has an ileostomy bag (so part of her intestine is just... outside her body). Her health has been declining rapidly, physical and mental. She can be loving in her own way and I just want her to be happy. She's lost connection with most of her kids because she is so dramatic and hard to be around. It's easy for regular conversations to turn into arguments because she thinks you're attacking her - and then she gaslights you into believing it never happened. She sweeps important and traumatizing things under the rug, but holds grudges on small things people say or do. And she's very different now, after having so many surgeries. It's horrifying to watch.

But I love her. Despite the anger and the pain she has caused me and not addressed... I love her so much. I do my best to be a good kid because at any moment she could die and I don't want her to feel unloved. I don't want her to feel guilty in her last moments - like her children don't love her. She is my mom after all. 

That being said... I don't think I could live if she died. I don't know what it is about her specifically, but the idea of her not being around anymore drives me insane. I feel like my heart and brain begin splitting at the thought of it. My whole body shakes and I begin crying. One day to just wake up and she doesn't exist anymore. No more conversations with her. No more seeing her face or anything. Gone. and even as I'm typing this I'm beginning to hyperventilate. I can't stand it, this anxiety. I sometimes think I should kill myself so I never have to experience a life without her, but then I don't want her to have to experience losing a child. 

I'm terrified and absolutely paralyzed by this fear. What can I do? Is it normal to feel this intensely about death of a specific person? Is what I'm feeling even healthy? Part of me feels like I have a really unhealthy dependency on my mom, but it's strange because our relationship is so back and forth. 

I just need to find a way to sleep and not be so anxious anymore because I feel like I am manifesting her death sooner than it should be (which makes me more anxious).",12May2020,1

286,"Using a throwaway account because some of my classmates use reddit and I don't want them to find out yet, before I've made a decision.

I was supposed to graduate highschool next month, but because of the quarantine our graduation party was delayed until August. Everyone in my class is deeply saddened by this and are looking forward to it, but I'm secretly hoping it is cancelled completely.

I've been in this school since year 7 (grade 6 American, I think?), but after 6 years I don't think I made any meaningful connections. Everybody keeps telling me how HS is the best time of your life, but I couldn't disagree more. Basically everyone but me loves partying and drinking, but I never enjoyed it. Believe me, I tried. To clarify, I'm definitely not the ""holier-than-thou"" type of person, I just never liked that. As a result, I'm graduating without really wanting to keep in touch with anyone. 

Now that graduation is approaching, most people are promoting this ideal of unity between everyone in the class. This has been going on for a while now, and I'm sick of it. Why? because there are a lot of people being purposefully alienated from the main group. I understand that not going to their parties would not make them like me, but it is more that just meself. Some of the nicer people is the group have called this out because, really, we are not that united. 

Another reason why I don't want to talk to them is because of how they love to shame people because of their relationships. This last year, I was almost universally harassed because of my ex, with everyone claiming I was going to go back to her even though she was abusive, and one girl was driven to depression because for our graduation video they began shaming her because all they could think about regarding her was her ex. Of course, this was not everyone, but it is something that nobody really finds odd, and I hate that environment. 

The final nail in the coffin, really, is that the only ""friend"" that I had started to only talk to me when she needed help with homework. During quarantine, I haven't felt then need to chat with anyone, but she stuck with me the first few weeks. That is, of course, until she finished what she was working with and ghosted me. I didn't realize she was using me until now. So really, I don't have any close friends to speak of.

So, now, I don't want to keep in touch with anyone. With our last few weeks of school cut short, I realized that I didn't feel bad at all having unknowingly seen them for the last time without saying goodbye.  Tomorrow, I had a meeting with my film class to celebrate the end of the school year, but I already cancelled. Now, the only time I will get to see them again is if our graduation party actually occurs. I really don't want to go, both to cut ties with them and because I don't like parties. I haven't quit the group chat yet because that will cause some people to get mad and try to get me back in. 

I'm only conflicted about this because everyone keeps telling me that these will be some of the best memories of my life, but I don't think that applies to me. I just want to move on to university and meet people that I genuinely can get along with. My parents don't want me to miss graduation or to cut contact, but my friends from outside the school are actually telling me to not go or are offering to go with me so I don't get bored. I don't know if i will regret this in 20 years, but right now it seems unlikely. What should I do?

TL;DR: Higschool was not my favourite time. I want to cut all ties with everyone, but I don't know if I should.",12May2020,1

My friend is in a mommy daddy role-play with a 14yr fem and 18yr male
 
My friend is kinda gullible and shes always trying to make friends. She added the girl while trying to find another person, the girl told my friend that she was abused and trying to escape (I'm not sure how she got the guys I'm sure the girl sent it to her tho) my friend felt bad and See's it as she needs to talk to her 
I didn't think to much of it until I saw him messaging her  stuff like this (this is on snap I don't have screenshots)

*Kisses your neck* 
*Takes off pants and slides into you*

So I messaged him the words ""tiny dick"" 
And then he sent a dick pic 
He had sent one before since my friend said when he sent it ""oh no not again"" I opened and it was his private area hard 
I said 
""wtf does he know your age?"" 
Her : "" yeah""
""He's 18 right?""
Her:""yeah"" 
""What did he say when you told him"" 
Her:""I mean he didn't really say anything"" 

By asking her more he sent her nude drawings of women and asked for her to look nude girls ON HER PHONE and send it to him 
She said he's never asked for her nude 

Then I talked to some other people about it and decided to talk to her knowing she wasn't going to listen 
Like I said we talk on snap and I don't remember the messages clearly so hears it basically

""You shouldn't talk to him""
Her""why""
Because you're being stupid he's a pedo""
Her""no I not""
""Call""  
We called and I yelled at her she said shell block him
I told her I didn't want her to think I'm being mean and understand why 
She said because she's not supposed to
So I said that's not the reason 
And she said its her reason
And I said well it's the wrong one 

I made her put me in a group chat with him 
I have his snap if anyone needs it 
He hasn't hit on me but I don't post pics of myself

288,"am from Illinois, where we are currently in Phase 2 of re-opening. This means non-essential business employees are asked to work from home and only travel for essential goods, if needed. 

My employer has be granted a PPP loan. We are a sport facility that coach recreational and team students. Obviously, we are shut down bc this is not essential and my sport is very hands on coaching (gymnastics). 

My employer had us (employees) come off unemployment and now it asking us to go in a work, while social distancing and cleaning. I live with a very immune suppressant individual and another individual who is 70 years old. High risk for COVID-19. 

What rights do I have to tell my employer that I 1) dont feel safe with this 2) feel that it goes against our guidelines and 3) how much must I obey my bosses orders since they are now under the guise of this PPP loan. Do I have any room to be safe and stay home while getting paid? I am trying to figure out the best course of action.

289,"A friend texted me asking about schoolwork, and we carried on a conversation (something seemed a bit off to me throughout, but I figured it was just me overanalyzing) for a while before he told me that he wasn't proud to admit it but was close to killing himself. 

I made sure he knew how much I was happy and relieved that he didn't do it. I let him know I care about him and I'm here for him if he ever wants to talk. I tried my best to be supportive. 

He told me that he’s less likely to commit suicide now, but I'm still worried. I seriously care about him and be deserves the world. I wish I could give him a big hug and make him feel better. 

The last message I sent him was at 10:56 PM. It's 12:19 AM now, and he still hasn't replied. It wasn't a question, just me telling him not to be too hard on himself. Since it wasn't a question and it's getting pretty late (but he's an insomniac, so I don't think that he’d be asleep so quickly), I don't really know if I should be worried about his lack of response, but I still am. 

I don't know what to do. I'm only 16. I already posted this to r/SuicideWatch as well. This is frigging scary because I don't want my friend to die and I just want him to be okay.

291,"Alright, so I guess I should explain this. I’m 19 (M) and I live with my parents because they offered to support me while I go to school. I live with my stepdad, my mom, and several younger siblings in a two bedroom apartment in an attempt to save money and pay debt that my stepfather racked up. He has made several claims as to why he couldn’t pay these bills, but that’s irrelevant. A few weeks ago, he was let go from his job (easily $100k a year, which is important later) for not knowing how to manage people, which is literally in the title of his job. I should also mention, this is the *sixth* or *seventh* time this has happened. He often left my mother and I (and eventually my younger siblings too) in horrible situations (like, homelessness and various other situations similar) because he needed somewhere to sleep for work.

Currently, the only people in the house employed are my mother and myself, both of us working entry-level jobs because my stepfather asserted that his job was safe. Well, my mother put some applications out (as did my stepfather, but he’s been turned down on almost every single one so far), and she has been accepted to work at the Salvation Army. The problem is that this is several states away, and it would require us to move. This of course means I would need to leave my job, which has been very difficult to come to terms with. It’s a niche job, with incredible pay (for essentially just doing menial tasks in an office) and most of the staff is like a second family to me. It’s going to be really hard to leave, but there is no way I could survive where I live on my own because my hours were cut and rent is ridiculous (college town and a town nearby often has celebrity homeowners, as it is a ski resort town). I would need to assist my mom with watching my siblings so she can go to work and it will let me do my online classes. But leaving work will absolutely shred my income, as the industry I work in is essential, but not likely to hire new employees during the pandemic. My mom is planning to leave in about two weeks, because they want her to start immediately. What should I do next?

TL;DR: My mom got a great job offer, and is taking it no questions asked, but I have to leave my job that I love bc independence is unattainable where I live. My money is all going towards college, so I have to go with her. How do I let my employer know I have to leave ASAP?",12May2020,1

OCTOBER 2017
This was the worst month of my life. I’ve had to move in the past but this was different. They talk about starting new chapters in your life and how you need to leave old situations to experience new ones. But they never say that there’s a possibility these will be the worse chapters of your life. So a little backstory. I grew up with my mom in an apartment since I was in 5th grade. That was one of the best memories I have in my life. That whole street was like a family and I’ll never forget those childhood kids. They helped me experience a true childhood where you go outside and have adventures not only with your friends but your friends parents too and everyone just got a long. Well in 5th grade I had to move in with my grandma and grandpa who lived 45 minutes away from here. I would be going to a whole new school and never see these people again. Cellphones weren’t really a thing for children and we left abruptly like my mom never told me her plans since I was a kid I guess. I left without ever saying goodbye to my Rhoda Lane family. And they never got to say goodbye either. I was just a little boy so it didn’t affect me too much. 

In fact this town treated me very good. I made my best friends through high school here and even moved out of my grandmas with my mom into our own house. It was something we never thought we would have and it was amazing. Until 3 years into living in the house. She got an abusive boyfriend and this relationship lasted for 2 years. By the time it was over I was a junior in high school. The first 3 years were amazing. Then the boyfriend came through and fucked everything up. My mom became depressed and my little sister also became depressed. But I met my soulmate at this time and while I should have been more depressed I wasn’t because of her. 

My mom began drinking, and taking her anger out on my little sister. Not physically just with yelling. I was still okay though until senior year came. My mom has plans to move to South Carolina and I know it was because she wanted to run away from the memories of living here. Even if it was only 2 years of hell and the years before were good, those good years didn’t matter anymore. I became depressed and more of a recluse with finding this out. What should’ve been an amazing senior year wasn’t because I knew these people that were in my life wouldn’t be anymore. Even though we had technology and FaceTime it wouldn’t be the same. I didn’t go to any parties because I isolated myself from my friends and I didn’t even go to prom instead I just worked my shift as a dishwasher. My friends didn’t even really try to reach out which is understandable because I stopped reaching out to them. Even my graduation was so depressing. While everyone was having a milestone moment in their life, I knew I was just there to attend, walk the stage, then go back home and smoke weed. Didn’t attend any graduation parties or anything. Not that anyone invited me. Which again, I blame myself for for isolating. 

October 2017 came. 4 months after graduating. I had to leave my girlfriend of 2.5 years, I had to leave the house I felt like I found myself in and had so many amazing memories in, and I had to leave everything I knew behind. I had to do this before when I was in 5th grade but o wasn’t even self aware. I was just doing what mom says. But now I’m 18, self aware, and I feel dead inside. We drive 20 hours to the new house in South Carolina and this is where my true hell begins. 

I was always a happy kid. Always talking always making friends. Even with everything in my life that happened to me I was still positive. But this move down south broke me as a person. I genuinely felt like my old self had died and I have to make a new version of me. But I don’t know how to do this. In 5th grade when I did it it was easy because kids make friends easy. I’ve been down here for 3 years now and I have not made any friends, I’ve had about 10 different jobs, and I don’t know what I’m doing with myself. I’m from the north so being down here was a huge culture shock. When you grow up in the same state your whole life you kind of assume everywhere is like where you live except it looks different. This was a million times wrong. I don’t fit in with southern people and I haven’t since I moved here. They’re grimey, they always stare at you, they’re racist, talk shit behind your back for no reason, and just annoying to be around.

I consider myself a genuinely nice and sweet guy. But these people down here make me feel like I’m so weird and idk what it is. I’ve even had coworkers tell me that I’m weird. Like what the hell?? They’re so rude. Ive never had this back home and actually in high school I was pretty popular until I started isolating myself during senior year. People always said I was chill always said I was cool whatever. But down here people don’t even talk to me, and make me feel so uncomfortable. Obviously the only place I’ve been able to meet new people is working at jobs since I can’t afford school and every job I’ve had here is the same. They’re all a happy little southern family and I was never apart of it or able to break myself through their barrier. I don’t know if it was because I was from up north or what but I don’t get it.

And because of all this I am more depressed than I have ever been in my life. I used to be so confident and now I feel like I can’t even go grocery shopping because I feel so out of place down here. I feel like I’m in a loop of start a new job, meet new people, start out okay, and then after a month the vibe people have towards me feels weird and I leave. I feel dead inside and I don’t know what to do. I live here with my girlfriend now (the girl I had to leave when I first moved down here) and even she’s depressed now. She says she doesn’t like the south either and it feels weird down here. Plus she also had to leave her friends and family like I did and is kind of going through the same thing as me. We feel so helpless. We had so many friends back home and it seems like we can’t make one single friend down here. 

I wanted to go into so much more detail so I’m sorry if this is kind of sloppy because I wanted it to be as short as possible too. Pretty much I just need advice on what to do. How do I make friends? All my friends I had back home were friends I made from 5th grade and it all came natural and it was my own family back home. Now I’m down here and it seems like everyone has their own family and I will never be apart of any of it. And my girl feels the same way. We feel like it’s the people here and we talked about moving back up north but it’s stupid expensive and stupid cold. But the people make it feel warm. I just feel like no matter where we move we shouldn’t have a problem and I’ve been having this problem for 3 years straight pretty much. I feel like the shell of of a person instead of the person I used to be. I don’t have a therapist and I don’t have anyone to talk to except my girlfriend and we are kind of going crazy here. What should we do?",12May2020,1

296,"Some background information: In July2018 i moved across the country with my mom cause my dad was mentally abusive and clinically depressed. That left some scarring and i haven't really got to talk to anyone about it yet. I went through a fake depressed phase (to the point i cut myself). I regularly get these breakdowns but they aren't so frequent anymore. Sep2019 i moved again and attended a new high school.

So basically i go into a fresh high school, its new and i haven't messed up yet. And then i go and be self-absorbed and say really rude things to people, be pretty b*tchy and generally a nuisance. I pushed myself to do things i was bad at with a negative attitude. I wish i could go back.

This time in Quarantine has made be realize how toxic I was and how i was just repeating what i did before. I don't know how to apologize, i just want to stay inside my room and not go to school when the time eventually comes. I know i need to face my problems head on but I'm scared ill just mess up again. I want to move to another school but its a hassle for my parent and just not the way to deal with things. Any advice is absolutely appreciated. Thank you.

299,"this is pretty long, TLDR at the bottom

alright so here's the thing, since march 2020 i've basically been home inside a full house with all of my family members and their s/o. we've all been in and out of each others hairs since ever but the one thing that i have to tolerate daily is my aunts and uncles and whoever's random shouts for attention, my brother's gaming/classes, and my mom's 24/7 karaoke and fb live streams. all of this noise and disturbance are in the living area, which is also where my desk area is, which is only a few feet from the stairs down or the kitchen (open floor plan). 

onto some details: 

* my IT internship is now a wfh IT internship and i am taking 3 online summer classes (in order, at most 2 running at the same time), no meeting times just my own pace and due dates. 
* that noise level and lack of consideration for others is driving me insane, it is exhausting dealing with them and trying to get them to be understanding is hard af (because of them, i flunked one of my finals and my professors had to email me because there was too much coming from my mic during the quizzes/exam proctoring, brother made sure not to game while im in an exam)
* there isn't a good private/quiet space in the house except for the attic that nobody has seen in the past 7 years (i dont have my own room), my parents dont want me going up there because it was a mess from the last time they saw it, theres a window but the ventilation isnt great in summer weather, no a/c, bugs mites and other things; they want me to have my work meetings in the living room or my room instead and promised to keep the volume and disturbances down and im here like that is a whole lie because i flunked and my brother also flunked and we both got yelled at for it by the ones who caused it :) 
* i dont wanna be slouching in bed during meeting calls (zero space in a shared room) and i dont wanna wake my brother up early in the mornings with it (or bother him when he is napping midday while avoiding everyone else). parents room is pretty close to the living room and it's not sealed so they would also be disturbed early morning
* i also have to deal with my aunts and uncles and whoevers randomly coming up to say a few words (istg they are purposely being loud just to be annoying) or steal snacks (all in living room. open space)

im not sure how this wfh internship is gonna be like (didnt get much information from company). they also reached out early to stress that its okay if interns wanna back out because of covid19, they could still run the program with or without us, its gonna be online only and if anything they could cancel this year's program, i agreed to continuing it but also was open to them canceling if needed and so were some others (reply all is a fun button). 

i need the position because this would be the only job i have that matches my degree/industry well, the position deals a lot with website management as well as analytics so i am very interested in it and the practical knowledge/experience that comes from it. i am fine with the work load since im very used to juggling academic stuff with life stuff with work stuff, but i am absolutely not okay with having to juggle anything alongside dealing with my family's antics with no escape (escape was usually school or work)

im pretty much stuck between moving myself/my set up a lot or suffocating in a potentially dangerous attic for 2-3 months. it would be mentally draining to me to have to move myself multiple times a day while trying to concentrate on real-time work while also have to deal with my family. we can try to clear out the attic but we are in the middle of a pandemic i dont think we could get any exterminators here or do heavy cleaning on such a space, plus its still gonna be really hard to breathe in

**TLDR**: covid19 strikes, losing sanity dealing with family, has a wfh internship starting soon, has online classes starting soon, zero space to actually be in a wfh situation, **should i drop the internship and save myself the mental trouble** or **should i get the experience while possibly making it the worst experience ever because i have to deal with my family at the same time**?",12May2020,1

So I'm a male in my late teens, I have several issues that are constantly making my life harder than it has to be, it's nothing new but at this point my usual coping mechanisms are no longer helpful so I felt like asking for advice. I'm constantly agitated, pissed, annoyed or angry at everything and everyone. It's impossible for me to sit down for more than a few minutes or do anything that's mentally demanding. I constantly feel like I'm sick or that something is seriously wrong with my body, once a thought gets inside my head, I can't do anything to distract myself and after a while it feels like someone is reading my own thoughts to me in a really annoying voice. 

A huge chunk of my day is spent pacing around my room and fidgeting with things, trying my best to escape my own thoughts (As an example, for the last few months i fidgeted around with my hair so often that I always had headaches by the end of the day). I push away anyone who tries to approach me or talk to me, it feels like everything is so fucking loud and annoying. Trying to hold a conversation is getting harder for me, I either have nothing to say or blurt out random incoherent shit that makes no sense.

No social life (even pre covid) homeschooled all year round super strict parents. When a ton of shit hit the fan a few years ago, everyone fell apart. Became ass holes, or sad all the time. I stayed strong. Clear minded. Then I jacked for the first time. Strict family strict morals. And according to my morals it was wrong. I still believe that. But I kept doing it. I felt horrible kept doing it. Then when I tried to stop it was to late. Porn got in the mix. Now orgasms feel like nothing. I fap avg about 4 times a week. Sometimes more. Been good at removing the porn part but damage already done. I now have sick sexual thoughts.

She has also asked for us to meet up when I go to her city next time and we both shared numbers too. I don't if this matters but she has also called me hot, sweet etc. It was very nice.

  


I'm in general kinda introvert, awkward at conversations and what not so I was really excited when we vibed. I've also told her that if I feel like I'm disturbing her, please let me know etc. So yeah, just recently I don't know what happened but she's taking hours to reply back, and the last message I sent she took over 2 days to see the message and reply on fb. I know she was active on fb tho cause she shared posts, commented etc.

  


So after 2 days she replied and I replied back and once again she didn't see the message yet (after 7 hours or so and still) if she wasn't interested in chatting I didn't really wanna disturb her sending more messages and having a conversation just for the sake of it.

308,"This is going to be a lengthy post so TL;DR is at the end...

I'm going to start with the worst issue I'm currently facing and it's that I have really bad anxiety and depression sometimes and it's usually because I think about death and losing my parents and siblings. I'm 16 currently and I think I'm very mature in this regard. I've been really upset about death for as long as I can remember but it started making me horrified and not enjoy living for about a year now. I'm do not believe in God (but I respect anyone who does) and this makes it really hard for me to not ball my eyes out when I think about not being around anymore. I also know alot about the hear death of the universe which makes everything feel so useless to me. I wish I was never conscious of any of this and wish I wasn't alive but also want to live forever. I've told my parents a tiny bit about this but nothing more than ""I'm terrified of death and get sad often"" they have offered help but I do not want to see a therapist. 

Okay so this is going to seem out of place now, but I just got done writing that Frist problem I have and started to cry. It's late where k love currently (about 2a.m.) and I panicked and got out of bed and pretty much fell to the floor freaking out because I don't want to die. So in this panic I texted my friends and a girl I like and got one answer. It was my best friend who texted me and he said seek advice from my parents cause he can't do much but he's there for me. After talking to him I just chilled out and am like emotionless again... WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME.

Now for the second part of my problem with emotion. I had a huge crush on a girl (I'll call Anna for anononimity) back in grade school but she liked another guy, which was upsetting to me because I had just told her how I feel. About a year later we got into grade 9 (first year of highschool where I live) and I was in a relationship and she was no longer. At this point my relationship was pretty shitty; my dad got cancer and my girlfriend just cared about herself. Saying I didn't call her enough (long distance and called for 6 hours a day isn't long enough). I always thought Anna was beautiful and we were still close. I'm a class I had with her she had been holding my arm and my girlfriend at the time found out. She told me to tell Anna to fuck off and I did because I was an idiot. I think Anna had began to like me bit I realize until way after. Fast forward you to now and Anna just ended things with a guy she's been dating for 1.5 years. She texted me right away to get advice and I gave her pretty good advice in my opinion. I still have feelings for her and so I didn't want to try and mess things up, so I did give her an unbiased opinion. She's been single for about 2 weeks now and I've been talking to her everyday. Ive dreamt about her recently and want to tell her how I feel and everything but I feel it's just too soon. She wants to hang out after quarentine and I really want to as well. She parties and I don't though and she told me she wants to ""have fun"". Before she goes and gets hammered and does something she regrets I want to let her know Ive got these feeling for her. I don't know what to do and would also like advice on this. Should I just go for it or should I try and wait it out, I imagine very often being with her and frequently dream about kissing her. 

TL;DR: 
I get severe anxiety and depression at random intervals and don't know what to do about it. 

Also I have had feelings for someone for years and they're finally single (since 2 weeks) do I tell them how I feel or wait? She wants to hang out bit I think just as friends (after quarantine).",12May2020,1

311,"Hey everyone and anyone. I am turning to you all for a little advise. I am not sure what I should do. I have an idea of what to do but I am not completely sure. So here we go....

My boyfriend (40M) and I (35F) have been together for 15 years. We have a beautiful life together. We have 4 children, a successful business and have always had that soul connection (plus great sex). 

Last fall he started to need time by himself with his “boys”. He had never been one to go out and party. I knew this wasn’t going to go well for us. The more I begged him to stay home the more he wanted freedom. In early February I finally found out about the other girlfriend. I was and am still devastated. She was 23 and didn’t look like she had 4 kids. (I do a good job staying in shape but I can’t compare with that). 

Of course, I am an adult, I understand infidelity. I get that there was something missing. He is the love of my life and I want it to work. But the more I find out the worse it feels. He was able to just shut me out, he was so cold to me. 

I don’t know what to do. Stay or go? Since I found out about her (apparently he had already ended it), he has been saying and doing all the right things. But I am obsessive and I keep digging. I found out even more hurtful things about their relationship. I am so pissed and so hurt. If it weren’t for all my children, I swear I would be gone. 

Any advice?",12May2020,1

318,Ok so around 5 months ago my best friends Boyfriend broke up with her for reasons that although probably relevant I don’t want to get into to keep things semi simple. So as soon as I found out I told her I’d come get her and so I went and picked her up (she lives like an hour and a half from my bfs house). I picked her up and bring her to my bfs house where I’m staying and we proceed to get drunk by ourselves because my bf was on the night shift at work and his housemate and his gf were at the the local pub. I am friends with his house mate who is also one of my other friends brothers. His gf and him had only been together for a couple of months and I’d only met her a couple of times at this point. She was in the process of moving in with my bf and his housemate and had just quit her job where she lived which was 3 hours away and got a job in the town they live in (so some big commitments had been made). Anyway after a while his house mate comes home by himself really drunk and we’re talking to him. My friend hasn’t really met him before. His gf gets home a bit later and a few other people come over too. Housemates gf goes to bed not long after getting home and we don’t really see her for the rest of the night. Anyway the rest of us are out in the shed getting drunk and hanging out and very late in the night probably around 1-2am my friend and housemate go missing. Two of our friends who came over go out to look for them and come back saying that they’re having sex. So after that my friend and housemate cover it up and tell my bf it didn’t happen and then housemate goes to tell his gf their friends are saying shit and not to believe them because nothing happened. Anyway I end up comforting my best friend for the rest of the night because she feels awful. The next afternoon her bf picks her up and they’re back together with her saying he can never find out and neither can anyone else and basically I’m sworn to secrecy. The two friends who caiught them in the act promise housemate they won’t say anything. I ask housemate if he’s going to tell his gf and he says he will but not right now because she’s just moved here and got a job here and has nowhere else to go if they did break up and it’s not a good time. Fast forward to now me and housemates gf are really really good friends and I love her so much she is absolutely lovely! Anyway she’s had concerns that he’s cheated on her and talked to me about it A few different times and I’ve had to talk to her about that and lie to her (don’t worry I’m disgusted in myself too) and I’m basically asking what I should do (even though I guess I know housemates gf needs to know). I will be ruining 4 lives by doing this. And I guess I’m looking for any excuse not to and to put it off. I don’t want to lose my best friend and I’ve talked to her about this and she’s begged me not to tell housemates gf because she wants to be with her bf and it will ruin her relationship too. But I just feel so awful whenever I see housemates gf because I know she trusts me and I know I’m a terrible friend for betraying her trust but I don’t want to ruin my best friends life either. She lives with her bf and if they broke up she would have to move out and probably go back to her parents who live 2 hours from where they live so she’d have to quit her 2 jobs. I’ve also talked to housemate about how I don’t want to keep lying to his gf either and he says that he will tell her when she’s in a better place mentally however I dont know if he will just continue to put it off forever. I also don’t think it’s fair to his gf because I think she deserves to know. Just tell me what to do reddit! I dont know if I can ruin 4 lives and I dont know if i could tell housemates gf if he refuses to. I dont know if I could do that to her I know she loves him so much. So basically I’m stuck in the middle and my friend and housemate have apologised profusely for putting me in this situation but neither of them wants me to tell housemates gf. my best friend has FaceTimed me crying and begged me not too.  I also know that if I do make house mate tell his gf all of our friends will probably hate me too and I also really don’t want his gf to hate me either but how could she not? I think I need to make him tell her.,12May2020,1

Recently I’ve been offered a great teaching job with full benefits and full salary. I just graduated in April so this is a fantastic opportunity especially given the current economy and pandemic. However, this job is in a rural community of ~2000 people that is roughly a 10 hour drive away from the city I currently live in. My city now is much larger (~75 000) and I have lived here my whole life. If I accept, I will be leaving behind all of my friends and family, as well as my senior dog and guinea pig.

I am unfamiliar with small town rural living and worry that this move may be a very difficult adjustment. 

Looking for advice and opinions. If I choose based on emotion, I stay at home and hope for a different opportunity to arise or a part time subbing position in the fall. If I choose based off intellectual growth and career building, I go. At least for the school year and then re-evaluate.

Lastly, I will add that this school district has guaranteed job security despite the pandemic. In my current city, they are trying to plan for hybrid learning in the fall which could complicate things here for me. 

I expected to feel overjoyed when offered a job but now that it’s here I feel overwhelmed and anxious. I feel like both choices could be right but also wrong at the same time. 

The contract would run September-June and then I would re-evaluate. I could come home for Christmas and in shorter breaks decide between coming home or exploring around this new town.",12May2020,1

basically, every time i look at her, she feels flattered, almost like she's the baddest in the world, she feels proud, i dont even know how to explain it. She starts walking more confidently, she's like : yas bitch (cringe)

and it fucks me up, cause i think that she's into me cause i only look at her. and i dont stare at her or anything like that, just look at her the way i look at others. tho, tbh, not anymore, at first i kinda liked her too, but now, nah.

i know it sounds stupid, but im at a point in my life, where i feel like no one loves me, so, ummm....

-Made 0 connections
-Main teacher hates me
-Embarrased someone on accident
-getting blamed for someone else having panic attack
-Got yelled at by another teacher for saying sorry to much and for looking too sad.

I feel like such a dumbass for not dropping the program when I signed up for my classes, only because my parents wanted me to stay in.

327,"So I’m a teenager (14F) and I’ve been having issues with my mom. Lately she’s been getting on my nerves and today was a new low for me.
So you know how schools are out? Well I’ve been receiving homework through google classroom and gmail. Last week I did all of my homework but one assignment for English (I had to right a sonnet 😒) and my mom got on my hide for it. 
Today I woke up at noon and she wanted me to do all the homework for that week. She also demanded I do the sonnet even though it wouldn’t be worth anything. 
So I was working on my homework for a full 6 hrs straight (finished my French and tech) and all I had left was English. I went down stairs cause I was hungry. My mom then yelled at me for not doing enough homework and that I needed to finish it all tonight ( my homework is all due Friday). She then yelled at me for walking away and that she “was still talking” to me even though she turned away and didn’t talk for ten seconds. 
I then went up stairs and sobbed for a good ten minutes. Then I went down stairs again because dinner was ready. While trying not to cry my dad berated me for not doing homework. This whole conversation started with him degrading me, saying how I “would bite his hand for food but if he wrote ‘homework’ on it I’d run away”(that’s a whole new can of worms). I tried my best not to cry. After I took a shower I had a major headache and needed to lay down. She came into my room and I thought she was gonna berate me but she was FaceTimeing my cousins. She then went on a small rant about not doing my homework. I was clawing at my arm to tell myself not to cry and she left.

Is this normal? How do I talk to my mom about how I feel? This is definitely not a one off day but she’s never been this bad about homework. She’s told me multiple times when I’ve been upset with her that I wasn’t allowed to feel that was. She was talking like she was the dictator of my emotions. 

Please just tell me what I should do... How do I tell my mom she’s driving me insane?",12May2020,1
328," I am a happily married woman. With my close friends(all women), we arranged a one-week vacation in Greece last summer.

I was a little bit drunk,he started making advances to me and we made out in the club. None of my friends saw us because they were really drunk and away from me and nobody knows any of this. The thing is that he is only 3 years older than my son. I had given him my number. He called me a couple of times but i didn't return any of them. I definitely regret this but can't forget about it.

329,"I (f18) smelled it before the other day in the middle of the day, outside of my room. When I walked into the hall and the bathroom it was there. I figured it had something to do with the grill or something idk. Figured it wasn’t that big of a deal. I live with four other people; my mom , my grandma, my grandpas ex wife and their daughter (who’s 27). Thought if I smelled it they probably could too, and they would know what it’s comes from. I kinda brushed it off as me being young and it probably it having an explanation that I just wasn’t aware of. 

But I woke up tonight, it’s 2:25 AM, and I can now smell it in my room. Everyone else is asleep. I’m pretty sure the heat is on so I’m not sure if it’s circulating from that. Idk. We have smoke detectors that work and change the battery’s regularly. (Don’t smoke detectors have carbon monoxide detectors too?). So should I not worry if the smoke detectors arent going off? 

What do you think? Am I being dramatic? I’m definitely going to mention it tomorrow but I have severe anxiety so I’m kinda paranoid rn and thinking of every worse case scenario. 


Edit; I don’t even know if what I’m smelling is exactly gas. Its kind of like a gas or chemical type scent. It’s not overwhelmingly strong either. A lot of this could be dramatized by my anxiety, that’s very common for me. It’s hard to tell what I should be freaked out about or not, hence why I am posting here and asking.",12May2020,1
330,"Ok so I (25F) have been with my boyfriend (28M) for around ten months, we've recently moved in together and I'm not sure how to handle the situation I'm in.


At the start of the relationship I was aware that my boyfriend was watching porn - obviously, it's something everyone does and I've never had an issue with it with any of my past boyfriends so it was no different this time. However, as time has gone on, things have changed a little.


Now, let me say that my boyfriend and I have a very active sex life. We always have done but especially having moved in together, we've been having sex multiple times a day. All's good.


Since we moved in together, my boyfriend's sexual preferences have become a bit more... Wild? So before, every so often he'd slap and choke me during sex but now it's happening every time and it's happening more and more. I started noticing this but as it's something that I enjoy too I didn't take foo much notice. 


However, it's not only the physical side he's been taking further. He's recently started introducing porn into our sex life. This isn't something I was exactly buzzed by but I'm always up for trying new things and if he wants to watch porn together then I'm happy to give it a go. The problem is that it seems to have gone from being like a side to being part of the main event. I started having a problem when we were about to have sex,just us, nothing else, some casual morning wake up sex, and he struggled to get hard so he put some porn on. When I say that that made me feel so ugly and unsexy... Like I can't get him hard anymore? I don't know.... Anyway this part is my fault as I should have said something but I didn't want to kill the vibe and ruin the moment so I just let him get on with it. 


This has happened a few times now and I've just been letting it happen because I want him to still find me fun and sexy and exciting but the truth is it keeps hurting me and I don't know how to say it or if I'm just overreacting.


Last night he put it on when we were having sex and laid his phone next to me so he could watch during. He hardly even looked at me and now I'm lying here typing this out, crying and feeling weak and pathetic. I think this is made worse as I feel I've put on weight with this quarantine and so I can't help but feel these two things are linked. 


Please if anyone has any advice on how I can bring this up and talk about it I'd be so grateful, i feel like I've just let this get so far away from what I'm comfortable with and I don't know how to bring it back. 


Thank you in advance.",12May2020,1
331,"Hi All,
Need an advice 

I was in a relationship from past 8 years with a guy. We actually met in college days we were around 17year.



I wasn’t taken this relationship light  I had decided if I am moving with this person I will be marrying him and he was also serious at that time.

We completed our PG and I got a job and started working . He was in a depression for 10 months that he dint have any job. His friends, relatives, left him him I always told him he deserve better and he will be in a good position.

Finally he got a good job in very good organisation and he got new set of colleagues to enjoy.

Fine I was happy that he got job, his financial situation wasn’t good at home , I was happy seeing him getting settled.

He wasn’t enjoying with his friends he want going out for vacation he want wearing good cloths or partying.

I always wanted him to see in good position and live his life and get things what is always dreamt of. 

After joining to his job in  2 months he came and confessed he got closed to one girl and chatted , spend time in calls and videos till mid night. 

I understood him because that was new life to him and corporate life. I really got angry but I just told him to speak to that girl and stop everything , but he kept on continuing the same.

I yelled at him, I requested him, I cried he used to tell I’ll stop but continued in my absence .

This happened for 4-5months and I contacted that girl and requested her not to spoil my relationship but her response was she knew that he is In a relationship but can’t stop contacting him.

That girl she kept on conveying my msg to him and argument started with him and myself.

He changed a lot
He compared me and her
He said she is modern
She is updated
She is good looking
I earn less
Everything 


And when this reached his family he said I stayed with him for money and he said he doesn’t want me .
He portrayed in front of his parents that I’m not worth enough. His parents told him he can marry whom ever he like they dint have any objections.

He got good salary he got good job and on-site opportunity and he is happy with her.

I wanted to study in aboard but sacrificed as he dint want me to go anywhere.
I got a small job which I was happy with. 

Today I earn less , I lost my friends , I lost my time and happiness",12May2020,1

333,"Maybe this will sound silly but... I love making videos, editing, making people laugh, etc. I want to get somewhere on YouTube. I even want to start Twitch streaming. I don't want to be ""famous"" but if I want to keep doing what I love and keep putting 6+ hours everyday into it, then I need to make some sort of revenue (at least until I get out of college and start searching for a ""real"" job). So I'm on a mission to get a small following. 

I've been doing this for 2 years but only got serious in the past 6 months. But what keeps happening to me is that I have a unique idea, something that can provide different content than what everyone else is doing, and then I check YouTube a week later and someone just did that idea and got successful. 

My growth has kept steadily increasing, but when I see other content creators who are similar to my niche and doing way better, I get discouraged. I feel like I'm too late in the game to succeed. I see other videos and think, ""I can't make those animations."" ""I'm not witty enough to think of those jokes."" Or I see Twitch streamers and I think ""They're super good-looking, how can I get anywhere if I'm going against all these hot people?"" ""I wouldn't be clever enough to think of that funny comment."" 

The pressure to make unique content before other people can beat me to it is overwhelming. And then I'm drowning in thoughts of ""I just naturally can't do it as good as these other creators.""",12May2020,1

We have been talking for 11 days straight and I don't know if I can keep up with it, I told her things that I really care for her and she said that feels the same way. I think she's been replying much slower than expected which I was thinking that I should just cut her off, she mostly initiates talks and tells me about how she thinks off me sometimes.



I don't know her slow replies are just getting annoying and we have gotten really close to each other but I just wanna straight up block her and never talk to her again but I feel like she's already invested some time towards me.

336,"I’ve (F) had it for about 4 years and it’s still an outline. I got it when I was 20 and to me it represents a combo of strength and femininity. The artist made it into his style and as I matured I realized that it wasn’t to my liking. 
The lines are too thick for my taste and a new artist said he can help it look more feminine which sounds cool. I would absolutely love to get it removed even though I know it’ll be costly. I don’t mind the price tag but I just don’t want my skin to be ruined. I know it can cause a lot of burning and damage and with the size, (even though it’s mostly lines), will make it difficult to fully remove. 
I never thought of it as something negative on my body until my recent ex pointed out that he didn’t like it one day. (I did appreciate the honesty though) He did say that with or without it, he loved everything about me. 
However, after that it’s made me wonder if my tattoo would make it hard for a guy to like me? Or for people to think of me as classy as I’ve always thought of myself? I know who I am, the way I carry myself, and the values I hold near and dear. 
I’ve never really cared about what others thought until hearing this small insignificant comment from someone who loved me.

Also this is a bit of a read, so i thank you kindly for your patience and persistence if you have it. Im not a coward, but please, someone just tell me what to do....I feel so lost...

Im 30 yrs old. I feel like a failure, I have a very set view of how the world should be. Apparently, I relate to Naruto alot and I didn't even know. Im only just now starting to watch Naruto. 

I was adopted when i was 5. My brother, and my sister as well. Im the oldest. My brother is now 29, and my sister 26 or 27. I don't remember and I don't know and I don't think I care. Too bad. All three of us were adopted by the same lady. My brother is in a group home for the rest of his life bc of our physically, emotionally, neglectful bio mum. He has fetal alcohol syndrome. My sister has chosen to remain with my adoptive mother. I haven't seen either of them for 15 years. Here's why. 

My adoptive mother was very manipulative, very emotionally and physically abusive. I was molested at 2. So was my brother. My sister didn't experience that, Praise God. The house we grew up in had a different set of rules for the adopted children, despite repeated statements saying otherwise from the bitch (Adoptive mother, AM). We were beaten while AM's own two children did not recieve punishments as near as severe as ours.  Brother started running away in the night, so he was sent away. After that I fell apart and started becoming more angry and didn't give a shit. Why should I? Brother was safe. Not 2 years later, I was sent away. From south of Chicago to north Wisconsin. Didn't finish high school. Didn't say goodbye to any friends. Just vanished. No phone numbers to ask for help. 

I was sent to a trade school and told not to come back. A year later,  I left the trade school and was told to go home. I chose to live on the streets instead. If I went back, I feel like I was gonna slit AM's throat in her sleep. I didn't care. Eventually we made contact and it was shitty. She told me who my parents were and I found them. Fuck the bio mum. Deadbeat... my dad, is an asshole but not a bad guy. 
All this was 10 years ago. Fast forward to about January this year.  

I decided the only way I'll ever get rights to call my brother or see him is to play nice with AM. I've got no money, no education, no influence. Im a failure, wtf am I supposed to do? I feel as though I have forgiven her, but this old hag has no business in my life. I've invited her in regardless bc im desperate. She's laying on thick the fake love, and false memories, and reminiscing about ""oh hey remember the good times?"" No bitch, but I do remember the choke slams, quarter of a bottle of dish soap while being laughed at by her own children and being homeless for a couple of years. Oh boy!  WHAT FUN😡🤬. Fuck you bitch. I just want my brother. 

Is this really worth it? I don't even know if he knows im alive or what he's been told. Should I bother? Or should I just be forgotten....?

Any advice? If you've made it this far, CONGRATULATIONS. A CRISP HIGH FIVE INSPIRED BY DEADPOOL TO YOU. And if you've read all this, thank you. For reading,  and sticking it through. Just being able to heard actually means alot...",12May2020,1

I’m 18 almost 19 now. These things happened around 15/16 maybe 17.

I had a sexual attraction towards my mother. And did some stupid things. I spied on her in the shower, Groped her once, went through her underwear etc. 

I was really messed up. I still am in different ways. I don’t have these sexual problems anymore, or do any of these types of things. I apologized and stuff to her. However, I’m dealing with the guilt and stuff.

I don’t know how to move on. And I hate myself. 

I’m also worried about being reported to the police some of what I did, by my mom. 

Like I said, I want to move on, and I want to live my life, but I don’t know if I can, all because of something stupid I did.

i can’t believe ive done it again. im very disappointed at myself. i just had sex with the same wrong person, for the hell of it. i don’t even feel the dopamine, i just feel “nothing” cause that what it meant, at least this time. 

so when we first started our “situation” things wasn’t set as far as what it was. but for some reason, i can sense and know that she’s having sex with other people. the only problem is that she’s lying. 

i dont know why when women fuck around, they tell lies, but expect men to tell them the truth about everything. and then they repeat the lie over and over so it can sink through. shit doesn’t make sense to me. 

once i started to figure out, i stopped talking to her that often and didn’t want to be bothered but she still insists talking. 

today, i came over her house, and we went in my car and talked. then she asked me if we could “talk”. before anything else i said we wasn’t having any sex, and she got triggered.
so we ended up having sex. and then i told her, i know i wasn’t the only one and she started to lie. can’t stand when i hear a lie. 

but more so i can’t stand myself for falling in this trap again.where i can make a decision that good but end up going on my impulse. it makes me feel dumb.

348,"Basically, all fights start with my younger sister who is turning 14 this year. She's immature and has zero self discipline.

My mom has been doing everything for the house. She cooks 3 meals a day, does the laundry, cleans, and because she is a teacher, helps my brother who is 10. She just gets frustrated when people don't do what they should do.

My dad is really cool and supports me with whatever I do. The problem? He is addicted to World of Warcraft. He plays from 10pm to 1am, then wakes up at 11am. He doesn't really help my brother as much, even though he is also a teacher.

Note: My dad does English and physical education. My mom does Maths and Science, you can see how that balances out.

So, my sister has been retarded again. She didn't do her work, has been behind for a week and constantly compares herself to me. (Oh, my brother has a bigger room, has his own workdesk, gaming chair, wifi, I'm imperfect to him, blah blah blah.)

Now, because she is unwilling to put in work and yield her effort, this stresses out my mom even more. She screams unreasonably, when we just need a little bit of time off. Thing is, my mom doesn't have time off. She's constantly working.

When my mom found out, she just really lost it. My dad stepped in and defended her (sister) and my mom then lectured him. How she sleeps alone, works all day while he's taking daytime naps to prepare for long gaming shifts.

My dad's defence is that it's Covid period. The 'Circuit breaker' is up, and people should just take it easy. Nobody needs to go out. He knows its wrong to stay up all night and game, but he feels that since he already took a hiatus when he had to raise his 3 kids, now they can take care of themselves and he feels that its right to continue his old tradition.

I am not taking sides. But I'm irritated that my sister is lazy, my mom is angry, and my dad is now passive. I love my parents, but I hate it when this happens. It's the third major fight between them that my sister caused. I want something done.

354,"I am really confused about this.

I am have had a on and off relationship with someone (I will name cherries in this) since the fall of 2017. at first we were just friends but we were extremely flirty. we would only really talk on snap but I went to school with him and he rode my bus. I don't remember every detail but basically at one point after snapping every day and being really flirtatious, he removed me. than I found out that he had been talking to another girl and they started hanging out in the halls and later on dated. I was really upset and honestly it made me feel awful. I was still immature and he was 2 years older than me and the girls he had started dating was even older than him. I remember feeling super insecure and confused, but I wasn't heart broken. he had acted like a complete asshole towards me after this because one of the girls in our friend group was spreading rumor's.  I moved on and my life changed a bit. over the summer of 2018 I put on 20 pounds because I stopped micromanaging every bite I was consuming and I was in a really good mind set and had matured allot.  

so basically back to school went really well. I had allot of new friends and I was doing well with my classes. I had been hanging out after school and on the weekends with friends. after school on the bus, cherries had all of a sudden started acting weird and friendly. there was a mutual friend  so we were all talking one day and he was being really nice. so the night of the homecoming game, my best friend had came over after to spend the night. my phone hadn't really been charging for some reason so when we got home, my phone was completely dead. so she let me log on to my snap chat on her phone. I had checked my messages and saw that someone had added me and than in the quick add, his name was at the very top.  I had told her I thought it was weird because after he cut me of he had acted like an asshole towards me.

so I showed her and I was like that's weird I thought he blocked me after he started dating (insert name) so she was like yeah that's weird. so she asked if she could check something really quick and I gave her the phone and she was on it for a second than she handed it to me. she was looking at me like she was expecting something so I said what? and she looked at me and said ""I added him"" and I was mad because I didn't want things to get weird and for him to act the way he had before. so I was hoping he would not add me back and he did. so one thing lead to another and we started talking. but right as we started snapping it was like different than the first time. he seemed more mature and communicative. shortly after we agreed to just be friends(WB). But the thing was: we weren't. 

we would talk almost every single day. he was taking course for emt and cpr. sometimes he would snap while in class. than the next weekend we stayed up until 2ish in the morning talking about deep stuff and made plans together for the summer. basically this went on until Halloween. I had went with a guy I had been talking to and he got mad and started acting different. I was really confused because we had both agreed to be just friends. basically we didn't talk until the beginning of December because the guy that I had went with was a friend of his and when he saw us together he left. so the next day he was acting weird and told me we couldn't talk anymore because he had a gf. 

I backed off because I knew something was up and I didn't want to push. it was just weird the fact that not at any point had he mentioned it. so at the end of November he texted me out of no where and was like how are you? and I said good and we started texting and he told me he didn't have a gf anymore because ""she's a bitch"" and I knew it was a blatant lie. which later on I found out was. and I had stopped talking to the other guy. so we talked all of December. but the energy had completely changed. at this point I started to realize I had serious feelings for him. I started to have really bad anxiety because I was scared to do anything out of fear he'd drop me. we would fight allot and than bounce right back. we would tear at each other with personal shit. we would stay up and talk till 5 or 6 in the morning. this went on till the very end of December. my phone completely broke at this point so didn't have a phone till mid February. right when I got back on my stuff and started posting on my story, he had texted me asking where id been.

I had been going through allot before this so over February break I decided I had wanted to tell him how I had felt. than found out he had a gf that was posting about him so I didn't. I cried myself to sleep that night because I was really hurt again.  then in the beginning of the summer we started talking again and one day he told me we couldn't talk anymore because he had a girlfriend. even though the night before we were talking about sneaking out. than he kept snapping me while he was at her house in her room and kept sending me picture of the bracelet with her name on it. 

so I blocked him. I was upset and I had enough. so than as this corona shit happened, my state went on full locked down mid march. for some reason I decided to tell him. I told him how I had felt and how nervous I was about it before. he told me that it wasn't weird and we defiantly would have hangout and drove around. than we started talking again and we called one night (which we had never done before) and talked on the phone for 5 hours. he asked if he could meet my parents. I was really confused. and he later on told me he felt the same way while we were talking. so we had been talking for about a month and in mid April I realized I need to be clear with him that I didn't want to mess around. especially if were gonna hangout and he's gonna meet my parents. so I told I wanted to know what the deal was because I wanted something serious. and after everything that happened, it wouldn't be a crazy concept to start a relationship. 

and his response: damn

so I said is that all you have to say and he said idk what to say and I said either you feel the same or your don't. and he left me on read. I gave it a day and I blocked him. I was really mad because he was still active and it felt like once again I had gotten my hopes up for nothing. I don't know what to do. I still feel intensely about him and I thought by blocking him, he would be out of my head and id get over it. but its been almost a month and I still feel awful. I cried uncontrollably last night and today. I really need so advice, so please send me some.",12May2020,1

I live in Kansas and 4 days ago the county I am in Ordered closure for K-12 schools, public libraries, and recreational facilities (which I would consider Crunch Fitness to be) until March 29th, but the management here have continued to disobey this city order and have not closed, and I have been the only one at work all night since we are open 24/7.  I am not too afraid of this stuff and try to stay rational in these times of mass-hysteria, but last night like an hour before I went to work the county next to us shut down everything that is not an essential place (restaurants, bars, gyms, etc) and the other gyms/businesses in my county have closed indefinitely; so I am feeling a little uneasy being alone in the fact we are open and I’m the only staff member here.  I want to tell my managers that I do not feel comfortable coming in for my shifts until the government here says it’s okay (the 29th as of now) bc I will probably end up going to my parents house for a while (I have no supplies/little food at my place) but I don’t want to pass anything to them, however I also don’t want to get fired bc I will be in a shitty spot once this stuff cools down as I assume it will be impossible to find work.  I start to think they might also shut down in the morning/tomorrow, but I thought they were going to shut down before today and these greedy pigs have said in our work group messages that we need to “capitalize on the public/competing gyms closing” to get new members, so I don’t know how they will react if I tell them I don’t feel comfortable coming in.  

I also don’t know if I’m over reacting by feeling this way and I assume other staff members will be coming to work since we are open. 

I feel like no matter what I do I’m risking something; if I tell my managers I’m leaving town then I’m sure they will fire me for missing my shifts, and if I stay my parents/family will not want to risk being around me (which I understand as a gym is a germs paradise).  I just wish they would do the right thing and close bc throughout the day there is easily 1000+ people in and out of here, passing bodily fluids around, and not being anywhere close to far enough away from each other; and they are mostly ignorant gym rats that think they’re invincible bc of their huge biceps.

At first they just did weird shit like have a bunch of boxes filled with stuff in the shared yard, but then it started getting progressively... Darker.. like her screaming for help because he's beating her... And then freaking out when we call the cops... Like leaving their dog alone for days. Yelling at each other over drugs. 

They bolted their front door shut, and changed the locks, so the landlord can't get in. Also, due to this fucking virus, in my state landlords can not evict. Oh joy. 

Tonight I lost my temper. I had a very long day and when they started screaming at each other I poked my head out my door and told them to shut the fuck up. Now ohmygod I'm scared. Shaking like crazy. All the dude said was ""fuck you bitch"" and that's doesn't bother me. Knowing crackheads they'll forget it happened. But on the other hand...

362,"I'm a community college student. I, like many students, have to do everything remotely because of the lock down order.

Sadly, my home life is not ideal and it has really been damaging to be GPA. My mom has been an alcoholic for my entire life but refuses to admit it or get help. Instead, she makes excuses and blame other people for her problems. At the same time, my dad enables her. She's unemployed and thus, financially reliant on my dad. He always gives in to her demands and buys her 12-24 packs of beer, even though he's seen first hand how horrible she gets while she's drunk. (I can't wait to cut them both out of my life when I get my shit together and move out but that may take years.)

Anyway, She gets extremely obnoxious, aggressive and violent when she's drunk and i just can't work while she screaming/threatening me. I've spoken to her about this and either she tells me that's she's ""self medicating"" or makes empty promises. She knows that education is the most important thing in my life and how drinking effects my mental health but she's doesn't care. She's been very inconsiderate through this whole fucking process. 

Next week is final's week. I can't focus on my timed exams or final projects while my mom is screeching like a fucking a banshee in the background. How do I keep her from drinking and my asshole father from buying her beer. I told him how important these exams are and he promises not to but he's broken these promises in the past.

I hoping that my governor reopens the state by next week so I go to the library and work instead but I'm doubting that.

Any advice on to deal with this? Thanks",12May2020,1
363," When I was younger my mom would hit me when I didn't do what she asked or when I was being disrespectful. She used to have problems drinking and taking things like Xanax. When I went to my psychiatrist I told her that I didn't want them because they made me drowsy and I would have to take it in the morning before school but she would make me get them and I would take a few and then I noticed they were all gone. I always noticed she would get more violent or yell at me more if she was drinking or taking pills. She asks my sister for them sometimes. I know its not just her that causes these fights between us, I know that I'm at fault for a lot of these fights. But since I got older shes been throwing things at me and hitting me harder. A while ago she hit me with a metal spatula and made me bleed a lot more then I guess normal scrapes and cuts and I had to use multiple paper towels to make it stop bleeding but she hasn't made me bleed since so that's good. But she also calls me ugly, fat, a pig, tells me she wishes I was never born, and she told me I'll never be anything in my life and that I'll never get into college, shes threatens to kick me out of the house I know she won't but I still don't like when shes says it. A few times she told me to kill myself. I say mean stuff to her too which I know is wrong but I never tell anyone to kill themselves I've had friends who tried to. I'm already a sensitive and emotional person and suffer from mental illness like anxiety, depression, and body dysmorphia. She also says she'll lie to get me into a mental hospital saying that I tried to kill myself or call the cops on me for being violent. My dad left us a little over a year ago I still talk to him but shes tells me no one loves me and that my dad left because of me. I also lost almost all my friends because of a fight so I don't have anyone to talk to. In the last year or two, I've started fighting back which I know I shouldn't but I told her on many occasions to stop or I will hit her back. This last fight which happened a few hours ago she gave me multiple bruises on my face and other places. I didn't fight back this time because I know I shouldn't. We were fighting because I wouldn't get out of the basement, she threw my shoes at me, hit me with a metal decoration we had she broke it hitting me with it but it was pretty flimsy and she dragged me across the room by my hoodie. When I finally went to my room which I know I should've just went right away, she came up maybe 20 minutes later and started yelling at me and then I said shut up because she was saying hurtful things which got her really angry she threw all my boots and shoes at me and choked me. I did say shut up multiple times but I couldn't help it I was so angry and that just made it worse. I told my dad but he doesn't do anything about it. I'm mostly writing this to get it out of my chest, I know it's not entirely her fault that I'm bad and shouldn't do what I do but sometimes I can't help it. I never told anyone but my sister and my dad, my sister wants to do something about it but she never does, but she can leave whenever it gets worse because she's older and has her own place and sometimes I go with her but she's leaving to go to another state soon. I know people go through way worse but I don't know what to do I try to avoid my mom most of the time. I think she might be bipolar because sometimes she's so nice to me and I like being around her it was just a few days ago we started a tv show together and now she won't get out of bed only to fight with me and my sister. I'm pointing out all my mom's flaws but she also has good things about her too and I have bad things about myself.

My moms bf thinks that it was  because he wasnt the ""one for me"" and I should date another guy.

I told him that that's not gonna happen. I dont even see men as attractive and it would make me feel happy.

368,"Hi everyone,

I have met one girl on internet and we had been writing for 2 months every single day. Not only writing but we also played games and talked on voice chat.   
She writes me everyday, even as first and she wants to call with me all time (we usually call 1.5-4 hours) and she is always so cheerful and laughing. She literally asked me to come to her city and to hang out. She is very supportive and helps me through my anxiety problems.

Our relationship did not start so good, she used to lie about her life and about her look, but after 3 weeks she went out with it and apologised. She told me that no boys want her and if yes they only care about sex and if she wont give, they will leave her afterwards. We once did video call, I was pretty nervous and she told me that it was cute to see me nervous. But she did not show herself and she told me same that she did not want me on FB because of her photos because she thinks she looks ugly on them.  


However, sometimes I feel that she doesnt really like me that much. It is because I really didnt have many friends in real life and they were all fake and I feel like who would want to be a friend with a retard like me..., (she told me same.) However, I dont know but there are many boys that are writing her everyday and she ignores them and still goes to write and talk with me not with them. She told me several times that I am different than other boys and that I have a good heart (This is actually true about me). She told me everything about herself, her life.

So Ive done some things in the past that made my parents lose trust in me. So since those things, they dont allow me to sleep over. But I am 18 and I can't take their rules anymore. We don't agree on anything at all and we have very different mentalities. They are middle eastern so are quite strict but I am very open minded simce we live in Europe. I just got home now from a date (no lockdown here). I arrived at 11.30PM and my dad shouted really bad and my parents were both VERY angry. They said no more arriving after 9PM. Like wtf?!

First of all I hate that I have to lie about going out on a date (since they dont allow that) and have to say instead that I went for a fucking walk. Also 9PM, wtf?! I dont need a fucking curfew. I have a very bad relationship with my parents and honestly im so fed up with their BS. When my dad shouted on me today, I was like ""okay I cant sleep over but in that case you should expect me to get home late"" and then I said ""but since you dont even approve of that then I think the best thing is for me to move out"" and whenever I say ""move out"", they freak out and talk about how much they support me here where I live with them and how Im not adult enough to move out. I feel like in some way they are verbally abusive. Anyways I dont like my parents.

But I dont have a job and Im trying to get one but no luck. Im graduating from high school this June. Then Im either gonna go to uni abroad or take a gap year... stil idk.

370,"Failed after going against the world.

I  am a final year computer science undergrad. I had an option to select between applying for masters or go for job placement interviews. I  wanted to study further, but I faced a lot of criticism. Credits to typical family culture in India, I was asked by a lot of relatives,  friends not to go for masters abroad as it is expensive and difficult.  My parents showed minute support, but I knew deep inside, they were not happy with this decision as opting for a job where I might have got salaries for around 10,00,000 INR(big amount in my family) annually,  would have been the suitable, normal path. This is when my aspirations to go for masters rose. Anyway, they agreed on the masters' option with very much hesitation. I prepared for GRE..score a dismal 308, wasn't confident of attempting it again(smh). I applied to 7 universities in the US. Mind you, all this time all I heard from my family was about looking for different options like an MBA, [M.Tech](https://m.tech/)(MS  in India), etc. I hated this coz I expected at least one person who would have believed in my chances of getting into a top university. No one did at that time. All I heard was criticism. Rightly said, the difficult the path is, the thornier obstacles shall be.

But even after this, sobbing, being depressed, I gathered myself and worked hard on my sop,lors, and the rest of the profile. I spent some good  bucks over the application fee. Felt bad asking such an amount from my dad, but had to do it. The 1st admit was the safest university of all.  Obviously, no one was happy with that admit. So I waited for the next 7  months for the rest of the applications and then things happened that I  dreaded the most. I got only one admit(the safest one) out of the 7  applications I submitted. I knew this thing was not good at all. I  aspired to be in some good universities and I got an admit from the one I  thought I should never go.

Now, I  have not slept properly in the past month, never went out for a  walk(thanks to COVID!). And after getting rejects in such a short span, I  am fearing of telling this result to my family. Obviously, I have been proven wrong, everyone except me has been right all along. I was stupid  to take the difficult path to follow my aspiration. But again all I have heard from the world was how I should have contingency plans if I fail.  But even a tiny bit of motivation would have helped me insanely. As the saying goes there should be no plan B to succeed. I had the same  t hinking.

Now I know when I'll say  I have failed to get admits, all I will hear from people is taunts,  things that will pinch me the most. I don't have the guts to say I have failed as I will be inviting a storm on me. I don't know what to do now.  I have no job, I have no proper admit and then this coronavirus period is adding to the toll. Post lockdown, my friends will be joining their workplaces, a few of them will go to great Universities for masters while I have no privilege to get into any.

The main thing over here is I am disappointed because 1.none of my family members supported me in this decision 2.not getting into an admit(proved wrong) 3. lost the opportunity for a job(it would be more difficult to get one in these times).

I don't think I will ever have the courage to take any difficult path after this if I have an easy way around it.",12May2020,1

374,"Please bear with me, this is going to be a long story, but I will put a TLDR at the end.

To start off with, I am from South Africa and I want to know if there is anything I can do about my SIL, let's call her Cathy. She is a complete psychopath. She's narcissistic and a compulsive liar. 

Some backstory:

I met Cathy while studying in college. When I met her she was nice and friendly and very understanding to some of the personal difficulties I'd faced growing up and even seemed to have shared some of these experiences. I'd found out that she'd grown up in an orphanage because both of her parents had passed away and she'd had no family to take her in. She also stated that she was half-Chinese, half-British. Don't ask me how she ended up in South Africa. She told me how her mother, a Chinese woman, lived with her father, a British man, throughout the Apartheid on a mango farm in the North Cape. 

This is where the warning bells started, but I ignored them. Big mistake. After a while I noticed that some of the stories she told us about her childhood sounded a lot like books I'd read and films I'd seen, but I was still willing to give her the benefit of the doubt. Everything had happened to her in her 25 years from being kidnapped and held hostage to travelling and working as a chef in the UK. Three months after starting college (she was in her first year and I was in my third, but she was older than me by 3 years and we shared a class) she dropped out citing that she'd gotten brain damage from a motorcycle accident that had happened two or three years before and couldn't keep up with the coursework. No biggie. She started working in a bar and we still kept in touch. 

Now, my brother isn't the biggest brain out there and we **do not** get along. Around that time he'd broken up with his fiance (who was also  the mother of his son) over something we still haven't gotten clarity over. He'd seen a picture of me and Cathy and had asked about her. I figured that he was still recovering from his breakup and needed someone to talk to. For the life of me I cannot understand why I gave him Cathy's number that day, and I still regret it. 

Not two weeks passed and Cathy moved in with my brother. Everything was fine at first, she was charming and friendly as usual. Then slowly she started to turn on my brother's friends. Now, my brother has always been very social and outgoing, where I'm the more introverted one. His friends were his life and now she was slowly getting rid of them. 

After a while they moved in with my mom and dad because of financial issues. My brother was an apprentice at the local manufacturing plant and Cathy didn't work, plus my mother was basically raising his son. Now Cathy **hated** my brother's son from the get go. Usual step-mother BS. We didn't do anything at the time because my nephew was spending most of his time with my mom anyway. 

My mom and dad built an apartment for themselves on the same property and moved in there because the house was too big for the two of them (they are retired) and fitting it especially for my dad who is a hemi-plegic since he'd had a stroke in 2002. 

Cathy got pregnant about a year after they married and had a little girl. By then a lot of her stories were not matching up and we'd come to realize that she was spouting total BS. There was everything from skipping grades to being the head chef of a restaurant in the heart of London. And she refused to find work stating that ""she was too white to get work in South Africa"". As she's saying this I'd had 3 jobs in that same span. 1 part time job, one where I'd worked as an assistant and then my current job. 

Every time we'd talk about her getting work (because they were struggling financially and were leaning on my parents to pay for a lot of their expenses) she'd come up with some or another reason why she couldn't go to work. Maybe the best (by that I mean worst) reason was that she said that she has Gene Barre Syndrome (which is total BS). This is a horrible condition and she most certainly didn't have it. But my brother ate it all up like the sucker he is. 

Now to get to the root of the problem. My SIL is emotionally abusive towards my nephew and, i don't know what, abusive to her daughter. I've thought about the idea that she has Munchhausen's Syndrome because of the constant siting that she's ill with this condition and that condition, none of which we have proof for. But now her daughter is also constantly 'ill' with a large barrage of mind boggling illnesses. It could be Munchhausen's by Proxy, or she could just be a psycho. 

Her daughter is a sweet little girl and the healthiest I've ever seen. She does get the occasional bout of flu and such which is normal for a toddler. But here is the kicker. She ignores all milestones for a child. My niece only started crawling at 2 and walking last year She is turning 4 this year and still doesn't talk. Now I don't mean that she's a quiet child, she literally cannot talk. She strings words together. My best friend's baby is turning 3 and you can basically hold a conversation with him and my other SIL's daughter is just 6 months older and is much more developed. 

For example where my best friend's boy could tell you that he'd seen a brown lizard on the wall, by niece would say ""Amma (ouma is Afrikaans for grandma)... lizard"" and would point, or ""Amma... ball"" if she wanted to play with the ball. Now this could be because my SIL says that her daughter 'chose' to be English while all of us speaks Afrikaans. She also doesn't allow her daughter any social interaction with children her own age, saying that the reason she cannot work is because she has to take care of her 'sickly daughter' and they cannot afford to put her in daycare. Also that 'she is too sick and vulnerable' to go to a daycare. My mom and dad are literally retired and are home all day and even offered to take care of my niece.

I feel that this is gross negligence and child abuse, but I don't know if I can do anything about it. There is a lot more things that I didn't add in this post because I feel that it's getting too long and people don't want to read a novel. I'm asking if there is anyone out there who can tell me what I can do.

375,"I have a group of friends that I met on a game about four or five years ago that I still talk to every so often these days. I was 14 when we met and I’m now 18. I’ve been telling them all this time that I’m a male (of the same age) but in reality I’m a female. 

I didn’t have any bad intentions when I lied about who I was, I just didn’t want to be a girl on a gaming website and figured it would be easier to play myself off as a boy. I even used pictures of “myself” that I got from some random dude at my high school, though I haven’t sent a picture of “myself” to them in years. But I’ve been friends with these people for years now and I feel like a bunch of smaller lies just stacked on top of each other. I created an entirely separate persona and I feel so guilty about it.

The reason that this has been stressing me out lately is because one of my friends lives in the same state as me and we live relatively close by. He might end up going to the same school I am, and at that point it’s just too real for me. I obviously don’t want to meet him in person if I’ve been lying about who I am, but if he’s at my school I’m worried he will be able to find me using my phone number. 

I’ve been blocking all my online friends on social media apps that are connected to my phone number since I’m worried that they will realize my phone number is linked to some of my real social media account. But I feel like it’s useless, blocking them on my end won’t do anything. They can still find me. This is also why I’m worried about just ghosting them, I feel like one day they’ll realize that their facebook is suggesting some random girl saved under my fake name in their contact book, and then they’ll realize that I’ve been lying this whole time.

I feel so guilty, I’m torn on whether I should tell them or whether I should just cut off my communication with them. And if I tell them, I don’t know how. I’m worried that if they get mad at me, they’ll be able to figure out who I am, again based on my phone number and it’s links to my social media. I just don’t know what to do and feel like I’m in too deep. Any advice would be appreciated, especially if you’ve been on either end of a similar situation. Thank you.

TLDR: Been lying about who I am to internet friends for years and don’t know if/how to tell them the truth about who I am",12May2020,1
376,"If someone could give me a piece of advice or an opinion or anything, I’d be so grateful.

All of my experiences before the age of 22 were just going out with guys, flirting, and a lot of heartbreak/lies/being ghosted. A guy I was going out with used to insult me, was a sex-addict (good thing I never slept with him) and thought that punching women was ok. 

Then I met my current BF and he was just like me. Well-behaved, also a late bloomer, very caring. He was infatuated with me and I was scared, knowing he would go abroad. But we stuck together, lived together for a bit, then did long-distance. 

There were problems, though. He was/is too childish, lives in a fairytale where we’ll be together forever but has no well-defined future plans, our sex life is awful and he did say some bad things to me. I was unhappy and wanted a break. 

I slept with a friend. We discussed about our feelings and they were mutual, but a relationship was impossible. He was an incredible friend, he helped me a lot, I owe him a lot. He moved abroad too, but we stayed friends. I also got back with my boyfriend. 

My friend and I were supposed to call each other on my birthday, like he suggested, and right before the call he said he got a steady GF and asked if it would be awkward. I said no, I have a BF too. He ghosted me. I sent him some kind of closure text and I will never know if he replied, because my phone stopped working and I might have lost some texts during that day. I wanted to reach out again, but it would be too lame. 

I am heartbroken, not because he has someone, but because I lost one of my dearest friends. I am heartbroken because I tried to make things work with my BF, I even went to therapy by myself, but I don’t know when one should walk away. I’m heartbroken because I’m afraid I’d be like that forever, either being lied to/ghosted/wondering if it’s worth it/wondering if I just settle or if there’s more to it. 

I have an awesome career, incredible parents, I study, work, I am healthy and feel beautiful, but this sadness regarding my love life has always been there.",12May2020,1

so i’ve been struggling with my mental health for a few years now (undiagnosed so i’m not going to label anything) and i’ve noticed that i’ve been extremely uneasy and stressed(?) in lockdown. i don’t know if it’s because of lockdown itself or something else but it’s impacting me really badly and i have no motivation to really do anything. 

small things like brushing my teeth when i wake up or showering every other day are getting really hard. i won’t lie, my sleep schedule has gone really bad, i mean like 8am-6pm and the main reason is ramadan, but me being stressed isn’t helping me sleep either. it’s like i’m tired or everything, but my brain isn’t letting me take a break and actually rest. i wake up feeling even worse the next day and it’s affecting my education too.

i want to email one of the teachers i trust and tell him why i haven’t been doing any of my assignments lately, but i don’t want him to single me out, or think i’m making excuses? i don’t want him to think i’m some weird kid that wants attention for not doing her work. 

like i’m a decent kid at school, i do all my work and yeah, i get in trouble sometimes but i get let off because all teachers know i don’t mean anything . and i don’t want to be “lazy” about my work but i genuinely cannot get myself to do it and i want someone to know so i don’t get called out on it, but at the same time i don’t want his perspective on me to change.

382,"Self isolation meant working from home, and I found that working from home is much more stressful than working in office. Plus I'm on service industry, managing service personnel and on this lockdown period means my people cannot go to work. Now that our government have ease the lockdown and allowing people to go back to work, while I'm still working from home, our service persons are able to go back out and do their work. But there's TONS to do, tons of work to arrange and I'm constantly being bombarded by my boss asking for various data and things to prepare. 

I'm feeling super stressful from all this, felt liek a heavy weight is being put on top of me, I can't breathe, I felt dizzy, but I still gotta do my work. So I brace through all that and now I felt like fainting.

383,"My 7-year-old son is into Minecraft. A year or so ago he started watching some YouTube videos to learn how to do more, and as he got better at searching and seemed to understand our warnings to stay away from things that seem too scary (Herobrine, violent horror mods, etc.), we started letting him watch more YouTube in an unsupervised way.

Well, over the last few months, I think due to some of the YouTubers he watches, he's also got into Undertale... which at first seemed innocent enough, except he's gotten interested in these comics and music videos that seem way too violent and scary for someone his age. And now he's gotten drawn into these other worlds, Baldi's Basics, and Bendy and the Ink Machine. I just went through his YouTube history and am aghast at some of the stuff he's been watching - people dressing up as these characters and scaring each other, creepy animations, Monster School videos with guns and other forms of ""comedic"" violence.

It just all seems way too much for someone so young and impressionable. His behavior has gone downhill somewhat - he's always been a pretty intense little guy, but he seems almost addicted to YouTube and has a hard time putting down the iPad, throwing tantrums at times, sneaking it off the shelf when we've told him he can't watch, and trying to get his little sister to ask for screen time so he can say he should get some too. He seems really attached to these characters, fond of them, moved by their stories. I've tried getting him into the Lord of the Rings, The Chronicles of Narnia, Greek myths, and other stuff with similar dark themes but perhaps more literary and moral value, but he'll often refuse my offers to read to him or whatnot and says things like ""no, I only like Undertale now"" or, ""the only thing that makes me happy is YouTube.""

I'm a horror fan myself, and have had fascinations with fanfic of various sorts. I love Minecraft too (though I focus on architecture). So I can relate to his being drawn into various fandoms, and his interest in scary-but-safe thrills. Maybe as 40-year-old parents, my wife and I are just too sensitive and old fashioned to understand what kids are into these days. But is our concern justified? Is this too much for someone so young? Should we be setting more limits?

TL;DR: 7yo is into Undertale, Bendy, Baldi, and other online violence / creepiness, and seems addicted to YouTube. Are we just overreacting by wanting to set firmer limits about what he can and can't watch, and how much YouTube time we allow?",12May2020,1
384,"When I was younger my mom would hit me when I didn't do what she asked or when I was being disrespectful. She used to have problems drinking and taking pills. When I went to my psychiatrist I told her that I didn't want them because they made me drowsy and I would have to take it in the morning before school but she would make me get them and I would take a few and then I noticed they were all gone. I always noticed she would get more violent or yell at me more if she was drinking or taking pills. She asks my sister for them sometimes.

I know its not just her that causes these fights between us, I know that I'm at fault for a lot of these fights. But since I got older shes been throwing things at me and hitting me harder. A while ago she hit me with a metal spatula and made me bleed a lot more then I guess normal scrapes and cuts and it took me a while to make it stop bleeding but she hasn't made me bleed since then, I think it was an accident. But she also calls me ugly, fat, a pig, tells me she wishes I was never born, and she told me I'll never be anything in my life and that I'll never get into college, shes threatens to kick me out of the house I know she won't but I still don't like when shes says it. A few times she told me to kill myself. I say mean things to her too but I've never told anybody to kill themselves because I've had friends who have tried to. I'm already a sensitive person and suffer from mental illness like anxiety, depression, and body dysmorphia. She also says she'll lie to get me into a mental hospital saying that I tried to kill myself or call the cops on me for being violent.

My dad left us a little over a year ago I still talk to him but shes tells me no one loves me and that my dad left because of me. I also lost almost all my friends because of a fight so I don't have anyone to talk to. In the last year or two, I've started fighting back which I know I shouldn't but I told her on many occasions to stop or I will hit her back.

This last fight she gave me multiple bruises on my face and other places. I didn't fight back this time because I know I shouldn't. We were fighting because I wouldn't get out of the basement, she threw my shoes at me hit me with a metal decoration we had, she broke it hitting me with it but it was pretty flimsy and she dragged me across the room by my hoodie. When I finally went to my room which I know I should've just went right away, she came up maybe 20 minutes later and started yelling at me and then I said shut up because she was saying hurtful things which got her really angry she threw all my boots and shoes at me and choked me. I did say shut up multiple times but I couldn't help it I was so angry and that just made it worse. I told my dad but he doesn't do anything about it. I'm mostly writing this to get it out of my system, I know it's not entirely her fault that I'm bad and shouldn't do what I do but sometimes I can't help it.

I never told anyone but my sister and my dad, my sister wants to do something about it, but she can leave whenever she gets bad because she's older. I know people go through way worse but I don't know what to do I try to avoid my mom most of the time. I think she might be bipolar, sometimes she's so nice to me and I like being around her it was just a few days ago we started a tv show together and now she won't get out of bed only to fight with me and my sister.

She’s the first and only person I felt I could be myself around. I don’t make friends easily, so she genuinely felt like my soul mate (in a platonic way) and it’s hard to let go. I never told her how I felt because I always just thought I was way to sensitive, but I’ve learned over the years that friends aren’t supposed to be like this, they aren’t supposed to make you sad. I finally told her back in November how I felt (through text— my first mistake) and basically just told her that she’s made me feel very alone and unappreciated (I only brought up recent things). I made sure to say like no hard feelings or anything I just wanted to finally get this out. She then texted me a very rude message essentially blaming me for her depression and it left me crying. Since then we haven’t mentioned it and have gotten back to normal like nothing happened, but I’m so bothered by it. I feel so hurt by the things she said to me still. I haven’t talked to her about it because we are never alone in person (her bf is always with her). Is this even worth saving? If so then how could I talk to her and not make her feel attacked?

They’ve changed more into me degrading myself and thinking awful things, that I don’t even want to type. There are times where I will pinch my ‘fat’ until there are marks. And unknowningly scratch myself until I bleed. Now I don’t want to kill myself, but I just don’t understand why I hate myself so much. I feel like I need to punish myself for being me.

A few months ago, I did break up with him and we had no contact for a few weeks. During that time, I actually tried to move on and was dating someone new. My exbf reached out to me while I was dating someone new. Eventually, I broke things off with the new guy and kind of “got back together” with my ex. The new guy was fun and all, but we didn’t share the depth of emotional connection/intimacy as my ex. So I felt unfulfilled and craved my ex more, which is what led me to end things with the new guy. 

My exbf made it clear he still loved me and wanted to get back together. He wants to move here to be with me permanently. He has made his intentions clear and that he doesn’t want anyone else. I felt guilty that He didn’t know I had been dating someone else during our break, so I told him. It crushed him, but he forgave me and still wanted to get back together. 

He made it clear that he wants us to be together. I told him I couldn’t commit yet. He told me he’s ok with taking it slow as long as we’re in “an exclusive grey zone.” 

Tbh I think I love how much he loves me, instead of really loving him for him. I think I love how committed my ex is to me and how he thinks I am “the one.” Yet I just can’t reciprocate that level of love and commitment.

401,"TL;DR: My brother used me for rent then abandoned me after I set my boundaries with him. I reached out to him and said that if he didn’t hate me, all he had to do was reply and change my mind. I never got a reply and now I want to come to terms with the fact that he truly does hate me.

Hi guys. I’m the essential worker from [this story.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/g3li1r/advice_regarding_a_sibling_who_wont_pay_his_rent/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

A lot has happened since my brother left. After ignoring me and a few other family members for a while, I got sick of it and told him that I was no longer paying his rent and he had no home to come back to. I said this to our landlord, and he told me that he couldn’t start moving my brother’s stuff out of the room until he had confirmation from my brother that he was leaving. I believe this was so the landlord could have proof that my brother left of his own accord.

At any rate, my landlord sent him some messages and received no reply either. Still, he had my word that my brother was gone, so he went up to my brother’s room to survey the situation. While up there, he found a box of what he called paraphernalia - basically, a box that implied my brother was doing drugs. Naturally, the landlord got upset, sent a picture of the box to my brother, and asked him for an explanation, otherwise he may have to call the drug squad.

Because of this, my brother finally messaged me and said he wasn’t coming home. He then went on to explain that he hadn’t been doing drugs and that our landlord was “making threats that [my brother] wouldn’t take easily”. He asked me loads of questions and basically treated me like I was the one who had threatened to rat him out. I made it clear to him that I personally couldn’t care less about whether or not he used drugs, but his concerns were with the landlord and he should be directing his questions to him, not me.

My brother said he’d report him for... something. I don’t know. He never said what it was for when I asked him. I told him that if his goal was to get the landlord arrested, then it wouldn’t just put me at risk of losing my home, it would do that for all my landlord’s other tenants, as well.

Still, my brother said he was serious about it. Then he had the gall to say “we shouldn’t fight”. I told him, paraphrased: “I’m still angry with you for what you did to me over these past few weeks. Don’t go preaching about how we shouldn’t fight when you haven’t even apologised to me yet.” That was shorter and more blunt than what I actually said, but that’s the gist of it.

Anyway, I said that all I wanted from him was a thank you for what I had done for him, and an apology for what he had done to me. He started talking about the issues he had. He said I could never understand the stuff that he was going through and that all my family and I had done were judge him. (Guess the rent and I can go fuck ourselves, then.) I said that having issues of your own doesn’t mean you can make things worse for everyone else. I told him about my suicide ideas and my attempts and how I fought through them because I cared about him and my family, and I didn’t want to push the pain onto them.

He said that what he did was wrong. He still didn’t apologise, or say thank you.

Instead, he told me he was done. He left because he was done with judgment and micromanagement or whatever.

We exchanged a few more words and then he said something rude to me and I blocked him. After that, my mom called me and we had a long talk about how he told her he loves me and he wants to make it up to me. With this in mind, I unblocked him a day later and sent him a message explaining what mom had told me, and that if he really felt those things, then now was the chance to say it - because as it was right then, it felt like he hated me and he wanted me dead. If I was wrong, then all he had to do was reply and say that I was.

He never replied.

I sent him one final message explaining our motivation for what he perceived to be “judgment”, and I explained why I continued making the sacrifices I made for him. I said I loved him and that would never change, but that I could only love him with as much room as he gave me, and that wasn’t a lot. I said if he ever wanted me back in his life, the door was open, but for now, goodbye, I’ll see you when I see you.

That’s all a very long way of saying I confronted my brother after he sent me a reply, and we had a falling out that confirmed he hates me.

In all honesty... I feel nothing. I don’t feel guilty for cutting ties with him. I know I did my best; it was him who failed to reciprocate. It does feel shitty to know that he truly does hate me, though. With that in mind, how do I come to terms with that? How do I let go of the fact that he may never contact me, and it’s because he wishes I was dead?",12May2020,1
402,"i’m a teenage girl and i was talking on the phone to my nana and i told her about how i had woken up with extreme thirst, i proceeded to tell her that this happens frequently. she told me that i might have diabetes, and at first i thought “of course i don’t have diabetes, other people have diabetes, but not me” and i just brushed it off. but then the following night i remembered that my grandpa has diabetes (type 2) and then i did some research and looked up symptoms, and i have pretty much all of them, and it even said that the age that symptoms usually start is 14, my age (15 in a couple weeks) and i really started to freak out. now you’re probably thinking, just go to the hospital to get tested, which is a valid question but my parents are getting divorced and i don’t want to put that stress on them. and my main fear is cost. like i said my parents are splitting up so money is tight right now, and i feel like if i just don’t tell my mom (i’m living with her, i seldom talk with my dad) then it will just go away, but i know it won’t. i just don’t want to cause others pain and i don’t want my parents to feel bad because they are already going through so much. i’ve never told anyone this. thanks for reading.",12May2020,1

407,"I live in a medium sized apartment building, and the walls are definitely on the thin side. Most of my neighbors are fine, though we all have vastly different schedules so we’ve mainly just chatted in passing. 

My problem lies with a couple that lives close to my unit. They’re constantly arguing with each other, screaming and cussing and banging things. This often happens in the middle of the night, between 1am - 4am. It’s loud enough to wake me up. They both definitely have anger issues, so it’s scary to even hear their fights. 

Prior to the pandemic, these fights happened maybe once every few months so I ignored it. I admit I’m a pretty anxious and non-confrontational person. I should’ve said something to them or my landlord sooner but honestly just hearing how vicious they get with each other made me very apprehensive about approaching them. They also seem to work night shifts so I’ve never come across them during the day. With the pandemic and shelter-in-place orders, their fights have become more frequent and frightening. 

Recently I’ve been preparing to approach my landlord about them. I have kept a list of dates and times of their loud fights and also have a few audio recordings (they’re so loud my phone has no problem recording the noise). 

Last night they had their worst fight yet. I was woken up past midnight by the sound of screaming and it sounded like they were trying to really hurt each other and they have a child, so I immediately called the cops. I don’t know how it was resolved, but one did leave to spend the night elsewhere. 

Should I still approach my landlord about them and/or say I had to call the police? A part of me feels like I did this out of order (i.e. should’ve tried talking to the neighbors or landlord earlier) but this fight kind of forced my hand. I’m also afraid they might retaliate, especially if they find out I called the cops on them AND complained to the landlord about them.",12May2020,1

Hello everyone, I would like some advice as it relates to potentially moving abroad.

I'm a 20 year old male living in the United States and I’m not entirely sure how to distinguish myself. Traditionally, when faced with this issue of actualizing one's potential the options are academia or a military career, for a wide number of reasons neither of these options appeal to me; neither are functioning as they ought to. 

Even though I just turned 20 and was the most recent hire at my current company, I’ve been promoted to supervisor and could quite easily have my managers position in little over a year. I understand that this is an excellent opportunity but I feel that to become an extraordinary character I need to be making extraordinary choices and working a lack-luster job doesn’t seem like the beginning of a story that I would be proud of. 

I am very much seeking what the Battle of  New Orleans was for Andrew Jackson; I want for something to occur, whatever it may be, and I take some form of action, and that is the moment where I begin my life. I’m not sure if something like this could happen here in the States, there aren’t enough difficult decisions to be made. I don’t necessarily desire comfort to any degree, I dream of having my own Greek hero's journey and suffering is invariably a part of this.

Is going abroad the move for me? And if so, where? Any and all advice is greatly appreciated, thank you.",12May2020,1

412,"Hello,

So in early march I preordered the Animal Crossing Limited Edition Switch from my local gaming store. I called them before hand to ask if it was possible to trade in my old switch for the new one. They said it was possible and told me to preorder the Animal Crossing Switch on their website and choose the option ""pick up in store"" so that's what I did. 

By the time the Swicth came out all non-essential stores were closed because of quarantine so I called them to ask them about the situation. They told me that they have my switch and when the stores open again they would call me so I could come and trade in my old one.

So the store opened up again last week and I got no call. Today I called them and asked about it and they told me they sold it to someone else and there is nothing they can do. The person told me they can try to ask the supplier if there's gonna be a restock but that can't be possible since the Animal Crosing Switch is limited edition.

I was planning to drive to the store tomorrow to ask them about it in person.

I know this is such a first world problem, especially during these times but i would still be grateful for any advice on what i could do.

Thank you",12May2020,1

I did see on the news that there is a possibility of a second wave of coronavirus happening in the fall or winter but there just isn’t any certainty on the situation.

414,"So I (18m) talked to a friend of mine and he told me about how he has a crush on the girl in our friend group. He told me that he asked her out a while back but she said she'd like to stay friends and not turn their relationship romantic because she didn't like him that way.
Anyway, he told me that since then his feelings for her grew more and more intense although they kept in contact as friends but without anything developing between them. those feelings made it so he couldn't concentrate on the things he was trying to do or even sleep because he kept thinking about her,
so when we talked he said he is recently really considering cutting the connection with her completely so he has nothing to remind him of her existence and he'll be able to keep going throughout his day. This solution of his doesn't feel right to me. The three of us (and a fourth guy) were great friends since kindergarten and not only he'll be ruining a great relationship with a great friend, he'll also be breaking our group dynamic so if we want to meet up as a group it's either with her or with him. I think one of them will be left out and/or we'll end up not meeting anymore.
My question is what can I suggest to him so he stops thinking about her all the time and has a healthy crush on her? And what do you think about his solution of cutting your connection with a person if you feel that way towards her/him?",12May2020,1
415,"
What happened to me last fall was I drove to my girlfriend’s place. My girlfriend’s area is literally one of the most dangerous neighborhoods of America, and I was just some 18 year old college kid at the time. I wasn’t stupid whenever I would visit the area, like always keeping my car doors locked, staying aware of my surroundings, not look like I’m scared to death to be driving in that neighborhood.

Usually, I stay in my car and wait till my girlfriend comes outside to open her front door for me, but one time her mom was waiting for me to get out of the car instead of waiting for my girlfriend to come outside to pick her up. I decided to start waiting  outside her front door whenever I would pick her up or visit her place, Just to be respectful if her mother wanted to meet me or not. I’ve done this a couple times since my girlfriend would only take like a minute to open the door and let me in. 

However, this time on a Sunday around 6pm, I was waiting outside for my girlfriend or anybody else in her house to open the door for me. This is at Chicago in the  fall so it gets dark around 5-6pm, but either way I thought nothing would bad happen, I mean it’s only 6pm, usually most deaths or tragic events happen late at night. so I thought nothing bad would come up. As I’m waiting  outside her door, I hear a group of people walking at a distance from my girlfriend’s street. once one of them in the group yells: “HEY! KEEP LOOKING AT THAT SIDEWALK!”, I turn and see that there’s around 6 guys and two girls with empty bottles with the main guy yelling at me holding something in his pocket. I was starting to get a little scared in my head which was the worst thing I could’ve done, because  I became frozen in fear looking down on the sidewalk.  As they kept going closer I could hear their footsteps getting faster and the one of the guys in the group saying: “Yeah we got em” and the group shouting at me but not too loud where neighbors could hear them. The buff dude with a red doorag kept yelling at me the same thing about looking at the sidewalk and to not move. I started to panic and I started to think about calling the police, but I knew it would be no good because the police can’t come in seconds, so I kept calling my girlfriend so she can open the door, she wouldn’t answer. I kept calling her at least 3 times and was always left on voicemail. right when that group got at least a 4-5 feet distance from me, my girlfriend opens the door all happy and I storm into her house to get inside and lock the door. I was so scared they were going to try to bang on her door at that instant, but they didn’t. They got all quiet, and walked past the house as if nothing happened. I was really scared even being inside the house after the group of 6-8 guys and 2 girls walked past the house. I needed 15 mins to calm myself down to even talk to my girlfriend about it. 

I don’t know if I was panicking and maybe just overreacting to what happened in that incident I believe you always get that gut feeling that something isn’t right and when someone or a group of people are being shady and have bad intentions towards you. Ever since this incident, I could never feel fully safe in my house, and I live in a very safe suburb. And everytime I see someone getting hurt really bad in real life, I start getting flashbacks to when that incident happened. 

Thankfully, I haven’t gotten any nightmares or flashbacks about the incident since February, but a lot of times I’m still super anxious about my safety and everytime I have the feeling of vulnerability physically, I get frozen in fear or start to panic a lot in my head. I never had gotten into any incidents like fighting or confrontations ever since, so I think that might be why I haven’t fully had a big panic attack. However, nowadays I would not want to sleep because I would worry if someone ever would try to break in to my house. 

Any advice on how to get over incidents like this  or am I just being a crybaby?",12May2020,1

418,"I'm a student in a math class, since we are doing it online lots of people are cheating on their tests. I'm in a discord server with a few friends who are in the class with me, it's not a server just made for math it's our personal server but we have a channel for math for when we study, and for them, when they cheat.

My friends cheated on every test so far, but i had no part in it whatsoever. I study with them in a voice call until the test is given out, and i join back after the hand in deadline passes to discuss what we got on the questions, and i go on with my day. They cheat on all their tests, and recently they got caught. one of my friends sent in another one of my friends' notes in for his hand in (cause we need to send our work), we are not allowed to communicate during the time, so it's a bad look for the both of the,

I haven't been in contact with them directly, i read the message sent in the server that said this information and i don't know what to do from here. 

there is no incriminating evidence on the server linking me to cheating, i never sent notes to them and i've been getting higher grades than them on every test. Normally this wouldn't worry me but the guy who made the mistake that caused this whole ordeal is a sensitive soul (bless his heart) his parents are very rough on him for getting bad grades, i'm scared he might say i've been cheating and drag my name into this mess, i know he wouldn't do that normally but in a flair of emotions he might say i was a part of it.

What can i do in this situation? i don't know if i should call anyone and ask about it cause im scared, i studied hard for my tests, i did not ever send messages during test time and i never joined the call.

421,"So we split up after things got very toxic during the second half of our 3 year long relationship. They split was about 3 years ago.

He originally left his gf before me to be with me. He was so sweet at the beginning and we had a really passionate relationship. He treated me super well and it was perfect.

We were both jealous, but I would get angry with my jealousy. He would just ask questions. I used to have anger issues and they started to come out at this point.

Halfway through the relationship, there was a moment in the car where he got cut off and laid on the horn. I told him to stop but he kept it up, so I slapped him. He was obviously upset and hurt by this.

After that, he started pulling away, but was still seeing me regularly etc. We ended up moving somewhere together for a summer, but he had to keep leaving and coming back for school stuff and I kept getting upset at him and just couldn’t control my anger. It caused him to really pull away more. Eventually he started flirting with other girls, hiding his phone, and other stuff like that (obviously he was doing something he shouldn’t have). When I found out about him giving his number to some girl one time, we got into an argument and I hit him again.

Some more time after that (not too long) he did something stupid (not cheating related, but it really really hurt that he did it without telling me and then handled it the way he did) and we got into a terrible fight and I hit him again and we broke up.

(I hit him a total of about 4 times, but they got more frequent)

While it was technically splitting up, we still basically being together like we were still in a relationship.

During this time, my friend saw him with some other girl holding hands. I tried reaching out to a guy I used to like but he didn’t seem interested. Another time someone saw him dancing with a girl in a club (he really never went to clubs, but this one time, this happened. Also, I don’t remember if it was while we were split up or after we got back together since it was such a blur. Might have been after getting back together). Stuff like that.

Eventually we officially got back together, but he was even more distant and was still being kinda secretive. My anger issues got worse and he would just try to leave when I would yell at him, but I would block the door or tell him it’s over if he leaves. Eventually, he actually left. A couple months later he called to meet up to apologize and end things on good terms. So we did and I missed him a ton when he left.

During that meet up, he said he was going to see our favorite band the next day (which hurt that it was without me). The day after that, he called me asking to meet up again. He said he was listening to them preform and that it felt wrong without me. I had already talked to my friends and decided we shouldn’t get back together. He tried to convince me, but I told him no and soon after that meet up moved to a different city.

Soon after, I texted him happy birthday and swiped on him on a dating app. He just thanked me for the birthday wish and didn’t match with me.

Fast forward 3 years to now, he apparently moved to the same city as me (it’s the one pretty much everyone from our area moves to for opportunity) and I get a notification that he followed me on Instagram.

Now I really don’t know what to do.

I saw the notification and my mind got all mixed up.

The relationship got so toxic, but I know I’ve changed since. My family and friends give a hard “no” for him. But maybe he’s changed too. And I’ve never felt like I did with him. I felt like he really was the one. I don’t know what to do.",12May2020,1

To which she responded with (ex's name) isn't thinking about dating anyone anytime soon, he's happy focusing on his career, and faith. This thing is I didn't ask if he would take me back, I just asked what his perspective was. I did mention wanting to get to know him again or someone else. Of course taking it slow but that I would need to find myself again first. I told my best friend that when my ex is ready to share his perspective I'm open to hear it.

437,"My wife  and I got furloughed in March, she has finally got her first unemployment check (no back pay yet) and I am showing ineligible. I know this is by mistake but it is almost impossible to get through on the phone line to the state’s unemployment office (Florida)  and I am unsure if I’ll ever get any benefits. That being said our apartment lease ends in a month and we’re unsure of what we should do. We currently live in Florida for the jobs we got furloughed from (hotel industry) but have no family or other ties as to why we’re here. The hotel has been closed since March and reported they do not know when they will reopen but that when they do we could have our jobs back. Since our lease is ending we are trying to decide if it makes more sense to stay in Florida and try to find an apartment that we could afford and that would rent to us while being unemployed. ( would be using wife’s unemployment payments and savings I built up initially to pay off some of our debt) or if we should move back home to Atlanta where we could stay with family rent free until we got back on our feet. 

Biggest concern with staying in Florida would be hotel taking forever to reopen and then taking longer to get busy enough to call us back to work. Florida’s unemployment doesn’t seem to be very reliable as well so there’s a chance we might blow through the savings for rent. Also if the economy gets worse vs. better in the next months I rather be closer to friends and family. 

Biggest concern with Atlanta is that we’re underestimating how long it will take to get re-employed and that we end up in worse jobs and/or we decided to fast and would have been better off waiting on unemployment and to return to our old jobs.

2 weeks back, my wife told me she was going to the park right across our house to get some free air, not a lot of people goes there so I let her go (even during the corona virus pandemic).After 10 mins or so I thought I'd go there too because i had been locked up in my home for too long.When i got there I saw my wife sitting on the ground (which is unusual because the park has a lot of benches) I asked her why she's on the ground and she told me she just felt like it.

I, however noticed the soil where she was sitting felt like it had been dug recently, after hanging out for sometime with her she decided to go back home and i decided to dig up the soil because I felt she was acting kinda weird (We've been married for 19 months and known each other for 3 year, so I could understand if she was acting unnatural). On digging up the soil I found corpse of a black cat, no blood on it, so I assumed she must've just buried the dead cat on seeing it.

On reaching home I asked her if she buried the cat and she denied, I asked her again why she was sitting on the ground right at that spot and she became furious because she thought I was accusing her  of killing the cat which I wasn't. It's been two weeks and we haven't spoken. 

I don't know if she's lying and i don't have a reason to believe she's, but something just feels off about the whole predicament. I've approached speaking to her again and again but she's still  angry that I accused her of animal cruelty.

once a very good friend of mine was like ""yeah it's just that gay people aren't natural. i mean god made a man and woman for eachother not a woman for a woman or a man for a man""

i can't help but think that maybe it's just how they were raised or their religion (despite being aetheist, i go to a catholic boarding school) so all i said was i strongly disagree because i didn't want to go against their beliefs.

453,"Our exams have been moved online.

  
I had a marketing exam (my favourite subject).  
I completed it (thought the questions were very open ended, I didn't know how much detail they wanted).

I submitted it close to 2 weeks ago, and I've just gotten an email from my lecturer stating I haven't submitted an exam.  
I tried to clarify and she said that's not my exam.

  
I completed the higher certificate (a lower level degree) exam, and not the one I was suppose to submit.

  
We use a system where you register yourself for your modules.

We had no lecturer at the start of the year, I went to look for the module to sign up for it (it wasn't an elective).

There are 2 modules under that name, I signed up for both.

  
I have only just realised that 1 is for the higher cert, and one if for the 4 year degree.

Both just happen to have the same name. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I somehow managed to click in and complete the wrong exam.  
They're very similar, the higher cert one is very open ended, but similar topic (BCG Matrix, Using industry examples etc.)  
But it was 1000 words per question, so I assumed they wanted us to just do the work.

  
I'm an idiot, I didn't realise until I was told.  


I'm trying to get them to allow me to complete and submit my exam before the final deadline (20th), but from talking to the exams office, I'll probably need to defer and complete my exam in August with those who failed and are repeating.

I'd pass, I like marketing, but I don't want this hanging over me and certainly not for as stupid of a reason.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do.. I'm just waiting for the final word from my department head.

  
I changed colleges at the start of the year, so their system is still new to me.  


So basically a mirage of small little stupid things lead up to this.

&amp;#x200B;

I was told 'no student has ever been allowed to submit a terminal exam after the outlined due date'.

But no other year has completed it online, they've always been in exam halls.  
We haven't had to shut down colleges and schools due to a pandemic in recent times.  
And I highly doubt any other idiot has managed to submit the wrong exam before now.

What the hell do I do?

Im in grade 11. During grades 8-10.5 i had severe tourrettes and had to miss a bunch of inclass schooling due to high amounts of stress and anxiety from my tics. I missed a LOT of school and did assignments in the rescource room or at home. Mid-grade 10 i was able to turn things around and become a full-time student not needing the help of support workers. My training wheels were taken off per say. Once i started going to classes regularly i was able to start mingling with students in a couple classes that i  had already talked too. I would be laughing and joking with them inside of the classroom. But, During breaks i would stand around with the inclass friends but wouldnt make much convo with them. During lunch it would be nearly impossible to locate those friends since my school is MASSIVE and would hang out at my older cousins house a five min walk away. I would always put on a smile and try and be “cool” and “fit-in” but sometimes it would be a bunch of horsesh*t tbh. Once school would end i would have little to no contact with them. Only one group chat for a class that requires a permanent 4 man group for the year. Do keep in mind that i live in another nearby municipality 10 mins away from my school. If anybodys from Vancouver. School is in south-Van and i live in Richmond near the River Rock Casino. But i still feel like i dont hang out with these friends outside if school. Now, outside of school, i have a dozen “bros” that were made by our parents being great friends. Weekend bbqs, bday parties, NFL sundays, etc. I love these guys to death. Every weekend theres a function that included at least a couple of them and we’d hang out and watch UFC fights or hockey games together. But, inside of school i feel a little lonely.

456,"Hello people of reddit! 


Now, I (26f) normally would just go to a doctor about this, but given current events I think this is a little too small/minor to go to a hospital or doctor for just yet. It’s not dire, it’s just annoying, and I’m just trying to get some outside opinions, because even though I have a bit of medical training pertaining to injuries like this, this is stumping me a little.


So, stupid me screwed up by wearing pajamas that were too long for me, and I ended up tripping. I fell forward and caught myself in kind of a bent-arm push-up position before fully hitting the ground, and I thought I was fine until I got up and noticed my right shoulder was hurting a little. NBD, right? I figured it was just a strained deltoid muscle or a strained pec (clavicular pectoralis major) muscle, and treated it as such. 


Here’s where things get weird: this doesn’t exactly feel like the pec muscle strains I’ve had in this spot in the past. The last time I strained my pec on this side, it hurt to move my arm in any direction or put weight on it. This injury doesn’t feel like that. I can move my arm to the front and to the back just fine, and straight up and down just fine too. I can even lift things, wash my long hair, or do a push-up using my knees without much pain. But moving it out to the side straight out or bent in a chicken-wing shape, bringing it from back to front, and pulling up my pants hurts like hell (I’d say a 5 or a 6, enough to make my eyes water a bit). It minorly hurts to shrug my shoulders, there’s only a little swelling over my entire shoulder, and no bruising (I’m very pale and bruise easily, so it would be easy to see). I’ve gently palpated all over the shoulder area, and the only real pain I felt was coming from that soft spot about an inch directly above my armpit. No pain while breathing, or while moving my neck, but my collarbone/shoulder area feels “funny” like I need to pop it like I would my knuckles (and yes, I checked to make sure it wasn’t dislocated, it’s definitely not), and it feels better to keep it in a sling.


There is a little bump on my collarbone close to my shoulder, but its only slightly tender when I gently touched it, and my WFR instructor said that broken collarbones HURT when touched at all. I’ve actually have broken my collarbone before on that side so that bump could be just the way it developed. It happened when I was born, and I haven’t had any problems with it since, but it makes me wonder if that break could contribute to a weak spot or something on my right side that would allow for a hairline fracture? 


I’m just giving it ice and rest for the last couple of days, and I intend to rest it for the next week or so and see how it feels. But what do y’all think? Could it be a fractured collarbone, or is it most likely a strained pec or deltoid muscle (or both muscles)?",12May2020,1

464,"Ok so around so the main people in this will be: 
bff- my best friend
hm - my boyfriends housemate
gf - housemates girlfriend

About 5 months ago my bffs boyfriend broke up with her for reasons that although probably relevant I don’t want to get into to keep things simple. Anyway as soon as she told me he broke up with her i said I’d come get her from their house so we could spend time together and I could try and cheer her up. So I drove to her and her boyfriends house and picked her up (she lives like an hour and a half from my bfs house). I picked her up and brought her to my bfs house which was where I was staying and we proceed to get drunk by ourselves (my boyfriend was on the night shift at work and hm and his gf were at the the pub). 

I am friends with hm but his gf and him had only been together for a couple of months and I’d only met her maybe 4 times at this point. I didn’t really know her and we’d only talked a couple of times. She was in the process of moving in with my boyfriend and hm at this time. Gf had just quit her job where she lived which was 3 hours away from my boyfriends house and got a job in the town he and hm live in (so some big commitments had been made). 

Anyway after a while hm comes home by himself really drunk so me and bff talk to him and we all continue drinking. My friend hasn’t really met him before only knows of him. Gf gets home a bit later and a few other people come over too. Gf goes to bed not long after getting home and we don’t really see her for the rest of the night.

The rest of us are out in the shed getting drunk and hanging out and very late in the night probably around 1-2am bff and hm go missing. Two of our friends who came over go out to look for them and come back saying that they’re having sex. So after that my friend and housemate cover it up and tell my boyfriend it didn’t happen. Then hm goes to tell gf their friends are saying shit and not to believe them because nothing happened. Anyway I end up comforting bff for the rest of the night because she feels awful. 

The next afternoon bffs boyfriend picks her up and they’re back together with her saying he can never find out and neither can anyone else and basically I’m sworn to secrecy. The two friends who caught them in the act promise hm they won’t say anything. I ask hm if he’s going to tell gf and he says he will but not right now because she’s just moved here and got a job here and has nowhere else to go if they did break up so it’s not a good time. 

Fast forward to now me and gf are really really good friends and I love her so much she is absolutely lovely! Anyway she’s had concerns that hm cheated on her and talked to me about it A few different times and I’ve had to talk to her about it and lie to her (don’t worry I feel absolutely awful about it). 

I really don’t know if I can keep lying to gf however I will be ruining 4 lives by telling hm he has to tell her. I guess I’m looking for any excuse not do this and to put it off. I don’t want to lose my best friend and I’ve talked to her about this and she’s begged me not to tell gf because bff wants to be with her boyfriend and it will ruin her relationship too. But I just feel so awful whenever I see gf because I know she trusts me and I know I’m a terrible friend for betraying her trust but I don’t want to ruin bffs life either. She lives with her bf and if they broke up she would have to move out and probably go back to her parents who live 2 hours away so she’d have to quit her 2 jobs. 

I’ve also talked to hm about how I don’t want to keep lying to gf either and he says that he will tell her when she’s in a better place mentally however I dont know if he will just continue to put it off forever. I also don’t think it’s fair to gf because I think she deserves to know. I dont know if I can ruin 4 lives and I dont know if i could tell gf if hm refuses to. I dont know if I could do that to her I know she loves him so much. 

So basically I’m stuck in the middle and bff and hm have apologised profusely for putting me in this situation but neither of them wants me to tell gf. Bff has FaceTimed me crying and begging me not too.  I also know that if I do make hm tell his gf all of our friends will probably hate me too and I also really don’t want his gf to hate me either but how could she not? I think I need to get him to tell her. But I dont know if I’m being selfish by ruining 2 relationships. 

I told bff I was planning to give hm a month to tell gf. She ended up telling her boyfriend what happened and he broke up with her. I feel absolutely awful I’ve just ruined my bffs life! 

Hm is very convincing and I really don’t want to make him tell gf but I still think she should know. I’ve caused so much drama and I just don’t know what to do.

So during this quarantine period of course all of us are at home social distancing etc (I hope!) and it meant that there is no uni. I study abroad and do all my friends from uni so everyone flew back to their home countries before the lockdowns occurred. It's been a month and a half since. 

Now I'm really bad at keeping contact with my friends. If they dont text me i wont text them type of thing which i know isnt good. But also my group of friends at uni, which consisted of 6 of us, were close but we werent close enough. This may be because we had only known each other for 7 months (freshman at uni) and we all also have other friends who we were closer to back at our respective homes. And you know how at first you dont want to be too much etc.

But sometimes i feel like im being too much and forcing it? like sometimes they will leave my snaps on open but then again its not those snaps that they HAVE to reply to you know. but i feel like im bothering them and then i see that two of them are getting one much better in the sense that they call each other every day and chat etc whereas i dont. 

it feels like theyre all better friends which is understandable but it feels like im not as close to them which makes me go into like a loop of they may not like me, why cant i be as close to them, how do i get closer. I want to be involved in their lives like everyone else but i dont know how to without making it forced. i want to be able to call them whenever im bored and chat and catch up like they do but i also suck at small talk and keeping convos alive. i dont know how to become better friends and how to not be ""jealous"" (although idk if thats the right word) of their other relationships

Sorry if its long i just dont know how to say it properly haha",12May2020,1
467,"I've gone to the same private school since 6th grade and overall its been pretty good. I usually had a stable friend group and I liked my teachers. The past 2 years I've struggled with depression and I've felt so stressed out that I started skipping school at least once a week.The pressure to get good grades is unbearable. My friend group kinda fell apart because one of my other friends switched schools and I didn't really get along with one of them. Most of my classmates are too focused on grades so they're no fun. My graduating class is \~40 and I've tried to branch out but there aren't any groups where I belong. While grades are important, I think school should be fun too. I want to experience highschool parties and be a little crazy but Im scared that I wont make any friends and that Ill have the same experience no matter where I go. 

This year made me realize how friendless I am because my exchange student friend left and I felt so alone. Im scared of change and leaving behind the good memories, but its just so hard to continue going there. Also I would be going from a private to a public school, so i dont know if thats important.

468,"cw this is about sexual stuff idk if this post is allowed but i don't have any other friends i can talk about this to (so sorry if it needs to be taken down!!)
did a google search on this and idk if i'm going to suffer horrible consequences soon or if i'm overreacting. i am over 18 and just had sex for the first time a few days ago and i'm like 99% sure my bf used lotion as lube which strikes me as unsafe and kinda yuck but he didn't mention anything about it and i just realized that's probably what he used now. plus i'm the worst and too embarrassed and shy to bring this stuff up w him 
also, he told me that having sex won't start to feel good for me until after the first five times. my friend thinks this is just a way to convince me (someone who is less than eager about sex) to have more sex w him. i have no idea whether this will be true. my first/only time was really painful and uncomfortable and awkward, kinda made a bloody lil mess on his sheets, and i was still hurting and spotting blood two days afterward. i want to be able to enjoy it but i don't wanna torture myself so many more times til it starts to become fun but if that's the only way thru i guess i'll have to. but do i really have to?
any advice would be so appreciated. this is the first guy i've done sexual stuff with and i'm totally new to all things nsfw. thank you in advance!!!",12May2020,1

470,"this post is going to be a bit weird, 

well, not if you're an understanding person

basically, i really need an advice on this

&amp;#x200B;

there's this girl; she's into me; 

whenever im around her (at campus) i can sense it; the way she acts, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

im mentally to a point where it literally works against me;

and, yea it sound weird

how could someone liking effect you in a bad way? but it does

&amp;#x200B;

now hear me up.

i can see the way she feels when she's around me; i can tell by her face; flattered, she feels like she's the baddest of all; i cant even explain it; she walks more confidently, like yas bitch type of face

and, the issue for me, is that i think that she only likes that i look at her, not my actual self

as i said, mentally im in a bad position; rn, besides family, i dont believe anyone loves or cares about me; no it doesn't depress me; it actually is like that tbh. i mean, i dont even talk to anyone, and unfortunately, for the most part it was my choice

anyways. i fucking hate it. it angers and triggers me

everytime she's around, it cringes me, i always feel like its all about her and not me.

its all about satisfying her ego, and she doesn't like me (physically; cause i mean we haven't even talked so doesnt about my personality)

i know that it might not be the case

but i cant help but feel that way

it makes me violent and angry

It came into my school in year 9 and also 12 years later i still thoroughly believe that it was just too little too late. Im here still having made no friends and a relationship i recently had has crashed and burned and i just have a lot of weird feelings in me.

Part of me feels like i can study a lot but ive noticed that the time i feel this way everyday has decreased to about 2 hours out of school which isnt enough. I just feel so lonely these days and i mean i dont hurt myself or anything but i just dont know how to proceed. I really wish i could organize things to look foward to but a lack of friends and quarantine restrictions has made this difficult. Everyday just feels the same and bullying and shit doesnt really help. Im a bisexual male but i dont really let it show so some people found out when said relationship with another guy broke down and my old group seems to feel weird about it because im no longer texted by any of them or invited to the group zoom calls or talked to at physical school (which came back this week for year 12s). i just dont know how to stay motivated honestly. 

IDK if this seems like a whiny post but i genuinly just want some advice because i just want to get year 12 out of the way as effectivly and painlessly as possible.

478,"Throwaway account. I'm 17, female, and I have a group of 5 friends who either don't value me at all or don't have any etiquette, though I don't think it's the latter.

Here's my situation: It's been a year since we all moved to different schools- one of them even moved to New Zealand. We are all introverts, except for one girl, who could literally befriend anybody.  We are all in different places, but we have been active on our groupchat, especially now, in quarantine. 

Back in school, three of them were already friends for a year, one of them the extrovert who I'll call X, the other two were NZ girl and the third my sort of crush(that's another story). They had a lot in common and shit, and when I and the two others eventually became friends with them (the other two can be O and L, who are definitely closer to me.), I got the feeling that we just didn't fit that well. But we pulled it through for two years, and we still keep in touch almost every day.

Here's the thing: we have good time, sure, but I've come to notice that everyone sort of always ignores me (like when I ask a question, etc.), and they have been doing so for the past three or so years. It's just that it took me that long to properly realise it. When I speak, they don't take much value in it. They meet up without me. Only O texts me first and we keep texting frequently, but the others? Nuh uh. They leave me on read. They keep in contact with everybody else, but not me. It might seem like I sound entitled to their attention, but we're supposed to be friends dammit.

 They put in approx Zero effort into our relationship. I really do care for them, and I help them out when they contact me (rarely) for things they need, and its hurting me a lot. Took me three whole years to realise I'm being used and not valued.

I call them out subtly, but it goes over their head, and I'm too anxious to break it off because I really don't have many other friends. What really pushed me to write this was a yesterday I sent a text out on the groupchat saying if we can do a discord call (we do it often nowadays) and maybe play a game, but not ONE of replied despite having read it. 

After waiting the night for an answer, I told them that a yes or no would do. X replies soon after saying she didn't read the texts, and there couldn't have been more bullshit in a sentence because the app told me all of them had read it. Do I really deserve such blatant rudeness? From people I care about? 

I then I ask her to respond to my question. She says, ""About discord?"" I say yeah what else my dude. Then SILENCE. Not another text. NZ girl says i can come, maybe. Nobody else replies. I'm like, okayy this happens every f-ing time. I'm going to ignore it this time too.

However, in the evening X has the nerve to send some video she sent to her bf, expecting an inflow of reactions maybe? I'm usually the one answering to bs like that, and she probably expected me to because I'm apparently such a fool, but I didn't. Nobody did either, because for whatever reason they have. Maybe I have wrong info and the rest are just as rude to each other. I want to leave this godforsaken group. It's stressing me out. 

tl;dr I have friends who ignore me (questions, texts, never contact me first) and I'm growing sick of it.

So reddit, help a girl out. I don't want to have no friends. I truly do enjoy their company, and we have a similar sense of humour, which is rare in my place. It's just that I'm the replaceable person, and I don't want to be that. What do I do?",12May2020,1

482,"For some background, I \[18F\] am having to make some life decisions. I was recently accepted into the most prestigious university in my country for the degree of my dreams - a double genetics/science bachelors degree - and being the only degree of its kind on this side of the globe, I decided to move there early this year.

For many reasons, it didn't quite work out. I didn't have much in the way of savings, was staying with members of a service club I was affiliated with for a nominal rent agreement and was desperately looking for a job. With the current world situation, I was informed by those I was staying with that I had to leave. I had nowhere to go other than to return home, so return I did. I couldn't continue my degrees from a distance so I had to defer until next year.

I've been back home for nearly three months now.

My boyfriend \[19M\] and I have been together on paper for four months now, but have had a five-year-long interest that hasn't waned at all on either side. We've both had tumultuous upbringings and each provide the stability to each other that we've never had alone. I'm certain to my core that our relationship can and will last given how we've grown together through the years.

He is currently midway through his double degree in our home state - where I am now. He has two years left to complete it, graduating in 2023.

From my move earlier this year, we've realised long-distance for any considerable time would likely spell the end of the relationship we have now.

And so I have to make a decision regarding the next few years.

I have several options, being;

1. Move back to university in ten months - virus permitting - and attempt long-distance. Ask him to move to me after he graduates and then both move back home after I graduate.
2. Remain here until 2023 when his degrees are completed, then move together so I can complete my degrees.
3. Remain here until 2022, commence my degree, and have him undertake his mandatory internship over where I am - likely meaning 4 months of long-distance, at minimum.
4. A variation of 2 or 3 where I undertake a bachelor of science here (currently guaranteed entry next year), reapply to the university, and (hopefully), transfer with my completed subjects being credited to reduce the length of my double degree interstate.

I apologise for the wall of text or if any of this doesn't make sense. I'm trying to be level headed about this, but I'm genuinely scared of the implications this may have for my future. For one, how do internship companies look upon people who graduate later than their peers?

Any insight, advice, opinions, similar experiences, or thoughts would be appreciated. I'm rather new to the big wide world, I guess I'm just looking for guidance.

Hope you're having a wonderful day.",12May2020,1
483,Here's the gist of it. My dad stopped working 5 years ago saying he wants to renovate the house. Until now he is still doing something to the house. That's not the problem. He regularly asks my mom for money and in large sums for who knows what. When she fails to give the money he brings her to the room and beats her. He always shouts and get angry at the most simplest things. Recently he also have started having fights with me. Although I can fight back. The problem is I have an usually high anxiety due to past incidents. Because of that I always end up in tears. I tried lessening my mom's burden by working as well but it never works. Any mistakes that happen in the house  he always pins it down to me and blames me. I really want to report to the police but my mom said she is afraid that he will do something to us if we reported.

484,"Let's start with this I'm a 23F, last year I came back from abroad with a couple of k's in my pocket, a broken relationship and some hope for the future. I got together with a good friend of mine and we were having a blast. Until the money ran out and I lost my job at butchery shop without having set aside enough savings. I have finance anxiety, usually I'm pretty good with money because of my poor backround. I do not wish to end up with so much struggle as my parents did. Personally, I don't spend much on food or clothes, I try to save up on bigger plans or things I might really need (mattress, drivers license, rent back up, dentist fees) Now my 24M BF comes from a very simillar situation, but he's just so bad with money it stresses me out. He earns little, but tries to side hustle which helps a lot. I totally respect that, but recently I lost my job because of the whole covid-19 pandemic. I told him it might take a few months for me to pull back up so I sold my beloved bass guitar and gave him my last cash for two months rent in advance. He spent it instantly on his hustles but paid it to the landlord luckily. But I've noticed he brings me to shops on his days off and will pick random hobby bs going way above our budget and will not even try to pay at the check out? This really confuses me. I got a couple hundreds from my father om my birthday, but I had to spend it all on dog treats, food, beer and random crap we really dont need. The problem is he wont even ask if I have the money on me. We went to a shop just for some toilet paper and I forgot my wallet in the car, he started picking everything and anything he wanted for snacks that evening, I realized he's not going to pay for that  fourth time either in one day. So I and asked him if he has any cash on him at all. He said no and then put half the stuff down. His own birthday is coming up and now I'm kinda bare and  little disappointed. I don't know what to do. He's sensitive and I might be bad at talking about my feelings and I just don't know how to bring this topic up without getting anyones feelings involved. I really cant afford him sometimes. He never pays for food or dog food, even when we split the rent, he pays for gas and treats once in a while but makes me go 50/50 on his random ideas like a blow up kiddie pool for 350. I love him a lot but I might turn grey haired if this keeps up. I don't see myself working as a cashier for the next ten years, I want a university degree and a place where I could make music, other things too, like a car and some freedom so I can remember what it means to want and actually get something. Once the walls open  up I'm planning on going abroad just to set my score right and so I can have some savings, my own license, car or a small deposit. He wont go with, because he got a dog which I paid for and now he has to stay with it because it's a big breed and no one in our families can provide the space or attention needed. This will last until it dies I assume or we find a good, affordable sitter for at least three months? I adore the dog but I'm just not willing to put my life on pause for another year. I was in a crappy relationship for four years where I had to put my exes needs in front of mine and I felt freaking awful, I never got to achieve or get anything for myself. My time, life and dreams are fleeting and I'm just looking at them from the sidelines. Honestly, I don't know what to do. This guy may be the one, he's honest and sweet, caring and absolutely my type, so much like me, but he's such an idiot sometimes too, just like me.

So the problem is about my brother, who's 13 right now (I'm 21), we've only met like one year ago (We grew up seperated) and we became good friends at least thats what i'd say. He's been calling me almost every day now for a couple of months because he needs my help with computer stuff. However oftentimes he can be pretty rude and ungrateful and I kinda feel like he's only talking to me because he needs my help. I told him how I feel about his behavior more than once and he said that it isn't true and that it isn't just about my help.

So the most recent event that got me thinking is the fact that his birthday is next week and he already told me he invited many people, he did however not even mention me being invited despite everything I did for him.

487,"Okay, here goes. This guy who lives in a house with us (it’s like a house where the person who owns it rents the rooms of the house to various tenants) has been losing his mind (literally). Every other night or so he starts drinking and probably starts doing drugs starts banging on all of the doors of the tenants (specifically ours and our neighbors). The neighbor to the left of us is family with my girlfriend who I reside with. The neighbor down the hall next to the kitchen has no relation, but she’s a good person with two kids. He herasses the neighbor down the hall allot because he thinks they snitched on him one night (doing the things he usually does). It’s a long story. That night, we all got together to try and calm him down, after he broke their door (neighbor down the hall). After that night it got worse. The landlord was notified and said “we‘ll give him another chance.” Nights go by with the same thing. Eventually, he got into and argument with my gf mom. He started banging on her door hard, calling her very mean things like “lame ass bitch” or “I’m gonna call my friends to kick your ass.” He usually threatens these things. It’s gotten harder cuz sometimes we’re hungry or in need of the restroom and he patrols the halls saying things like “whoever comes out here I’m gonna fuck them up.” Later that day (this persisted from 12am to 6am) the landlord showed up and gave him a warning. He talked to all three parties (my gf, her mom, and the a**hole). After a heated debate, he said that the solution was to install cameras. Fortunately, this helped... but, it didn’t take long. He started up again, tonight. Basically what happed was, he got into an argument with the tenants downstairs (we live upstairs, they’re like separate units, you know with different addresses n stuff) and broke their window. The cops came, and he hid. They didn’t find him. He comes back into the house, breaking stuff, banging on the doors saying he’s gonna kill everyone. At one point, I thought I heard him drop bullets, and what made me buy into that notion was what he said after I heard the metal clinging, “ here’s what’s going to happen, I’m going to blow off your heads.” My gf called the cops. This was the first time anyone of us ever called the cops out of one of these violent episodes. They showed up but couldn’t get in. My gf called her friend to pick us up because we weren’t gonna stay the night. Prior to this, her friend rolled up and the a**hole was outside. He hit his car with a crowbar. Trying to get my gf friend to come out saying “I just wanna talk.” When the cops arrived, again, we’d figure now was a good time to leave. We were trying to be as quite as a mouse. We get our valuable and we attempt to leave. The problem with this was that he lives like 3 ft away from us, (he locked himself in the room and the main door so police had no way to get in.) we tipi toed out until we hear his door open and ran out. Shortly after we left, and I was in a conversation with the officer he surrendered. 
My question is this. What next? Will he just get a slap on the wrist? He’s on parole! I want him to go to jail or get evicted cuz it’s gettin hard, very intolerable, and he’s crazy! He saw me talking to the officer. What if I’m a target now?",12May2020,1

495,"I’ve got this friend, probably the only true friend I have at the minute, that I’m kind of concerned about.

I was texting him and he told me that him and his “best friend” (R) were together then broke up shortly after, R admitting that she only got with him because he was just there. Even shortly into their relationship, she threatened to break up with him over some stupid reason. 

I wish I could tell him (L) that R isn’t good for him at all, that she’s been toxic, manipulative and dismissal of him in the past, and still now apparently. But I don’t wanna come across as dictating or controlling, because that’s not my intention, I just wanna prevent him as best as I can from getting hurt by her again. But I’m afraid of seeming too obsessive or overly caring if I tell him my concerns.

Or should I just stay out of it? As I said, he’s my friend, and I don’t want to see him hurt over this person again. But after all, it’s none of my business, I guess...

501,"[WARNING: sexual assault situation described]

How can I help begin healthy coping mechanisms?!

Hi, 
This is my first post ever anywhere on Reddit but I’m reaching out for help. My partner was at a small party and lost her memory. The next morning she had to be told what had occurred that night. She had too much to drink, was concussed from falling off a balcony and synergized this all with adderall and xanax.

Throughout the night a stranger asked her friends for approval they denied him. He also then tried to kiss her and she denied him. He is also a marine.

The bystanders saw her and him enter a hallway together to then come back and enter a room where her friend was with her respective partner. The person who she was denying all night then took her pants off. They left and my girlfriend stayed there with her female friend continuing. She woke up the next morning on the couch to then rush home and showered for a long time.

Her friends said it seemed mutual from afar. But was strange that the person she was denying entered the room. She has told me there was not consistent but,

They said when the girls left the room they were laughing and smiling and they seemed to be happy. 

But she does not remember anything! She actually has asked me to research to build the story of what actually happened.

To add more detail, after event happened she immediately called me. every ten minutes for two hours to which I did not respond and she left no voice mail. But texted me come pick her up. Which I didn’t. She woke up on the couch and drove her friends car home. She came over crying and up set. 

I want to comfort her now, we’re okay touching a little bit. but she is upset and I am doing my best to offer her favorite things and allowing her to direct the conversation. But. . I notice I have waves of making this about me and how I am confused and upset about everything and not sure the direction of the relationship because she had said in the past how she had maybe desired another sexual partner which we were exploring having on going conversations. But she is really upset about this whole situation and didn’t want it to happen. Even to the extent of wanting to be hospitalized because of the psychological trauma of sexual assault

I really need some advice. Please 

How do I help her?

Will we be the same after?

Is she lying about not consenting? 

Is a rape kit after 48hr and multiple showers and bathroom visits worth it?

Should we call the police?

What will happen if we do?

How can I help begin healthy coping mechanisms! 

Will we go to court?

Is a concussion an important element to the assault?

Please we tried calling a victims hot line and the hospital but they all said file a report with the police or never picked up the phone. 

Any advice appreciated. 

May this find you in good health and happiness.",12May2020,1

I explained this to my friend and she doesn’t believe that he was abusive to the girl. This boy has now moved in with my friend after two weeks of speaking and they’re together all the time. I recently found out that his other ex girlfriend said he was abusive to her too so this obviously rings alarm bells. He has a massive coke problem but has told my friend that he’s given it up, even though I know he bought some last week... he also claims that his recent ex (who he broke up with two weeks before getting with my friend) has caused him to fail DBS checks due to her reporting him for domestic abuse but the police didn’t believe her. I explained to my friend that a DBS check wouldn’t fail just for an interview so I think he’s lying.

512,"I (22F) am a college student. Around my second year here at my University, I became acquainted with a dude named Jake, who lived in the same dorm building as me. Jake has always just sort of struck me as being a very awkward person to be around, for various reasons. The best, most simple way that I can describe my overall feelings about him is that, for whatever reasons, we just don't vibe well, if that makes sense. He's just not my type of company, and just about every interaction we have is extremely awkward and very forced as well. Everyone I know feels the same way. 

For one thing, he's a bit older than me and my friend group by I think 7 or 8 years. I'm pretty sure he just turned 30, while we're all still in our early 20s. He joined the army after high-school, so he's a little bit older than your typical dorm-life college student. That's not really an issue in-and-of itself (It's not a **massive** age gap), but it does lend a certain heightened weird-factor to some stuff he does. For example, a year ago, me and my friend (now roommate) both decided campus life was too expensive and decided to get an apartment together. Not long after, Jake took both of us aside separately to tell us ""how salty he was that neither of us had included him in our apartment plan'. That was extremely uncomfortable for me given the facts that A.) My roommate and I are both women, B.) We're around the same age, C.) He never even asked us or mentioned anything about getting an apartment, and D.) I (even still now, but more then) barely knew Jake at all. It seemed vaguely creepy that that this was apparently his expectation.

It's important to note that he's never really left the ""Aquaintance"" zone of my social sphere. The fact of the matter is that despite over 3 years of interactions, I barely know the dude, and most of our conversations have simply been exchanging small talk and pleasantries when we've passed by each other in the dorms. Starting out, I never made any explicit attempt to exclude him from a deeper friendship (that goes for my whole friend-group as well), but like I said, we just don't vibe well, and he's made similarly weird, sexist, gatekeepy, dickish, uncomfortable, or tone-deaf comments that have kinda just made everyone very socially-distant around him, and they try to keep their interactions with him as formal as possible. Everyone else kinda just ignores his messages and stuff now because he weirds them out.

I've tried being a little more understanding and polite, because I honestly just feel bad for him. I can tell he's a really lonely dude who doesn't have many friends and is desperate to connect with someone. I've hung out with him on several occasions, but it's not only awkward (as he doesn't really engage with or contribute much to any kind of conversation), but he also says some uncomfortable stuff, and has a very demanding, petulant, and entitled attitude about a lot of things.

When the Pandemic really got going, and our school closed the dorms down, he moved into our apartment complex in a unit close to my roommate's and I (that a whole other story!), but ever since, because of proximity, we've become the go-to people he wants to hang out with, and it's gotten difficult to deal with. We've had to set more clear boundaries with him (which he either mocks or tries to argue with). Other times, he just flat out seems to ignore our clear signals. Last week, we were both working on Final stuff, and he came and stood in our doorway for over 20 minutes trying to have a mundane conversation with us despite the fact that we were both clearly busy with important school-work. I even said stuff like, ""haha that's cool, but I gotta focus on this essay so I'll talk to you later"" several times, and he **still wouldn't go**. My Roomie was in a Zoom meeting, and he got her attention so she'd take off her headphones, just to say something completely unimportant. It was infuriating, and she messaged him later asking him to please not come over unless we invite him.

The semester's over now, and I kinda just want a couple weeks to destress and have some introvert alone time, and he's texted me a few times about hanging out. Once when he invited himself over, I emphasized that I really just needed alone time that night, and he incessantly mocked me for it, and stayed for a couple hours anyway, so I've taken to just ignoring the texts, even though I know how shitty that is. 

I don't want to flat out tell Jake that he should just leave me alone altogether, but I also think he's just looking for friends in the wrong places, and that he would probably benefit from finding people closer to his own age and personality to hang out with, because I can't be the friend he wants. I'm wondering if there's any way to tell him gently and kindly (I'm kind of worried about his possible reaction either way), but also in no uncertain terms, that I don't really like hanging out with him because he makes me uncomfortable...

longish story. 

i need someone to tell me if i’m overreacting or what i should do to deal with the situation.


hi, i don’t post much on reddit but i don’t want to ask my friends for help because they may look at me and my family different and it’ll make things super weird.

i’m 15, and my mum and stepdad met in 2013 and got married in 2017. until 2013, i never had a father figure in my life so when my stepdad met my mum, i was 100% on board. i showed him heaps of affection, loved him, and made him feel apart of the family.

my sister is 17 this year, and i have 3 older brothers who are between 20-24. my brothers are all troubled, ones in jail, another is a drug addict and the other is an alcoholic who’s threatened to end his life on multiple occasions.

over the last couple years, i’ve started to resent my stepdad because as i got older, i realised how toxic he is, and how much he disrespects not only my mum but my siblings. 

my mum dealt with my brothers and i, all by herself until she met my stepdad. at first he helped out a lot with all of my brothers. then he became incredibly hateful to my oldest brother, let’s call him G. G is the drug addict, and he’s been struggling with it for a while, he’s unemployed and stays home and smokes meth everyday. obviously i have a lot of love for G, so it makes me so angry when i see my stepdad yell at him to get out (whenever he visits), take my mums phone and hang up on him when he calls, and grab him forcefully and shove him out of the house. when he did this once i started bursting out crying, and he told me to stop sympathising for him because he’s a pathetic loser who’s nothing but a burden. i’m angry that i even had to write that. i can tell this upsets my mum too. she’s spoken to me about it once a few months ago. 

my stepdad hates admitting when he’s wrong, and if we call him out on it, he will scream at us and tell us we are being ignorant and to shut up. i’ve been sharing a room with my sister ever since we moved into his house. his house btw, is absolutely disgusting. the bathroom has mould everywhere, boxes of unused items, spider webs, dirty floorboards and carpet, etc. we aren’t even allowed to clean up because to clean, we need to declutter, and if we did that, he would be so angry. before we moved in, he promised he would clear clutter, and get rid of everything he doesn’t need (he’s a proper hoarder). we’ve lived with him for 3 years and nothing has changed. i asked if i could move upstairs because my sister smokes weed and i hate the smell of it in our room (it gives me headaches) i asked if i could clear some of the stuff upstairs, maybe i could put my bed up there, and he told me i was being an ungrateful brat and to let him do it himself on his own time. he’s been saying that for almost 2 years now. i’m honestly sick of how he never lives up to his promises. 

he does a million other things that make me angry but one of the main things is that he sexualises me a lot and it makes me incredibly uncomfortable. i had an experience when i was around 13, when a man groped me on the train when i was going home from school, and it always is kinda lingering in the back of my mind whenever a man approaches me. my stepdad knows about this but still continues to make remarks like “i’ll slap you on your ass if you do that”, “you should be wearing a push up bra”, “your dress is so short i wouldn’t be surprised if a guy did this” and so on so on. he doesn’t say those specific things everyday, but he has said those things to me on occasion before, and makes similar comments almost daily. they make me feel so awkward. my mum doesn’t say or do anything about it. my mum is annoyed at him too for not clearing the house, but she’s never spoken to me about the comments he makes about me. 

the reason i’m writing about this now is because 40 or so minutes ago, i was in the bathroom with my mum because we were doing facemasks. we were laughing a lot and were being kinda loud. my stepdad marches in and says “what’s all this noise” and my mum just kinda went silent. i told him “we’re laughing?” and he said “i thought you were in the shower together”. is that really fucked up? or idk? 

i don’t know how dads act towards their daughters but i have a huge feeling it’s not supposed to be like this. i don’t even speak to him anymore, and when we do i never make eye contact because i hate his face.  i avoid being in the same room as him, and since this virus started, it’s been killing me cause i can’t get away from him. 

i feel uncomfortable in the place i’m supposed to feel safe and at peace.

517,"I am looking for some other thoughts and perspectives to help inform my own. My fiancée (31M) and I (29F) inherited a sum of money from a relative earlier this year. We are homeowners with over £100k invested in our mortgage and we both work full time jobs in the public sector. We had handed in our notices at the start of March and were planning on taking a year out to try and get some experience working in the film industry. We have written one feature length film together and have various other projects we want to work on as a pair. We were hoping to write and shoot some stuff together while seeking low level volunteer and work opportunities in the industry to meet people and network a bit, and also get some experience. 

Obviously, the pandemic has put everything on hold. Our employers were grateful that we could keep working remotely from home so we postponed our leaving date indefinitely to wait it all out. It’s getting to the point where we feel tired and frustrated and just want to get going with life. I completely appreciate that is how everyone is feeling right now. But we are considering jacking it all in soon anyway as we just can’t bare it much longer. The jobs we work are stressful with workloads that are beyond unmanageable. My fiancée keeps saying, if we catch corona and die, is this how we really want to go? I completely agree with him but I feel anxious to walk away from a pay check when the future seems so uncertain right now. I hate my job and I know I’m not as good at it as I used to be, in part because working from home is just really difficult anyway, but also because I have already kinda quit in my head. So my heart’s not in it any more.

I just don’t know what to do. It’s a risk to walk away now but then, it was always going to be a risk whenever we chose to do it. My fear is we will be wasting this once-in-a-lifetime sum of money - it will be squandered on bills and living costs - and we won’t be able to progress as there’s just no way of knowing when the film industry is going to pick back up again. Do we risk it anyway, and use the time we will have on our hands to invest in our creativity? And hope that things will be a bit more stable in a year’s time?

Or do we wait? I have noticed a considerable decline in my own mental health since the lockdown was announced, in part because of the nature of being “locked down” but also in part because I was ready for the next phase of my life to begin and now I have no idea when I will be able to start living again. Right now this feels like existing, not living. I know my fiancée feels similarly.

What would you do? We have been working away at jobs we are not invested in for the best part of 7 years, trying to fit in bouts of creativity here and there, but it’s not enough. I feel impatient. I want the next bit. I want to have some fun. But I worry we are jumping the gun.

I am so grateful for some other perspectives, if anyone has anything to share. I am very aware my situation is very different to a lot of other people’s right now and I hesitate to even post this as I know I am very fortunate to be in this position. Thank you so much for reading my ramble and I’m grateful if anyone has any thoughts to contribute.",12May2020,1
518,"Hi all, new to Reddit but heard it's a good platform for questions like this. **Apologies for the length but I think context was NB here.**

I used to work at a call center at 24 with 19-26 y/o's. I was generally liked, very friendly, got along very well with everyone. I am very PC in my speech/beliefs, and all of my colleagues knew this. If I caught the odd friend making dumb sexist jokes, I'd poke back at them (in good fun, never attacking them, I know that's not how you stick up for yourself.) I'm a white woman, not by my standards but ""attractive"" (got asked out by pretty much every male co-worker.)

Well about a year into my job, a good colleague let me know some girls (who had slept at my house, thought we were tight) had been calling me **""fake"", ""lowkey racist"" and ""two-faced""**.  One even spread a rumour I called a girl a ""dumb b\*tch"" when I was calling *myself* that lol. I went to the bathroom and cried then called my manager and said I had to go home. He had no issues as I was the employee with the highest target rates so he knew I wasn't just being lazy. 

My mother told me to simply just talk to them, so I did. I gently asked the girl in question to grab a tea and asked why she was calling me this. Turns out, one time months before that, I was at lunch talking about my boyfriend with some ""friends"", told them the night before, he was telling me people at school once called him a ""sand n\*gger"" (he was Indian) and he laughed. I told him this was awful but he said he and his friends kinda reclaimed the word. He egged me on to say it in front of him and eventually I did, when I told my friends this I whispered it really low and immediately regretted it. They just laughed but I thought it was no big deal at the time despite feeling weird saying it. It was extremely out of character, like my mouth farted and my brain didn't catch up.

So turns out for months my ""friends"" (who I honestly was always sketchy of, they always gossiped about eachother, fat-shamed people etc) were dragging my name through the dirt in group chats but nice to me in person. I did apologize for saying this word (to white colleague.)**Thing is -**

**Almost a year after leaving this job due to mean girls (one mean dude) and I still feel guilty for ever ever letting that word come out of my mouth.** It feels like no matter how unjustified some of the nastiness they inflicted on me, I can't help but feel I am a terrible person who deserved it, so I can't move on. Especially when I see all of these big social media folk having their lives torn apart and how many people hate them. I feel I deserve the same.

519,"for some backstory, i've been struggling with myself and my body for years now. i can't seem to control my movement, if i don't move after a while i feel something crawling on my hands. i cant sit in place without thinking about anything otherwise i start getting an indescribable feeling of anxiousness. 

i deal with this problem by pacing around my room whenever i get the urge to move. if i have to sit down and do homework or attend class, i usually tap my fingers, play with my pens and pencils, or play with my coal eraser.

i honestly dont see a problem with it, but my mum is livid and my dad is always either making fun or me or yelling at me. it makes me want to cry and i feel horrible, but i cant stop pacing or moving. it's sort of compulsive.

my dad told me to get ready as he was going to ""have a chat"" with me about the whole thing yesterday, and both yesterday and today i find myself getting nervous whenever he talks to me about anything. even when he asks me to bring him a toothpick i cant stop my palms from sweating. 

how do i prepare myself for when this ""talk"" happens? and in the meantime, how do i stop myself from getting so nervous that i want to cry whenever my parents walk into my room or talk to me?

(it is worth mentioning that my mother uses both of the closets in my room as she ""cant use the ones in hers"", so she barges into my room pretty often. i've tried talking to her about my privacy but she always asks me if i have anything to hide from her, which again makes me extremely nervous and i want to end the conversation immediately. my dad also barges into my room without even knocking, and then proceeds to lean against the doorframe and tap his fingers on it, which also makes me extremely nervous.)",12May2020,1

524,"Hello everyone! I hope you’re staying safe during these times...

My question is basic and I was just wondering if someone could please shine some light on this, or show me a new perspective.

My mind is something like this... ‘where does self confidence come from? Well nothing that’s a product of this world can since our consciousness and life is temporary... but then what can I base my self confidence on? Because it is causing me to really doubt myself and feel insecure at times and many other things...’

And on and on, and I can’t seem to find an answer to anything or anything to settle on. Infinite regress?

Any advice at all on this would be much appreciated :) let’s please use this post to discuss it as I doubt that one answer is going to satisfy my mind.

Even before this situation occurred, he asked me to stay the night with him but mostly because of my parents, I declined it.
I recently talked with my father about my relationship (he already knew something because of my mother, she told him a few things) and he seemed quite okay with it but he (me too) is a little bit old school and, perhaps, worries about me (I suffered a lot in the previous relationship). It's wrong to want to spend the night with the person you care about? Do you thing I'm rushing it?

531,"So,

I was in a five year relationship and that was... Yeah. It wasn't a great relationship but wasn't as awful as some have had it so that's that really. 

After that I was kinda lost on what I wanted and when guys showed me too much affection or attention I self sabotaged because it kinda completely freaked me out. Then I met someone and he was cool and we got into a relationship - it was really bad timing for me because there was a tonne of drama in life and my mental health was shit. He ends up breaking up with me in lockdown which sucked because I actually dug him but now since him any guy again that shows me too much attention or affection I freak out and just back away.   


Despite this I do genuinely want a relationship and want something real and something that could develop into something serious - I've been working on my mental health since that last relationship but I still get freaked out when someone shows me too much attention.

So I didn't really do any of the work set, and past me didn't think it was a big issue.

It hurts to think he does not want to be intimate with me, but will literally pay money to see and talk to other women. He claims it was just spam, that he had a subscription years ago and still gets emails. Okay, fine.

Last night, about four more emails of ""subscription successful"" to multiple different women from the same site appeared. I knew then he had lied to me. I asked him if he had told me the truth when we had spoke before, only for him to say ""about what?"" Once I explained what I had seen, he admitted to lying to me because he ""didn't want me be mad.""

Since then we have lost pretty much all trust and are slowly trying to build it back up but we grounded her &amp; took away all her devices except her laptop because she needs it for online middle school &amp; thought we blocked everything she can talk to people with but she is STILL trying to be sneaky. She still finds a way to get on her things without having any devices besides her laptop.

539," **TL;DR: Continue with an exhausting, slow-killing NGO job to increase chances at grad school and not lose face with everyone, or pursue a new career path to help build my soft skills?**

Hello everyone, I need advice. This is quite long but I hope you can hear me out.

I have been restless for months now at my Environmental Conservation NGO job. This is my first job out of university (my degree is in Geography), and when I landed this job, I was really over the moon because I have always dreamed of working for a conservation NGO. I dreamed of it ever since I was 15 (I'm 22 now and graduated when I was 20). In college I did a lot of volunteer environmental work, because I wanted my volunteer work to reflect the passion for working for an NGO. I even argued and cried in front of my parents when they did not agree with me taking this job. Because my job pays low, and it required me to move away to a rural area far from everyone I know. Everyone in my circle knows me as this girl who pursued her mission of conservation.

But I don't know, things are different now. It's like the rose-colored glasses have been taken off. In my NGO, I started off (September 2018) as their mapping person because of my Geography background. And so in the first three months, I did a lot of mapping tasks. And they were very pleased with my outputs, that in my 4th month (January 2019), I was promoted to the role of Project Coordinator, which is basically leading this whole conservation project, just under the supervision of my boss. But overall in the NGO, they still ask me to do all the mapping tasks, and so my load just got a whole lot heavier. I want the role, because it's such a great learning experience. But somewhere along the way, I got burned out from all the things I do, and as much as I want to, I have no passion for what I do now.

In fact, sometimes, okay, most of the times, I hate my job. At first I started to hate all the workload. And then little by little, I started nitpicking at all the things, like the low pay that's not making me able to save up anything for the future. While in the beginning, field works used to excite me, I have gone to field works very frequently now that I hate it. Every week I'm traveling to the communities, every week I have to pack and unpack and pack again for the next field work. It's very exhausting and I hate how it's not making me able to do anything for myself, like go to the gym regularly. Or learn courses online.

I also hate how I don't even feel like I'm working for animals, which was my original motivation for working in the NGO. Now, I work a lot for people, I do a lot of community development work. And I'm not really good at it. This job made me realize how bad I am with people. Although, at times, I'm not sure if it's me or if it's just the burn out. Because when I first started, I had a lot of hope and lots of excitement for being able to empower communities. But now, it's like, I have also lost hope for communities because I work with 13 different communities in my project and some of them are really just flaky and are enablers of illegal logging and it's frustrating me and has made me lose all hope. It's like, I don't even like people I just do this for the animals and the trees but I don't even feel like I'm targeting the things I want to target in my work. It's like, I don't even feel satisfied with the work I do, so I might as well work somewhere else where I earn more and have a great work-life balance.

Finally, I think the last straw was how I realized that I don't even have any strong connection with any of my workmates. When I entered this NGO, I entered with another guy my age. And so he was the closest to a good friend that I have in this NGO. But he quit because he started pursuing law school (and partly because he also thinks our NGO is not employee-friendly). The girl closest to my age now already has a kid, and so it's also very hard to connect to her. The others are already 30+ yr old people, and they have their own 30's clique. I really have no one I can confide with in my organization. Which is hard because I am very far away from all my friends and family, and I don't even have time to have a social life outside work because it's taking up too much time. And because I work in a rural province, there's little to no social groups that I can join in, it's limited to churches or maybe basketball league. We don't have friday night outs at work or whatever social activity because everyone's always on field or just too tired.

All signs point to me quitting. What's just holding me back is my dream to pursue a graduate degree abroad through a scholarship. And to get into competitive scholarships, you have to demonstrate significant work experience. And in terms of experience, this job is the best bet. Because while everyone is working corporate jobs, I'm working for a non-profit and leading a conservation project.

But I really just want to quit. And I want something entirely new. To refresh me. To offer new perspectives. I don't want anything related to the environment, or to Geography. I want to try for a job that's communication-related? And corporate. Like Marketing for example. Or maybe work for companies that are focused on organizational development. Something like that. So I can improve upon my soft-skills, but at the same time, possibly influence future work mates to be more environmental-conscious? All while living close to my friends and family, and having a decent work-life balance. I just want to have a new environment, a fresh perspective. Because living here and dedicating all my hours to this one organization with zero work-life balance is eating me alive. And even if I want to have extra-curriculars, there's nothing here.

So please, help me. I still dream of working in conservation someday, but now I'm kinda thinking that maybe I need to build my skills first. My communication skills and leadership skills in particular. And I want to feel like I have impact too. But being surrounded by seasoned conservationists is making me feel like what I do is nothing. Because I'm bad at my job. Maybe I can't impact at a community level at this stage in my life. Maybe I can only impact people who I'm closer to on a personal level. After all I'm just 22 years old and everyone around me is much older and more experienced. I feel like my opinion doesn't really matter to them because I'm young and inexperienced. The only thing that's really stopping me is how this might impact my chances at pursuing graduate school scholarships. Although, everyone at work also knows that I'm not really good with communication and skills with the community. This came out in my evaluations. So yes, I'm doomed just as well because I don't have the best impression with my bosses. We're really just short on people right now and we have a lot of work so they won't really easily let go of me.

So what do I do? Stay here to increase my chances at a scholarship? Or change my career completely and see where a new path leads me?

541,"My brother (M16) has been joking about getting a sugar daddy but I (F24) didn't take it seriously until recently when he forgot to log out of Instagram on my phone. For context, we are in Vietnam, where white foreigners are treated like gold. My brother goes to an international school so he is fluent in English, i.e there is no misunderstanding/miscommunication in talking with foreigners.

He began talking to a guy over 30s, who is currently a language teacher in a secondary school in the city. Their conversations would not have raised any red flag but the guy started talking about how age wouldn't be any problem, etc. I was extremely concerned as they even went on a coffee ""date"" today, and my brother lied to both me and my mother about it. Just now he texted his friends that this is the happiest he has been in a while, ever since he cut himself last few weeks.

The current dilemma I have are:

* I cannot let my brother know I have read his messages since my mother used to do that and it created a rift in their relationship.
* My family cannot know because they work in certain positions that if this kind of thing got let out, it will *destroy* not only their careers but also their lives. My mother will actually have another stroke. Again, we're in a country where the saving face culture is prevalent.

Apparently all his friends have no qualms about this pedophiliac relationship and there has been no sexual contact yet (that I know of). I have the guy's personal mobile number and email (they were on his Insta) and screenshots of their conversations - what do you suggest I do to get this guy out of my brother's life?",12May2020,1
542,"This is a dramatic rollercoaster - Sorry it's so long

I have a friend group of 3. There's me (F30), my friend T(M30) &amp; my other friend S (F30).
We have been really close best friends for 15+ years.
S has a super sweet, loving personality, just to give you context for the following - 

For the last year or so, since a breakup, T's behaviour has been quite irresponsible and unpredictable. We have been a bit worried for him, really been there for him emotionally &amp; I hold a lot of fun nights for them at my house, just us 3 to unwind &amp; relax &amp; talk.

T used to phone me about 3/4 times a day (I'm not much of a ""phone"" person, but I did always answer &amp; chat anyway) A few months ago, T stopped phoning almost completely. Then finally revealed it was because he felt He no longer had much in common with us two, because he was single &amp; we both had a partner. I found this strange as S &amp; I never invite our partners to our nights together, we don't bring them up in convo too much etc. We're all adults &amp; have been friends for years &amp; always find common ground &amp; have lots to talk about. 

The phonecalls still pretty much ceased, but when we met up things were great. His behaviour was erratic though - examples - One week he decided to get two face piercings in one day then two tattoos the same week. A few weeks later he wanted to legally change his name. He booked a bunch of holidays in one day... I could go on. The worst though - I got a text from his phone saying he was dead. I text back saying that's not funny &amp; tried to call... No answer, got another text saying ""It's his mother, he is dead"". I completely freaked out, crying &amp; shaking, trying to call until finally he answered laughing.

Now, this is all a build up to what happened last night. A few days ago, he decided he was getting a puppy the next day. S &amp; I were worried, because we love dogs &amp; believe a dog is for life &amp; part of the family. He has had 5 dogs in the last 10 years. He always finds an excuse once they are about 6 months to a year old to give the dog away or in one awful case - put the healthy dog to sleep. 
Also, he lives alone &amp; works a lot! Like 4/5 12 hour shifts a week. 

S &amp; I tiptoe around the news. S said ""I think it's good for you mental health, but just remember it's a long commitment &amp; hope it will work out ok"". 
Suddenly, he messages into our group chat saying we are very judgmental &amp; condescending. We have always been that way towards him &amp; we need to shut the F up. Poor S got the brunt, he told her ""Don't F***ing start with me"" etc. I was so shocked as we never speak to each other in that way! 
I messaged saying please don't speak to S like that, she's only looking out for you. He responded very nasty messages, saying ""Go back and stop answering your phone to friends &amp; live in your bubble!"", (I answer 95% of the time), I was so upset, I said ""Please, don't do this, we were just looking out for you"", he then said I was being snarky &amp; ""D'you want an argument? Cause I'll give you one? Do you???""... 

(I do believe that our questions &amp; comments would be condescending if said to anyone else, but he himself said he's fragile,  his mental health poor &amp; behaviour erratic, so we were really just being honest &amp; concerned)

At this point, I was so upset &amp; angry. S &amp; I were talking separately and both felt very hurt.
We wished we could say to him that the reason we were so worried about the dog was because of the history he has with dogs. Also, very upset at him name calling &amp; being so aggressive. 

The argument finally got to T saying he still felt totally got of the loop cause he was single. He said he was ""insanely jealous"" of us two.
I put across that I was jealous of his amazing career &amp; wage but that everyone of us had 1 or 2 of the ""life goals"" (career/family/health etc) just we each have different ones. It's normal. But we would never let it get in the way of our friendship. 

He seems to harbour so much hate for us, just cause we have a bf? 
The worst part is - I was unemployed for almost a year recently. During that time, he would send me photos of his £3000 wage, talk about money constantly &amp; I was depressed as hell but never mentioned it once.

Eventually he said sorry. Then went back to normal, asked us what name we liked for the puppy... I just don't know how I can be normal with him atm. Feel so hurt &amp; I now know how he truly feels. And there is so, so much more that I've left out.

My guess is, we will continue to have a very superficial/shallow relationship. One where, we do not give advice, we do not talk about out partners, we are never honest with him, we just chat about TV &amp; the weather &amp; celeb gossip.

Or is there a way to really fix this and move past it? 

Thank you for reading guys -",12May2020,1
543,"My Grandfather was always a favorite around the holidays. He gave the best hugs and the smell of his leather jacket mixed with his cologne is one of the fondest memories of my childhood. 

I learned some time in early high school that he had molested my aunt over the course of many years during her and my mother's childhood. He never touched my mom and we chalk that up to him targeting the one that he saw as more easily manipulated prey. As a result I grew distant from him, only seeing him a few times over the seven or so years that I knew of the things he had done. 

It just feels strange. I know that what he did was what most of us would consider ""unforgivable"" and that is kinda how I had treated it since I had found out, but he was still my grandfather and had always been good to me when I was around him. He was kind and always made an effort to make my siblings and I feel loved as children. How do I process both the good and the bad?

I know that making the decision to even let my grandpa be a part of our lives in any capacity was difficult for my mom, and that she never fully forgave him for the things that he did, but I think she had wanted a relationship with her dad, and now she won't get another chance to do that.

544,"Hi there. 

I live in Bangladesh and I am looking for a new job. I currently work at a retail bank as a universal banker from 9:30am till 7:30pm to 8:00pm or even 9:00pm. Due to commute, I leave home at 7:30am and reach home at 10:00pm. They only provide a 15 minute lunch break. The work is very multitasking and stressful and high paced. There is huge sales and customer service pressure. 

The environment is extremely restrictive and controlling. You are not allowed to go outside for even a smoke break without verbal permission. For going out for any purpose you need to apply in a computer and be granted leave by two managers on the computer. Such leave is allowed only for customer visits and you need to tell them where you are going and they will later call to confirm if you did go there. They don't allow these for personal reasons except say if you have a visa application (doctor's appointments cannot be made during office hours) or a medical emergency and the reasons has to be included in the online application. 

Even if you are visiting a customer for work, the work is such that you cannot leave when you want to. Customers are always poring in, and it takes a minimum of 30 minutes (I have counted) or sometimes more or never to leave depending upon situation. 

You also absolutely cannot obviously tell your employer that you are going out for another interview since they consider it a lack of loyalty. 

Also here in Bangladesh, they usually have 3 or 4 rounds of interviews for each job. These are all scheduled during the work day and cannot be scheduled later. First is a selection, then a test, then a upper management board and finally a CEO. At least that was what I faced in my current and first job right out of MBA. 

In such a case: 

* How do I manage to attend the job interviews if I cannot go out once I am at office?

* What happens when I get 2-3 calls from employers in a week? I can maybe not go to work for 1 day citing some medical issues, but skipping 2-3 days is not an option at all.",12May2020,1
545,"I told him my feelings for him about a month ago now and he told he he’s not looking for anything right now. He’s talking to other girls too so I guess that’s why he’s not ready to settle down yet. 

Lately tho every time I tell him about my guy friends who are just friends he would always talk bad about them even tho he doesn’t know them at all or never met them before, in fact I didn’t even say any bad things about them but yet he always says something bad 


With one of my guy friends I literally just told him that the guy told me he liked me and Is asking to hookup and stuff...etc so ever since then he’s been hating on this guy and asking me why I even hangout with him and just saying bad things about him in general and making fun of him. 


So yeah it sounds like he might maybe be jealous when I talk to other guys or when other guys are interested in me and I talk to them. Like he expects me not to talk to anyone but yet he can talk to other girls and stuff after rejecting me when I told him about my feelings. 

Also The other thing is the other day when me and him hanged out we looked into each other’s eyes and the way he was looking at me was like deep staring but In a good way like you know that “look” they show in movies and stuff so yeah and I continued looking into his eyes too like I couldn’t help it but he just continued looking at me and smiling too and eventually I broke it off.

547,"Last week I injured my leg and it has been very difficult to walk without shooting pain, although I can still walk minimally (if I walk for too long, though, my leg will fail and I will fall). I’m going in to see a specialist tomorrow to be examined, but until then my boss has placed me on light duty. Depending upon what the examination reveals, that may continue or I may be instructed to take some days off. Not really sure.

Regardless, I’m happy to work and my boss has been happy to provide accommodations for me to do so. However, my coworkers insistently keep asking if I can carry 50 lbs boxes, walk all the way across the warehouse to grab something, run here, run there, push a super heavy cart etc. I have a very obvious brace on my leg and I am literally sitting down when I would usually be standing, and I’ve discussed my injury and that i’ll be gone for a doctor’s appointment multiple times. Even worse, when I inform them I can’t or i’m not supposed to do something, they either tell me that it’s “not fair” or that i’m burdening other people or “it can’t be that bad” (my fav). I already feel super ashamed and bad about it because I’m limping everywhere and look weird and I can’t exercise or do anything. I’m not happy with the situation, either. But having people not take me seriously is making me want to cry. I already snapped at a coworker a bit (basically I was like “Do you think I’m just sitting around for fun?” when he asked if I could run somewhere and do something I’ve specifically been told not to do and then told me I “basically have to do it”) and now I’m worried my boss is going to pull me aside and i’m going to get written up but I’m just really upset and I have no idea what to do.

550,"Ok so I am kinda pissed right now. This girl I’ve never met that I’ve been talking to for about 3 months made a account on reddit and just made complete bullshit up about me. She claimed that I said if we stopped talking I would kill myself (I have SS proving she’s suicidal and completely lying) along with SS of all our conversations. She also is saying I made “alt” accounts to contact her. I only have 2 emails one for my main then this throwaway. I’ve been having serious mental issues with having constant panic attacks and yes I’ve gotten professional help for it. She’s convinced I am lying since a jackass in her comments said I am most likely lying about having it. 


I am pissed out of my mind I trusted this girl and then she makes shit up about me. She also made bullshit claims I was “treating her bad” in which I got mad at her for constantly posting about me and obsessing over me. She literally made then deleted 50 post about me in a 3 day span. 100s of comments as well, she also spun a another lie around saying that I asked her out. (Once again have a SS showing her asking me out after 2 days of talking). 


On top of this she’s got a doctor from India stalking her or some shit apart of me wants to help her another part wants me to tell her go to hell. The doctor is pretty much grooming her and trying to control her. She was stupid and give him her inst and now he knows where she lives. 

I am also convinced she is in a abusive home where her parents are so controlling it’s affecting her health when it comes to socializing with boys. I am no doctor but the reason I say this is because she’s harassed multiple guys on different accounts after blocking them. She’s admitted on her reddit she got beaten for speaking English (yes I have SS of those comments as well). 

She keeps saying that that’s being strict and not abusive. I don’t think I am wrong when if you speak a different language you get beaten.

I wish I could tell him (L) that R isn’t good for him at all, that she’s been toxic, manipulative and dismissal of him in the past, and still now apparently. But I don’t want to come across as dictating or controlling, because that’s not my intention, I just want to prevent him as best as I can from getting hurt by her again. But I’m afraid of seeming too obsessive or overly caring if I tell him my concerns.

553,"As an adult, how do you meet new people and find new things to explore?

It seems like all this was easier when I was younger. In college, I was constantly encountering new people and being introduced to the existence of different clubs and hobbies, and I could choose to explore those or not. It also felt like the internet was more open then, the early 2000s; I was part of some small communities, I met people on IRC, I knew the addresses of my friends' webpages.

It just seems harder as an adult. There are probably small groups around me, but I don't know of their existence, and when looking online, even if I find a group, it's really easy to find red flags that make me want to skip. And when it comes to the internet, I have the whole of the world's knowledge in front of me, and I pretty much go to three websites. I just don't feel like I can just stumble upon stuff anymore; in order to find something useful, I have to already know that I want to find it.

As far as I know, the best center for communities online is Meetup, which is both expensive and full of spiritual or financial groups preying on the vulnerable. But I don't know of any other site that's even comparable to their membership. Again, there's a feeling that I don't know what I don't know. Advice?",12May2020,1

Before I posted this I started to get this bad gut feeling and almost didn't post it at all, but I'm starting to feel tired of being trapped in this shell and not doing things based on fear.

I am 19(F).I think I did a lot of stupid things in my past. Like I trusted almost every person so easily. Honestly, my parents never taught me how to be clever and never did I thought it was even necessary. I am a focussed, sincere, and humble person. I don't hurt people. I am scared of making people feel bad. I love others more than I love myself. I really know it's wrong. I also want to be clever. Eg:My friends called me dumb and instead of telling something like I am not I just said yeah maybe. This made them think like I am even more dumb. I am just a simple person. I don't play games uk. I had a break up recently where he said some really harsh words to me. I felt bad for the first time. It was like someone taking away my respect. He threatened me to leak my nudes and spread my secrets that I had told him. I want to draw a line between being clever and being selfish. I don't want to be selfish but sometimes I think that you gotta be clever here. I want to be smart. I made some mistakes and I realised those. I am improving. But can you tell me something that helps me please.

Hello,

I'd like to have your advice on how to get over my procrastination because 'just stop thinking about it and do it' didn't really work for me.

I have always been a procrastinator, I'm very slow at everything and always do my tasks at the last minute, that didn't cause much problems for me since I always managed to get by and since there is usually a deadline that I can finish things off before it.

A few years ago I started delaying answering to some of my friend's text for a while, that didn't bother me since it wasn't much of an issue, however this became worse in this last year and turned to a real problem and a source of anxiety for me, it also made me feels overwhelmed and uncomfortable most of the time yet i'd still continue putting off answering to texts.

Now I barely answer to any one in time, I  ignore their text sometimes for weeks and months, I have a lot messages that I haven't answered to in almost all platforms, I even no longer want to turn on my smartphone and prefer to keep it away, some of these text aren't that important but I don't want to ignore my friends messages and I feel that it started to affect my relationship with them since I rarely go out of my home and texting is my only source of staying in touch with people, after a while of putting off a certain text rather than just being anxious about it I start to feel guilty for putting it off and I don't know how to answer after a long time especially since I literally have no excuse what so ever, so the more time I put it off the more harder it is for me to answer. Even though I answer them countless times in my head for some reason I can't actually write the answer and send it which wouldn't even take one minute, and whenever I receive a new message I always feel that I'm not in the right mindset to answer and they would all accumulate and overwhelm me. 

I don't mind procrastinating things like organizing my room or so but I don't want my own problems to affect my relationships or even affect people directly. It also made me way more isolated than I'm. It feels like a silly issue that can simply be fixed by answering rather than writing about it in Reddit but I have no idea why it is so hard. So I would appreciate any advice.

tl;dr: I keep procrastinating answering to my relatives &amp; friends text for a long time and even If i did manage to answer I repeat the same thing all over again, I need your advice on how to stop procrastinating.

Thank you",12May2020,1
559,"Hey, I've created a throw away for this post. Apologies for the long post, let me know if I need to change anything as it's my first time posting. I hope this is the right place.  
A few years ago I graduated from a degree that I realised all too late I was not passionate about. It has a lot to do with what I perceived was considered a 'good' degree.  
I spent a couple of years working on applying for jobs in that area, still very oblivious, and working part-time as a bartender. I definitely stayed for longer than I should have, but I was also experiencing very strong friendship bonds for the first time, so it was harder to leave. Due to moving to many countries when I was little until the end of high school, I didn't have the chance to cultivate relationships. (These friends were also the ones which made me realise that I wasn't currently doing something I had any passion or interest in, and we remain fast friends to this day).  
I kept sinking deeper into a depression and eventually realised, with the help of my parents, that I really needed help, since everything was murky and blurry. I ended up moving back home, to my country and my childhood home (this all within Europe).  
It took a long time to get out of the depression and lack of motivation. Eventually I managed to get part-time work at a local school as a sub, and some occasional part-time work at local night-scene. I also started to see a psychiatrist and am on medication. This has all helped me in tackling my thought patterns and rumination (as well as dealing with stuff left over from when I had an eating disorder in my teens).  
I began thinking about what I want to do, and among other things I couldn't stop thinking about a particular STEM subject. Finally I took the plunge and I made the preparations which included re-taking some high school subjects and taking some new subjects to fulfil the requirements. These are things I've been thinking about doing for a couple of years, without making the move.

  
However, early January this year, our family lost my brother to suicide. It was very unexpected, he had no prior history of mental illness and a very good environment around him (great friends, great gf, no money problems, studying his passion). Seemingly the result of an overwhelming desire to be perfect at what he did and to excel (even though he was already excelling and doing amazing work).  
Life will never be the same, we will never be the same, we will always feel this loss. We were all very close and are all trying to get to grips with the situation. Stress is a killer as we have all learned so horribly.  


As a result, my perspective has changed on what really matters in life, and am starting to question my motivations behind going for this STEM subject. (Is it what I really want? Is it just because I feel life is wasted if I don't do something STEM related? Do I really want to go to school for another 6 years?)  


The reason I did my first degree was because it was vaguely related to art and design, which I have always felt isn't a 'good enough' subject. Art has always been referred to as something which can be a hobby by my parents (the are both engineers).   
Also, if I were really honest, the prospect of pursuing and failing/doing badly at something art&amp;design related absolutely terrifies me.  


This also has to do with the expectations and the hopes of my parents, who are wonderful and only want the best for me. We have our differences and don't have the easiest relationship, mostly because we communicate terribly and I am especially bad at it - I try to be good in other ways, but I always end up hurting them and making them stressed. I just want to stop them worrying/be on the right path so that we can cultivate a better relationship without expectations.  


I am currently feeling very much in limbo and at a loss in what to do, and how I can begin to investigate and work on my next step. I don't know if the gut feeling I have of leaving this path of studying and just getting full-time work in the mean time is something that I really want or if it is something that is severely clouding my judgement due to our family tragedy.  


I would love some pointers or approaches that I am just not capable of seeing at the moment. I am grateful for any insight.  


Side note: I am aware that I am a very privileged person. I have loving parents and a roof over my head. We are in a country which is very privileged too, and in many many many ways I am so lucky.",12May2020,1

I told my mom about the lost wallet and Because i was so embarrassed that i drunkenly spent so much money, I told her that someone used my credit card to spend so much. I panicked and that was a dumb lie but i said it.
She made me fill out a police report and everything which I did but I only reported my lost wallet, not that I spent so much money obviously. Then I lied to my mom that I did not get the email with the police report and that I talked to the police station's office and they told me to wait 4 months and then get back to them ig I haven't got the police report by then.

570,"I’m 19, a student in college, living at home.

I have a stalker my age. She had taken every friend group from me through out high school. Ruined my reputation time and time again. When I graduated, I only had one friend group left. They were all older (by 1-2 years) but loved having me around.

In the Fall of 2019 I started college and my stalker surprisingly went into the US Army for basic training. I was happy to find this out. Thought I was free. Because of this, I spent time getting closer to my friends, as doing things like that has always been a fear, ever since I met that insane girl at 14. At some point I didn’t have to be invited to plans because I was a part of the plans. We hung up every week up until the quarantine. They’re probably the best friends I’ve ever had. There’s been no problems at all in regards to me.

On New Year’s Eve my friend (who did not know this friend group, and didn’t really hang out with anybody, but was still close with me) took her own life. She had Aspergers and was struggling already. What pushed her past the edge was my stalker.

My stalker finished basic training and had her phone back for who knows how long. MY stalker targeted my friend simply for being friends with me. Blackmailed and humiliated her in such a terrible way. My friend had problems in her life and decided to end everything because of a problem that only I should have to deal with.

My Mom is the one who prevented me from talking to my friend. I shouldn’t have listened to my Mom. I shouldn’t even have told her what was leaked to social media and what my stalker sent to her parents. I was just terrified.

My friend is gone now and I feel it’s my fault. My Mom does not show any sympathy and acts as if she never existed. She has always shown a clear disdain for people who are “different”, which is also why I was neglected &amp; abused until age 14, because a school counselor called concerned, and now they’ve stopped, despite still being very toxic. Took me to get tested and I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety and ADHD. But they completely kept the ADHD a secret until I was 18, after high school, when my ADHD had already gotten much, much worse.

Ever since that day, I have had terrible trouble sleeping. Lying awake in agony. I have become a true insomniac. I used to always fell asleep before 10 PM. Now I’ve been up past midnight every day of this year. My friends helped so much and they didn’t even know it. I was so grateful.

In January, before the semester started, I found out the girl I had been talking to prior to my friend’s death was actually set up by my stalker to get info on me. She goes to my campus and leaked a bunch of info to my stalker. Was a complete surprise. From what I understand, my stalker convinced her to do this by telling her some atrocious (most definitely false) information about me. This girl I allowed to follow me on Instagram after talking on Snapchat for a while. She seems to have sent a bunch of information on my private Instagram to my stalker. 

In February I was falsely accused by this girl who I literally had blocked for a month. The plan was clearly something my stalker would come up with. That’s another long story but to put it shortly - I was investigated as a threat to the campus by the Public Safety Department. Proven innocent, of course, but it really stressed me out.

I had an “A” or “B” in all three of my classes that semester, despite the humongous weight on my shoulders. I never went to a “C” or below.

When I learned classes were going online because of the pandemic, I knew I would struggle. I never did work at home. It was impossible with my depression and I needed to be out of the house, which is how I had been working all semester.

Despite this, I tried my best to do well. I was struggling a lot but going as hard as I can. The semester continued online in late March. In early April, my stalker struck again.

Around 3 AM on April 4th, me and a ton of the friends in my friend group were tagged in a photo on Instagram. An anonymous Instagram account was “exposing” me. I was being publicly accused of raping a child. The fake victim my stalker used was my childhood friend who went missing long before I met this stalker. (I am aware of how my stalker knows her name but it’s another long story).

Most of my friends heard me out, I explained I have a stalker, who spread rumors about me throughout high school. Despite this, 2 of them already completely no longer talk to me. The rest of them show clear distrust for me, and I am being treated so differently. Slowly they seem to be becoming more and more disliking of me, and we were all so excited to see each other after the quarantine. I had to postpone my birthday party in late March because of it and now I’m not sure if I’ll be able to have it without any friends coming. I no longer feel like a part of this friend group simply because on crazy girl decided to accuse me of rape... and decided to use the name of my missing childhood friend, who I literally consider to be dead, as the victim. This has crushed my soul.

The stalker sent the address of my campus to one of my friends, taunting and implying that she was going to send this information to my college next. Definitely wouldn’t look good seeing I was just accused of planning violence out of the blue in February, despite being proven innocent.

On April 19th I reported her to the Army CID with all of the proof I have she everything she’s done since she finished basic training. Took me a lot of willpower. I have laid awake for hours on end, during the day and night, just staring at the ceiling in complete apathy, depression and disbelief. My grades slowly slipped. By the time the semester ended, I failed every class.

Not sure what will happen next. Haven’t heard from her since then. Hoping the CID will or has done something. Wish I could’ve gone to the police but I was worried my parents would’ve found out and made things difficult like they always do.

This entire situation is completely unfair. I shouldn’t have to go through this alone. My parents have only ever thrown me under the bus throughout my life. Kids at school would realize my parents would never protect me so not only was I assaulted a ton of times growing up, but they would eventually learn to accuse me of things. 90% of what I accused of as a child wasn’t even true. The ones that were true were petty preteen things (example: cheating on a test that literally everyone in the room cheated on) Despite all that, my parents would always immediately turn on me, as if I was some criminal by default.

I wanted to go to the police the day she returned and made my friend take her life. But not even that was enough to convince my parents that legal action needed to be taken. That is when I truly realized how little my parents care for people like me. Overtime, friends with mental illness, even the ones hardly noticeable, were disliked by my parents. My Mom has always been in disliking of that childhood friend who went missing, before and after her disappearing, simply because her and her family were “off”. I will never understand why. I was 9 when I last saw her.

My life was going so well. But my stalker has returned and despite no longer living in my state has found away to take control over my life. Picking off my friends one by one. Ruining my attendance at college, directly and indirectly. And I know how easy it will be for her to ruin my home life as well. She is toying with me at this point.

My greatest fear ironically is that she is discharged from the military for misconduct and sent back home. With her life ruined, and her in the same city as me, it’s terrifying to think what she’d do with nothing to lose. I would genuinely fear for my life.

573,"I recently went back to work after a seasonal layoff, to find my workload EXTREMELY reduced due to coronavirus and the nature of my position, which was already worked into the budget before the pandemic began. This leaves me with mostly down time, and extreme boredom. At least when I was home I had the company of my dog, and could cook, clean, etc.

I have a long enough commute that I am unable to travel back home for lunch, making the day that much longer. 

I am very thankful to still be employed. I'm just not sure how long I can last working full-time without a set of tasks to do. 

Advice? What would you do? 

The pay rate is enough to the point that getting a different job, especially those hiring during coronavirus, wouldn't result in any more money.

The job involves both an indoor and outdoor component. I have a small office and a big outdoor work campus that I share with 2 other people. 

How can I pass the time?

Should I find a tedious hobby to do for almost 40 hours a week? Like what??? Any suggestions? 

Should I try to find a job that has the same pay but has more responsibilities and social contact?? (Keep in mind I have a bachelor's degree and this would mean going to work somewhere that had nothing to do with my schooling). 



TLDR: My job is basically all down time because of Coronavirus, and I'm bored. What should I do all day?",12May2020,1
574,"I’ve lived on my own for a few years now and I love it. Last September I moved into a beautiful one bedroom apartment that I could see myself being in for a while. It’s spacious and quiet and in a great location in the city. My partner’s lease is up in July but he wants to move in with me before that.
I grew up with two siblings, in college I lived in a house with 5 girls, I lived with some extended family for a short period of time  after college to save some money, so I know how to share space and considerately live with other people.
I’ve been feeling uneasy for some reason when thinking about where he could put stuff like his desk (I live in a very old building and there are limited outlets throughout the place). I think it should be in the dining room where my work space is. There is a lot of room in there and we can run an extension cord for his computer. He thinks the living room would be best for him but there’s no room in there. We would have to rearrange the whole room and get rid of a couch just so his desk could fit, even though there is an open gap in my dining room. It’s such a small thing to argue over, but it also blows my mind that it doesn’t just make sense to him to put the desk where there’s a large opening. There is a very slim chance we would both be working at the same time. 
I’ve been tapering off my Adderall and it’s harder for me to focus on my work so I also worry about the level of distraction he would bring on his days off when I’m working from home. 
I want him to move in so we can save money and eventually get  a house but I’m worried that the adjustment period will be hard. I don’t want to fight with him and I don’t want him to feel out of place when he moves in. 
Does anyone have advice on how to make the transition easy? Anyone experience this before?

This is about an online friend I have. For about 8 months or so, I was in active conversation with him (talking on a daily basis). However in December, I notice him pulling back and I started to pull away too (as I feel that he was starting to become more and more negative, he’s shared that he’s suicidal and has mentioned that he has anger issues).

Recently we started talking again. When I confronted him about his behavior. After an argument, where he described he’d try and change it, that it was due to his bipolar that his replies are brief and short (which btw was completely different from the way he talked to me at the beginning of our conversation last year). 

As I always feel unhappy after talking to him, I do not engage conversation with him. He is always the one to initiate conversation with me. However, he will give curt brief replies whenever I respond. Sometimes my responses will be ignored, whereby he’d leave messages on my Instagram post or “like them” instead. 
A few times he’s ignore and “like” my questions. I feel very disrespected when he does it. 
So today  I decided to call him out for it. His response was that I take “days” to respond. So I went back to track my replies. I notice I’ve replied to every of his message  in 12-24 hours (we live in very different time zones).

Is he gaslighting or manipulating me? I have no idea what to believe at this point in time. I’ve been hurt by narcissistic people quite a lot in the past. I really do not want to be caught up in this cycle anymore. I’ve tried reading up more on this when dealing with him, even texting him “I feel” statements so that my argument is kept reasonable, doing my best to be firm and assertive.

585,"Hello, so my lease contract that I signed for my current apartment was for around 1 year. This is for a place in Germany whilst I am primarily living in the UK. I have most of my personal belongings in Germany and just so happened to be in the UK during the whole lockdown thing, so I can't really go back. Now I'm being told that because of ""renovation work"" in my apartment I have to move out of my place and move to another place which I did not agree to, which was never in the contract or was never mentioned to me. Of course during a time like this I find it absolutely ridiculous that they are forcing me to move to a place half an hour away from my current place, and just a quick look at the place makes me really not want to stay there at all. I am also told that I will pay the same rent for the new place despite it being worse. Even still, I have heard many of my friends's place rent has been delayed or canceled entirely, with some even saying early ends to contracts, however this is all from wjat I've heard in the UK. I'm still paying my rent for my place I'm Germany despite not having been there since the end of February and have no foreseeable date as to when I return. I am really not sure what to do. They said that they will move my things (basically forcing me to move) if I am unable to return to Germany in the next week. I also have a lot of personal belongings there as I mentioned a few of which are tech components, consoles, monitors, speakers and are so more vunurable to damage. I also really don't want anyone moving or touching my stuff. Of course since I am not in Germany there is nothing I can really do since they have the Master key. I am feeling really shitty about the situation.

586,"Hey! It would mean a lot to me if you read this. I will try to keep this short. It all started about a year ago, but it has gotten worst for the past 4 months. I am F(18) and she just turned 13. We are from Spain, if that matters. Our family is a mess. My father is and my mom doesn't find a job. I see my father as a horrible person and I think I made her hate him too. He is homophobic, racist towards muslims etc. The worst is that he is cheating 
on my mom And I've known for 2 years now. I have proof (chats and a sex tape) of him talking to at least 3 or 4 women. 

He used to beat me when I was little, he sometimes still does, not to talk about the mental abuse he put us 3 through. He does not usually beats my mom up btw, he only tried to choke her once and he punched her a few times. He has threatened me when I once told him I would report him so that's not an option.

My father is aaaalways arguing with my mom about money or literally anything. Btw I told my mom he is cheating but she does not have money to divorce him and be on her own.

Anyways. For the past few months the situation has gotten worst even though I didn't know it was possible lol. My sister acts like baby and immature. She always tries to start an argument w any member of the family. She gets so mad and starts yelling if my father is on the phone or even if I make a voice note. She gets angry whenever she does not like the food or childish stuff like this.

For example, she has thrown my father's phone on the floor when he told her he wanted to use it rn to play games (she broke her own phone 2 months ago). Today she threw the phone and broke it.

Soo I always thought of saving up to go live with my sister and leave this fucking place, but honeslty I think I should just leave by my own cause I don't think I can help her. I am soo done with everything, I cannot focus on university and I sm failing( I don't even have a computer)

I undertand she is a teen and that our family sucks but I never ever acted this way. Please do not tell me that I am overreacting because this situation is difficult, I am not a crybaby lol.

Sorry if this is messy, writing on my phone and I got a lot inside my mind right now.

Hopefully someone can give me some sort of advice cause I don't know what to do :)

588,"So I need some help here, I’m a Male (15) and I was apart of a friend group for a month or so and we all got pretty close with each other. Recently I caught feelings for one of the girls in there, but the problem was she had a boyfriend. No problem there, I could wait, I wasn’t in any rush.

In the last couple of days, she has told me how her boyfriend only talks to her when it’s convenient for him, how he never wants to talk, never wants to do anything they did before. So in turn she lost feelings in the relationship, and was just in it, just to be in it. 

Well the more we started talking about him, she grew more and more curious as to what he was doing and if he was cheating on her. When I offered to find out, she politely declined and said it was no big deal.

Now i know a couple of friends who are able to do stuff like that (go into their account, basically hack into it) and I sent them a text to do it, before she told me not to do it. They did, but never got back to me till yesterday. They basically told me that what her suspicions were are true and she was being cheated on. 

Here’s where I need advice on, they won’t send me any proof of it (I do trust what they are saying, because I didn’t even tell them about the girl and her boyfriend), and I can’t bring myself to tell the girl about it, because I know it will hurt her and myself as well because I went behind her back, and did it. 

So how do I tell her he’s cheating on her, while still keeping our friendship and potential relationship together?

591,"Throwaway because my regular account is too obvious to name and I don't want to make it so my friend could find this. 

So a friend of mine who I've been playing games with online for the past 6 years told me today that his wife has requested they separate. We've been playing almost nightly and generally having a good laugh all the time and well when I jumped on and invited him to the party, he joined and just sounded so deflated. He told me what had happened but he didn't elaborate past anything but saying that today his wife wanted a separation. I didn't want to pry because relationships aren't something we've generally spoken about.  We usually jump on, play our game and joke and laugh around. I've never met him in person before because he lives in another state but being friends we have each other on social media and so know a little bit more of each other's personal lives. 

Anyway when he told me I had no idea what to say. After about 30 seconds of silence I just asked what he was doing on the game and he said he just needed to feel distracted. So we played our game, won some matches, lost others and tried do our daily objectives like we usually do. It was different to our usual sessions but I tried to keep his mind off the obviously devastating news he got today.

I just want some advice on how I can support him in ways other than playing the game and keeping him distracted, if he chooses to seek help and support from me. I don't want to feel unprepared and leave him hanging with an awkward silence.",12May2020,1

Some things to know: I have depression and anxiety (I'm on meds), I have very low self-esteem, and I'm a *hopeless* romantic (Lk boy-crazy ngl). I'm kinda dumb, so if the writing/formating is bad... 

I've known E since I moved to my city. She was one of the first friends I met, and I love her so much. Our struggles overlap in certain areas, which brings us together even more. I literally can't put into words how much she means to me. Our birthdays are also 2 days apart which is crazy. 

It's been 6\[?\] years, we've been on-and-off friendship-wise, but when something happened to me that involved losing all of my friends, she stepped up and we became very close. Before last year, I never really even *thought* about her brother (I actually liked her cousin for a little bit). Everyone has always said that he was hot, but I never really agreed because I didn't want to seem like I was only friends with her for the benefits of being close to her brother. People would talk to her about how ""her brother was so hot,"" and she often mentioned to me how uncomfortable it made her, so I never even went near the subject. Late last year, I kind of 'gave-in' and was like, ""ok, duck it, I like him."" I moved to his school, so we were seeing each other a lot more. We don't even talk that much, but he gives me butterflies *ok &gt;:(.* He's less than 3 years older than me, he's nice, athletic, and taller than me (last two are just bonuses).

I don't want to continue in porn or sex chat to feel happy I want to have a genuine friend can anyone help me?,12May2020,1
609,"I f19 am a very horny person and love to have sex and masturbate. Yet I never had an orgasm before. I feel like I am always close. E.g when I rub my clit, i get my legs shaking, I get hot sensations over my body. But either they go away or I can't follow through. It is a good sensation but at the same time, it is kind of uncomfortable and I can't keep going.
Any tips or anyone who experiences the same?",12May2020,1
610,"I've aways been an anxious person. And for a while very depressed. I know I am a hypochondriac but while knowing that helps, it doesn't make all my symptoms disappear. 

In November I started working at a doctor's office. I hated it even then and would cry when I got home and before I had to go in. I'm enrolled in school for the next year so I figured I could just tough it out for a year to help my husband pay the bills. 

Since the whole COVID19 thing though ... I don't know. I have constant, stabbing pain in the chest. I can actually see my husband dead on our apartment floor when I close my eyes. I have vivid sleep paralysis nightmares almost every night. I dont think ill actually do it, but I've thought about ways of killing myself. Not because I want to die but because I'd at least be able to control it that way. I'm afraid I'm actually losing my grip on reality. Some days are better than others but it's getting worse by the day. 

The worst part is, even though I work with doctor's and we have ""rules"" in place, almost nobody here is taking it remotely seriously. The nurse supervisor and her doctor both think its stupid to require patients wear masks or that we even take temperatures at the door. The office manager has suggested paying a 15 year old under the table to be the one taking temps so we don't have to ""waste"" a nurse out in the hall. People roll their eyes and scoff at me when I wash my hands every 10 minutes. 

Yes. I know a large part of me is acting irrationally but fighting that part of me is tearing me apart. When I read about young people having strokes ... Jesus Christ there have been times i swear I can *feel* my blood. I know I'm not. I'm trying to be rational. I'm failing. 

My question is, with the second wave about to hit, does anyone think I can asked to be furloughed for the summer? I can't afford not to have the covid relief which is the only reason I'm still working. They furloughed a nurse who asked in February. I'm just worried that nobody will take me seriously. That they'll let me go but then protest my covid relief. 

I've been looking for a better job since starting here. This was only ever an emergency job because I needed a paycheck. 

I'm sorry for the wall of text. I'm sorry if I sound weak and stupid. My husband doesn't know what to advise so I thought I'd try here. Thanks.",12May2020,1

i've been like this forever

its like dudes around my age want to beat me up, the way they look at me. i've even had some random confrontations with them.

obviously

OBVIOUSLY, its not EVER one on one. cause in that case, many of them cant even look me in the face, well, if they do, there's no bad intention.

honestly, its so fucking tiring. 

again, ITS NOT IN MY FUCKING HEAD. I CAN SEE THE WAY THEY FUCKING LOOK AT ME

they always have a problem with me

the thing is that the more relaxed i look the more angry they get

literally, i have to look angry to avoid that shit

&amp;#x200B;

also, like, if i kissed a girl in the street, and they were there, they would probably kill me, even tho they'd ignore others. and yes, shit like that has happened. its almost like i get double the reaction everyone gets to anything i do

another thing is that if i'll look weak, non angry, if i'll look like i dont have a fucking body count, they'll try to make fun of me.

again, one on one this shit dont happen.

only when they are ganged up

617,"Basically what the title says. My grandparents live alone in Florida, and were supposed to come up and spend May and June up in the state where my mom and I live. Obviously, that ended up not happening, and my grandparents have been by themselves during the pandemic. Needless to say, they’re very lonely, but their 4 kids and myself have been calling and texting regularly. My grandfather has had some serious health problems in the last year, which had added additional stress on all parties involved. 

Yesterday, I spoke with my mom and she mentioned that she was planning on driving 1000 miles to go visit my grandparents for a week at the end of the month. My mother has not been quarantining at all, she’s had friends over for dinner and drinks regularly, is still working, and has basically been out and about like normal with minimal precautions. It’s been a fight we’ve been having since March as her and her husband (68M) are in a higher risk group, but they refuse to see themselves as ‘old’ and think my husband and I (36M/F) are being overly dramatic about the whole situation. 

I told her I thought it was a monumentally stupid idea for her to go down to see her parents (one of whom has cardiac problems and low blood oxygen levels on a good day) unless she went into full quarantine for at least 14 days before she leaves. Her response was that she can’t afford to stop working for that long (she can) and that my grandma has been giving her a major guilt trip about delaying her visit. 

I did the best to explain to my mom the concerns I have for her half-baked plan, which a would require her to stop and get gas in at least one state that’s reopened prematurely, right around the time experts are warning about a second wave of infections. My mother also has only the vaguest understanding of proper social distancing, etc; she’s one of those take the mask off to talk kind of people. I’ve accepted that she’s going to roll the dice with her own health and there’s nothing I can do about it, but exposing my grandparents is a hill I’m willing to die on.

I’ve asked her to run her plan by my uncle (60M) who is a doctor and a respect voice of reason that’s generally accepted by my grandparents. I highly doubt he’ll think it’s a good idea as he was warning the family 8 weeks ago to expect lockdown measures to last for a year or more. However, short of telling my mom that the family will never forgive her if our grandparents die because she insisted on not postponing her trip, I’m at a loss as to how to get through to her. 

My mother acknowledges every argument I make, but says my grandparents will be crushed if she delays her trip any longer. I told her that they will be even more upset if one of them dies and can never see anyone else ever again. She’s said she’ll think about it, but I know that’s her way of saying ‘I’m going to do what I want but will say what you want to hear to avoid unpleasantness.’

My next plan is to call my grandma and try to talk her down from the endless guilt trip she’s likely laying on my mom right now, but I need some ammo before making that call. G-ma is a very-self centered matriarch, so dismissing a global pandemic because it’s getting in the way of her social schedule is pretty on-brand for her.

So far, none of my mom or grandparents’ acquaintances have suffered seriously from this virus, so they’re reaching the dismissive phase of the cycle. We live in a county with low infection numbers, but a high per-capita rate and my mom has frequently been in a neighboring county that’s an active hotspot. Our state is also like 48th in the nation for testing, so we don’t even know how likely it is that we’ve been exposed. But all this empirical information goes out the window because my grandma is making my mom feel so bad about not visiting in April as planned before the world fell apart. I’m usually the one who steps in in situations like this get get both sides to be reasonable, but I’m at a loss this time. 

TL,DR: my mom is planning on driving 1000 miles to visit her elderly parents in a couple of weeks, despite the risk of herself and them getting sick because of it. I’m trying to talk them out of it but am meeting a surprising amount of resistance. Any advice for how to approach this situation would be greatly appreciated.",12May2020,1
618,"I (28M) have been traveling while working from my laptop for the last couple of years, together with my girlfriend. We've been together for about 5 years now. I develop apps and my girlfriend is a designer. She helps me a lot in my business. In regards to the current pandemic, I and my girlfriend have been stranded in Asia for a couple of months now. My girlfriend is from Asia, I'm from Europe.

My older sister announced a long time ago before the pandemic was a fact, that she is getting married in Juli and really wants me to be there. I agreed to go and be her witness and planned to attend the wedding with my girlfriend.

Fast forward, we're now in the middle of a pandemic and things have changed. My sister decided to delay the big party for the wedding until October because the amount of people invited far exceeds the maximum allowed during the pandemic. She decided to continue with the plan to hold the official wedding ceremony in the town hall with a small group of people in Juli. She wants me to attend both ceremonies, to show my support for her.

I have been self-quarantining for a couple of months now. Countries have locked their borders. If I decide to leave the country that I am in now there will be no telling when I can re-enter. My girlfriend is from this country and she will not be able to leave her country or go to my home country. So we will be separated for an unknown time if I decide to go. This will affect my relationship and my business.

Other than that, I have asthma so I belong in the Covid-19 risk group. It will be a lot of traveling before I reach the destination. However, I am not most concerned about my health. Both my parents belong to the risk group, they are old and are heavy smokers. I don't have my own place in my home country, if I do decide to go back I will self-quarantine at my sister's house or get my own place for a couple of weeks. After that, I will go back to my parents' house. Which still puts them to risk if I decide to go out for errands.

My sister called me selfish for me opening the discussion about the possibility of me not attending the smaller town hall ceremony and that I haven't booked my ticket yet. I suggested that I attend the big party, hopefully together with my girlfriend, and not attend the shorter official ceremony. I need your opinion, am I selfish or is my reasoning justified?",12May2020,1

620,"Hi there,  


I was hoping maybe someone wanted to give me some advice about a longtime friendship I have and if I should end it or not.   
Okay so here's the deal: I've had a best friend since I was literally two years old. Especially when we were younger (we're both 30 now) we were like soulmates. Almost constantly together having so much fun. We know each other so well and 'til today we can still talk and laugh endlessly when we see each other (which is not so much these days). I have two other good friends but she's the only one I have this intense connection with.  


The thing is, when we were younger she seduced two of the guys I liked and started relationships with them (the first time when we were 12 and the second time when we were 14 so we were quite young). One of those guys I just had a crush on (which she knew) but the other one was my first, actual relationship and she knew I was very much in love with him. Besides that my mother got mentally ill when I was 12, so around the time she seduced my first crush, and that was a very traumatic time for me. I didn't even get mad both times. Just very sad. Although later I told her I was mad about the second time. She said she didn't understand her behaviour either and that she'd wished she had never done that, but other than that I've never seen her actually regret it.  
We stayed friends because I just didn't wanna lose her and I thought I forgave her, but it wasn't until a few weeks ago that I started having six dreams in a row about her and the things she did. I woke up every day feeling super mad and since then I'm just wondering if this friendship is healthy.  


It's hard for me to look at it objectively. Although as I'm writing this it seems so clear that I should end it but I just can't imagine throwing such a long and intense friendship away like this. It's such an important part of my life. I guess my question is: is there a chance this friendship can still be healthy? And if yes, what is a good way to deal with it right now?

622,"How do you guys make your mentality positive on your birthday? 
A little backstory, when I was young, all of my birthdays were ruined. My mom and dad always fought over who I would spend my birthday with, and put me in the middle deciding out of the two. The day would always end with me making the “wrong” choice and hurting someone’s feelings. Nothing spectacular was every done, and usually I would have to share my birthday with someone who was graduating (since my birthday is around the same time.) 
Last year my girlfriend made it real special and cute for me. Initiate private trip to the beach. (The weekend prior) and then the day of, did cupcakes cleaned my car out really good, pizza and a movie. Super lovely. But my mentality and negative attitude just ruined it. She felt as if she wasn’t doing enough &amp; I didn’t know how to explain it’s just my negative mentality of the day. 
This year, no matter what she does, I want to have a positive mentality, but I’m just SO scared that I’ll end up having the same negative one I’ve seemed to expect from over the years.

624,"My cousin was born in the same year so we get compared a lot especially from her mum for some reason. Always a competition, totally unnecessary as she was smarter and more prettier than me. She was known as the hot one. And yes, she was in that mean girls group and I was an outsider so  I was disliked a lot by her peers. My family was poorer and mum was always working so we were left to kind of groom and feed ourselves as in at the tuck shop. We never had fancy toys or pretty accessories and new clothes was hard to come by. Needless to say I wasn’t well put together...to fit in...always scruffy and dirty looking. My best friend in primary was obese as well so that didn’t help and we were both the butt of everyone’s jokes. She was the meanest at 10-12 I think. 

So my mum’s hard work and business ventures paid off and we started to get spoiled and have nicer things and my cousin became a lot nicer in high school which I thought was very mature of her. She did bully others, I didn’t find out until after high school because we were in different classes but I don’t think she knows it which is the most concerning part. I mainly ignored her stupid remarks when she sneers at peoples clothing or their body..I think I was used to it; I mean I told her off too many times for like “dude, who cares or why does it matter to you?” I stopped trying after a while and just roll my eyes. We tried to be best friends despite having different personalities. We even got matching tattoos...big regret. 

Perhaps she moved to another city and perhaps she became a mother so I thought she matured a bit. But that wasn’t the case. I didn’t even thought it was possible to pick up a valley girl accent and she started having one liners like “that’s so rank” or “wretched” Anyway she doesn’t remember bullying me or my younger sister or anyone else for that matter. I don’t think she ever considered herself a bully....when we talked about our childhoods, she said I had it all. My mother spoilt me and I could get whatever I wanted. It shocked me but I think that’s I’ve always thought of her. I’m always forgiving so I moved on and because of our lack of communication due to distance she had become a lot more tolerable.

My sister did try to forgive her especially now that she’s in her twenties but my cousin decided to subtly fat shamed little sis online (she’s a medium) - all the bad childhood memories came pouring out of my sister...My sister has anxiety attacks so she completely cut her out now just for her mental health. Not before she ripped into my cousin for having no life to be bitching about other people all the time. She ignored me since probably because I think I’m a reminder of what happen between her and my sister...

Years passed, I’ve opened my tea house business. Everyone just assumes we’re successful because of our social media following but it just “looks” successful. Those comments and likes aren’t paying you. Our shop is quite hidden and people really go out of their way to check us out but most don’t because it’s inconvenient. Like all small businesses, we struggle in the beginning but we hustled and grind. 

Anyways our city went into lockdown and I’m in an Business/entertainment district so we cut our days to save resources. No one is working.. so why bother opening mon-wed and also we needed a break after hustling for almost two years without a holiday.

She finally messaged “Omgosh what happened?” 

“Nothing much, thank god our sales haven’t dropped drastically. 
 Our followers really supported us and we’re still okay. Also landlord is giving us free rent!” 

No reply. 


During the covid period, we’re busier than ever because parking became accessible. We’re very fortunate. Praise be to all the boba addicts out there. 

So I’ve made a post that we will be closing down our shop and relocating to a more main road strip and mixed residential and commercial location very close to all the destination spots in our city. It was supposed to be our second shop but after much consideration, I decided to close the current location and just move. Economy is going to be shit and I don’t want to be stretching myself too thin. Not worth the risk right now.

Again she messaged.

“What happened!?”

“Can you do takeaway or is that not viable?” 


I replied “I actually planned to open a second store but decided to relocate instead because it’s not worth the risk but yeah because of the uncertainty, I was able to negotiate a good deal. Saved myself 20k and 6 month rent free!”. The landlord would not budge before the covid19 lockdown but now I was able to get a good deal as they need a good stable tenant. 

Again ignored. 

She sent her younger sister to my shop to check if it was true, if we were really busy. Sure enough, she saw a long line and how we’re doing fine. Anyway it’s not just her but other people I know just ask “what happened” and when you give them an answer you’re doing fine and they ignores you straight after like you gave them the wrong answer. So I made a post on fb - don’t ask “what happened?!” Perhaps ask “are you doing okay?” It really irks me to think all those business owners who had to close their doors but to also get this shit thrown at them as well. I mean at least try to hide your disappointment when I say we’re doing okay or we’re just relocating to a better location. This is someone’s dreams and aspirations on the line not a gossip topic.

After seeing post, she texted. 
“Are you okay?! I hope you’re okay x.” 

I’m ok, just annoyed yet she doesn’t know that she’s part of the problem. Perhaps I’m judging her as the bully she was and I’m being unfair but it’s just weird how she asks “what happened?!”  like she wants my business to fail or for me to not be ok. I know I shouldn’t accuse her of wanting my business to fail but i can’t help it...I don’t even know how to respond to her now. Like I can’t ever see her as genuine.",12May2020,1

631,"I am 14 years old, and I live in the PH.

(I'm sorry if this is a long post, and if I look as if I'm ungrateful.)

My mother is a good mother, she actually raised me and my sisters while formerly running a small-scale *sari-sari store* since my father is working abroad as a seafarer in different countries. She fed us, sent us to school with the money she earned and the money from my father, and even helped her mother get well from the disease she had when we were little. She managed the store for years all by herself, before hiring a person to help her. Now that we have our own house, we can finally rest a bit from the struggles of running the store.

But as I grew up, I also saw her personality when she is pissed ( she has hypertension, and currently takes medicine for it ) and would often beat me and my sister up. The pain was dependent on the gravity of the sin committed.

There were instances that I really deserved it, but there were situations wherein she did it, blinded with her rage, caused by her high blood pressure. I know that I shouldn't worsen the situation, but being a teen and all, there were instances that I have triggered her, unintentionally.

There was this instance, when I was washing the dishes, when  I sneezed. I know it sounds weird, but hear me out. I covered it with my left elbow, but she was angry, saying that I sneezed on the newly washed dishes which were on my right side, insisting that I should wash it again. This was a month or two before the coronavirus started spreading in my country.  I tried to explain, but I also got a bit carried away, and raised my voice a bit. She thought I was talking back. Then she got the broom and charging wires and started beating the shit out of me, saying something on how my judgement is wrong, telling me that it was my fault, and started saying that my academic accomplishments did not really matter to her. It hurt my feelings a lot, and I started to remember all the times she beat me up, whether I did something bad or not. It hurt so bad, my ears started ringing, and because of that, I ran up to my sister's room, locking the door, and opening the balcony door, in case she would unlock it. She did, and I started shouting a lot, and my hands were shaking from the pain I was experiencing and my head hurts a lot at that time. So I said i'm sorry, even though I did not do anything to piss her that much. She started to walk towards me, but I walked back, even though she was saying sorry, and went to the balcony due to the fear. i would've jumped from the balcony, if she didn't go away.

I know this may sound exaggerated, but it's not.  It was due to the pain, the fear I experienced, that made me act like that. I actually asked my friend how to cope with this, but his advice wasn't really working at all, and I was afraid of talking to my other friends, because my batch has a handful of ""judging"" people, and I was afraid to tell her about it, since I thought she might get angry. I know from experience that bringing something unpleasant from the past and saying I haven't moved on ever since will make her angry again.

Please help me, this experience has affected my academic performances and social life, with me being down all the time, and not being able to win science contests due to the fact that I was having a panic attack while participating in it. I also started having nightmares and I have not slept well.

I know that she has been a good mother, but I still can't forget what happened after all these years of pain and suffering. Please help me.

I can welcome any advice saying that I may be wrong, change the persperctive, etc.",12May2020,1

633,"We've been remote for 2 months now. I was initially motivated and productive, but depression/anxiety have been setting in recently and it's affecting my work performance. 

Some of it is due to life events my boss knows about (ex. Death in the family), but the smaller things are also starting to wear me down hard. I live alone and the thought of spending another day working in my bedroom has me crying every morning. Each day is becoming a cycle of building anxiety, trying to get work done, crashing, napping, repeat. Some days I focus on hobbies and stress relievers but it usually results in me caring even less about work.

I'm generally a model employee and my boss knows something's up, but he's not much of a ""people person"" and I think we both feel too awkward to talk about it. I'm also the youngest on my team and the only girl, so I don't want to come across as needy or over-emotional.

634,"Hi there. This may be a long winded post, and I expect to have divided views. I really really need help with making a clear decision.

So I graduated college in 2018, and got a job in the field right away. After 1.5 years, I stopped working in the field (I made a lot of money working this job) and moved “in house” which means I’m no longer working crazy hours but also I’m making about $20K less per year. At the time of accepting a new position, I justified it because I no longer wanted to work in the field (working in the field required me to live out at sea) and wanted a normal schedule. 

Flash forward to the pandemic. I’m living in a very expensive area (I don’t have any other options since this is where my work is) and making a lot less money. My landlord decided to raise my rent during the pandemic, and charge thousands of dollars in illegal fees (I paid them before realizing it was illegal) so now I’m really struggling financially. I can hardly afford groceries, and told my landlord this. They do not care,  told me to move out and said if I move out early I have to pay a minimum of $800 early termination (in times past, I’ve seen them take $1800 from an individual for absolutely no reason at all). 

I need advice on what to do. I can’t return to my previous job in the field, and if I continue working this job then I will be flat broke. I asked my superiors if I can supplement my income on the weekends working another job, and they told me this is a conflict of interest (I work for the government).  I already have other job offers that would allow me to live comfortably as I was before, however it’s manual labor and has nothing to do with my college degree. 

Should I exit my current job that I worked so hard for and work a different job(s)? I feel like I would sacrifice all of my professional development that I’ve worked so hard for the past 2 years by doing this. Should I keep my current job, and do something on the side, even if it is a conflict of interest and just not tell them? If I get caught I would surely be fired. I’m absolutely desperate right now guys please give me some thoughts, ideas, solutions, ANYTHING!!!

I’m not looking for what is morally “right” or “wrong”. I’m simply just looking to be able to afford to live, as I’ve always been financially stable until I moved here and my landlord has been taking advantage of me (and lots of other young people who have moved here and do not know the state laws). Should I just go work a second job regardless of what the government says and be really careful not to get caught? Should I quit and work another job and throw away all of my professional development? 

Thank you so much in advance for any support y’all can provide. Much love.",12May2020,1

&amp;#x200B;

So when me and My current gf started talking. about a month in she went out to a party got drunk.  She then ended up leaving the party with a guy who she previously had liked in the past driving to the beach with her friend and another guy who where hooking up. ( separate cars.) The next day she comes back and I overhear her telling her friend that she ""gave this guy a blowjob and he already has a gf the next day"". Also on a side note she was going through her ig the day before the party or something and I distinctly pointed out the guy just picking with her and she said he was nothing to worry about and he had a girlfriend. This really annoyed me and made me depressed because it felt like we had already been talking for the last month.  (no sexual activities just some flirting and falling asleep otp). . We ended up getting together but this has always been a trust issue to me that she did that while we were in the early stages of a relationship. And ngl we have had fights on the topic.  Ever since the last fight. a couple months after all of this happend. Were in a huge fight primally about trust and this and im explain that i just do not like this and not knowing whats going on because of this long distance bs she tells me that she did not actually do it and that he forced her to. Which I dont think is true because of her already saying that she did it voluntary and she did not even block him on ig until like a week after.  I know a lot of other things could have been in her mind but imo if that happend to me i would not come back the next day brag on it and not block a disgusting person like that so i wouldnt see them.  P.s she also claims to not have liked the guy for over a year but have seen dm's where she is literally praising his feet and claiming things about him to someone that she said was the complete opposite with me.  ( just that hes worked for everything he has all his things are his, But with me it was that hes broke trash and all daddys cars)   I didn't know what to say and am looking for what other people think of this.

642,"So there’s this guy who I used to work with last year , who I was not close to at all and had no interest in pursuing a friendship with outside of work. 
He messaged me about ten times in the year that I left work, just things like how are you, what you up to etc. I didn’t reply for eight months, since our conversations never go anywhere. However after eight months, I replied that I was fine etc, and the conversation always came to a natural dead end. 
I recently went back to work because of covid, since it’s an essential job (I’m a student otherwise), so now I spend four days a week working in close proximity with this person. Last week he told me about his depression and some very personal problems, then told me that I am the only person he has talked to about this sort of stuff. Everyone at work tells me he fancies me. He’s started giving me compliments. 

I don’t know what to do, because he is a genuinely nice guy but I’m not interested. He has learning difficulties and has trouble reading people. I don’t want to lead him on in any way. He’s now messaging me about his depression. I really don’t know how to let him down when he hasn’t made any proper advances and now it’s getting heavy. I’m not the person he needs right now. We are not at all close, or even proper friends.

I know a lot of people would suggest I stop being such a bitch and just be friends with him, but that makes the matter worse. I don’t want to feed any sort of notion that there’s something between us, it seems to me that’d do more harm than good.

I’ve been hearing weird sounds since around last year. It started with this weird tapping sound I would hear every now and again. It is always the same: four quick taps, each sounding like something was hitting glass. It wasn’t so weird at first, as I live in an old house that makes all sorts of weird noises. But then it started happening every day, and at different times everyday. I asked my family about it and only my twin sister can hear it sometimes. But only sometimes.

Thus I’m a very private person and protecting said privacy is important to me. I just like the courtesy of knocking. But my sister turns aggressive even violent about being able to have access to me. And not in a possessive sense but like she’s entitled. (She can be very self-centered). I think she thinks because I’m not very social I should just be available to talk or hang out whenever. Which I don’t think is fair.

I’m not trying to be a bitch or secretive but today, I had my headphones in watch a YT video and didn’t hear her knocking. (This happens quite often). And she almost rattled the door open. I opened it and said why are you knocking like that? She gets offended and tells me I shouldn’t have had my ‘’music up so loud.” I tell her she’s broken my doors twice in the past and I don’t like that. She gets mad and walks away and is giving me the “silent treatment.”

I was very ignorant back when I chose my subjects and decided to take subjects that I believed would be best for my future rather than choosing things that I enjoy. This has been a massive mistake and has led me to feel very helpless and at times, very sad.

So basically I chose to take History, geography and English literature for my A levels and pretty much hate it. Like English is the best of the three, followed by Geography (it’s not like I’m crazy about them but they are bearable.) But I absolutely despise history. I am such an idiot for taking it and am so frustrated at myself for choosing a subject that I have no passion for whatsoever.

In all honesty, I’m not the most academic person and my true passion is in sports and particularly football (soccer for any Americans). I just don’t understand why I didn’t follow what I enjoy and it just feels to late to turn back now. I have no motivation to do any of the work and I know it’s my fault.

652,"I'm a graduate student starting my second year of PhD in a city that's away from home. I obviously feel homesick when I'm there so when the global pandemic ""started"", I flew back home. My supervisors obviously told me they want me around when the labs re-open, but my work can 100% be done remotely and we have no idea of when that will happen. My lab is in a small city with not a lot of cases so they think the lab will re-open this fall semester.

I currently am subletting my apartment with my furniture until the end of my lease (September). The place is really well located, I can't complain about anything except it's stuffy and I get 0 light since I don't have windows. Since it's sorta pricy, I wanted to move out to get a nicer place that's a bit further from school. I have to, by June 1, decide whether or not I will renew the lease and here's where the problem starts:

(1) I don't like that apartment I currently have and want to move;

(2) I want to move only to a nicer place but in a cheaper neighbourhood, otherwise I'll stay there;

(3) No one knows when we'll start going back to work;

(4) Rent is expensive so while I can stay at home (in hometown) I don't want to go back there to work from home anyways;

(5) All of my furniture is in that other city (ALL OF MY STUFF!);

(6) Most leases start in September so if I don't secure a place for September and labs re-open in October or November, I'm stuck with no house;

(7) I found a REAL nice apartment with a nice deal where I will pay exactly the same rent but it's in a cheaper neighbourhood but the lease starts in July...

The safest bet would be to renew my lease with my current apartment, and stay there for a whole other year (in that crusty apartment). BUT I think it's a waste of money if I could have that much nicer place at the same price. Only concern is what if we're working from home for another year and I could stay in the comfort of my parent's house? With no rent to pay?

656,"F20. I stated dating someone two years ago, and I moved in with him M21. Throughout these two years we had some difficulties in the relationship. Not to justify him, but he was never in a relationship before me. He just hung out with girls and that is that. Also, he does not get social cues AT ALL. So yes, there were many arguments at the beginning of the relationship. 

A year and 6 months into the relationship things stated to go south. he got physical, not all the time but in huge arguments. Afterwards he would feel bad and say sorry, but did not really understand that it was wrong, he thought it was normal. Knowing this made me feel terrible. He never showed these sings and is the sweetest person I've met, his family just loves him. Anyway, I always wished for him to realize it, but I one day I just got tired of that. I packed my things and left after talking with his mom on the phone (such a nice lady btw), I told her the situation and it was sad that she related to my story. His parents are no longer together. So putting everything together I realized that he believed that it was normal because that is what he saw at home. All she could tell me was ""get the hell out of there"", and that is what I did. 

He was heart broken, I told him it's what I wanted, love is not hurting someone. He agreed that it was probably the best for now. The last thing he said was that in a month from now he would get in touch with me to see how our mindsets. Have in mind he thought that I was wrong, and that physical abuse in a relationship is normal). So I moved to my dad's. The month past by and he called me. We decided to meet and he was so ashamed of what he did. He apologized and told me how messed up his mindset was. I told him I wanted actions not words. He agreed and we decided to see each other only on the weekends for an undetermined time and that only time would tell. Then the pandemic started, and we were hanging out, his dad was over and he started to feel sick, they went to the hospital and told hi it was a mild case. I called my dad and he told me he did not want me home. That I should stay here for a month, since he cannot risk my sisters health. 

Now, I kinda want to talk about my family just to give some info on why I am having this dilemma now. 

We were an average family of 5, due to health problems we had to move to the USA leaving my mom behind in our home country when I was 16. The reason why I called his mom and told her about out relationship instead of mine; is because I do not want my mom to worry about that, I know I am wrong but I do not want her to feel helpless. And if I was a mother, knowing that my daughter is going through that would hut my soul. 

My dad and I did not have a good relationship when I was a kid. He was so rude to me and always liked making me feel so little. This always created HUUUUGE arguments between my parents because my mom would notice. When I was 16 he apologized, but told me that the reason why he was so mean was that I reminded him of my mom. Fu\*ked up, right? 

Living with my dad was just something else, even though he was not mean to me all the time. He was just never involved in my high school stuff, I was part of the modern band, and I invited him to all my events he would always say ""yeah I'll be there"" but he never showed up, I would go home and he would just be laying on the couch watching TV. I know it sounds stupid and many other kids wouldn't care but it was important to me. 

He also has this sexist way of thinking that I hate so much. My parents are also not together anymore btw. So, that is also another reason why my mom decided a year ago to not continue with their long distance relationship. I am 20 years old, and the time I moved back in I had a curve few of 7pm! He also wanted to check my bank statements whenever, just to see on what I spent my money on? I do not do drugs, nor do I plan to, I am the least person they would expect to.  

Because of his sexist mindset, I cannot tell him why I moved back in with him. I would hate to hear him agree with my boyfriend, and that would just hurt me so much. In the time that I spent at my dad's,we got into a lot of arguments. I once tried telling him a little bit of why I moved back in, and once I said ""we were about to go to bed, and he would not stop arguing and raising his voice, so I asked if he could just leave me alone for a couple of min."" he interrupted me and said ""What are you thinking, you have no right to say that to him, it is HIS HOUSE"" so I was like, well, guess I cannot count on you. 

The problem is not only my dad, but now my brother thinks the same way as him, and we just argue all the time. my brother is 4 years younger, but yet he feels entitled to yell at me, talk with attitude, not only to me, but to my sister which is younger than him, and my grandma. And my dad? he does nothing about it. 

Now that I have spent a month here with my bf because of quarantine, things are going great. He is still in the process of changing and he knows that, no physical fights, no nothing. There has definitely been a change. 

I would like to give my bf some more time to work on himself, and I know that it would probably be better if he did it without me here. But, once I think of all that I will be putting up with at home, I do not know if i should just stay here.",12May2020,1

It’s really bad when I run my heat so I’ve had to turn that off to prevent the spread when I notice her getting home but then my home gets very cold. 

I’ve emailed our apartment complex about it but they’ve basically said “this is how the apartments are connected”. The issue isn’t the air, it’s that she’s smoking so much in her apartment it’s affecting us. The entrance of the apartment building reeks of cigarettes too. 

I’ve looked in the lease and it says nothing of smoking (beside marijuana) in the units. I can’t believe this community would allow smoking in units. They said nothing about if we were moving into a smoking building or not. I just assumed most complexes were smoke free within the buildings.

What can I do?",12May2020,1
659,"My gf's ex recently posted a tiktok video with a very one-sided view of their relationship. Ok, no big deal, I'm sure this happens all the time. There were a number of false statements about her and her family, and he took a bunch of pictures from her dad's fb to make the video. However, the video got like 20K likes so far and he's an attention seeker, so he's making follow ups with even more egregiously false stories. My gf is afraid that everyone is going to see these videos and think she's a horrible person. 

I am not on TikTok so I'm not very familiar with their policies. Is there any way to get him to stop? He never says her name, but is using photos that are not his, but are available on facebook.",12May2020,1

**Scenario and slight rant**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I'm hoping to get some advice as I feel like not only am I at cross roads, but I feel like hitting my head against a brick wall, or shouting as loud as I can.

So for about 2 years now, I've been looking to get into Web Development (from the IT industry, 6 years), I've done training, I've built projects, I've got a portfolio, I've applied for thousands of jobs, gotten about 3 interviews, each one has just said ""You need more commercial experience"", each time I've come out of it, a little bummed, but get back up on my feet. But I just keep hitting the same wall, agents coming back saying ""I'm sorry we have nothing for you"" or ""I'm sorry, you weren't what we wanted at this time""... about half a year ago I decided to move jobs because the job I was in was changing drastically and not for the better, I thought to myself ""It's fine, I won't be in this job for long"",  half a year later, I'm still applying and getting nothing.

Currently I really dislike my job, I'm sitting on the helpdesk and answering phones, that's not what I signed up for, but because the team is quite small, it's what's required of me. The most that I have out of this job is I've decided I absolutely hate working on the helpdesk, especially for quite a few companies, I never know who I'm going to speak to next, at least my previous job was an in house job, I knew the people who were coming to me, I actually miss that job (it's true when they say you never appreciate what you have until you don't have it any more). 

Recently, a close friend of mine has recommended me for a job, but it's within the IT Sector, I said yes, I'm half wanting to go for it because it has interesting things to learn, but I'm half not because 1. It a first line job, again on helpdesk, however it's for a company and technically 'inhouse' though it's quite large, however it's not IT Support as such, however I've spent all this time on Web Development, and I believe that's what I want to do. But considering I hate the job that I'm in, I'm thinking of going to it, who knows, I might actually like it.   


But how I feel right now is sickening... I feel like screaming as loud as I can because of my frustration but I cannot, I have no where to without people asking questions, I'm now even looking at online counselling, but that's hard to find in the UK, at least where I'm looking... 

The most frustrating part of it all, is the amount of effort I have put in to change industries, yet no one is extending their hand, I feel right back when I first started trying to get a job, had the qualifications but not the experience. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm talking as if I'm going to get this job that I've been recommended for... it's not a walk in the park, I have to learn some complex topics to prove I'm worth it, and if I don't get it, I'm still back at square one, to which I think I might start looking at another IT Support job just to keep things fresh.

But surely this isn't the way things should be, despite my negative attitude in this post (which has been building up for quite some time now), I'm actually quite optimistic, have a high work ethic and I strive on learning, I love learning. But trying to put that across on a CV is non existent, because others also have those same words who don't have half as much, so it all just becomes words at the end of the day with no meaning unless they take that chance, and no companies want to take chances...

Play out the rest of this recommendation, find out as much as I can to make an informed decision. 

If I get it, great, I'll learn, however I'll always have web dev at the back of my mind, though I could always continue it in my spare time, despite wanting to do it full time. 

If I don't get it, apply for IT Support jobs, use it to freshen things up and continue to apply for web dev?

I'm not sure if I could stay in this job much longer if given the choice, It's really getting to me, despite it shouldn't. Perhaps this is all in form of something else, but all this energy is being put into this scenario as this is what I can see right now... I mean all I'm doing is picking up the phone, answering emails and fixing issues, I suppose it's the expectation of ""I have a problem, get it fixed...yesterday"" attitude which is increasing, hence why I don't want to be in support for much longer if possible. I would like a more creative role. Like Web Dev or Game Dev.

&amp;#x200B;

The only issue I have is salary, I'm currently the one who brings in the money and pays most of the bills, I can't take much of a cut, though I should be able to afford with my partner on a junior salary if we're careful... it's too much responsibility being the one who brings in the most, you become that rock, if that rock breaks, then it becomes unstable, and currently that rock's emotions are becoming unstable...

\*\*\*Internal chatter: Perhaps I should write a blog, though I think it would be quite a negative blog at the moment...\*\*\*

I'm just typing now... I'm expecting Reddit to reply on my screen whilst I type this to give me this 100% amazing answer... I think I should take Meditation seriously again.

Myself and my peers really haven't taken this well, and as a result a lot of us are failing the quarter. I've had three teachers reach out to my mother because of this and now my mother keeps calling me a failure, a waste of time, a waste of space, and really any other shitty name you could think of. I want to tell my teachers that them reaching out to my parents about my grades makes my situation worse and makes it harder for me to complete my work (because when I get in trouble my parents take everything - I'm literally having to write this on my old computer that my mum doesn't think works,) and that I don't want them to do that anymore. But I feel like they'll just call my mother *again* and I'll get in more trouble... What do I do, and how do I go about this??

663,"I put this in AITA but it was removed for asking for advice, so thought I'd come here instead. Posting this for my (24F) parents. I’m 100% on their side but it would be great to have some other perspectives. It’s a long story, so thanks to anyone who reads it all!

Our garden backs onto another property and the dividing wall is lined with trees, most of which have been there for decades. The tree that’s causing the issue was planted more recently but several years ago. It’s in line with our neighbours’ (A and B) kitchen window and they say it blocks the light. The tree is not tall, a good few metres away from their house and you can clearly see that it doesn’t cast a shadow on the house. Anyway, each summer A (M) would remind my dad to trim it if he hadn’t already, which he always did.

Two years ago A came over and said they wanted it cut down. My dad replied that he’d happily trim it to be even shorter but that we’d rather not cut it down as their house overlooks our garden and this tree gives us more privacy. B (F) then put a radio next to our wall, blasted a random station and left it on all day while we had a BBQ. I went to close the curtains that night and saw B turning off the radio and sticking her middle fingers up at our house. We trimmed the tree and didn’t hear anything else about it for two years.

Cut to two weeks ago when my dad goes to trim the tree as usual and notices that half of it’s gone! They’d cut off six branches that were pointing up (not into their garden) and leaned over the wall to do so. My dad waits a few days so he’s calm, then tells A not to do it again and to speak to us first.

A few days later, B sticks her head over the wall ranting about my dad being “unkind” to A and that A would never cut our tree. B was extremely upset, wailing and saying things like “My light! I’m begging you!” She still denies that A cut the tree until A comes over and admits he did. My mum calmly explained that we had no idea she was this upset as they hadn’t mentioned it for two years, but that we’ll sort it. A brings up another tree that they want cut down (that B had just said they liked), and B starts ranting again and calling my parents unkind neighbours, even though my mum had just said we’d sort it.

We discussed it and my parents said things like “Let’s look at it from their perspective” because they wanted to make sure they hadn’t been unkind. We decided to definitely cut the tree down as it’s causing all this upset and maybe plant something else further away from the wall.

Today they’ve put up paper in their window saying “Your behaviour is selfish, unkind and hypocritical. Fact. Give us back our light.” This has really upset my mum as we’ve said we’ll cut the tree down but they are still being nasty.

My parents are key workers, so are working very hard right now and under a lot of stress. Obviously I’m biased because they’re my parents but they are both truly kind people and I can see how it’s starting to really get to them. I know it’s hard without seeing the tree, but do you think my parents are in the wrong? What would you do?",12May2020,1

My sister and I are super close, and she’s getting married in Mexico late June, it was going to be this coming week actually but because of COVID they had to post pone, no issue there. The issue lies in the fact I need my passport to travel to Mexico obviously, and I had applied and sent in all my work and expedited the process very beginning of March. They shut down their facilities as everybody did when the heat of corona started, as they should have. However, now I went to check their websites because I figured I should’ve had it by now, and the website says if you applied in March it will likely take several months to get your passport, unless it’s a life and death situation. I know the rest of the world doesn’t care about me making it to my sisters wedding, but it means the word to me and her. I’m really not sure what to do, just suck it up and pray it comes in the mail? Their wedding is late June so there is still time and I’m hoping somehow maybe mine is near the top of the list but I feel like I’m just dreaming. Not sure if anybody here has suggestions or ideas to possibly get it or some way at least I can travel to Mexico for a week. I’m desperate.",12May2020,1
667,"So. Me and this guy have been texting and calling daily for a while. We live in two different countries. I’ve been having a lot of fun with him and he’s so nice, I couldn’t help but develop feelings for him. I’ve liked him for a few months now.

He’s quite shy and insecure, and I never got any hints that he could possibly like me back. Being aware of his insecurity, I wasn’t totally hopeless. 
Turns out he actually has a thing for me. I discovered that after I found that he’d made a reddit post about me asking the community for advice. He doesn’t know I’ve read that post and I’m not going to tell him because I know he’d die of embarrassment. 

I’m obviously over the moon knowing that he’s interested in me. In the post he was asking the community whether I’m just being a super good friend or if I’m actually interested in him. I thought I was making it quite obvious that I like him but apparently, that’s not the case. So, how do I make him understand that I like him without explicitly saying that? He’s oblivious to any of my moves. We already tell each other “I love you” every night. We tell each other that we miss each other and that calling is the best part of the day. 

tl;dr: crush is oblivious to any of my moves, though he likes me. how do I make him understand I like him too without explicitly saying that?

676,"I'm a ALA Lishting consultant,  and I've worked in residential and commercial lighting sales for over 7 years. I have always admired electricians.  I've always dreamed of working with my hands to build and I love creative problem solving. My great-grandfather and gradfather were engineers and badasses. Eventually,  I'd like to own my own business, where I help the home owners pick out fixtures and switches, then I can be the one to install.  

Over my career in lighting, I've spoken to several electricians about the aspects of the job I may not like. Mainly, they listed that home owners are difficult  (I enjoy working with them very much, and I get along with people easily- retail for 7+ years), they also mentioned crawling into crawl spaces,  covered in dirt and spider webs. I present myself like a professional, but really,  I like ""Charlie work"". I am the grub worm. I debase myself with dirty jobs a lot, I just put it to the back or my mind, I don't mind gross jobs. 

The only thing holding me back was that I was making 40k + in retail,  and I wasn't in a place financially to step down and train as an apprentice.  In the last two years, I quit my lighting job when I was promised selling insurance ""making guaranteed 75k+"". Stupid and naive, I quit my well-paying job with ppl I really enjoyed. The insurance job was a scam, and its left me bouncing between jobs for the past two years. I was laid off due to COVID, and it got me looking into training provided by the government.  

All I want to do is residential, but all the apprenticeships are for commercial electricians. And it looks like I would mostly be lugging conduit and digging ditches, which I am willing to do,  but I don't think I'm what their looking for and vice versa. I know the $ is in commercial, but that's not where my passion is. How do I get started? There aren't ANY.schools near me. The closest would be to get an engineering degree from a community College 1.5 hours away. Ive done so much research,  the more I learn,  the more confused I get! The engineering degree classes don't teach anything about electrical work! 

My problems-
How can I get started specifically so I get training in a residential environment? Do I need school first? Or just find an apprenticeship?  Apprenticeships have to be approved and it doesn't seem like any residential apprenticeships exist? 

Any insight is greatly appreciated.

In March, I paid for a big surgery to repair a torn ACL in his leg and he was really on the upswing. Then, he was very lethargic and doctors discovered he was bleeding internally and recommended he be put down. I experienced the suddenness of a pet's death before, even with regular vet treatments 7 years ago, with the deaths of my first two pets... who were also from internal bleeding. 

It was very hard for the first few days. When I was alone at night, it would smack me. Then I came back to work after quarantine and my boss asked how I'm doing. The simple question made me choke up. Then I was talking to another co-worker and choked up. 

But in the past 5-6 days, I feel myself letting go and it makes me feel guilty. I feel as if I should be sad all the time. If I really stop to think about my dog, I can sort of ""summon"" that sadness, but not as much as the first few days. I feel worst when I'm going about my day, or I wake up and he isn't the first thought on my mind. He gave us 10 flawless years of his life.

I know I miss him, just like I miss the dogs we put down 7 years ago in old age. I know grief molds, and is a current that pushes in and out. I just loved him so much and feel like, even if he wouldn't want me to be sad, I owe it to his memory to be miserable right now.

When I moved in the landlord said a cleaning woman came every 2 weeks and it was included in the rent. I’ve lived here about a year and a half and I’ve definitely gotten the impression that the cleaning woman is mostly here to check on the apartment and report back to the landlord which is annoying but not a huge deal. 

Except now we find ourselves in a global pandemic and in my state residential cleaners are not considered Essential Workers so they shouldn’t even be working at all. Even if they were I feel like I should have a say in who comes into my home during a pandemic. (They haven’t been in since the first week of March.) My landlord, who is out of state, disagrees. She texted me to tell me that the cleaning woman needed (?) to get into my apartment this Thursday and would be coming every 2 weeks. 

My apartment is generally clean. I’ve always felt a little awkward about the cleaners and usually clean before they come to the point where sometimes I can’t even tell if they came or not until I check the Furbo.

I’m not sure what to do. I’ve been taking social distancing seriously and haven’t been able to see my friends and family. I don’t feel it’s right to put my health at risk by allowing someone into my home without knowing what other homes she has been in or what her social distancing practices are. I’ve heard them in the apartment upstairs in the last few weeks and it sounds like 2-3 people.

At the same time, I don’t have a lease and am month to month. This is obviously critically important to my landlord for whatever reason and I would hate to have to find a new place to live at this time or even once this is all over. 

What should I do?",12May2020,1
688,"I didn’t mean to start the argument. It wasn’t my intention. He wasn’t texting me all day. Just very few little texts. I recently had a tonsillectomy and I’m on day five and it’s been absolutely awful. So most of my days are relaxing and not having much to do. He asked how I was feeling that morning and would only text me every few hours. I know he’s not busy. He’s only working every five days and on the second five days he has a duty shift that’s from 7am to 2pm the next day. But other than that, he’s at home doing absolutely nothing. He’ll go out to take his dog out or maybe walk along the beach or go to 7/11 for Mountain Dew and snacks. Yesterday he went to Verizon and I was curious as to why. Not trying to pry or anything, just as his girlfriend I was curious. It took almost three questions just for him to say that he was looking  at a new phone to switch to. Apparently now if I’m curious as to what he’s doing all day it’s “weird” and “why” do I wanna know so bad. I figured that it wouldn’t be weird to ask what he’s been up to. He used to tell me everything but it’s been hard the last month since we’re long distance. And while waiting for him to reply I went through old messenger messages since we chat in both. We primarily use messenger for memes. I sent him two memes yesterday and no reply. So I sent them again, and he questioned why. I told him that he didn’t react to them. I know, it sounds silly. But I told him that I just missed how we would always send each other stuff every day. Now it’s maybe once or twice a week. After a little argument he said he stopped sending lots of memes because apparently I don’t send enough and always react to his. I know he sends stuff to other people all the time and I thought being his gf I’d have a little more attention than other girls or friends that he sends them to. But then we started getting into an argument more about him sending less. So I said never mind and he wanted to discuss it. I kept saying never mind because he’s the type of person to not put my feelings into consideration. I kept saying also, “all I’m saying is that I miss that(the sending of memes)” but he kept justifying that he doesn’t want to keep that same energy anymore because I wouldn’t send as many(he is constantly on Facebook and it’s the first thing he looks at in the morning. Most mornings he won’t text me or text me back until he’s on Facebook for a while.) so I told him that he sees more memes and I don’t. This just all sounded like such a stupid argument so I kept saying never mind. Then I felt I needed to apologize. I have been kinda cranky because I’ve barely been eating and yesterday I cried almost everytime I took a sip. So I apologized saying that maybe this whole thing just exaggerated in my head because of my mood. And he says “yea I guess” He doesn’t believe any of my apologies. I’m trying. Trying so hard to apologize when I know I’ve been in a bad mood and started an argument. He also says that I enjoy to argue and that I have a sick fascination with it. That hurt me. Arguing with him makes me sad and most times I end up crying because it drains me emotionally. Then we started arguing through text. It got pretty nasty on his part. Towards the end he started saying that maybe he should he who he used to be. Going back to drinking heavily because it made him “happy” and that means no arguing with me so because of that I’ll be happy. I told him that’s not how it works and he kept insisting that yeah his old self of self destruction, going to work drunk and not caring will be better for my sake. Also calling me a victim during this argument. The last texts from him I asked him why he can’t love himself and he said “I don’t like talking about that. Don’t push this conversation. Don’t ever push this conversation. That topic is for me and me alone. Don’t ever question me on that. I have my reasons. And they are my own. I don’t like people questioning me that. There are so many barriers with that. Don’t. Ever. Ask. Me. That.” I said goodnight then and he said ok. That’s been the end of that conversation and we haven’t spoken since that last night. What do I do in this situation? I’m completely at a loss.",12May2020,1
689,"If this doesn’t belong here please just kindly let me know. 

TL;DR - I went to university at 18 because my mother had a break down and pushed schooling and my degree on me because of engineering is family history. Now I’m 26 and just now realizing I should’ve been living for myself? What are the next steps to living a life that I truly love to my core?

Hey all!

Hope everyone is well during quarantine. I tend to delve far too deeply into extremely simple questions, however, I was discussing life with a best friend of mine. This made me want to ask reddit...

Around 18.... 2012, senior in high school, when my mother asks me what I want to do. Yep this is later than some but still she asked. After months of discussion I began the process of enlisting into the Air Force. Around the same time I was introduced to lady ganja... so you can already see how my mindset will become skewed in the future.

Very very very long story short: my mother had a breakdown about me leaving for basic and the deployment... this made her push college on me. Obviously I considered it and sounded much more appealing to my current life so I dived into a civil engineering degree. Looking back at her demeanor now she was definitely manipulating me 100% my issues is I’m realizing holy shit for nearly 5-6 years I wasn’t self aware?? I did everything to appease my mother and parents?? Is this normal? 

And now I’m 26 having work in my field (civil engineering), even having gigs in the quality engineering field within manufacturing, and realizing wtf have I been doing? I don’t enjoy this nonsense. Now I know old fashioned people are WORK WORK WORK and then SAVE SAVE SAVE. Nope sorry our generation  is different. I want to save only to see the world and do something I enjoy. Hell I’d enjoy being a lawyer or a doctor more than this shit. And trust me I’m not just stating that without any basis of evidence.

Anyways, guys, thanks for reading my rant. I love you all.",12May2020,1
690,"(We’re both around 14-15) 
This is also very long and gets a bit deep (trigger warnings) 

Know whether this is actually a problem but I have only very recently added her back because I was hoping that we could be maybe civil awful like that but maybe she’s changed I don’t know

Like maybe like a year ago she added saw my Instagram post and said I look nice, I just thanked her and we talked for a bit I thought she was pretty nice so when she asked for my snap as friends I was okay with it but then shit got weird. Next day I snapped her but just asking you basics, she only replied with “what are your kinks?” 
I was a bit taken shocked, by this point you would thought I would have thought something a bit weird was going on, nope I carried on thinking this is was normal.

(Some of you might say that it is normal because we are both teenagers and it’s normal to have a bit of fun or whatever but it was very forward)

I told her that I didn’t feel comfortable telling her, she moved onto telling me her kinks, at this point I’m uncomfortable, I probably should have just addressed the situation.

Next thing she does is send me a picture in her underwear and I’m feeling very uncomfortable.
So I tell her,
 “Sorry I don’t feel comfortable doing this,” 
She gets really defensive saying that she had the confidence to show me her body I should do the same. 

I tell her to stop asking me for nudes because I’m uncomfortable and straight, for whatever reason she doesn’t like straight people when I tell her she puts these emoji alongside something very similar to this: ew you’re straight 🤢🤮

I mean yes it might be a bit frustrating that I’m straight but there’s no need to do that.

Anyway, I ignored her for a month or two which wasn’t the nicest thing to do but some things happened at my home and yeah, I went back to her thinking she could have changed in the span of 2 months but boy was I wrong.

I received a message from her saying “aw straight girl ignoring me now after finding out I’m Bi,” 
Not the reason, In the span of the same 2 months things changed in my life, long story short became more insecure and had suicidal thoughts nothing too serious, I messaged her back just saying I’ve been busy with appointments and personal matters, me being too trusting I tell her what’s been going on and that. 

After I tell her that I was taken to a couple of therapists and all that she just messaged me “kill yourself you deserve it.” 
I was confused, questioning what have I ever done to her and she carried on saying that I should have slit my wrists more, thankfully a really good friend of mine helped me stand up to her as well as block her, she left me alone for good 6 months, then very recently I added her back still being stupidly naive and too trusting.

Yet again she was a nicer person then things got weird again, 
I messaged her a quick “hello, how are you” sort of thing just out of politeness, she replied with “I knew you’d come crawling back to me,” 
I tried to put her down gently not wanting things to get out of hand so I just  said that I was hoping that we could be civil and just be friends but instead she’s started to push me again for nudes when I told her no, she told me and I quote 

“You deserve to be punished, for being horrible to me when I’ve only been nice.” 

I know I should block her but what can I do, because I know a couple of other girls she’s tried this shit on I don’t want her to continue this with others that don’t deserve it.

It’s kind of gotten a little near traumatizing for him. They don’t just do this once every two hours, they do this all day and night. He didn’t tell the landlord about this at first and when he did(without video) they told the landlord he was hearing things. Now it’s gotten a little far and he’s wondering what steps to take with the following in mind: 

-there’s suddenly high water/electric bills these guys blame on him
-This is mere suspicion but worth noting here: they keep ripping paper in the morning which he could only assume are his letters(he never saw a letter for 2-3 weeks...)
-these are relatives of the landlords father in law

I was supposed to go back to school on the 15th coming up to move out of my apartment. Recently my mom decided to take it upon herself to call my landlord and get her to no longer require me to come so soon to move out. I wanted to still go to my apartment to hang out, grab some stuff, and be with my girlfriend for a bit. Now I should say that my house with my parents in located in a area close to New York so the risk is high around home and the number of cases are booming. The town which my apartment is in is in a county that has 28 cases which is about .001% of the population. My parents originally said I could go to my apartment and do what I want but when I come back home I have to quarantine in my basement for two weeks. Now, one day before I am supposed to go they are telling me they really would prefer I don’t go. They are not distinctly saying I cannot go but they are certainly trying to make me feel bad and guilty so that I do not end up going. A part of me now feels bad that I’m thinking of going but another part of me doesn’t feel bad at all considering that it’s a larger risk to go around to grocery stores near my home then to go to my apartment which is in the middle of no where.

Talking to them about it is not an option, nor is talking to the boss above them (I have tried this before and was told that I was causing trouble).

I never get this problem when working on other projects with other bosses. This boss is well known in the company for being a nasty piece of work and generally incompetent.

Is tmj causing changes in my face ? Or am I overthinking

I’m 21. So for some reason mainly this year the past few months I keep thinking my face has changed. I do have tmj and clench when I’m in angry or when I’m stressed also have Bruxism and tmd. Sometimes in my sleep. I think this is a long time thing but worse at certain times.
Lately I feel like my face looks weird. My chin looks bulgy and longer ? 

I have an ovalish face shape! It’s not long long but I feel like it’s getting longer.
I’m getting braces soon! I don’t have a severe underbite but my chin does protrude very mood like it’s more my bottom lip. 

Recently though I feel like I look puffy ! I’m not sure if that’s a bit of weight gain. I’m a skinny person but I feel like what if it’s not face fat but my jaw changing! 
But
My boyfriend saw me after 2 months today and thinks I look exactly the same except for getting more fuller cheeks! He actually said my face looks shorter and the fuller cheeks look nice! My mum said the same thing. She said I looked more healthier! Which is weird I’ve done nothing but sleep all day cause I’ve been so depressed lol. 

Even my friend who I saw after months says she saw no difference !! 
But I don’t see it!! At the same time I don’t know if I’m just tripping. I have bad bdd! I did lost weight last year and was trying to get my face fat back ! I think it’s back but part of me feels like I look bad or the fat is different ? Another part of me thinks I’m getting a square face. 

When I open my mouth I see my massester muscles clearly!! and it looks so bad! I have figured out ways to not grind in my sleep! But I’m scared I damaged my face and it’s already changing! 
What if it’s changing and no one can see it yet. For now it’s giving a “fuller cheeks” illusion but it’s actually something else!!!

Also feel like my lazy eye is getting noticeable !!!
2 weeks ago I felt fine and thought I looked actually normal but it’s started again!! 
I keep taking photos and analysing it! 
My boyfriend sees no difference and says its my 
Anxiety and bdd playing! And the tensed jaw muscles are making me think it’s growing when it’s not !!!
I feel like I look sad when I have a serious face like I look stoned !!! 

I still have a slim face but I’m scared it’s getting puffy looking! 

Right now my jaw feel a bit stiff and now feels like it’s placing itself forward!!! Idk if it’s my anxiety !! 
I’m so scared to eat foods, sleep!! I’ve been avoiding trying to dress up or even wear make up as I feel like it doesn’t suit me anymore cause my face !!!


If I do have these changes can u reverse them ???
Is it permanent?

I’m so scared 
I also have 2 impacted low wisdom teeth I’m getting out soon as well as getting braces!!! 

I’m worried That I’ll need jaw Surgery!!! 
I suffer from bdd and I went from analysing my face shape to then looking at my chin to see what bad change I have! 

My boyfriend is usually able to reassure me but this time I feel so confused!! He says I look the same and he sees no difference or bad change at all!! My mum doesn’t either !

Today my eyes also looked a bit out of place! My right eye (which used to be my good eye) is now going upwards ? But in a more odd way like it’s out of place ! My left eye (least fav side) looks more normal than my right !!!


My bottom tooth seems have also moved forward as it’s touching my top tooth badly !!!

It's not horrible, but my problem is that whenever I spend any amount of time with my family, I always inevitably get sucked into political ""arguments"" my family insists on having.

I use quotation marks, because these discussions aren't really arguments - they are just essentially my Dad and My Brother expressing their views on a given subject, not really listening to what anyone else has to say. My Dad and/or Brother will interrupt and dismiss me before I even finish a sentence and allow me to make my point, which then causes me to get frustrated at them, and then our conversations escalate.

My only options are either sitting out of the conversation and not participating for 20 minutes while they talk about whatever, or me trying to participate in the discussion, but always getting interrupted, talked over, dismissed, not listened to, or questioned to the point where I can't actually talk and express myself clearly..

Also, I want to be clear that this kind of shit happens even when we're not talking politics. It doesn't matter. If we have a disagreement, my Brother and my Dad are so prideful they will never admit they're wrong. They just dismiss me constantly. I don't fucking know how to navigate this at all.

What's worse, is because neither of them see a problem, when I do try to bring up the subject of ""hey I don't appreciate this..."" or ""I feel that we don't discuss things healthy..."" or whatever, again I never actually get to make my cases because again, whenever I express disagreement or contrary opinion to either of these two I of course never actually get to make my position made clearly and digested.

703,"As in the subject line, I am searching for reasons to like women, but I can’t find any. I’m only seventeen years old, so I don’t have a surplus of experience with females, so I won’t pretend to. I fully acknowledge that my viewpoint is highly subjective and may be entirely based on circumstance and a majority of bad experiences. This will be a long post, outlining my experience with women. Please tell me why I’m wrong in the comments, because I try hard to appreciate every person on this planet. From a young age, my alcoholic mother cheated on my father and won joint custody because she falsely accused him of assault. Having lived in the house for the duration of their marriage, although young, I know that my father did not do such, and I also know that my mother pushed him down the stairs on multiple occasions, screamed at him for nearly no reason, and attacked him constantly. I watched my mother threaten to, and attempt suicide by trying to slit her wrist with broken pottery she threw in a fit of rage. It’s worth mentioning that my mother is mentally ill, having had an abusive mother and suffering from borderline personality disorder. After the long divorce, my mother kept all of my toys because, despite my father having joint custody, she repeatedly threatened to steal me and move away. She was never physically abusive with me, but I was afraid to be around her, and part of me hated her for trying to force my stepfather into a father figure position in my life. My father said that my mother loves me “the best that she can” despite her mental illness, but I never got real love from my mother. I only ever got things, because she remarried rich. It never meant much because she’s the kind of mother to fuck off to Bar Louie to complain to other alcoholic mothers about their kids and exclaim minion meme bs like “there’s really only 2 cups in a bottle”. It’s the same to this day. To a lesser degree, this is how married mothers in my area act. They’re just miserable, unsatisfied, alcoholics. Nonetheless, alcoholics that glamorize alcohol and stress and can’t enjoy themselves at any social occasion without drinking wine and being blasted drunk, aimlessly criticizing their sober husband while relying on them to hold their hair up when they puke out their mistakes later that night. Moving on from that, I was teased by females since preschool, where they made fun of my high pitched voice and said some of the stupidest stuff I’ve ever heard like pointing at my drawing of a spiral galaxy and telling me “only stupid boys think that exists”. After the divorce, I ate my problems away, so I was physically and verbally bullied by females about how fat I was. This persisted into high school until i became an anorexic. I’m now 109 lbs and 5 ‘7. I personally struggle to communicate with females, partly because I’m afraid of them. If I tell a joke in a group setting, all of the guys will laugh. There’s always one person, almost always a female, who makes a remark that essentially explains the joke in an attempt to piggyback off of the social success of my comment. I don’t have many friends, but I can’t make any because they’re always in cliques, and attention is always diverted to the piggybacker because everybody is trying to get laid. Yes, I understand the crowd response is the guys problem. That is one thing that leads to me finding that most women just aren’t funny. In my experience, they’re slow to catch on. If they aren’t, they use “comedy” as an outlet to covertly complain about something, or make some remarkable simple joke that boils down to “vagina funny”. I hate to sound patronizing, but I get it, your life is a shitshow because of some small inconvenience that happened to you 2 weeks ago and sex does indeed exist. Another thing I don’t understand is why females are extremely vocal about every minor inconvenience. They’re so dramatic. With the exception of this and another reddit post where I asked for help, I don’t complain about contemplating suicide every other day or having such a negative body image that I don’t eat. Women, on the other hand, will ball up in the corner of a classroom before class because their best friend wasn’t at the cafeteria for lunch that day. I have trouble relating to their first world problems like missing their friend during a lunch day, when I get relentlessly bullied or treated as if I don’t exist. Case in point, I haven’t been to a single social gathering for all of high school or middle school, despite how nice I try to be or however many times I try to be another person that people might like. My image of females isn’t improving when I’ve been yelled at three times for holding the door open for women, or the fact that half of this app wants to rid of Father’s Day because they think all men are their douchey exes they’ll complain about for the rest of their lives. Another thing I’ve noticed is that women often aren’t politically informed, but always have something political or mean to generalize and say. My English teacher called me a racist in the middle of class for rolling my eyes when she corrected my saying “black history month” to “African American history month”. At least 90 percent of ever woman I’ve met won’t stop spouting mantras like “girl power” or “we birthed everyone around you”. I’m left thinking “I get it. You have a biological function. Can you talk about anything else?”. I, of course, can’t say it and risk being expelled because a woman doesn’t like me and all she has to do is scream rape, which has happened to some of my classmates. Modern women seem to relentlessly complain, brag about what they’re entitled to, put down men, insult whoever they want to, and cherry pick what they want from modernity in their desired pseudo equality. I have almost never had a woman tell me “good morning” l, wish me luck, or compliment me in any way. Men bend over backwards for women, and all they do is complain. Maybe I’ve just had bad experiences, but if all women are like this, I’m never getting married. I don’t wanna try to like them anymore.",12May2020,1

711,"There seems to be a habitual problem where I build up healthy habits, but then stop the moment I go back to visit my family. When I finally return it can take weeks to get back into my routine. 

It's things like my sleep, working out &amp; general activity level, skincare, etc. 

I want to clarify that it isn't through any sabotage or influence from my family. I'm very close to them and although they're not super active individuals they're all supportive. It's just like the mindset I get when I'm back in my childhood home combined with the stress of travel.

It's a 6+ hour drive to see them, so I only visit when I have a decent chunk of time (i.e. long weekend to a week), though I try to visit every couple months at least.

Does anyone else experience this and/or have tips to manage it (aside from not going home)? I hate feeling like I'm constantly starting over, it's so disheartening.",12May2020,1

He was seeing multiple women when he got my mom pregnant. Recently after having some doctor appointments I began considering reaching out to him strictly to get information regarding medical history for his side of the family. When going to the doctors and they ask about family history I only have my maternal family history. I have no interest in having a relationship with him or his family considering they have not tried to contact me for 24 (almost 25) years. I would just like to know if there is anything important medical wise I should be aware of. I know his name and I have his last known address and would probably send a letter.

727,"I don’t know how to handle this or what to do about it. 
My parents abused me since birth until I ran away at 18 to another country in order to get away from them. 
We are no contact, though they’ve pulled multiple stunts I.e. harassing me via snail mail/online, threatening me and anyone in my life, threatening to sue me if I come out publicly about them, and even threatening  to physically harm me/take me while showing up to this country looking for me. 
Needless to say, I really don’t care much for them after all they’ve put me through. 

I’m still in contact with my godfather, who is my mom’s brother. I’m very close to him and talk to him over the phone at least once a week.  He always mentions how much my mom cries over me and how much she “loves” me. 
I try to give him some leeway when he says this, as that is his little sister and my mom is severely mentally ill from being abused by my father, not that it’s an excuse for her to abuse people herself. 

However, the last time he spoke to my father who was the most aggressive out of them, my father went on a rant threatening him (long story) but then said he’d call him when he “wants updates” on me. He never called. 

Until yesterday, he got mad asking why my godfather never called HIM. Long story short, he APPARENTLY was “much calmer” and was telling my godfather to tell me that he loves me. I’ve never heard my dad even say he loved me (or at least not in a weird way)... my godfather kept telling me again how much my mom cries and now how much my dad says he loves me, although he does admit he doesn’t understand my dad’s “love” or motives. He also keeps insinuating a future where I speak to them again and always tries to guilt me by saying my mom could die one day and I might feel bad. Plus, my mom works in a hospital and has a severely compromised immune system, so she’s pretty at risk with this pandemic and he seems to always remind me of that. 

He keeps saying he’s not trying to convince me to give them another chance and he’s never actually directly told me to. But his wording really makes me feel bad. 
I genuinely want nothing to do with them and I always tell him that, but he doesn’t get it. I am naturally a very compassionate person, so I think he mistakes me saying stuff like “I hope my mom is not gonna get sick from working “ as me wanting to let my mom back into my life. 

He told me my dad wants more updates about me and “how well” I’m doing and now my mom wants him to call her for “updates”. He really put me on the spot asking if I would be okay with it. 

Yeah, it wouldn’t involve me talking to either of them and a part of me is petty; happy with the idea they’ll realise how much better off I am, but I feel uncomfortable them even knowing how well I’m doing.. but why? 

I don’t have the heart to say any of this to my godfather because I don’t want to upset him. 

He says they’re my parents and they should know how well I’m doing, but I don’t see them as my parents. They’re my abusers, plain and simple. But is it really harmful to just swallow my pride and let him do this?

729,"I (23F) currently live with my husband and his family (his mom, two younger brothers, and a foster brother) in Birmingham.

In the beginning of the U.K. Covid-19 lockdown everyone in the household was following the rules and we’d only leave for essential shopping and to drop off essential shopping at our grandparents doorsteps. However now I feel like my husband and his family are ignoring these rules but I don’t know what I can do about it. 

My 16yr old BIL just went to London for a few days to visit his dad - his dad drove him back home and came inside too to eat with us. My 16yr old foster BIL goes out EVERY DAY to meet in large gatherings with his friends. My MIL has invited relatives over from Manchester and also wants to move her mom into the house because she’s sick (maybe dying). And now my husband (who has a mini home gym) has said he’s invited his friend (who has previously had coronavirus symptoms, works with sewage, and has had other people in his household be sick with corona) over to work out together.

I’m scared for my own health because I have an immune disease, asthma,
and my lungs do not function at full capacity. If i get sick I won’t be able to do my grandad’s (90 years old and can’t leave the house) and my auntie’s (my grandads carer so also can’t leave the house and has bad lungs too) shopping and delivering their prescriptions to them etc which is my main worry because there is no one else that can do it. 

This isn’t my house and I don’t pay rent so I feel like I can’t say anything to my in laws.

734,"Never posted before so here goes, but before I explain my situation, I want serious responses not shaming me for the situation, to give me a practical solution, not mocking me for my struggle. I am an adult and struggling with pornography addiction and have locked down or prohibited all sources of porn except for one. It is the web browser on my ps4. I would really like to play video games online with my friends, but the situation is complicated. My birthday reflected on my psn account shows I am an adult, this will come into play later. It would be nice to be able to disable the web browser but I am not able to. I have a family management account setup where another family member is the family manager, and to disable the web browser for another member of the family, that member has to be labeled a 'child,' but according to playstation, for a psn account to be considered a child, they must be under 18 years old. I am not and my birthdate on my psn account reflects this and sony does not allow you to change the birthdate. So, this is the dilemma. There seems to be no way for me to disable the web browser on the ps4 and have a playstation account and a psn subscription to fully access all other features on the ps4 except the web browser. It seems like there should be a simple solution to this but sony does not make it easy. I have also tried the trend micro web filter for the browser but this is not very comprehensive, meaning it is easy to bypass. it is also subscription based so I would be paying $20 a year which I would be ok with, but its not even that useful, so why waste my money on something that doesnt work very well. The other methods to doing this would be to initilize my ps4 and delete my playstation account, create a new one and deliberately make my birthdate under 18. while setting up a family manager on the ps4 first and then I would be able to have the web browser disabled. But this would mean I would have to readd my friends lose all my online progress, possibly lose my games which i have bought digitally, this is a huge loss just because sony makes this difficult and not an option I want to take. Or if someone could just hack my ps4 and disable the browser in the code, idk. the other option is that I dont have a ps4 or use it which really sucks when you spend that money on it. So this is my plight, any information, feedback or advice would be extremely appreciated, especially from those who are tech savvy. Thanks.

735,"I after another night where I couldn’t fall asleep, my mom bought me a “good night tea“. I drink it daily for about a week and it is really making me drossy and all, but was still sometimes having issues getting my mind to rest + had some nightmares/woke up to a panic attack. My mom told me that this tea was all natural, because I didn’t want to get sleeping pills. Also, getting out of bed got harder after I started drinking the tea. 
Today, I looked at the package of the tea and there was one thing grabbing my attention:
Melatonin 
Now, I have not heard much about this substance, but I knew that this is some kind of hormone your body produces in the evening(pls, correct me if I’m wrong)
So I was basically drinking a tea with stuff to make me sleepy. I did some brief research and found out, that my bad dreams are most likely because of the tea being too strong, so I am only drinking half of it this time. I don’t remember the dosage it said anymore, but I think that I generally need less of such substances to notice an effect(This is the reason why I don’t even drink more than a cup of coffee in a month. The amount other people need is usually too much for me a d this coffee is just making my hyperactive) 
Here comes the thing, that I don’t understand about myself:
I know that things like caffeine and alcohol are technically drugs and whenever I take/took them, I feel dirty (I can’t really explain it but the fact, that I am taking these makes me feel like shit). So I don‘t drink any alcohol(bot even in chocolates) and I rarely drink coffee. 
For some reason, drinking the tea makes me feel the same. It must sound irrational to you, but that’s just what I am feeling. According to my research, Melatonin is completely natural and our bodies are used to processing it and you can’t get addicted to it, unlike some other sleeping aids. 

How can I stop feeling like a junky for taking Melatonin/why do I feel like this?

This happened several months ago and I just can’t seem to move past this and would really appreciate some advice on how to forgive and put this behind me. 

I’ve been overweight my whole life and was always pretty self conscious about my appearance. Last year I made the decision to make some life changes and become healthier. I’ve lost over 40 pounds and for the first time in my life I’m at a healthy weight and happy. 

It all started around Christmas time when my mother in law bought me a vest for Christmas. She bought me a size small and made me try it on in front of everyone. I was still losing weight at this time and the vest was a little snug, my mother in law made a big deal about it being too tight in front of everyone and said she would get a bigger size. I told her I would like to keep this vest since I’m still losing weight. She gave me a dirty look and grabbed the vest from my hands so she could get me the bigger size. 

A few months later I heard her talking to my husband on the phone and she said that I would look terrible if I lost anymore weight and then asked him “don’t you think she’ll look terrible?” He told her no and hung up. Before I started to lose weight I would say we had a pretty good relationship. Now, I just feel like there’s a lot of strain and tension. My husband told her that I heard what she said and I was upset by it. I didn’t get much of an apology all she said was that I should know she would never mean anything like that.

I currently work in the healthcare field answering phones all day. It’s at a good company with great benefits, and decent pay, but it’s slowly killing me.

Right out of high school I was unsure on what I wanted to do with my life so I went to a vocational school for healthcare. From there I’ve worked in numerous doctors offices doings clinical and administrative duties. Each job made me very unhappy and I kept leaving and searching for a better job. 

I thought maybe healthcare wasn’t right for me so I got a job in a different field and hated it SO much more. I returned to healthcare since it’s what I have so much experience in. 

Since then I’m still so unhappy and dread work every single day. I can’t stand being stuck in an office all day, doing work that makes me miserable just to take home a paycheck that barely pays my bills. 

I’ve tried to think about what I’d want as a dream job, what inspires me and would make me want to come to work everyday. I have nothing. I just don’t enjoy working. Thinking about having to do this for 30 more years makes me not want to live anymore. 

Does anyone else feel this way? Does anyone have a job they actually like and pays well?

749,"So, some backstory.   


I'm a 15 year old male who has been diagnosed with depression. My dog, a Belgian Shepherd cross, has a history of this sort of behaviour.   


Six months ago, she bit a pregnant woman while at the beach. The family luckily didn't want to press charges and get her destroyed but due to the law here in Wales, South Wales Police issued my mother with a criminal record for assault.  


Three months ago she attacked another dog while in the park. Luckily, she was muzzled due to the previous incident, so no harm came of it.   


Two months ago she turned on me while I was walking her and bit my left leg. This is rare, and she only ever does it when scared.  


A month ago she attacked another dog while in the park. Same story as before.  


Earlier today, she was sitting in the garden when my 15 year old long-haired fluffball called Bear went out from the house to the garden. Usually the cats and the dog are kept separate, with the dog in the main part of the house and the cats in the kitchen but in order to access the back garden you must go through the kitchen. That part went fine, but when Bear decided she wanted to go outside my dog saw her crossing the fire escape and went straight for her as soon as she could. Due to work going on next door Bear couldn't escape over the wall like she would otherwise have done.   


The dog grabbed the cat's neck between her jaws and shook her like a ragdoll. Bear was killed instantly from a snapped neck. We buried her, and due to laws in the UK that prevent aggressive animals from being passed from one family to another without first going through a charity like the RSPCA or PDSA, and due to the fact that those charities will not touch a dog that has attacked a human, we had no choice but to have the dog euthanised.   


At the moment I am holding the emotions at bay, but I won't be able to do that for much longer. How do I deal with the loss of my cat and my dog, and what should I do to prevent a relapse into depression?",12May2020,1

My dad screamed at me and then hit me. I get called a liar because of my bad memory, because I forget lots of stuff and my story “changes.

I have really bad anxiety and everybody believes that I can do everything on my own. But I cant. My friends are leaving me but at this point I dont care. The lower my friend count gets, the lower the amount of people care about me. The lower amount of people that care about me...well I guess less people would miss me if I just disappeared one day.

 I have so many other problems but in the end I don't matter. My problems are so small and pointless, and same goes for me. The idea of ending it pops up more frequently, every time I get hit or screamed at. My self esteem is dwindling and so is my ”happiness.” I haven’t told anybody, and when I do my problems, and feelings get pushed aside. I’m trying to help others but I cant even help myself. I’ve gotten almost used to it. I can’t help myself at all, and neither can anybody I know.

 My best friend hasn’t helped me at all, but its not her fault. Im just a burden. Im just a person who has become to anxious to tell anybody, it makes my heart feel like like its being twisted and crushed. And I don't really have anybody to turn to. I even tried to tell my one friend but she just laughed and said that I wasnt deppressed. It felt like a brick hit me in the chest. After pretending for so long I’ve made different impreesions on eveybody. The “happy“ girl that no matter what happens, she can make a joke! But thats not me. My best friend is getting mad at me  For not being “who I used to be” and telling me that she can get over it so I should to, and it seems like shes shaming me for not being able to move on. And now I guess I cant get myself to tell anybody, because theres nobody to tell.  
I’m pointless. And I kinda wanna end it.",12May2020,1
752,"Yesterday a young man in my senior class died in a car accident. I had one class with him this year, for only one quarter. I had classes with him freshman year, too.

We weren't friends, and I barely said anything to him this year. I know I talked to him sometimes in class freshman year but I hardly remember that.

Anyway, his death feels so weird. It's so unfair - we're graduating soon. It isn't fair to his family and friends. I feel sad, but I barely knew him at all. I don't know if this is grief, and I don't know why I'd be grieving. I don't know how to feel, I don't understand why this is affecting me, and I don't know how to feel better. It feels selfish for me to feel bad.

754,"I’m 17M, live w my grandparents 

I’ve been vegetarian for the past 9 months, partly because of health benefits but mostly because of animal rights... (it’s not so much that I believe that animals shouldn’t be eaten by humans, I just think that the way we treat these animals before killing them is immoral) 

I’ve explained this to family, yet they continue to buy me meat products and tell me to pick the meat out, but I just feel like this is worse!  I became vegetarian to stop supporting the meat industry, but by “picking the meat out,” not only is money going into that area, but I’m not even giving a justified end to the animal by throwing it away... 

Is it moral to be vegetarian when all I’m doing is throwing away the meat that I would have otherwise eaten?  What should I do when I’m in the situation again?",12May2020,1
755,"Hi everyone. 
I’m very close to my father (57) who has smoked for 35 years. He’s had a heart attack a few years ago and a stroke recently. He also has mild COPD. Tried quitting smoking after both incidents for about 5 months each time before returning to it again. 
We’ve got him the patch, e-cigs, explained the consequences very clearly, tried ignoring him, throwing out lighters, anything &amp; everything but nothing works. He saw both his mother and mother in law die from lung cancer. He seemed extremely scared after the stroke and realized the severity of continuing, but I still find new buds around the yard.

Yesterday Katie Hopkins was trending on Twitter and I saw that she asked if 'Sadiq Khan (London mayor) had gone back to Pakistan yet' and the comments were vile, saying things like 'hes not British' and that 'if a dog is born in a stable it doesn't make him a horse'. I just feel like I'm not wanted in this country I call home. And when Katie makes anti-Muslim comments the replies are so bad, too. Not many people defend my religion, my race. So many people defended Jessy from Little Mix when Katie went after her, but it's almost silence when she goes after Pakistanis and Muslims.

I understand why those SJWs have 'us Vs them' mentalities, now. These white people genuinely believe they're good people, and there are SO MANY OF THEM WITH THE SAME VIEWS. It's scary. I'm nearly an adult, is this what my life is going to be? Working in an office with everyone secretly taking the piss out of me? Thinking of me as a ticking bomb?

760,"Hi All - My gf's father (60s) recently broke his ankle and had two surgeries, is now discharged and immobilized at home. Her mom is a bit overwhelmed, understandably; meanwhile, her brother (30s) who lives near her parents, is going out to bars and socializing as if COVID doesn't exist.

GF and I reside in a diff state, she is becoming increasingly agitated at her brother for going in/out of her parents' home without face masks, or any ppe really, and increasing their risk of exposure to the virus drastically. Her mom insists everything is fine, but, with so much on her plate, is having trouble putting her foot down toward her son coming and going, as she does need the help at home.

SO, GF is debating driving home to help mom, keeping brother out of the house (to be clear he does not live there, he has his own place), and doing all of the shopping/errands/anything they could need while living with them while her dad recovers. BUT, she's really worried about putting people at risk along the way, even though I told her there is no silver bullet here-- but I want to make the drive (will take 24hrs total in the car) with her, helping to sanitize each other along the route how in/out of gas stations, etc. Then I would stay at my best friend's place (we're both originally from the same city), for a few days before, well, flying home... I'm in my 30s, non-smoker, wiling to take the risks to travel if it means her getting home safely. Does anyone think that driving home (in/out) of gas stations wearing masks/gloves, is safer than flying?

But for her birthday last year I was feeling pretty generous and I worked hard to make this great gift for her. I was happy with it and hoped she'd be grateful. She wasn't. But still, I was happy just giving it to her so I didn't think anything less.

Then my birthday rolled around. I was expecting a nice gift in return since I worked hard to make her gift. She didn't even tell me happy birthday. I mean, it's kind of a reach but she's not the most affectionate when it comes to me. I decided to ask her if she had something for me, she lashed out at me telling me that my gift was 'her love for me' and about how ungrateful I was and how it's better to give then receive.

I mean yeah. I know that, but at least a small gift wouldve been nice, like a flower or a card. Then again, I feel like I overstepped and should just be grateful she acknowledged my birthday.

Her birthdays coming up. And I'm wondering if I should give her another gift, but I'm also wondering if I shouldn't because of what happened last year. I'd rather not get my hopes up.

All I want is to go study the things I want to study, but to do so I have to make it through a variety of subjects through this program that I am much less interested in (such as english lit, writing composition, etc). Actually even in psychology my average was only a 50 something, despite having an 80 percent test average.

775,"This is a long story. This is my first relationship.

So I met my girlfriend last year around February through my cousin (24F). We slowly started up our relationship with a couple dates together before I had to leave to go back home. There’s 14,000km between us. 

We’ve been doing great but around the end of January 2020, I found out that she has a boyfriend who she’s been with a year prior to meeting me. She told me that she has been trying to break up with him for some time before she has even met me. But every time she tries to break up with him, he wouldn’t accept it and would force her to stay with him. My gf has told me that the guy always forces her to do things she does not want to do and that the guy is childish upon looking back. 

But when I found out that she was still with him, and that he found out I’m also her boyfriend. The guy disrespects my girl by saying nasty stuff to her and even making a Facebook post slandering her to all his friends, and because he tagged her in the post all of my girlfriend’s friends and family could see. My gf was able to convince him to take the post down. And because of this she was finally able to break it off with him. The guy hates me just because he thinks I’m the reason his relationship with her is no more. Especially since he calls me a f*cking foreigner. Its true, I’m a foreigner a Canadian. But thats just out of line and downright childish. He also expressed to me that he deeply hates her.

After taking a break from her, I decided to give her a second chance. And we have built our relationship back up and have been really happy with each other. 

However, she has told me a couple months ago that the guy and his friends has continually tried to contact her through text, FB, IG, and the popular messaging app in the country (Zalo) and that she has been blocking them each time they try to contact her. 

Recently, the guy had contacted her to say that he will be starting work at the same place that my gf works at. Mind you, her mom also works here. And now the managers have put him in the same shift as her. My gf is constantly worried that the guy would gossip with everyone about everything. She often catches the guy staring at her with disgust and anger. My gf’s coworkers have started to notice him staring at her and they have told him that she has a bf (me), but he ignores them and her request for him to stop staring at her during work. My gf told me that she has tried to express to him that she has me as her bf and that she doesn’t want him bothering or harrassing her. But despite that, just last night, my gf shared with me that the guy texted her asking her to bus out to him, where he’ll wait for her to hang out with him. She has told me that she’ll remind him that she has a boyfriend and will show me what she says in response. 

I’m at the point where this creep is getting on my nerves, and no doubt on my gf’s too, with her ex harrassing her so much. He wouldn’t take the hint with her not responding to his texts that she doesn’t want to talk to him. 

I’ve been trying to reason with my gf to open up to her sister and mom for more support, rather than just myself. But as I can’t force her to or even let her sister now (as thats not my place to tell her), she still hasn’t told anyone else. I know that if I try to contact the guy, it will definitely make things much worse for my gf. I genuinely love and care for her. I don’t want her to be harrassed by him anymore or it get to a point where he physically hurts my gf. What advice can I have to try to help my gf see that its best to also get help from her family?

I’m at the point where this creep is getting on my nerves, and no doubt on my gf’s too, with her ex harrassing her so much. He wouldn’t take the hint with her not responding to his texts that she doesn’t want to talk to him. 

I’ve been trying to reason with my gf to open up to her sister and mom for more support, rather than just myself. But as I can’t force her to or even let her sister know (as thats not my place to tell her), she still hasn’t told anyone else. I know that if I try to contact the guy, it will definitely make things much worse for my gf. I genuinely love and care for her. I don’t want her to be harrassed by him anymore or it get to a point where he physically hurts my gf. What advice can I have to try to help my gf see that its best to also get help from her family?

Note that my gf’s country is third world and the police are corrupt.",12May2020,1

789,"I suppose I should lay things out in order so that things make sense. 

I started working at a social media company over a year ago. I really enjoyed the job, as it was exactly what I had wanted to do with my career since I was studying in college. It was also such a stroke of luck since I met them while applying for another job entirely. 

Once COVID-19 hit and the quarantine started, I was one of the few lucky ones to be able to work remotely from home. However, as a majority of our clientele were restaurants, a large sum of them had to either terminate their contracts or suspend payments temporarily as they could no longer afford us. This meant that I and others had to take a pay cut (which was fine, I completely understood and held no ill will over it) and my boss had to lay off a few employees from the production branch. Now, even though I had less clients to work with than before, the workload was still the same as the production employees that were laid off had significant roles and now we had to make up for that. 

About a month ago, my cousin who I was very close to passed away. It affected everyone in our family and we were all deeply saddened by it. I was very emotional during this time but I was still able to perform my job. 

A couple of weeks ago, my boss came up with a solution to our pay issue. All of the employees would have to assist him in their new side business. By helping the side business in addition to our social media work, my boss claimed that they would be able to go back to paying us what they were before the quarantine. The side business work is tedious and exhausting. My entire week is spent with the side business, and the breaks I get from that are to do my social media work. This wasn't what I signed up for, and I was very upset. However, I didn't say anything to my boss or my coworkers as my boss is the type to guilt you into being a ""team-player"" and my coworkers go along with whatever they say. (We are independent contractors and get paid commission so I can't exactly unionize and I suspect that my coworkers are getting paid differently from me. Not to mention, my boss owns a semi-popular chain of restaurants and can afford great lawyers so any sort of legal action is out of the question.)

Last week, a coworker from the social media side Larry decided to quit to pursue a passion project business with his friends. As such, all of his work was redistributed to the other employees. I was given additional social media work on top of what I have, and the side business expectations. I seriously considered quitting as I had saved up some money (less than 10k) and was already applying for new jobs online. 

Now, just yesterday, my car was hit. It was parked on the street and a driver that wasn't paying attention to the road collided with it. The driver had no insurance and a suspended license (police only gave them a ticket) and I already contacted my insurance to file a claim. I am worried that my premium will increase as this is my third accident within the last 10 years and I might not receive much compensation since the driver had no insurance (my policy does cover uninsured motorists but I own a pretty old car). 

After everything that's happened within the last couple of months, I feel like my mental health has really taken a hit, and I don't want to keep working at my current job because of the giant workload. However, under the circumstances with my car and finances, I feel like I'll have to in order to survive. Should I quit?

***TL;DR*** A lot of bad stuff happened to me recently, so I feel like I need to stay at my job for the money. However, the job sucks and I don't think I can keeping working at it for another week. Should I quit even though I might not be in a good financial state to do so?",12May2020,1

792,"I just got my nursing licence and am debating where I should apply for work. I’ll provide some background information. I graduating nursing school last year but instead of writing my licencing exam right after graduation like most of my classmates, I decided to take that as my opportunity to move out of my parents’ house (they can be overbearing and a bit controlling so I thought it would be the best for my mental health and to be able to move on and start the next chapter of my life in a better environment). I decided to move in with a good friend of mine from school thinking it would be all sunshine and rainbows. It was for the first few months but then my roommate started getting on my nerves and it became distracting (complaining about me having friends over, being super anal about cleaning, being rude to my bf, constantly knocking on my door to have “roommate talks” which just brought me extra stress) Bottom line, it got to the point where living with her made me miserable, annoyed and the great friendship we once had felt like it fizzled out. Living there had become a burden and it was difficult to really be able to. Fast forward 1 year and I decided it would be best that in order to be able to focus on studying for my licencing exam, I should move back home to the suburbs with my parents temporarily to be able to focus. I continued to pay my share of the rent while I lived at home for 2 months and studied. The environment at home has become better since I left and I feel more at peace here than when I first moved out last year, and much more at peace that I did at my apartment downtown with my roommate. [Here’s my dilemma: with the whole COVID situation, I am debating whether I should continue to stay at home and pay rent to my apartment in case I’d like to live down there again in the coming months when COVID died down (I love this apartment so much, just hate my roommate) and thus find a nursing job up in the suburbs, OR should I just suck it up, go back to my apartment, deal with my roommate issues and find a job downtown?] I feel like living at home would be conducive to me having the support I need in order to focus on a new job (having meals cooked, laundry done, a bigger room and my own bathroom, no noise restrictions). There are less COVID cases in the suburbs than there are downtown. My dad is immunocompromised and has a heart condition, although he says it would be okay to live at home while I worked, and that I would just have to try my best to self-isolate, I would still be afraid to pass it on to anyone in my family. However, in favour of getting a job downtown, I currently have a part time job related to healthcare that I would still like to be able to go to, and having my hospital job downtown would make commuting between the 2 part time jobs a bit easier. Before COVID I also envisioned myself living in my apartment downtown for a long time and working downtown. But the number of cases downtown are a lot more which also scares me. I also feel my roommate situation might distract me or put me in a negative mood when I am trying to focus on work and orienting into my new nursing role. But I know when quarantine ends, I’ll be able to engage in a social life again which may offset any negative moods I’m put in by living with my roommate. There are just so many pros and cons to both sides. I would appreciate any input you guys have in terms of where I should apply for jobs.",12May2020,1

As I sit here looking at my dog, I can’t help but think that maybe it’s too soon.

Surgery is incredibly expensive (Upwards is 10k) and we are told that he may not be the same. We are not in a financial situation to do this.

803,"My parents are mormon, and to their knowledge I am as well. I don’t follow all the rules, I don’t go to church, but they don’t know that.

I’ve dated several nonmembers in the past. My mom had a serious conversation with me when I was 19 and began dating someone who’s Baptist   and basically was like “you guys can date but you can’t get married we want to make sure you’re still planning on getting married in the temple. I dated another nonmember after that and there was no serious conversation.

Back in August I told my mom my cousin wanted to set me up with her boyfriends friend who was not a member. My mom shut it down so quick I was honestly in shock. That “NO no more dates with nonmembers” reverberates in my mind to this day.

Since then I’ve moved out of my parent’s house and have dated a few people, both casually and seriously. During the winter I briefly dated, by chance, someone who was raised a member, but is more similar to me in terms of our relationships with the church now. For all intents and purposes he was a member, so I left out the nitty gritty and my parents were appeased.

Recently I’ve started dating someone who’s again not a member. I like him a lot and would say I could see it turning into something more serious. We’ve been dating about a month and a half. 

Ever since that shutdown in August I have been extremely reluctant to tell my mom about people I’m dating.

I had talked to my therapist last week about telling my mom and he suggested a letter. Some aspects of that idea didn’t seem ideal.

I told her about him last night over text, bad move probably. It wasn’t going to come up naturally, i want to merge the two worlds, and i just wanted to get it out. I wanted to avoid it turning into a greater discussion about my feelings about the church and my goals in life because that’s what it has turned into in the past. Had i been there in person it would have opened the door to a conversation i didn’t want to have and am not ready to have. I don’t want to break their hearts and inform them that I don’t want to get married in the temple and I don’t want to follow the rules of the church.

My mom and dad have said they’re concerned and want to have a discussion, so they can “better understand.”

I know they have to find out at some point. I would rather it happen slowly so it’s not this earth-shaking heart-breaking shock to them. I guess that’s not reasonable to expect.

We’ve only been together for a month and a half. It makes me mad that a relationship this new has to warrant some huge discussion.

My question is, can I avoid this discussion about religion or does it have to happen? How should I approach this conversation if/when it does happen? How much should I tell them?

He starts saying how she doesn’t get any attention at all and his wife said she is fine honey. The next thing I know he starts swearing at me, at his wife and daughters. His oldest daughter starts screaming “WHATS WRONG WITH DADDY!”. He starts slamming cabinets and goes over to the stove where there is a boiling pot of brazed meat with hot water all on the underside of the lid. He yanks the lid off and throws the water all over the kitchen and into the living room where his kids are then he grabbed another beer after yelling no one loves or care about him, then grabs a bong and walked outside slamming the door as he left. 

I stood there just dumbfounded by what happened in the span of a minute or less. His wife turns to me and says I go through this everyday. I asked if I could do anything and she asked me to stay for her and her daughters. I said ok I’ll stay. He walks back in and it’s silence. Then 5 minutes later he was acting as though nothing has happened. I found out that he has mental problems and has not been taking his meds and has been self medicating with weed, booze and other things. 

I’ve gone over there before and seen bruises on him like a black eye or around his throat so I don’t know who beats who bits it’s a toxic relationship to say the least. 

I was scared for his wife and kids as well as myself and he crossed a line that day and I haven’t been able to see him the same. 

I talked to my father who back in his day found out that one of his best friends also beat his wife so he told me to end the friendship. 

He has been texting me for 3 days and I haven’t responded. WIBTA if I told him why and that I no longer want to be friends?",12May2020,1
821,"Hi all,  


I suffer from a health condition that is sadly making about 75-80% of my hair fall out. It's messy (Hair clumps.. Hair clumps EVERYWHERE, I've practically given my bf's apartment new carpeting, gag), frustrating to see, and annoying. I'd like to just be bold and shave it all off so it regrows in evenly, but I'm worried about looking professional for my job. I work at a high-class restaurant as a server, which is managed by the very nice though traditional owner. I love my job here, they treat us great and have been amazing during the pandemic. They want our hair to be tied up off our shoulders which is totally fine with me, but I'm not sure how I could do that with a wig. Our dress code is also very strict, so I don't think they would allow me to wear a bandanna or something like that.   


Any ideas?  


Thank you in advance!",12May2020,1

824,"Some background: 

I work for a great small financial company on the tech side of things and have been moved around to new teams 2x in the last month to projects that aren’t interesting or engaging. I have worked from home for a long time so the covid SIP/wfh doesn’t really change anything for me but my actual work has changed a lot since SIP started. Also, right when covid changes started I had a bad accident and my company was really accommodating while I healed for a month and they have done everything to keep me employed. 

The problem is, since my accident and the start of covid, I am finding myself feeling really anxious and unable to focus on work. The projects being outside of my realm only add to that. 

I have a good chunk of money saved and almost no bills. 

I want to take time off but feel ungrateful for the opportunity I have and scared for the future. What if I can’t get a job that pays this much in 6 months or what if I can’t get a job at all?

I’m a senior in high school. My workload has been rigorous these past years. I’ve taken honors classes, aps,... a lot lol. I’ve also taken 4 years of math already, since I did a math class over the summer. 

Would it be bad to drop my math class for Film HL? I want to do film and broadcast as a career and I asked my counselor if I could drop math to take that class. 

I’m planning on taking English IBSL, Ap GOV/Econ, broadcast journalism honors, theatre tech, and golf. I’m also in a lot of extra circulars (clubs, etc.)

I’m just worried it’s gonna ruin my chances of getting into a good college, but I already have my 4 years of math?? I really want to take Film HL but that would mean I would have to drop math. I can’t take a zero period next year because I have a twin sister and she’s not taking a zero period and we share the same car. I don’t want to drop golf either.

826,"Hello to the community! This might not be a serious problem, or a problem at all, but I need you to give me some advice or tell me if anyone else is related to this.

I am a 15 years old girl and my dad has always been cautious when it comes to the use of tech devices (PC, phone etc). He has enabled screen time on my iphone and he doesn't allow me using my phone more than 3-4 hours a day. Am kinda okey with that because mostly I spend time sitting on my PC. 

Back in summer 2019, my dad randomly woke up at 1 AM to use the bathroom. He saw lights coming off my slightly open door (I thought it was closed) so he came to check on me. He caught me being on instagram when I was supposed to sleep. So he got extremely angry. As a result, he smashed my phone in the floor. I dont blame him, the mistake was clearly mine and I still regret it to this day. After a while, I got a new phone. 

But as a result from being caught using my phone when I was supposed to sleep, he takes away my phone in the night. Now in quarantine, he demands me to leave my phone in the kitchen table at 11 PM to make sure I won't use my phone during the night. This is annoying me lately, because now in quarantine, my friends are awake till 3-4 AM chatting on groupchats etc.  It is kinda annoying that I can't take part to their conversations and mess around with them after 11 PM just because my phone is taken away. I haven't told my friends that my phone is taken away at the night because they might make fun of me because I am in an age where all of my friends don't have their parents over their head restricting their phone usage or take their phones away. When me and my friends discuss what are we doing during quarantine, most of my friends say that they sleep very late at night and sometimes not sleep at all. I don't wanna be the only one that is different so I say the same thing. What I really do after 11 PM is watching netflix but i fall asleep after 1-2 hours and I sleep on 12-1 AM. 

Of course, it's my fault and If I were more carefull, my phone wouldn't be taken away, but there it goes.. The thing that annoys me the most is, I think that most of the times, a 15 year old teenager's parents are not involved that much in their stuff such as restricting them their phone usage etc. When you hear that a someone is having his phone usage time restricted, your mind goes to a 10-13 year old kid... not to a 15. 

I really wanna hear if someone relates to this and that I am not the only one here..  If you were me, would you be annoyed? How would you ""face"" this? Thanks.",12May2020,1

828,"Sorry if this becomes lengthy. I'll try to get straight to the point. My boyfriend treats his family like shit. He hates his siblings because they get more than what he did when he was younger because his parents are now more financially stable since they're older now. On multiple occasions, he's cussed out his mom and called her a horrible mother. He sometimes goes weeks of just ignoring her when she tries to send an ""I love you"" text. He tries to justify this by saying that she chooses her boyfriend over him. I asked why he doesn't like her boyfriend and he said that he's heard them talking shit about him before and now he hates them both. His mom tries her hardest to make up for the past and so does her boyfriend. They always get him gifts and ask for him and I to come over for dinner.

 He always says no and says he refuses to continue his relationship with his mother until she leaves her boyfriend. I tried to explain to him that that's not a fair choice to give to her, and that if he makes her happy and doesn't hurt her or mistreat him anymore then he should just get over it and have a relationship not involving the boyfriend then. He'll then go on a rant saying how I'm never on his side and that he's always on mine when it comes to my parents, which is true. However, my parents were very abusive growing up. 

I was physically and emotionally abused by them my whole life, and even went through some sexual abuse by a family friend. Since my childhood was so traumatic it's really hard for me to agree with him when he says his family sucks. I don't want to seem like I'm belittling his upbringing, but I don't think that his family has done anything to deserve the disrespect he gives them. He complains that he doesn't want his mom to talk to him anymore because of her still living with her boyfriend, but then will cry about not having a mother when she's never given up on trying to have a relationship with him even when he says he hates her. I don't know what to say anymore. Even with everything, I would never treat my parents the way he treats his and I'm not a person to just agree with my boyfriend because he's my boyfriend. I think that he's being a baby, and extremely disrespectful and its a real turn off. I don't want to ruin our relationship over family drama. Can someone help me see his side of things?

Anyway, so the friendship went south for a long while a lot of arguing a lot of disconnecting blocking and defriending happened. I was still trying to mend the friendship throughout all this but I kept getting backlash and rude comments from Jaime so I finally went into a no contact phase after 4 months he started coming back and we talked a bit, I noticed he was different towards me now wasn't really taking into consideration my feelings in regards to what had happened and expected time to be enough that we would go back to our usual 'normal' states with each other. But he kept criticizing me and saying rude things still so I went back to no contact. 2 months after that he had come back again and was asking how I was and saying that I didn't care about him and our friendship. (All of our surrounding friends new how broken up I was about everything that had happened between us) anyway the messages were sporadic and would come and go, we always had arguments because he would try to one up me or be rude again. But we were still talking, there were times when it was actually starting to get better and then . 
Then 3 days ago was the one year anniversary of when the incident happened, so it so happens I log into Facebook today and notice he is no longer on my friend list--again. And then I check Instagram and our other messaging application and he is no longer there either basically he had cleaned me out --again. Eventho he had promised before these things wouldn't happen again.

834,"My 13-year-old daughter (as I think of her) has recently announced that she's non-binary. I love her and I want to support her, but to be honest I'm really struggling with it: it's keeping me awake at night, and the best way to describe how I feel is deeply unhappy and anxious, as if I've lost the person I thought she was. 

I'm aware, by the way, that I'm using the ""wrong"" pronouns in this post, but she has told us that she hasn't yet decided about pronouns - and besides, the truth is that regardless of how she identifies I can't help seeing her as a girl (which is what she looks like - long hair, skirts etc). 

She's quite young for her age, in terms of looks and behaviour - if you met her you'd probably think she was about 11, more pre-adolescent than adolescent. In recent months she's spent a lot of time on Tumblr, and I know that a lot of the people she follows there (initially because of shared interests in particular TV shows, books, fan fiction etc) are trans or non-binary. I can't help thinking that she identifies as non-binary because it fits in with her Tumblr ""tribe"". I know that's a crappy thing to think, it suggests that I'm not taking her seriously and not accepting that she is what she says she is - but as I say, I can't help thinking it, and I also can't help hoping that this is a phase.

I like to think of myself as tolerant and open-minded (don't we all?), and I have non-binary and trans friends, but the reality is that when it comes to my own child I'm finding it really difficult to accept. I love her and I want to be able to support and accept her whoever she is, but I'm really, really struggling with it. 

So I guess the advice I'm asking for is: how can I come to terms with this and learn to accept her for who she is?",12May2020,1

Long story short, first job post-graduation, moved to a new state to work. I only worked half the year, and my salary is below the $75k limit anyways. This was going to be the first time I was going to file my own taxes, and I figured I'd go to a professional for help. My mother said she knew someone that I could go to who has a business doing this, so I obliged. I paid her, gave her all the necessary documents, and sometime later, she emailed me the documents after it was filed. I quickly scanned over it, it all seemed okay at the time, and went about my day. I got my return direct deposited like normal.

Well, fast forward to now, I still haven't received the Covid-19 relief payment, and the website still says there is no information available, after trying every possible configuration of the information daily. I decided I'd check my tax documents to verify my AGI was listed as below the $75k limit, which it should be, and it was. Then I noticed the typo in my address..

I attempted to check the status of the relief payment using the typo'd address instead, but there is still no information. I attempted to call the IRS to get the address corrected, but their phone lines aren't running right now. I can't contact anyone about the relief payment as of course they haven't established anything for that.

I feel like I'm at a loss for what to do, and I could really use this relief to help me out, as I live alone and my monthly rent is more than $1400, let alone other bills. If they mail it out, can they figure out the correct address, or will I just be out of luck?",12May2020,1

842,"Trying to decide whether to cut someone out of my life. We are both female and both in our late twenties. 

At one time, we were very close. We were roommates in college for one year, and continued to be for years after this. She was a very good friend to me and helped me out of some horribly difficult situations. I considered her a best friend, for a while, as she was consistently there for me. However, she then got a serious boyfriend, and very quickly her life became all about him and their relationship. 

They've since moved in together - they now come as a pair - I haven't seen her without him for two years. Not once have we gone for a drink together or had a girly night in, like we used to. It's like they're incapable of being individuals now they're in a relationship. I feel rejected. Maybe I'm a bit jealous and insecure, even, because I don't have a romantic partner. I'll admit that out loud, to make things fair. 

What's more, she's different when she's around him. I feel she looks down upon me, the single woman, the third wheel. She'll make (subtle but painful) comments about how I'm unlucky in love. She implies I am needy and reach out to her too much with my problems - yes, I have needs. I'm a human being. And, unlike some, I don't have a partner to confide in, so obviously I'm going to want to lean on my friends a bit more. But she makes me feel bad for doing this. Often times, she'll completely ignore my messages, or take days, even weeks, to reply. 

Bottom line - I don't think she's a bad person. I know she has been an amazing friend in the past. Our lives are moving in different directions, as she settles down with her partner and their white picket fence, and I pursue a career as a single woman. Maybe this is all a natural part of growing through your twenties, or maybe it's not. All I know is that I feel hurt, rejected and upset by her apparent indifference towards me. It used to be so good to have her around. Should I let her go, or accept I will never be a priority to her again, but try to remain in her life in some capacity? If so, how can I accept something that hurts so much?",12May2020,1

I am 22 [m], currently a year 3 med student at the best medical university in my country. I have everything I've ever wanted (namely a rather sweet car and a place of my own), and I am also dating one of the most beautiful girls I've ever seen, who is also very loving and supportive. I really couldn't have asked for more from life thus far.

Except things aren't really that simple.

I am not happy, and I cannot even remember the last time I was truly happy. And most of the time I can't even figure out why.

To start things off, I miss my ex, sometimes, a lot. She was not right for me, we had our ""lows"" pretty often, but we also had plenty of ""highs"". Objectively speaking, the ratio between them was close to being 1/1. We had a very weird chemistry going on. We broke up when I was studying for the med school admission exam (which I can safely say was one of the hardest in my life).

Though, however, I don't act upon this, since, as I mentioned earlier, I am already in a very loving relationship. I love my actual girlfriend a lot and we are extremely compatible, we truly complement each other, things are going out perfectly thus far, so the fact that I'm nostalgic for my ex really makes me feel like an asshole. I haven't told her about this, and I don't plan on doing so cause it's gonna be a very long and rather unproductive conversation, I don't wanna ruin her feelings like this.

This is one thing, but, I also kind of miss almost every aspect of my high school life. Even before graduating I knew it was going to be as such since I had great classmates and I got along well with the teachers as well. I really miss that life.

 I miss living in my hometown. I could move back there, sure, but that place has no future, it's kind of a dying dead-end city, everyone moves away after graduating high school (I only know about 3-4 other persons of my age who stayed).

I miss the car I was driving back then, even though it was an early 2000s rustbucket economy hatchback I got as a hand me down. Still, as shitty as it was I have much more memories of it than I'll ever do with my current one, mostly roadtrips and that sorta things from back when I didn't really have any worries

And it goes without saying that I also miss my friends, all of them left and the ones I'm still in contact with have changed a lot (as I probably did as well). Ofc, I made new ones here, but something just isn't the same, I never felt as connected to them as I was to my older ones.

Lastly, the fact that my parents and grandparents keep on getting older deeply saddens me as well, for obvious reasons.

My question is, why do I keep feeling this way if things are, well, ""better"" now? How can I stop it? Since I fear one day it'll start affecting my life one day, and I don't want it to be ruined by something which now is nothing but a mere memory.

852,"I can go from happy and friendly to a miserable, mean person in just a matter of seconds. The slightest thing can throw me off. It’s like a bomb goes off in my head and I react instead of thinking about how to calmly handle a situation. This has led to me pretty much becoming a loaner. I don’t have any friends anymore and I try to breakup with my boyfriend almost daily when I have an episode. I feel bad for my boyfriend being in a relationship with me and I’ve explained this to him many times but he continues to stick around for some reason. I feel like because of my personality I don’t get to enjoy a lot of social aspects of life. 

Sometimes I do really good at not blowing up and I don’t have an episode for a week or two but then I go back to my normal miserable self. 

I have been told that I need to seek therapy or go on medication but I really cannot afford it. 

Is there anything I can do to stop being this way?",12May2020,1
853,"My ex commit suicide last week. We were together in college (2015-2016)  and I cared for him, but I fell out of love because of his drug habits  and that I didn't like the way he treated me. He wasn't a bad person at  all. Our relationship had it's flaws and we went our separate ways.. he  would reach out to me every so often to check on me, but I wouldn't  continue the conversation because I didn't want to lead him on. I always  wanted him to be well, though.

I  found out this morning that he killed himself last week of a drug  overdose. It's breaking my heart because I just wanted the best for him,  and to live a happy life. He was only 22. My fiancé said he wished he  could teleport to comfort me because he's been away with his friends  working on his car. He also has plans to go hang out with more of his  friends to be gone for the rest of the week.

I  lost my grandma in October which was a huge hit because she was like my  mother. I grieved alone since he was in China finishing up our trip and  packing up my belongings so I could leave (I was living there). That  was the first time I had ever lost somebody close to me, and now I'm  just alone again and I feel like my fiance should want to be here for  me.

Is it wrong for me to feel so sad for my ex this way? Is it unfair to my Fiance? Is it okay for me to feel like I should be taking priority right now?",12May2020,1

861,"So I (32M) have a little brother (24M). We were pretty close during childhood, even though we're completely different. I'd like to think I have strong moral principles and I try to be responsible as much as I can. I've always been the big brother, helping him whenever he was in trouble or giving him some life guidance.


Now, after he dropped high school around 17, he started to take the easy way out. Stealing money. His girlfriends, my girlfriends, stealing in the cash register of our father's declining business, even stealing from disabled teens during a summer job. Everytime, he's swearing on our graves he's changed, he'll never do that again and such and such. 

Last year, I was in Barcelona for vacation and I got my phone stolen. So I asked my brother for help. I needed him to go into my room (he lived next to it). He did nothing though. A week later, I'm back and I noticed some things have gone missing. Including my brand new $2000 guitar (I put money aside for years). Well he was the only one who knew about it and it was obvious it was someone from the inside.

I'm no Sherlock but it wasn't that hard to find the guitar and the proof it was him. When I confronted him, he denied. I involved the police, he got a slap on his wrist but that was it. Since then, he tried to make amends or playing with my feelings (I love you, I changed), just like Slippin Jimmy if you've seen Better Call Saul. My parents are very forgiving  (or oblivious). I'm not such a fool, and they blame me a lot for it like it was all my fault. 

A few days ago, my brother told us he's going to be a father of twin girls. He and his girlfriend (2 year on/off relationship, multiple cheatings, you see the picture), they have absolutely no money, no degree, nothing steady. But he wants me to be the godfather because he thinks I'm a good role model. Maybe something about burying the hatchet. I would be glad to do it for his baby girl, for some kind of support, but honestly I'm still bitter and angry at him. 

Am I overreacting? Should I forgive him? I don't like to dwell on the past too much but he's never learning from his mistakes. I want him to do the right choices for once in his life.",12May2020,1
862,"So this is a bit of a complicated situation.

My good friend has recently come clean to me that our previous friend (also my ex boyfriend ) had sexually assaulted her last year. She actually told me about it because she was concerned that he had also assaulted me.

I was completely blown away as I know for a fact she takes these issues very seriously and would never falsely accuse someone. I myself had not experienced anything like that personally in my relationship but we were all much younger then \[teens\]. 

Before learning about all of this, I had actually been talking to him again as he was being a welcome beacon of support during a family member's passing. We had been talking a lot in fact and even flirting a bit with each other. 

He was abused during his childhood and has a suicidal personality, saying things like ""how he isn't a good person"" and ""I don't imagine growing old"". At the time I figured that this was just depressive thoughts \[As I also have depression\], but now I know about his horrible actions.

So after learning all of this, I feel quite betrayed by his behavior and I don't really want him in my life and I\`m unsure if I should just cut him out of my life with no contact or confront him about the situation and how he acts like nothing ever happened.  

But I don't want him to harm himself, even if he is despicable I don't want to cause anything like that. 

How should I go about ending my friendship with him and stopping him from taking any drastic actions on his life?

\[Also I want to note that this is a private situation, so many of our friends aren't aware of the situation and so still interact with him like normal as I did before my friend contacted me\]",12May2020,1

I have put off going to back to college for so long because I wasn’t sure what I wanted to commit to for the rest of my life.  Now, here at 39 years old I’ve still never went back to get a degree.  Still am not 100 percent on what I’d want to do.  Is it too late at this point to even consider. Starting this year and not finishing until I’m 43.  Would I still be marketable at that age or would it not even be worth it.  I started in IT in the early 2000’s but never finished.  The majority of my jobs have been IT related or technical support.  Honestly I’m in technical support now and absolutely loathe every hour I am there.  It is not challenging there is no growth potential.  It doesn’t pay very well.  I just don’t know what I would do if I would go to college.  I know I like to talk to people and help them solve problems but I think I have kind of burned out as far as technical support goes.  I still believe that one can truly find work that doesn’t feel like work but as for me I still have no idea what that would be.  I have that about going for business as that is kind of a blanket degree that could open doors in just about any industry.  The other thing that turns me off about IT is how rapidly it is changing and how I really don’t think I want to have to keep updating my skill set every six months to a year just to be competent at my job.

865,"So my workplace is a gym in Colorado and is still closed due to COVID-19. They called me last week to ask about my availability because they said they wanted me to choose 1-2 hours in the day that I can come in Monday through Friday until we open in June just to do whatever is needed in the day. They said they'd get back with me on what I'd be able to commit to for the time being. Since everything has happened I've been taking care of my little sister for my parents during the day from 7:30-5:30 while they work and helping her with her at homework since schools are closed and so are most daycares. So when my supervisor got back in touch with me I told them that one of my parents would go to work later at 930 so that I could come into work from 7am to 9am or anytime after 5:30 I was free. She kept saying there would probably be a shift from 6-8 for maintenance or child care, eventhough that isn't even my normal position (I was hired for the front desk) and that she'd get back to me on it. Thirty minutes later she called me and word for word said ""I just spoke to hr and that you either have to come in and work from 4-6 monday through friday or you'll be let go from the team"". Low and behold I ended up telling them I couldn't do the shift and am still extremely disappointed. Now they're asking me for a resignation letter but they literally said I'd be let go. I'm just not sure if I should actually send a resignation letter because something doesn't seem right about this whole situation. My supervisor has been messaging me everyday asking for a resignation letter and I even told her that they let me go and that I didn't resign. She just said they need it for my termination papers. 

I would also like to add that my workplace received the sba loan and sent out an email two weeks ago stating that we'd either get paid our usual biweekly amount through that payment method or get paid by them providing us scheduled hours until June. To me and my family it seems like they didn't want to have to pay their employees and would rather have us come in to work 1-2 hours a day and lose unemployment and then only get a fourth of our normal pay. I did confirm with my supervisor that if I came in for the 4-6 shift that I would only get paid for those hours.

The job that's farther away is able to hire me right now. The one close to me has a longer hiring process that's been slowed down due to less staff bc of the pandemic. It will probably be weeks/maybe a month or two before I can start there. My current job is fantastic with dealing with the pandemic and supporting us as employees, so I've been teleworking. That is not guaranteed at the job that can hire right now.

Do I a) take the job farther away because it's a sure thing and then leave if I have to in a month or two (a headache) or b) turn down the farther job and wait on the one closer, while I'm still able to telework. I'm super torn on this.

I have a couple anecdotes I wanted to share but I’m general do you guys think it’s a problem if I tell girls that I’m not physically attracted to them and the reason why if they’re interested in a more than friends relationship but I’m not?

The other day a girl from my high school ( we’re both in college now but back home due to covid) asks me if I want to hang out and I say yeah but just as friends so she doesn’t get any wrong ideas from the start. She asks me why and I said I don’t like in her that way and she tells me to elaborate, insinuating that it has to do with her physical appearance. She says if I have something to say then to just spit it out. I said ok if were being completely honest you’re a bit overweight for my preference. She then proceeds to blast me saying how much of a stereotypical frat gym douche I was and how all I do is lift weights and eat protein powder and that normal people don’t have time to be at the gym 24/7. She says just because you’re buff doesn’t give you a license to body shame other people. Uh where is that coming from?!?! Plus, I’m pretty sure half the reason she wanted to hang out with me is because I’m buff.

Another instance was back in February when I was hanging out in a girls apartment back in college. We were watching a movie and drinking (we were pretty plastered) and she suggests we hang out in her room for a bit. I say no I’m really enjoying the movie I’d rather finish it and I’m tired so I think I’ll go home after. She retorts is it because I’m not pretty enough for you? I’m like uh kinda I’d say you’re just not my cup of tea, I hope you can understand that. She’s like what the fuck do you mean by that? I tell her like she wasn’t physically attractive to me and she says tell me why. I say idk what do u want me to say like ur face is not physically attractive to me.. I don’t have a desire to bump uglies with you.. she then almost breaks down and says I’m sorry that I’m not an Addison Rae looking white sorority girl and that I only hang out with her for free ciroc.

My surgery is scheduled for tomorrow. I've already had my pre-op appointment, I've already been let go at my job for the next 2 months. 

Today, the hospital called and said my insurance won't cover my surgery. After several phone calls, I was told that they won't cover it unless it's from an accident, which it's not. 

On my list of benefits, it says that it covers out outpatient hospital care, outpatient surgical facility, surgeon services in a hospital or outpatient surgical facility, outpatient miscellaneous medical services, doctors medical care and treatment performed in hospital. And those are just the ones listed that are relevant.

First of all, is it even legal for an insurance company to have these benefits clearly stated, but then give an excuse of ""Only if it's the result of an accident"" when it's literally the day before a surgery that I absolutely have to have?

This isn't even the first time this has happened, I just had to pay about $2000 out of pocket for my MRI, which exceeds my maximum out pocket, but they say they don't see any claims for it. 

The hospital said my surgery will cost about $37,000. But if I'm paying out of pocket, I will get a discount and ""only""  have to pay about $3000 down tomorrow. (Which I can't even come close to doing.) I've already been let go of at my job. I don't know what to do. Im kinda shutting down.

883,"Tldr: saving to buy a house, living with parents who has anger issues, do I stay or do i go. 

So last year I (30f) was living with my ex in a rented place, and I got sick, like really sick. I needed a lot of care and help. We (he) decided I should move back home with my parents so they could help look after me. Once I was settled there he left me. Not working and the expense of moving and splitting up, ate all my savings. I'm now better and able to live independently. 
My parents advised me to get used to being back at work and start saving again, then I could buy a property instead of renting again. Which I have now started to do. I now have enough income / savings to set myself up with another rented place on my own. It will take me about another year to save up what I need for buying a house. 
Don't get me wrong I really appreciate them giving me this option to save, and for all the care my mum gave me when I was sick (she literally helped me walk, dress, shower, she cooked my meals and drove me to and from the hospital for 6 months). I give them rent and contribute to the electric, gas, and water. I pay for my own TV / Internet package and groceries, I cook and clean and walk their dog. I still realise I have an amazing financial deal here. 
The problem is my dad, he's always been an angry person, paranoid, and goes off at the slightest thing. He puts me on edge and makes my anxiety go through the roof. I walk on eggshells and something still manages to upset him. I spend my time in my room because I am not welcome in the main house. He still treats me like a child, and his motto bringing me and my sister up was 'children need to fear', this is very much how I feel around him. 
For example if my parents are having a conversation about something small, like what's on TV or what they saw on social media, and I try to join in, my dad will say something like 'can you hear that voice?' to my mum, or 'no one asked your opinion' to me. If I work late or go out with friends and return after he has gone to bed, I cannot cook, use the toilet, shower, or watch TV. The same goes if I get up earlier than him. 
This is despite the face that I am 30 years old, I have a good job, and I think I'm a fairly decent human, I have good friends, no debts, no bad habits. 
His behavior is obviously being magnified by the lockdown, but I have been feeling like this ever since I moved here. 
So do I cope with him for another year and buy my own place, or for the sake of my mental health and our family relationships, do I leave now??",12May2020,1

Hi. So I (16m) have 0 experience with girls. But now there is one that I really really like. I just decided to confess to her next Monday.

I am finished writing out why and how I like her(I lead up to it with something quite interesting imo but that doesn't matter rn) . But what do I say now? Something like ""now do with that information whatever you want, but I would really appreciate any kind of answer"" and then what? Do I just leave?

886,"So I signed up to one of the gift exchanges, I really enjoyed the christmas one and thought this would be a fun thing to do during the current situation.   


My match is living in temporary accommodation due to problems at home. And I felt really bad so I had a little plan to send them a kinda care package but with the theme of our chosen exchange. Part of it would be a gift voucher for a supermarket so I googled the homeless shelter they were residing in to see which was closest so it would probably the one they frequent for their essentials.   


THEN I thought I would look at them on Reddit to see if their was anything in particular they might like and ok yeah thats nosey as hell but I was doing it for good reasons.   


What I saw them posting about and comments they sent ... has left me feeling like do they even deserve the package I was planning, I actually want to get another match. A lot of their comments were about one woman in particular her boobs and how much he would like to fuck her etc which at the beginning I was like ok who am I to judge but there is a lot. Also he commented on a 12yo post from an asian country horrible things about do you want to bomb us, how'd you learn to make bombs etc. Another which I didn't look at the picture about revenge porn of his ex and for me thats just not right and disgusting. I want to spread joy with the whole secret santa thing I am annoyed because I felt really sad for him and now I think whats actually true in his story. 

I actually emailed him about allergies before this revelation and my first instinct was to email him and say wtf, but I thought that unwise. 

&amp;#x200B;

Do I ask to be rematched?   
Do I send him my gift anyway because if someone is mean sometimes I feel it's because they're hurting real bad.   
Or do I just send a small little thing and forget about it?

We hang out a lot and she has this new best friend of hers (24F) that joins in whenever we’re gonna go somewhere. We get along well since I actually knew her before she became friends with my sister. I didn’t know her that well but recently the three of us have been hanging out quite often and she is the ideal girl that I’ve always dreamt of. Beautiful on the inside and outside. And I am the pickiest motherfucker that I know when it comes to females. These past few weeks we’ve gotten the chance to know each other more since we both hang out with my sister and she meets my personal criteria of the ideal future partner I would like to have. We’re both clearly into each other with the looks she gives me. I feel there was never any intentions between the two of us but it seems like we just click. We can do anything and have the time of our lives. I’ve never laughed so much with another person and neither has she. Today she asked me to go on a walk with her and we can have some lunch later (there’s not much else to do cause of the virus). I declined. Why you might be wondering? I knew this girl prior to her being best friends with my sister because she is my best friends ex. We would have double dates with previous girls I’ve been with but I always thought she was extremely attractive and smart. My attraction towards her grew exponentially now that we got to really know each other. But I value this guys friendship a lot and she knows I’d feel guilty.

900,"Hey y'all, this is my first post on reddit so I hope I'm doing this right. 

My best friend (26 F) lives alone in a condo next to a guy (~40 M) that lives with his mom and sister. About 5 months ago, he said he could smell her smoking weed and that he needs a smoking buddy and that she shouldn't be surprised if she hears a knock on her door. She kindly asked him not to do that and since then he has came outside to talk to her everytime she got home from work, and now that she's working from home, comes outside to talk to her everytime she opens her sliding door. 
There is literally not a single moment that she can go outside without him trying to talk to her. She is super creeped out by this guy and it makes her really uncomfortable being around him. She's pretty introverted and just feels really uncomfortable that he is constantly trying to talk to her or smoke weed with her. She is also concerned since he doesn't believe in COVID and some of her family members are severely immunocompromised. So, she won't use her patio or go outside. 


Should she say something to him? What should she say if she does confront him? She doesn't want to piss him off since she lives alone and he is twice her size at least.",12May2020,1

Well the day came around and I got pressured into trying to hang out with her, but I ended up joking around with my sister and she yelled at us. So I went inside and did what I do most days, I did some school work then talked to my friends. As it turns out she actually did care about the holiday and now she keeps giving me grief for it.   


We just had an argument and its safe to say if I don't fix this soon she'll never let it down, I tried explaining myself and apologizing, but it didn't work well and she ended up saying that my step brother is her favorite son, and I went ahead and went to my room to type this up.

906,"I (17m) recently found out my friend (17f, we'll call her J) had a boyfriend, about a month ago. He is 19. I thought good for her, right? Well my cousin (17f) is a mutual friends of ours, and she told me from the start she didn't like the guy. He used to be friends with her older brother and neither she nor her brother particularly like his personality.

My cousin has been telling me things J told her about their relationship. It's a month old relationship and they:

Kissed on the first date, not having known each other before it.

He told J(who really, *really* likes her cosmetics) to stop painting her fingernails because he doesn't like it, and she did. That's just an example of multiple thinga she stopped/started doing differently because of him, according to my cousin.

J started acting... weird to say the least. According to cousin, her dress got a little dirty once. When informed about it she immediately said ""oh that's bad. My boyfriend notices these things. Help me clean it"".

J started asking him advice on every little aspect of her life, including multiple years old friendships.

According to J, they ""spend all day together"". When it comes from her I know she means it.

J's sister used to know the guy, and told her not to see him. She hides it from her. Her mom also advised her against it, so J barely tells her anything of the relationship. As far as I know, J's sister is also unaware they're a couple.

The worst one, which scares me the most. Apperantly, J told my cousin that he went down on her. She says when he proposed it, it felt great, but afterwards she immediately regretted it. Reminder, they've known each other for a month. And the most J has ever done is kiss a guy.

I'm terribly worried for her. She's the type of girl who hops from crush to crush, and when she crushes she goes all the way, ""he's the one"" and all. She could be very easy to manipulate and I think that guy realized it.

I've been out of touch with J for the past month or so, so I can't do much to convince her myself. Plus, I'm a guy - chances that she'll tell me all this herself are low, even though we've been friends for a while. Me and my cousin are both scared for her. At best I can see her get heartbroken after the guy's tired of using her, at worst.... let's just say permanent damage. Mental and possibly physical.

It all started off with msging less and less to short responses to literally SILENT facetimes. I've even began to start thinking to myself ""Ah...my friends won't care if I'm sick...they won't really be there for me when I need them the most.."" It hit me more recently cause I'm showing symptoms of Covid -19 and had to get tested. I was worried (I'm immunocompromised) and told my friends about it. They told me to update them.

She was in university studying to be a medical assistant (which is rare because many families do not see the value in spending money to educate their daughters). She briefly introduced me to her boyfriend,AL, while I was there but confessed he is pressuring her to marry him but she does not want to marry him. Lucy swore they never had sex. Well 2 months after I return to the U.S I get a message from her saying she is pregnant. She says she still does not wish to marry him. I asked if he is a bad guy or harming her and she said no but that could change. Later she asked me how to get a visa to the U.S that she can have if she ever wants to travel to the U.S ( had to tell her unfortunately Visas have a strict time limit of use so you cannot hold onto them for a year or more).  Sexual assault is very common and she would not give me an upfront answer on how she ended up pregnant. I'm worried she was coerced into sex to trap her in an unwanted marriage.  When I talk to her the spark she had is gone, she is dull, flat and tired. She had to quit university and is at home taking care of the baby at Al's house. So I started up a small business idea with her hoping I can help her squirrel away a  nest egg just in case she ever has to take the baby and run. Her baby daddy,Al, caught wind of this and  is trying to control it. He will pretend to be her when I text her on the phone ( I started calling her to get around this).

I am one of the only people who is forced to help support her, deal with her narcissism, and deal with constantly having to listen to all of her paranoid ideas. Even with all of this I love her more than anything and I don't want to give up on her.

She refusing to get treatment because she doesn't believe anything is wrong her. If I ever mentioned her getting any mental heath services, she would never talk to me again. I can't force her to get treatment because I have no proof that she's a danger to herself or others. I am the only one helping her. Her mom is still alive and she has 8 brothers and sisters but none of them are close and they don't do anything to help.

He wants to let his manger know that he will be leaving in 4 months so that his current employer has time to find a replacement. He works in a small team of 4 people and they are always busy so I get where he is coming from.

I told him that it's a good idea but he would be better off giving them the required 1 month notice as things might get awkward at work and if the find a replacement they could replace him before he is ready to start the new job. This would leave him unemployed for that time in between.

He very much likes his team and his manager so he wants to leave on good terms. How can he do that, should he give a long notice or just give the 1 month to be safe.",12May2020,1

920,"So for background I’m 20. For almost 13 years my dad was single. However he’s been in a relationship since I was 13. I have a brother that is 18 years younger than me. Along with two step sisters. I live on my own, 45 minutes away. He’s never bothered to come see my house and doesn’t even know my address. He does not call me. He does not respond to texts, I have to send 3-4 and then mention them when I call him if he received them. They are typically photos of my pets, jokes or just random things. I’m now expecting my first baby. And he has some mindset that “I’m off doing my own thing and he’s doing his”. And let me tell you IT HURTS! His entire family is the same way. They don’t call/text and I’ve been expected to visit them since I’ve been able to drive. I feel as if I need my dad more than anything right now? But he’s a very aggressive man and I don’t know how to approach it. 

We got into a rather heated argument on Mother’s Day. (If you don’t believe a pregnant woman is a mother skip this.) I personally think it’s a case-by-case basis. I don’t think giving birth makes you a mother, because some aren’t. I also don’t think being pregnant makes you one, because some make terrible choices while pregnant. However I would consider myself a “mother”. Example: the babies rooms ready, she has everything if she decides to come early. And it’s been this way for a few months. She’s very much loved. 

I was upset that my S/O slept all day. We weren’t literally just supposed to make breakfast together. I didn’t expect any gifts. So I called my dad for comfort. However he yelled at me and said I wasn’t a mother. And that I didn’t deserve anything. And that you have to give birth to be a mother. So I began crying and hung up. He texted me some very ridiculous things, telling me “you aren’t going to disrespect me like that” which I said “you aren’t going to tell me what I did is less respectful that what you said.” And he said “leave me alone” He hasn’t spoken to me since. 

Given the situation I think if I ignore him, it could work? He isn’t one to apologize. He’s rather rude if we’re being honest when told he’s wrong. But at the same time I feel as if it’ll be my fault if I don’t apologize or speak to him.

922,"So after a hard breakup, a job that got me sexually harrased, failed study class and Covid19 on top of it all i moves back home to my mother. Problem is, I cannot live with her without making her and my life a living hell. 

She wants me to pay for living at home, the equivalent I guess of around 250 dollars a month, and to do all the house chores at home, making food, cleaning and Putting up with her dog/puppy that she got a few months ago and be a servant when she wants me too.

Now, I understand the demands separately. But that I think would also grant me some goods, right? Nope. I cannot go out with friends,( because of the virus’s itch is understandable, although the restrictions and spread is much less here in Norway) except for a chosen two that is okay for her. And when I am out I have a Time to be home at 11 in weekdays and 12/1 weekends.

I also have a lot of the responsibility for her dog/puppy where basically she isn’t potty trained yet, she is 6 months, cause when my mom sees the signs the dog needs to pee( sniffing around the ground and circling) she doesn’t get up, just complains along the lines of “pissing on my floor again, are we?”. And she does not play with her either.. and when I do go out with the dog it is never enough for my mom, so she will say stuff like “you call that a walk?”.

I cleaned the whole house this month, and she came up with “you didn’t vaccume” but I did get a little “good job I guess”. I clean the bathroom once a week, and she wants me to clean the whole house once a week. 

I just got a small job that pays minimum, and I told her that I really want to work a lot so I can save up, but then she calls me lazy for not contributing enough. 

I am financially stable enough to last only a few months and just got that small job, but I would much rather save the money and be able to live at home till I go to collage.

Although I could write a whole book of her ungratefulness and entitlementness, but It would be too long and I am not the perfect daughter either. But we did have a huge fight tonight and I am getting sick and tired of always talking past each other and we just don’t get along under the same roof.

So, how do I survive living under the same roof without one of us tearing the other apart mentally?

923,"Me and many of my friends that live with their SO’s have run into the same problem. Our boyfriends don’t do shit.

I’ve tried asking him to help out, you know basic stuff, mow the lawn sometimes, do your dishes when you’re done (instead of letting them stack up in our room), do your laundry when it’s dirty but ... it doesn’t work just to ask him.

And I’ve tried waiting him out, but since we share a room it gets gross with all the dishes, laundry and trash piling up so I get fed up and do it myself.

Since quarantine started, my boyfriend hasn’t initiated cleaning or laundry or anything on his own.

My friends have also vented to me about these issues, that they’ll give their bf a list of simple chores while they do the more intense ones (cleaning the floors, cleaning the entire kitchen, etc), but they still won’t budge or do anything.

For reference, I work and he doesn’t, and I’m also a full time student at the moment. I’ve got a lot on my plate and it’d just be nice to have some help with the house.

I’m not breaking up with him, and I’ve witnessed this sort of behavior in nearly all my relationships.

927,"
I have a popular account on Instagram and twitter in a fandom for this famous singer who’s been around since the late 90s. I’ve had the twitter account since 2012. The Instagram account since 2017. 

From 2013-2015 my twitter account was targeted by all these fake accounts that stole my pictures and put derogatory captions to them. I was also tricked into accepting requests from accounts that looked normal but weren’t upon further investigation. The culprit was two girls from America one named, Michelle and one named Amber.  who were also targeting other fans at the time and even themselves. A lot of fans ended up deactivating or setting profiles to private and everyone became paranoid. They are very problematic hateful racist people. I’d say 80% of this fandom are women that are in their 30s. 20% are people in their teens and 20s. I am in that 20% group, as well as amber and a lot of my friends accounts. Michelle is not. Michelle is 37.  I have not once engaged with either of these people but my friends have.

It stopped for a while until the singer went on tour in 2018, it started again on Instagram. Michelle or amber was stealing peoples pictures writing derogatory hurtful things over them, including mine and two of my best friends accounts, spamming the singers hashtags with the pictures, with all the fake accounts. The singers team became aware of it and put the Michelle on a block list from his concerts. Amber changed her account completely, username and all and stopped doing it. She also goes by the name Cassie now. She got people to turn on me and feel bad for her. Luckily there’s enough fans who seen it all from the beginning on twitter, that know better and don’t like her and see right through her. She even got pictures with the singer at his last tour which she doesn’t deserve. Amber has been trying to draw attention to herself for the last few months with fake claims of people bullying her (very few people even talk to her) and posting all these bullying quotes. 

Lately, 
My Instagram account is being targeted again and I haven’t posted since April 27th. A new hate account was made saying *my username* is fake. With the caption : superficial C*nt. The description says “ a fake b*tch who thinks she’s important but she really should just k!ll herself. She talks to herself a lot because nobody likes her. Die already ya loser” 

Another account says : “she needs to delete  Instagram. Nobody cares about her. Not even *singers name* likes her. Why don’t you talk to yourself some more you psycho. You mom should’ve aborted you” 

I reported it for bullying and harassment and blocked the accounts. I posted on my Instagram story for others to report it. My friends reported it and posted it on their accounts as well. We think it’s amber or Michelle behind it but have no proof to back up the claims. The accounts are still up. They were reported two days ago. My twitter and instagram accounts are now private. I live in Australia and if it’s them they live in America. 

How can I get this to stop? I’m sick of this drama.",12May2020,1

a couple of days ago our chem class had a test
it was a standard class test, nothing too crazy. the teacher left the room immediately as soon as class ended for a demonstration she was planning to do outside. my friend watched a little part of the demonstration from the open door and then subsequently she and i went to the front where she was holding the phones and got our phones, put back the periodic tables, etc and went to the bathroom 
later a class meeting was called in which the teacher and principal said that the tests were “stolen” and that they would be interrogating people. after interrogating me and the rest of my classmates, they called my friend in and told her that it was most probable that she took the tests SOLELY based on the part that she went to the front to retrieve her phone last. they have no other evidence and no witness accounts (mind you - there were many people in the room during the demonstration) 
we tried to talk to the principal later but he said he doesn’t have any other leads so that’s why he thinks it’s her

I (16f) dyed my hair a few months ago (beginning of December) and for the past couple of months I've noticed that I'm losing a lot of hair. I've been doing my best to be gentle when brushing and washing my hair, but it doesn't seem to be working. I have pretty thick and curly hair, and the area where I part my hair is beginning to bald. 

Not sure if this is important, but I wash, condition and put coconut oil in my hair about once a week. This is the same routine I used before bleaching my hair. Using coconut oil multiple times a week seems to make it worse. 

My hair has been dyed in strips, so cutting off the dyed hair isn't an option. It'll probably be a few years before my hair gets long enough to cut all the dyed parts off. 

Any advice on how I can reduce or stop my hair loss?  Any tips would be helpful :)",12May2020,1
933,"This sounds incredibly stupid but I am very confused due to this pandemic. Just a little background; I am 100% disabled vet (PTSD). I was medically retired at ten years after massive trauma occurred in a very short period of time six years ago. 1.) My only sibling died completely unexpectedly from an unknown medical condition. 2.) A month later I received a phone call that my husband was dead. He was military too, I was thirty years old and didn’t get the courtesy of a proper death notification. A series of “mistakes” led to me getting a phone call from a backwoods LEO (he’s no longer with the PD) asking if I was the wife of *John Brown. I confirmed that I was and his response was “your husband is dead”. I was driving home from
a get together with friends ALONE. Driving 65MPH on two lane country highway. Thank God I didn’t go into shock and cause a massive accident. I could have killed innocent people. It still blows my mind that a stranger called me and didn’t even ask me to meet LE at the police station, military post or my home. But it happened and it was a nightmare I try not to think about. Burying your only sibling and your spouse within a month at thirty years old is enough to make anyone crazy. I just kept pushing bc I didn’t know what else to do. I’m thankful I had the support of fellow military personnel and I just put my uniform on and kept going. I was injured in the line of duty six months later. Recovery was mentally and physically grueling but I did it because I didn’t know what the hell else to do. I was surviving on all fronts for a year but I made it back to duty and life was getting “safe” again. Then the last straw, my very closest friend died in my arms. That was pretty much the end of the line for me. I accepted medical retirement and moved out of state. Since then I’ve been pretty isolated. I live alone and don’t interact with anyone at this time. I was doing a lot of service work with veteran organizations. Traveling to different states and assisting communities affected by natural disasters with fellow veterans. Because I’ve been through so much bullshit I don’t let media “panic” get to me. I live in a state where the news is frequently reports we are in danger of hurricanes etc. We had Irma a couple years ago. Most people panicked and tried to evacuate. I stayed and helped out in my community bc my home wasn’t damaged. I heard about covid a couple months ago. I assumed it was media panic and just kept living my daily life. I don’t do much when I’m not volunteering with a veteran organization out of state. I go to a couple twelve step meetings a week for the fellowship and so I don’t become a complete shut it. Then all of a sudden ALL the meetings were cancelled. I went from having someplace to be every single night to nothing. I guess it’s been 6-7 weeks, I know people are dying and everyone is supposed to quarantine. I am very sorry that people are suffering from this virus, but I really don’t understand what’s going on. I’ve been going to the grocery store every 4-5 days for Dog Food and food and drink for myself. A lot of people are wearing masks now but Target is open, fast food drive throughs are open, 7-11 is open...if I go online I read all these things about “stay home and save lives” so I’ve being sitting at home alone TRYING to wait it out. Only venturing out for supplies. I’m going to lose it. I really am, I am getting to the point of not bothering to get dressed or know what day it is. Now I read soup kitchens/food pantries desperately need help because people have no money for food. I would LOVE to help out at a food pantry or getting food to people in need...but aren’t I supposed to “stay home and save lives”? I’m sorry, but I’m frustrated and trying not to lose it. I keep telling myself “people are dying from this horrible virus” and “I should be grateful”. No, I would rather be out HELPING than holed up ALONE. I don’t have covid so what good is it sitting in solitude with the exception of going to Target and McDonalds late at night? If people need help, I want to help not hide in my solitary confinement of a home. Am I supposed to “stay home and save lives” because I prefer to GO OUT and actually do something to help people who don’t have food or are sick. I’m totally cut off from society, do organizations like the United Way or Red Cross need help? If we are quarantined I don’t understand. I’m NOT worried about me, if I get sick it is what it is. I don’t want to put others at risk, I want to help. Can someone just tell me what’s going on without hysteria, just facts...do I have to sit in solitary (with the exception of going to McDonalds drive through) or can I actually DO something to possibly contribute to those who really do need help? At least in the military when we deployed to hell holes we KNEW it wasn’t indefinite. We had a date to look forward to of when we could get back to normal. Now we just sit and do nothing with no end in sight? That’s all I hear is there is “no end in sight”. WHAT is really going on? Sorry and thank you. Please if anyone is familiar with organizations like Red Cross or United Way tell me is there anything I can DO? I don’t want to do anything “online”, I want to go help people if that’s an option!

934,"My boyfriend grew up in a hyper religious (Roman Catholic) family. He is actually very open minded, and doesn't force his religion upon me or shame me for being pro choice or any of that crap, but he does personally hold *himself* to a fairly high religious standard. 

His family taught him that masturbation was bad, because not only is it a sin, but it is also considered cheating against your *future* spouse. i.e, beating your meat before you meet your future wife is equivalent to having an affair while already married, because the act of marriage and sex is so sacred, that any adulterous acts *before* marriage even takes place is also considered a sin. 

......like I said, HYPER religious family. 

We have been seeing each other romantically for almost 1 year now. Although I'm not religious, we both agreed to wait until marriage for sex.

He came to me one night, his hands literally shaking, saying he had to get something off of his chest. It turns out that not only had he been masturbating, but he had basically been addicted to masturbation since he was 10 years old, right up until his 22nd birthday, masturbating 2-3 times a day almost every day. He says he resolved to kick his addiction after his first date with me, which I completely believe as not only has he proven to be very trustworthy, but I frequently use his laptop/desktop/phone for various tasks, and I have never seen him scramble to delete his browsing history, as I have seen my own brother do sometimes. 

Although I consoled him and said that I didn't see it as cheating, and that there was nothing to forgive, I am worried for a number of other reasons. 

1. If this was so important to him, why did he wait to long to tell me? Does this indicate that he is a good liar? That he is capable of hiding much bigger things? **To other people in relationships out there, is this a possible red flag?** 
2. Although he said he was able to kick his porn addiction, and I *do* believe him, I find the fact that he compulsively masturbated for almost 12 years, multiple times a day,  very disturbing.  I don't what to think; **nobody does something for 12 years compulsively and then just** ***moves on.*** **Could this spell trouble for our relationship in the future?**

937,"Hi everyone, posting here for advice and to be honest, I'm finding it cathartic to talk about this.

For context, in my country you have to inform your local HR team (comp&amp;ben or in our case, payroll) about your pregnancy so they can coordinate with a government agency for mat benefits. I had informed my line manager about my pregnancy and our payroll admin knows. I didn't make any announcements online or in the office as I felt that my pregnancy was something I wanted to share with friends and family only.

I had a miscarriage last February. I informed my LM who then informed our payroll to trigger my mat benefit (2 months paid time off). A day before my scheduled operation, I received a message from a fellow employee saying she felt my confidentiality was breached and asked if I was okay. At that time, I was experiencing spasms from medication and welcomed any form of distraction. I didn't process the confidentiality part at that time and just told this person I will be ok and just need time off. I'd like to point out that before that convo, I didn't tell this employee I was pregnant, yet alone having a miscarriage. Her response was to ask about my medical leave and, ""semi congrats"" as you don't have to worry about a kid and you get paid time off. I had to remind her that I was devastated for the loss and wanted to have a kid.

3 weeks after I've returned from my leave, my LM casually told me that I was a victim of a privacy breach. It turns out that our recruiter (who I never talked about my miscarriage to) was reported last Feb because she was gossiping about my miscarriage in the pantry. Our pantry isn't very big and it's very difficult to have a private conversation there as tables are very close together. 

I discussed the incident to our HRBPs and with the recruiter and it looks like they knew about it, apologized for the incident, and that was the end of the conversation. 

I feel that my concern has been invalidated and I still don't know who else know about my miscarriage. Note that as a l&amp;d admin, I face our employees on a daily basis. I'm glad I only have to do online sessions due to covid19 but I have lost my motivation to work. I actually cry and have panic attacks every now and then, most especially when I have to run a class. As a public speaker, this experience of being afraid to speak to people is disorienting.
I feel tightness in my chest everytime I'm in a meeting and the recruiter is also there. I also feel that the recruiter shouldn't be handling any employee information given how comfortable she is gossiping about my misfortune and I don't even know why she knows/had to know about my miscarriage in the first place.

I have considered looking for another job but covid19 has made that difficult. I also want to say that I enjoyed my job and was even looking forward to coming back to work after my leave as it means stability for me, financially and emotionally. I don't think I'm making a mountain out of a molehill but I feel angry that I have to look for a new job when I didn't do anything wrong to begin with. 

Should I keep trying to look for another job? How can I overcome this discomfort that I have about my current job? I'm also considering going to therapy but have limited means to do at the moment.",12May2020,1

However, I noticed that I’m only lazy at home. At school I always get work done and try to finish homework during any  free time and I’m extremely productive. But at home I’m a lazy slob that just lays around. With the recent quarantine, the last semester of my high school career has been moved to online class.

The reason I’m so worried now is because the college I’m going to attend next year (Cal Poly Pomona) is going to be all online for the first semester. I literally don’t know what I’m going to do.

So, any advice on how to desensitize myself to the more dramatic fear of veins? Exercises? Coping skills?

945,"Some I formation about me:
I am 21 years old, female. I don’t smoke or drink and I avoid caffeine at all costs now a days. I have general abdominal pain (more so based gastrointestinal issues ) and PTSD. I’m currently prescribed amitriptyline 50mg, dicyclomine 20mg, and escitalopram 20mg. 


Since this past December I’ve been suffering from repeated episodes of supraventricular tachycardia. Generally my heart rate ranges between 150bpm-220bpm , and it comes on very suddenly and  has become very common (an episode almost every other day). I’ve been able to handle this, but recently things have gotten worse. 
My heart rate has gone up during these episodes (used to average around 160bpm, now I’m averaging around 200bpm.) and my symptoms have progressively gotten worse. I now have trouble focusing my eyes, have trouble breathing, and get dry mouth right before an episode. During the episodes I get extremely weak, almost like I’m going to faint, and feel very disoriented, on occasion I’ve gotten physically sick from this. 
I had a holter monitor study done in January and my doctor has only gotten back to me now. I’ve been trying my best to manage my symptoms on my own but it’s become progressively harder with time. I am now having multiple episodes a day where my heart rate will shoot to over 150bpm while I am at rest.  I’ve begun to have trouble staying conscious during these episodes (I have extreme dizziness, and my vision fills with black spots.) My doctor believes that it is anxiety but during my most recent hospital visit the emergency room doctor told me that he believes it something else, something more serious. I was told to come back if my heart reaches over 150bpm while at rest- it has multiple times but given my previous visits I don’t think there is much that can be done. (I have also been made to feel like I’m being a hypochondriac by my doctor- which I don’t think I am. I just want to feel better- and I am doing my best to listen to doctors advice.)
I don’t have anyone else who can advocate for me and I don’t know what to do- I feel like my doctor is minimizing my symptoms and as things get worse I am more worried for my wellbeing. I feel like I’m at then end of my rope. Any and all advice is appreciated.",12May2020,1

947,"I'm currently a junior in a STEM-based high school (16 years old), and despite recent events I'm still trying to think about my college applications. I've been told my entire high school career to aim for an out-of-state university because of my ""exceptional academics"". When people say that though, they almost always mean an engineering college, or something in the STEM field, which is pretty meaningless to someone who wants to pursue art. Even still, I've been pretty lackluster in my grades due to stress and other student things.

I've spent hours upon hours on researching good art schools and universities, but almost all of them are either way, *way* out-of-state, or extremely expensive (not to mention highly prestigious and picky). In-state universities are much more practical, but none of them come close to excelling in their art programs. Eventually, I want to end up working in the industry as an animator, so I figure going to an art-based school will help me reach that goal.

As someone who was raised in a not-so-rich household, my parents can't afford to pay my tuition, so money-wise I'm on my own. I'm signing up for every scholarship I can find, but at the end of the day that doesn't matter if they don't accept my portfolio (which isn't even finished). And even if my art is acceptable to them, my grades may not be; I've already finished all of my required high school credits and am currently taking random AP classes along with college level calculus, which is pretty hard to excel at. 

I know I'm only 16, but senior year is fast approaching and soon there won't be any time to think about it. Should I just take the L and go to an in-state university, or should I focus all my efforts on trying to get into art school?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I'm afraid my art isn't good enough to get into the schools I'm dreaming of (calarts, pratt institute, you get it) but nothing else interests me. Should I just settle for something more practical?",12May2020,1
948,"Hello people of reddit, i need a little help. Recently due to the current virus epidemic my job has started to implement people to work in groups for our work shifts. 

There are 3 groups which have four-five ppl in them. My problem is that my boss asked me to create a kind of competition/contest amongst the different groups. I have no idea of what type of contest that i can run between the groups, in a bit puzzled on this. 

Some extra info is that i work for a coffee company. Most of the people that come into the store currently are mobile orders and pick up orders. Anything regarding up-selling and possibly sales might not work.

950,"Last year I received my Bachelor's degree in computer programming from a nationally accredited school. When I had signed up, I mixed up regionally accredited and nationally accredited and thought I chose right...I was wrong. I figured...okay, can't transfer my credits to a state university and pursue a Master's degree if I decided to later on because the accreditations aren't compatible. 

Anyways, since graduating, I have had no look finding a programming job. No one wants to give me an interview since I have not going to a state university. The employers that do interview me say that they are not interested because my college didn't teach me super advanced math classes. In their words, I can't think outside of the box because I don't know these concepts. Since I am unable to find a programming job, I am stuck in a contractor job formatting documents. My interviewer said I was going to be a junior analyst.

I found out about Southern New Hampshire University and how they do online classes. It is a regionally accredited school and probably holds more value than where I went. After talking with an admissions counselor, they informed me that they should be able to accept my degree and allow me to join their Master's degree program.

It would cost me $22,500 for the whole program. I'm still $80,000 in debt from my previous college. Do you guys think that getting a Master's degree will help me find a better job opportunity?

957,"Okay so my brother (20 almost 21 next month) has been living with my husband and I since January. He ended up transferring schools to the same city that my husband and I just bought a house in. My parents asked us if we would care if he moved in with us to help him save money for school. We said of course to him moving in. I am currently and have been pregnant so we thought it would be great to have an extra hand at the house since he’d be living there for free. 

Since January he has maybe washed his dishes twice and has yet to clean his room. My mom has came over 3 weekends and cleaned his whole room and done laundry for him. His room is disgusting and smells bad all the time. But that’s his problem not ours so it doesnt bother me too bad..

What does bother me is when he makes messes in the house.. any time he cooks he leaves all his dishes out he used to cook with along with every wrapper used or taken off so I have to come behind and clean it all up or it will sit there for days. He will make a sandwich and leave the bread, ham, and cheese laying on the counter for whoever to pick up. He also hordes all of my dishes in his room until I realize and tell him to bring them up and wash them. But he never washes them he puts them in the sink to “soak” since there is mold on them. So I always end up having to wash them. Anytime he takes a shower he leaves his clothes in the floor for days and I’ve had to ask 3 times at least to come get them. He never flushes his toilet. Which is gross. 

As for groceries no one addressed when he moved in how he would get groceries because he doesn’t have a job. So my parents were just having my husband and I pay for his groceries until we just couldn’t afford it anymore. Then my dad finally made him get a job (which didn’t last long) to pay for groceries, which he gave us a total of 50 dollars for one month.... and my mom ended up having to give me the rest because he refused to pay more because he wanted to “save his money”. So he continues to eat our groceries all the time. 

Anytime I address any of this with my parents they say well just talk to him. Or tell him to do it. But I feel I shouldn’t have to parent him.... he’s 20 and doesn’t listen to me anyways. I was independent at 17 and never once asked my parents for money because I worked full time and went to school. So I paid for everything on my own, so I can’t understand this mentality he has. 

My dad then said my brother should mow our lawn since he literally does nothing but make messes.. so last week our yard needed to be mowed so I told him the night before and he said okay and it had to be mowed the next day because it was going to rain for a week straight. Well the next day I told him again and he said okay. Well he never would come outside to mow, so my mom called and I told her I was about to mow the yard (I’m 7 months pregnant) and she said no that it was my brothers job to so she was going to call him. Well he told her he would but never came outside and had himself locked in his room playing video games so I mowed the whole front and back yard by myself. So I never said anything because I’m just tired of expecting anything from him anymore. So my parents called later to ask if he mowed the yard and I said no I did he never came. So they told me it was my fault for mowing the yard that he probably saw me doing it and went back to his room. That I should have kept asking him to come out. What?! Idk how everything gets turned around on me.... if I saw anyone 7 months pregnant mowing I’d run out there and help in an instant. 

Now the icing on the cake is the other night he came upstairs and I could tell he was high. So I asked him if he had been smoking weed. My husband and I are both very against it in our own house, especially with a baby on the way. So he lied and said no, but I kept pressing and he finally caved and said he had some. So my husband and I both said we don’t want it brought our house and never smoked in our house. Well this morning I woke up and my whole living room smelled like weed. So when he woke up he drenched his room in air freshener like I wouldn’t notice. And I confronted him and was mad, but he denied it even though I’m not stupid. 

So that was the last straw for my husband and I, we just feel so disrespected and taken advantage of because we literally let him stay here out of the kindness of our hearts. So I called my mom to tell her he was no longer welcome to stay with us and we told her about the weed and how we told him that it was not welcome here and him smoking it anyways. 

So somehow my mother guilt trips me saying. He can change. And she doesn’t know how he can afford college now. And I needed to go talk to him and see why he’s doing all of this. And have my husband go and talk to him and tell him he better straighten up or were making him move back to my parents. 

I told her no. That we have put up with all of his disrespect and taking advantage of us for too long and we don’t want him living here anymore. I am too pregnant to be taking care of my 20 year old brother and getting too stressed out by all of his messes and taking/using all of our stuff. Not to mention it has caused fights with my husband and I because he is my brother so I feel very responsible for how he has been and it’s not fair to my husband especially. 

So now my mom is angry with me and blames me for all of it. So I just need advice how to move on from this and if I did the right thing by kicking him out and putting my foot down with my parents. My mom has guilt tripped me so hard that idk what to think anymore. We just want to live peacefully in OUR home. It’s like he got dumped on us to take care of. Sorry this is so long, just needed to vent to some strangers on the internet because I feel people who are not emotionally invested in situations give the best advice!

960,"I am 20, turning 21 in June. He is 27 and his birthday was in February. 

And Yes you read that correctly. Yes, I mean I physically struck him. I pushed him hard in the chest which was more like a punch in both hands and then I slapped him across the face. Now let me explain.

We’ve been together for just about two years now. I was homeless and on drugs for the passed four years previous and he took me in and got me clean and then we just hit it off. And September of last year we found out I’m pregnant. (I’m 37 weeks pregnant now. I’m due to pop any day.)

Before I got pregnant, we had arguments here and there but nothing we couldn’t get passed. We both have anger issues and realize this and our way of dealing with our anger is to just word vomit at each other and get it all out and then sit down and talk about it afterwards and see what we can fix. Sometimes we get pretty heated and say things but nothing that can never be taken back and we have most definitely NEVER EVER got physical unless it was a hug at the end of it all. We both come from domestic violence situations in our childhoods and past relationships. He’s probably the healthiest relationship I’ve ever had. Not perfect but better the rest. I truly plan on marrying this man.

I love him dearly but ever since I hit about 20-25 weeks, somewhere in there, our arguments have gotten very... stressed. And very aggressive vocally. I’ve threatened to leave and take his kid and called him a POS (which bothers him immensely) and he’s called me a bad mom (which bothers me immensely). But that’s as far as it’s ever gone and we always talk it out and go on a date afterwards and really try to make it up to each other. But the farther along my pregnancy goes, the more intense things are getting. I know it’s stress but still. And the fact we are quarantined together isn’t helping.

Yesterday we had the arguments of all arguments. Actually this was more like a fight. We were having a good day all the way until about 3pm when we were discussing the nursery. He said he was going to go get a new light to put in the nursery and maybe a dresser for the baby stuff and I said that would be nice and then I mentioned getting rid of the tv that is in there that’s broken and all hell broke loose.

He blew up on me and I immediately got angry and I went upstairs while muttering he’s a POS. He followed me angrily only this time when he got into the room, he got in my face. I kept patronizing him by calmly saying over and over to get out of my face and eventually it escalated him into telling me I can leave if I don’t like it here anymore. I ignored him and got on my phone and he smacked it out of my hand and it landed on the back wall and smashed. I got so mad that I pushed(punched) him in the chest back away from me to go retrieve it and I scream I was calling my dad and leaving. He then rushed to my phone and threw it again and called me a drug addict and that’s when I snapped.

I slapped him clear across the face and he immediately said to get out. I said fine and I proceeded to just overflow with tears from the anger. I have never hit anyone before. I’ve been on the receiving end. I vowed never to. But I did. After a few minutes he blocked me from the door and refused to let me leave until I sat down and he hugged me and cried with me and told me he was sorry and he would buy me a new phone. I cried into his chest and we forgave each other but I can’t passed it.

I hit him. He had an ex he left beat the shit out of him because he will NOT hit a woman. And I’ve had men beat me to an inch of my life. I never thought I’d be the abuser. It’s seriously messing with me. I hit him. This whole relationship we have had one understanding and that it’s not physically violent. There’s a certain trust you can’t get back after you cross it. The trust your partner will never hit you. And I did it. I can’t take it back. I hurt him. I never wanted to hurt him. I don’t want him to think this is us now. But I made it us. I tried to express my grief to him and he told me I’m too weak for him to be actually angry about it and keeps telling me of was for the justice of my phone. But that’s not ok. I physically struck him after everything we have been through and I never want to get that angry again. Ever. I love him. I want to marry him but I cannot be like this again. I’m scared for myself and of myself and I don’t know what to do.

I will take literally any kind of advice anyone has. I have traumatized myself by hitting him and it brought up my pst in my head and he doesn’t wanna talk about it because to him, it’s over and dealt with. But to me... this is how it starts. We’re having a baby together and I hit him...

962,"Weird title but here me out. This is also going to be pretty long I didn't realize how much there was to say until my thumbs just kept going. 

I've always been a nonconfrontational person when it comes to personal and financial problems. I used to bottle it up and just be passive aggressive about what iij would say and I have been working so hard on this the last few years and have finally gotten to a place in life where I want to do better and be better and FEEL better. My bf(26) and I(27) moved out over four years ago. A few days ago we each moved back in with our parents in order to save as much as possible in order to buy his coworkers house next year. I am wildly excited and I want this more than words can describe. I love this man, we have known each other since freshman year of high school, we just click so well. The only problem is I have to make sure he will help me with this. Throughout the whole time we have lived together I have taken on my part of rent, the bills(all except the wifi which our fabulous roommate was paying, I miss that fucker), and basically all the groceries/toiletries/etcetc. During all that time he only bought groceries or toiletries when I asked or he would buy stuff just for him. This is where me bottling everything up comes into play. At first I wasn't too worried about it. He made considerably less than me and I didn't think that maybe he isn't managing his money well. It eventually got to the point where I wouldn't bother asking because he hardly had his part in rent every month. I knew he didn't have the money. Even when he went to California to see his friend for a week and I knew he didn't have the money for it I said nothing because I wanted him to go have fun and I was going on a trip to Japan in a couple of months I didn't want to ""make it weird"". So the year goes by and it's 2020. We are planning moving out as our roommate will be moving in with his gf and I wasn't about to get stuck paying so much in rent my savings would disappear. Alas, he decides to go to California again that year, informs me last minute(which hurt because the times he went were during our anniversary and I never expected it a second time), and let's me know he won't have but 200 for rent(at this point roommate is gone and total rent is 1200). I pay 1000 dollars out of my own pocket for rent that month with the promise he pay that much next month. Next month comes and he doesn't have it. I KNEW he wouldn't have it. I know how he handles money better than he handles money. When we where packing to move out and I got to the route I asked if he had canceled the wifi plan(he was supposed to be paying it after our roommate moved out four months prior) to which he informs me he never asked the roommate to switch it to him and roommate had been generously paying for our nice wifi this whole time. So the ONE thing I thought he was paying for he wasn't even doing that. I try not to make money my priority in life, but I don't want to use it all on simply living and carrying someone else through life too. I blame him for never asking me about any of this or trying to get involved a d I blame myself for not being more assertive and bringing it up. Now that we have a chance for a house I am a mix of excited and terrified because I can't power through that alone. I could barely get through the apartments without stressing out and mentally shutting down. I don't know if I can rely on him financially and that worries me. I've had many serious talks with him lately without being passive aggressive, mean, or snobby. Just laying down real facts and saying how I feel in this matter and I feel like he isn't giving me much back. The most I've ever gotten out of him is when I pulled him aside and explained how I felt about all the money I pay and that I WANT this house and I need him to want it too. We both cried and hugged it was very emotional. Then after that it's just... lackluster effort and even less in the way of a response. I even bring up the house(we are buying from his coworker who is moving out next year) and ask ""how much is he planning to sell for?"", downpayment, condition of the house, etc and all I get is ""I don't know"" or ""I haven't asked yet"" and it's like pulling teeth to get him to CARE about OUR life. He's never mean or stand-offish about it either, it's as if he just cannot get himself to do what he needs to do and I have no idea how to help him do it. I've spoiled him by essentially taking care of him, but I don't have the capacity for it. I truly do not and that breaks me even though I shouldn't feel bad about it. Even moving back in with my parents was something I really didn't want to do but he was so insistent on wanting to do so. He wouldn't help me look at other apartments or anything because he wanted to go back home and I just left the room. I was floored I mean this is our life and he should be FIGHTING for this. I know life is hard and depressing and he may not feel like he's going anywhere right now, but that's not a reason to shut down and let me carry us financially through... everything. I make a decent amount, definitely more than him, but it's not THAT much. At this point I feel so helpless and I'm not about to ruin myself financially either by moving into a house and soon after not being able to afford it because he doesn't have money again. Or his job which may be going under is gone and he doesn't get a new one or gets one that pays the same crap wage(he doesn't make a good wage, but he loves his job which is another ""dumb"" reason I haven't pushed him to get a better one).

Excuse me if this post is everywhere or if I'm getting emotional. I just don't know how to ensure this will work out. I don't want it to come time we should be getting the house and he's saved nothing and essentially done nothing but sit on his bum and get taken care of at his mom's this whole time and then the poor man who owns the house cant sell it right away either because I have to be the one to say ""we can't afford it sorry you waited for us"". I don't want to be the one who handles everything and pays for everything either though.

965,"Let me start off this post by saying that I haven't always been a quiet, reserved person. In my childhood, I felt like a pretty normal person who socialized and had a ton of friends. But in middle school, I stopped making an effort to make friends and as a result I ended up becoming an outcast and creating an outcast persona. This was around the time when my parents split up and I had to move in with just my mom and her boyfriend. It was an earthshattering experience that changed me forever and it really messed me up.

It was so bad that in the groups of ""friends"" I did have in High School, I was emotionally distant from them to the point where I wouldn't talk to them for days. After highschool, I stayed at home for 2 years (I am 20 right now) and basically wasted my life away. I worked crappy jobs and smoked weed all day. I went out on a few dates with girls but never was able to relate to them on a personal level and those relationships quickly faded as well.

Flashforward to February 13th, 2020. The day I joined the US Navy. I was looking to get away from my parents, from my family, from my town. I wanted to travel and to be independent and make a positive change in my life. I wanted to sail around the entire world and see amazing things.

In bootcamp, a lot of my insecurities came up again when I tried building relationships with people. But, despite this (and just the general challenge of bootcamp itself), I graduated and moved on to my A School (like a technical school for enlisted members). I am currently stationed there and I am scheduled to leave in less than 3 weeks. I will be heading to a base on the East coast and at first I was very excited. Now I am just filled with what feels like confusion and chaos fused together, as I find it very difficult to build relationships with people again. Every day I come back to my barracks room (I live with 2 other people who I don't care for much), lock myself in the bathroom, and wallow in frustration.

Don't get me wrong. I try to make an effort to talk to people from time to time, but it just always ends up the same way. I know that people are less likely to want to build rapport with you if you act needy and desperate, so I try to be reserved. I can't ever find the words to say to anyone say I just stay quiet. I can't just find the balance or more importantly, it feels like I can't find myself.

There is a girl I have been talking to for a few weeks now since my classes started. I can tell she likes me and at first I felt like maybe I should ask her out on a date. I never got around to it. It might just be because I don't ever go anywhere or do anything, and I feel like if I tried dating her she would just find that out and dump me for it. I honestly never go out or do anything here, I just stay in my room at all times besides when I have to leave. So because I haven't made the move, she hasn't really been talking to me or trying to be around me anymore. I've tried to make the move to talk to her here and there but my heart just isn't in it anymore. I try to get her out of my mind and move on but the feeling of frustration for why I couldn't just make the move kills me. All of my roommates go out and ""party"" (can't party much at all right now because of the Corona but they still find ways around it) and they look at me like I'm a vampire who never sees the sunlight. If I did try to get out of the house, I wouldn't even know where to start. Everything here on base is closed down anyway because of the virus.

Lately, I've been more down then ever and I keep pulling myself back up and then falling back down the next day. I know I will be on a ship soon (or maybe not because of the Coronavirus) and I won't have much time to do anything besides my job and go to sleep. Now I am really regretting doing this whole Navy thing because I feel like I've signed 5 years of my life away and there's no way out. At the same time, I'm proud to be here and I want to make this work but I can't get away from my past and just improve myself and get better.

What could my problem be? How do I fix this? Should I even try to make it work with the girl, or just move on like I've tried to do many times now? I feel like this problem is only getting worse and I know I'm not in the right mental state because of all of this. Is there a way out from all of this pain and can I make a positive change or just suffer from the same mistakes over and over again? I hate to complain like this but I really need some advice on how to make this all work. Thanks :)",12May2020,1

967,I generally have been a solid student. Not exceptional but better than average. I’m already accepted into my college for next year. I’m worried about something that is happening right now though. I took an AP stats class that I shouldn’t have taken. Not because it’s exceptionally hard but I just don’t like the class itself. I got a B for the first semester but then we went to online and I lost all motivation. Going to school helps me but being away has tanked my grade. I can’t push myself to do something I’m not interested in or passionate about. I know I’m going to get a poor grade in the class overall and on the AP exam. I’ve been beating myself up pretty bad and it’s been eating at me. I know I’m 100% capable of getting something like a lower A but like I said I haven’t applied myself and that’s one of my flaws. I can’t motivate myself when I’m not passionate or interested in a topic. I’ve done well in pretty much every course in high school and this is rough for me to accept but I’m not doing anything to change it. I guess that leaves me with a few questions. How can I personally deal with this to move on? How do I explain this to my mom? I kind of feel like a failure and I know she’ll probably be disappointed. Will this have any major effects on me in the future? I hate sounding like I’m making excuses but I can’t help it. It’s my own fault anyways and I have nobody to blame but myself.,12May2020,1

So, I (17F) have this old friend (17m) who I want to connect with. We last talked about a year ago (when this happened). We left off on a bad note. He accused me of leading him on, which is kinda true to an extent because I was confused about my feelings back then. But I really regret what happened, and want to make up with him. If possible. I just don’t know how to go about it.

The dilemma is that I’m blocked. He blocked me on Snapchat and Instagram out fo bitterness. I think he was upset that I chose another guy over him (I don’t blame him). But I don’t think he hated me, just was upset.

He is friends with my cousin, so I was thinking about maybe asking her to talk to him for me. Like tell him that I want to talk to him. But I’m just not sure if it’s a good idea. I would really like some advice here.

tl;dr: I want to make up with my friend that cut me off, but I’m not sure how to go about it.",12May2020,1

So basically I’ve (F21) been dating this guy (M21) for about 4 years, and everything’s been great. One thing though, he wont have sex or kiss me on the lips. 

I know he loves me, he goes out of his way to make me feel special and appreciated, but I want to FEEL something, if you catch my drift.

I love him with all of my heart, but he just doesn’t understand why this bothers me. I know that he doesn’t have side h*es or anything like that, he’s very open and honest about things, so we can trust each other. He also doesn’t have a purity omen, like waiting for marriage or anything of the sort. 

I know he gets aroused to because I put on lingerie and sat on his lap and I felt something poke me😉

Yes, I’ve “dealt” with this for 4 years, but I just don’t want to mess anything up, because he is my Prince Charming. 

So what should I do? When I ask him about it, he just says that he doesn’t want to hurt me, and that he heard that sex was a painful experience for both partners. He’s also worried about diseases kissing and contact in that sort of way. To me, it sounds like he’s doing it for me, which is sweet but I kinda want something MORE.😐

973,"Hi everyone, I’ve been really stressed lately about figuring out where I want to go with my life and what I’m interested in in general. I’m going to college next year, and for most of my life I’ve told myself that I want to be a doctor and had this perfect plan laid out for my future. Well, I’m really starting to question everything I have always told myself, and am starting to realize that I have no idea what I want to do or who I am. I feel like sometimes I tell myself to believe something because I really want to be that way, and what’s worse is that I can fall victim to my own lies. I am acknowledging that, and as a result now feel very lost in the world.

The reason this stresses me out so much is because I am such a planner. I like to feel in control and know what I want, what I believe to be true, and where I am going. Right now I feel completely out of control, and it is very stressful and frustrating. I wish I could just know everything I need to know now and be dead set on where my future is headed, but I know this is impossible.

My question for you all is, how do I let go of this obsessive planning mindset? Are there things that I can do to learn to just be comfortable with the unknown and to be happier in the moment? I’ve always had a problem with this, needing to have everything figured out and decided up front.

Furthermore, what can I do to continue discovering my interests and what I want to do with my life? Are there certain books I should read or things I should do to help myself understand what I really want and not what I think I want? Thank you!",12May2020,1

975,"  Hi, so this is quite a long post, I am sorry about that. But it basically boils down to what is in the title.

I currently on a year out before starting my fourth year at medical school again, which means I am basically two years away from completing my finals and qualifying to get a provisional license to practice medicine in the UK.

But I am fairly sure that is not what I want to do – entering medicine was due to pressure from my family and not really my wish. If I had my way, I would be a biology teacher.

However, I was good at medicine, and I passed each year without dedicating myself to my course. In year 3, problems with my depression spiralled, and I got into heavy drinking and drug use, which I am embarrassed about, and I am sorry about too – as a medical student I shouldn’t have been doing those things. I still passed the year, but got pulled up for not completing things in my logbook (stuff like taking blood, practising taking ECGs, etc.) which I didn’t complete as I was too engaged in other, unhealthy stuff. I was deep in therapy at the time but still struggling.

In Year 4 I had a near breakdown – I wasn’t attending classes because I simply didn’t care. I didn’t like the doctors teaching me and was terrified of becoming a doctor. I tried nearly everything to get kicked out – but nothing worked. My therapist at the time, who also worked for the medical school, convinced me to instead take a year out.

I am now in a much, much healthier state of mind. I’m not constantly drinking/smoking/doing drugs anymore. I have addressed some issues with physical/mental/sexual abuse from home and I am working through a diagnosis of complex PTSD from these things. I realised from having other jobs this year I have a real problem with authority due to my childhood – things like disagreeing unreasonably with my boss. I am much more self-confident now too, and I get why I felt suicidal for the near entirety of my course, as I just didn’t let myself heal the physical/sexual abuse from home.

So all this leads me to think maybe I should try complete my course. Get a better qualification if I leave now, I get a 1st medical science degree. I might allow myself to see myself as a doctor, now I know that I am not a deeply flawed person and that my distrust of authority figures deeply affected my perception of the doctors teaching me.

But the complication in this is a really lovely, dedicated boyfriend who has seen me through my worst – he wants to move on, move away from where we went to uni together (I knew him from day 1) and just start afresh. He has supported me so much whilst I have told him I don't want to do medicine. He does not see me differently due to my abuse, and he has supported me to become a much better person. I really, really love him and I really love the idea of a fresh start.

But I am scared he won’t stick around, I am scared my parents will retaliate if I leave, and I’m terrified I won’t be able to support myself. I am terrified I am making the wrong decision to leave my course, like some of my friends and all of my therapists have said, even though I want to.

982,"My friend and I are both 27/F. I became friendly with her (we will call her Jade) through social media, and although we started off communicating through text, we found it much easier due to time zone differences and functionality to send voice notes to each other through WhatsApp, and that became our primary method of communication. It wasn’t unusual for us to leave messages that ranged from a few minutes to close to an hour long. There would be delays sometimes in the response time due to time differences and other personal activities going on, and we both understood and would get back to each other within a few hours or a day or two tops.


During the course of our friendship, we have had a few tricky situations. The first one was a time that Jade met a man at a local Meet Up and was conflicted about how her desired intentions with him and vice versa. She had been agonizing over the situation for at least a week following the Meet Up, and I mistakenly did not ask beforehand if she was only venting or if she wanted advice, so I gave my two cents, and Jade got very defensive in turn. I apologized and then Jade apologized because she felt that she had overreacted. So then Jade asked me for my input, which I gave at her request, and then she got defensive again. She apologized again after disappearing for a few days, and I have since made a metal note to just objectively listen, not give advice. At this point, we were still sending voice notes but with a decreased response time on her end.


It did not work out with said man, but she met another person soon after and went through the same sort of agonizing over intentions (with me just listening this time). Jade and I continued messaging a little more sporadically (which I could understand as life gets busy when we least expect it), but she would also disappear for periods of time despite still being active on the app, and at this point, there were some notes I left previously that she left unheard. I had brought this to Jade’s attention on two separate occasions, to which she got defensive for me bringing it up when she was “too upset to respond to my question because I asked her if she had listened to them on the same day of a particular holiday that she doesn’t like”. The second time I brought it up, she entirely ignored the question as if I didn’t ask and then came back a week later talking about an unrelated topic. At this point, it had been two months since I sent them and she still has not listened to the voice notes. However, Jade has sent me texts and we have spoken on the phone, and she has sent a few short notes (unrelated to the ones I had sent her), so at some point, it feels like she does not want to hear them, and it makes me feel a little sour on top of her tendency to talk to me about her recurrent feelings of being alone and people not doing enough to help her in situations, all while criticizing me for not giving responses that she considers sufficient enough. 

So my question is, are these red flags and should I be wary, or so is there something that I am missing? Should I try bringing up the voice notes once more? Overall, I really do enjoy our conversations and understand that her living situation right now is difficult, but it can get exhausting because lately I just do not know which version of Jade I am going to encounter.",12May2020,1

985,"Making this post and any others with a throwaway account since these topics are sensitive.

And I must state that I'm a young guy who's still figuring alot of crap out, and I just a bit of advice  steady this particular facet of my mental health during this period. I'm not here to debate. And I don't hate any of the groups I'm going to discuss here. I can't stress that enough.

Since I haven't been feeling particularly lonely or bored during lockdown here in the UK. And since my family are still in work, it's been a pretty low key time. I eat, I sleep, I play games, I browse the web, I read. Typical stuff. And I guess I haven't really been as productive as I'd like. Being apart of the GCSE 2020 lot helped a bit, because exams our finished just as schools were closing over here. So I've pretty much no school work.

Most of my time has been on YouTube and Instagram, and Reddit to a lesser extent. 

Combine this with my slant toward politics, and you might begin to get the idea. I'm studying A Level politics at college, starting September. And one of my best mates and I bond alot over political discussion and our views. To surmise; we're both Tories. And the sort of Rule Britannia-ing, God Save the Queen-ing Patriots you might expect Tories to be. We're lovers of England, lovers of the UK and Commonwealth alike. To put it simply. Naturally, I follow quite a few politgram pages, and political YouTube channels. And like to indulge in content surround British and Commonwealth politics on a regular basis.

And becuase of that, a few weeks ago, I found myself heading down a particular rabbit hole. The one regarding mass immigration, demographics, ethnic change, and cultural change. 

Most of the people who broadcast these ideas, particularly in the UK, do it in a real doomer/blackpilled kinda way. Which I guess made it easier to strike the chord it did in my mind, since personally I'm volatile to those kinds of attitudes, and they do a good job of making me pretty nervous in most circumstances.

If you didn't know already, the subject of most of these discussions in Britain mostly surround Muslims. And people originating from countries where Islam is the dominant religion. With advocates from Right-wing groups like the EDL, Britain First, Patriotic Alternative etc. Claiming heavily that demographically, Britain and white-Britons are basically doomed in the future. And that we'll be a minority, Sharia law will become implemented, Christianity fades away. Pretty much saying that the UK and its culture are under immense threat. Due to ethnic change and multiculturalism.

But where do I come into this?

Outside of some political discussion, I hate to hate. I'm a passive, maybe too passive sometimes. I like to be tolerant, inclusive, yada yada. Its just part of my personality and thought process.

But because of listening to all these commentators, watching these videos, reading these posts, and looking and stats on demographics. I've developed this genuine subconscious fear and state of worry. Which I think has been a massive blow to my outlook and mental health.

And in my mind its developed into this twisted superiority complex complex regarding the white-British race. I've found myself obsessing over white birth rates and numbers of observant Christians. In my real life, its manifested itself in me giving people of colour the side-eye. And morally, my demeanor want me to be more obligated to white Christians the any other group. I feel absolutely sick of myself. And becuade of all shit I've seen, all the evidence I see seems to my mind to be irrefutable, and it makes me genuinely more afraid.

I genuinely keep becoming scared that as I grow older  my culture, race and way of life will fall or into obscurity or be destroyed. See how some of those doomer attitudes have rubbed off on me? 

I don't want to look at things this way. It's made me more distant from certain people. Ramped my anxiety way up, the worst it's been since I left school. 

I'm scared, angry, full of nerves and resentment. And what I thought my personality has taken a massive turn. It's the least mentally healthy I've been for a while. And I'm worried about how I might come out the other end.

I just need some advice, people to talk to, people in the same boat, whatever. I'll take any help. I'm just not in the best place atm.

Writing this post has been good though. A big weight feels like its been lifted, if I'm honest.

Thanks so much for reading if you've made it this far. I really do appreciate it.",12May2020,1
986,"  

So my husband and I were living in florida for years, we had a good relationship with both sides of our family who all lived in another state far away. We would see each side once to twice a year. But even when we had a good relationship with my husbands family I would notice little things of favoritism with his siblings when they would all visit, and people undermining my husband. My husband has a know it all, entitled older brother who has a masters degree in English, but didn’t do anything with his degree and works for a non-profit. He got divorced a few years ago so we helped him move out of his parent’s house and helped him get on his feet in Florida. That is until he brought a girl into my home without my permission who was obsessive over my husband(his brother and this girl are now engaged and we are not on speaking terms even though we tried to have a relationship with them) and he has a sister who is the baby of the family who is spoiled rotten and is a total brat. Neither one of them can do any wrong. Whenever my husband talks about his own accomplishments he gets torn down, and his parents start talking about how good the other kids are doing, even though my husband is way more successful and always has been. But honestly, he has major emotional damage that he doesn’t notice from his family always tearing him down and trying to manipulate him. So, two and a half years ago we announce we are pregnant with my daughter, I decided to have him job hunt back in our home state so that our family could be a part of our daughters life. At this time I actually had a great relationship with his mother and they lived in a huge house just the two of them. So they offered to let us stay there for the first year of our daughters life to save money to buy a house of our own and settle down. So we move back when im about 6 months pregnant everything was fine, So my only wishes were after I had my daughter my husband and I wanted time alone in the hospital, and we wanted the two weeks that he got off from work for paternity leave to be just us to bond with our baby. So I birthed my daughter in November, It was a painful labor and I was very sick. 3 days after I had the baby who they all met in the hospital besides his brother because he lived in florida and we were not speaking to him anyway as well as he was not speaking to us. A few days after being home and trying to heal, which anyone who has had a baby knows the mental and physical toll the next month or so having a baby is his mother says she is paying to have my husband brother, fiancé, and their two aggressive dogs come up to stay with them. We said we are leaving to get a hotel while they are there and she replied with “really? If you loved me you guys would stay” But we specifically asked that everyone stay away from us in the beginning as we are new parents trying to get our footing, and they agreed but blindsided us last minute thinking I would just let her son (who hates us), and his fiancé (who hates us more), and their aggressive dogs around my newborn baby and use us as an excuse to get a free trip home. So we left I tried to stay civil and still let JUST his brother come and meet the baby at the hotel. We came back home and acted like it didn’t happen.She was rude about her family Christmas party too because I wouldn’t take our month old baby, during flu season to be manhandled by her whole family. After that we kind of ignored each other, her and my husband would get into little nit pick fights over things like we would not let her babysit and whatever else. But that’s because I didn’t trust her so I always took my baby with me. One day in the middle of the June she got in my face because we had a vacation planned the same weekend she did and she wanted us to babysit her dog, but we told her we couldn’t and she went irate while I was holding my 5 month old baby in my arms she was screaming at me that we don’t pay bills, or help her with anything. Which was true but we stayed upstairs because she made us all feel uncomfortable, we didn’t even end up saving money because she would take up the whole kitchen for hours and just linger so I couldn’t cook supper for my husband when he got off work, and we would constantly take little weekend trips away because I couldn’t stand being there. So as she was screaming at me with my daughter in my arms I asked her calmly to stop yelling in front of my baby and she replied with “I don’t care” so I packed up and we left again. It took her 6 months to “apologize”. She said I was in the wrong and she expected me to reach out to her. But I let it go again because its my husbands mother. So I invite her to my daughters first birthday, she got mad after the party and texted me that she was pissed because I took pictures of my daughter with everyone else but her. But my mentality was take your own pictures its not like she didn’t spend the whole party hovering around my daughter. So once again we get past it, but at this point its just awkward every time she’s around. So fast forward to this past Christmas my daughter is 2 and she doesn’t really know who they are but they never would reach out to see how our daughter is or to come see her! They only live 30 minutes away. So anyways so its Christmas time its about 2 weeks before Christmas she asks if we are coming to her family Christmas party we said no but we will still celebrate with them because we don’t really know the rest of her family and my daughter is shy so we didn’t want to go. She tells us that they want to celebrate with us on Christmas eve, we tell her we cant because my husband had to work until 8 pm. He is a supervisor at his job and manages a team so he cant get anyone to cover for him especially on a holiday. So she ignores us until Christmas eve rolls around and she asked what time we would be over that its fine if we come over late, We said were not our daughter hates being in a dark car and her bedtime is at 8 when my husband gets off work. She gets pissed and said we were probably celebrating with my family which we weren’t we didn’t celebrate with my family until that weekend which is when we were taking to schedule to celebrate with them. She didn’t talk to us again about Christmas, Christmas day none of his family even told us merry christmas. So early February rolls around and its my husbands 30th birthday and usually she atleast sends a card. Well we went to Disneyworld for his 30th and the only he got from his mom was a fake facebook post saying “happy 30th birthday” no call, and they were actually in florida at the time visiting their other son and never once reached out to us while we were in florida for 2 weeks at Disneyworld they were only an hour away from us in Lakeland florida. So now im pissed because here they were hurting my husband again. I don’t know how it got brought up but when we get home from the trip my husband was texting her and she said she sent texts saying she wanted to reschedule Christmas and was supposedly super nice about it my husband said if you did it please send a screenshot of the message because none of us have it. She couldn’t so once again she was lying and manipulating my husband and I had enough. Also its not about material things but my husbands mom has never once bought a decent gift for any of us, including our daughter but still pays for my husbands brother, and sisters phone, car insurance, and any financial issues they run into, but has never done anything for us. So I sent her a long text telling her she needs to reevaluate her behavior and maybe after this year we can reaccess if she should be in our lives because everything I put in this post doesn’t even cover all the lies, and bullshit she has pulled the past 2 ½ years its too much to write. She never answered my text but texted me the other day even though were quarantined she wanted to drop off some presents for us for Christmas and easter. We didn’t answer but she dropped them off on the porch. She did get my husband and daughter a few decent things. She got me things like A PEACH FUZZ RAZOR FOR YOUR FACE. Please tell me that is not low key trying to be rude. Plus in 26 years young I don’t have hair on my face. Lol So to me it was just offensive. But at this point should we just be done with the toxicness she brings in our life or should we just keep forgiving her? Thanks for reading my novel.",12May2020,1
987,"so i recently adopted an orphaned kitten. we found her abandoned and alone outside, she’s obviously a few days old as her umbilical cord is still attached. 

i know you’re supposed to stimulate kittens to help them go to the bathroom. but when she sleeps, she wets or poops herself without stimulation. i do stimulate her in between eating breaks, and i know she’s going enough and she *is* going, but as i said, she wets herself in her sleep despite me stimulating her regularly.

988,"I'm currently sharing a house with my ""friend""(both 23F). The tenancy ends really soon and it's become apparent in the time we've lived together that our friendship has come to an end and this is mainly due to her toxic boyfriend who is both physically and mentally abusive as well as extremely manipulative towards her.

In the time that we've lived together I've discovered she is now extremely homophobic, racist, selfish, disrespectful and will do or say anything to get her own way without caring about the impacts it would have on the people around her. She is also quite bitchy about our other friends whom I've grew closer to since she got into her relationship. I've been friends with her for 4 years and she never displayed any of these traits before him. In fact, before she got into this relationship, she was one of my best friends.

I no longer want to be associated with her and at the minute, I have a lot of built up anger and resentment towards her due to the way she has treated both myself and our friends over the past year. I am also annoyed that I've put so much time into helping her when things got rough or listening to her rant about him for hours on end.

989,"so a bit of background knowledge, I kind of thought I would want to be in this field of work for a while and had even spent quite a bit of money for private training. 

but now, the fact that the head gets pissed off way too easily has kind of scared me into working in this field. There are also a couple of other reasons  which I don’t particularly want to delve into on here. It has also been in the back of my mind since I started; but it also could be due to excessive self doubt.

However, now looking back, I think that I should go into a different field of work entirely; should I really just quit and start a new career path that I think I will enjoy a lot more or just stick it out for a year?",12May2020,1

The cousins dog pees everywhere and is causing stains on the grout because they don’t clean up after her.",12May2020,1
996,"Ok. To start out this post, I am a high schooler with a busy life. I figured out my freshman year of highschool that I cannot just do as many activities as I please. I need to have time to go home, shower, do homework, and have some time to log into xbox and chill with friends for a bit. I do high school marching band, jazz band, show choir (we call it swing choir), spring musical, fall play, and other activities like yearbook, our schools non-denominational youth group, and many others that don't meet that often. I finished winter wrestling, and tried out for volleyball in the spring, but never got around to practice as I had other commitments. 

It may seem like thats just a full schedule already, but that's not it. I am an patrol leader in boy scouts, and i volunteer to do office work at my CCD where i went to sunday school for 4 years and got confirmed. I auditioned for MGAMB (Macy's Great American Marching Band) to see whether or not I am worthy of marching in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in NYC. I also applied for a non-profit music group (no audition group too) and asked for spots in 2 of their main ensembles. A Drum Major for their Marching Band (waiting on a time to interview) and a tuba for their concert band (already accepted). 

I am very well aware that I commited to way too many things. I like to think of myself as a multi-talented individual as I can do several different things to impress people and entertain many. Im what people call an ""Attention Junkie"", I LOVE having the spotlight to myself and leaving people entertained and satisfied by whatever I do. All I want at the end of the day is to know that i made someone's day and that people enjoy what I can offer.

Ok, now here is where trouble began. Just January, I did what people in the marching arts call 'Hitting Your Wall"" I began to really hate putting on my Asics wrestling shoes and my unwashed school pe clothes, and go upstairs to our wrestling room to do the same thing everyday. Most days I end up being sent the trainer because i didn't drink a lot of water, and got lightheaded after doing something hard (In wrestling, at least in my team, water is permitted once during practice... after practice. I bought a sports bottle, but that was at the end of the season, so there was pretty much no point) If it was Tuesday, I would have Jazz Band, which means i get out of practice early, or if its an earlier dismissal, I would wait an hour and a half. Tuesdays at my school are early dismissal, every other Tuesday is a half day. If it was Wednesday, I would have Swing Choir directly after practice. I eventually got back into the hang things, but by then wrestling had ended. During our conference meet, I lost twice, got 6th place, and accidentally threw my headgear towards the mat, which made it look like I was angry. I kinda was, but i did not intend for the headgear to hit the mat, just throw it to my side in disappointment. Worst part was that my mom was there and watched my butt get kicked (I only lasted 1:36 for one round, and got pinned while bridging) I decided that while wrestling was good, it wasn't my thing. Once the season ended, I decided to help our speech team with playing guitar for a performance group. We moved on to sectionals, but we got beat and didn't qualify for state. Once March arrived, I went to school twice at 5:30am to do volleyball ""camp"" before school started. I tried out on the first day of tryouts, made the team, but I never showed up because I had a school play to do. 

Now here we are in summer now that CoVid-19 took us home. I wish my problems ended here but they just get worse.  (Warning: TONS of reading required)

First off, my boy scout troop is a ""high adventure"" troop, meaning we do a big trip every year, but some years we do ""signature trips"" like Philmont Scout Ranch, our troop's classic Grand Canyon Rim-Rim-Rim trip, and then in between big trips like those we do other trips like whitewater rafting, biking a long distance, and even doing a bike-hike-row trip. All of these trips must take under 9 days to complete. We spend 7 days doing rough work from 6am all the way until we get to our next campsite, which can be from from as short as a 7 mile hike to a 60 mile long bike ride, and everything in between. We get 1 ""free day"" to do fun things like sightseeing, and souvenir shopping, followed by Testimonial Dinner"" where we go to a fancy restaurant and pig out while sharing what we thought about the trip we completed. The next day would be a travel day home, usualy in our chase vehicle (A 15 passenger work van rental) or by train. We follow a similar schedule every year. For big trips like Philmont and the Grand Canyon, we start training as early as October, walk around an indoor track throughout winter, and do 3 mandatory training weekends during the spring, with the last weekend being a tough as what 2 days on the trip would be like. If the trip isn't that extreme, we start in February in the indoor track, then go into whatever the trip is, also doing 3 training weekends. All of these trips are done in late july-early august. Now what they don't exactly tell you or your parent is how much the trip is. For small trips, it costs no more than $500, but this canyon trip was an estimated $2,000+ per participant. Before we postponed our trip in April, me and my family had put down 1,000+. I am a working middle class, which means that in order to do trips like these, we have to sacrifice a lot of things to get some extra cash. To top it all off, I hate waking up early as it is, so waking up every weekend at 6 and finishing training at 10 just makes me grouchy. I have tried talking my mom out of it, but she is willing to put up with financial issues and early driving issues to make sure I am a part of an experience of a lifetime (I love my mom for that reason, and others. Happy Late Mothers Day i guess) That's where this part of the many problems stands for now.

Here's the next problem. MGAMB has a $30 audition fee, which isn't much. If i get accepted, however, I owe $1,700 to pay for my trip, not including travel and spending money. I am not gonna say I hope i get denied, but it's a lot to commit to if i do get accepted. I would travel to NYC on plane, get escorted to the hotel, spend 6 days rehearsing and enjoying NYC, and I go home by plane, or by train on Black Friday. Traveling to NYC or being in the group isn't the problem, it's how will I pay for it and make it work with school and possibly work.

Last problem. Every 2 years, my school's music department plans a big trip somewhere down south. Last year, we went to NOLA. In December, we are going to Disney World in Florida. If i remember, it costs around $900 to go on these trips with the school. I have so many other things going on that I may or may not be able to make this trip even worth going.

Bonus problem. I'm trying to fit work into my already busy schedule. I plan on cooling down on a lot of my activities so I can fit a part-time job to make money for all the things I want to do. College will be a whole other story (long story short, I plan to take out loans and pay them off with my career job)

Now that you read through my problems, I can now ask for advice. 

My situation is pretty unique, but it feels so common. If anyone has had any similar experiences like me (committed to too much, need to pay for things, losing lots of time and patience in the process) can you just give me advice on what to do from here? Like I mentioned in the beginning, i'm only a high-schooler with little to no experience in the real world. This is kinda my first real world problem i've ever faced, and I just can't figure it out all by myself, it's just not possible with the size of my problem. I'm not asking for money, or any kind of service. All I want is to know i'm not alone in having big chains of stress constantly tugging me. Any and all help is appreciated. Feel free to send this to anyone you may know who knows how to help people out with things like this. CoViD-19 has halted everything, so that makes things slightly easier to manage (I am constantly at home with lots of time to do work and think) Thank you SOOOOOOO much for taking 10 or so minutes to read through my problem.  Once again, all advice is helpful.",12May2020,1
997,"So I have a toxic roommate. He would constantly say everyone doesn’t like me because I have a resting bitch face and I look mean and he keeps saying that people are so nice to him and work and such like that. And he would just continue saying how much they don’t like me and that our friends would talk about me. I would confront them and they would say they never said these things and stuff like that. He also has his mom involved with the apartment which is under my name only. I was going to move back with my mom last month but I couldn’t because I had to give the apartment a 60 day notice so I was like nvm then, I’ll just stay, it’s better and easier. After that, his mom started calling me selfish and I only think about myself and how come my parents are involved and his they raised me wrong. 

It bothered me but whatever until I had to take time off one time so I didn’t go to work, so he was forced to take Uber Bc he has no car. His mom started saying how come I couldn’t take him to work. Mind you, work is 30 mins away and 30 mins back and it was 6 am as well. She started saying how unreliable I am and how she’s worried that he’s here living with me and stuff. She also said that I understand his situation with rent (he can barley pay it) but yet I don’t do anything to help him. She kept saying how irresponsible I was and how I don’t have the mindset to make money and how I didn’t even take him to work back when he was at Walmart so I’m just selfish and all I care is me me me. So she just kept talking and talking about it for weeks and I had a breakdown with my mom in the call the other day, I already have bad anxiety and it was getting better until this happened. So I guess I just feel hurt and disappointed because I did a lot for him actually. I got him the job at amazon and took the test for him and not once had he said thank you, I would go buy groceries everyday, and I would honestly help him with his issues. I’d be lying if I said I felt like I’m not appreciated, I don’t like saying what I did for people but sometimes I do get annoyed when they don’t recognize. Maybe I’m being a bit of a hypocrite or dramatic but it’s like I’m pressured to go to work now, I don’t even feel comfortable at home. 
I had a really bad breakdown last 2 days with my mom because I just don’t know what to do. I know you should confront him and stuff but whenever I get close to mentioning it, I would have a lot of anxiety and I would just not say anything.

I confirmed it with him several times to make sure that he was dedicated, and yesterday he decided to drop out the moment I shared my written plan with him. Literally, once I shared my months long hard work with him, he dipped. And mind you, he is my best friend.

999,"Job frustration

I need to vent and I'm also looking for advice and opinions. I finally landed a job at a law firm that I've desperately wanted to work at for a while. I originally applied for a position in litigation, but they thought I would be a better fit for an intake position. I accepted the job after I read the description; however, the job duties are nothing like what was described. The job description placed me under the impression that I would be scheduling appointments, answering the phone, gathering facts about the case, and working directly with our lawyers. The problem is, is that it's actually nothing like it was described to me. All I do is sit and call potential clients all day, most don't even answer. I started in early March then a week later, we had to begin working from home due to Covid. I've had very little training and I can only perform the bare minimum, which makes me feel like shit. It feels like I'm incompetent, and that they're not impressed with me. Even though my job incompetence is a result of a lack of training. There's help when I need it, I just can't get immediate assistance when I'm stuck at home.

Please understand that I am very grateful that I have this job during this pandemic. I really am. Please don’t bash me, I’m down enough as it is. I'm still very passionate about Law, I'm just frustrated. I need this job because it pays well with insurance benefits and I really need law firm experience, so quitting isn't an option at this point. I don't know how to cope. I have bad anxiety and depression, which I had to quit treatment and medication for because I turned 26 and got booted of my parent's insurance. I'm trying to stick it out until my new insurance plan kicks in and I can continue to get help. I'm hoping that it'll get better from there. At least until I'm there for a year and I can look elsewhere. I'm pretty disappointed.",12May2020,1
1000,"So i’m a ninth grader and I check out books at my highschool frequently, i’ve always been good about reading them and bringing them back in fast and i’ve not once had an overdue book.

So to start with, I live by myself, I work for a major communications provider in the UK and I earn about £1,2K per month. By the end of the month I normally have about £150-£300 available (not including my £500 emergency overdraft).

I have had a passion for photography for several years, and it's now time I would like to sell these photos, however, it will cost a lot. I'm not sure if it's worth it.

I am using squarespace as a domain, I'd like to get a business subscription with my own person domain but they are charging about £230 for the year (if I pay in monthly instalments that will go to +23% and I won't get my domain).

Not only do I want to get a domain, but the I would need to buy some stock for images I'd like to sell, buy a couple of canvas frames for each photo (like 6 max) which would probably cost me at least £100. I find it's easier just to get them canvased and ready as not many people want to buy digital copies.

1002,"Straight males specifically. I’m not afraid of them, like I could speak to them and we could get along fine it’s just I’m M17 and bi. I’ve experience good friends of mine turning on me and leaving me after finding out. I don’t make a big deal out of my sexuality and I never usually talk about it because imo it’s not important to anyone other than who I date/find attractive. I only have one straight male friend now. 

I never had many due to the fear of them turning on me and due to the fear of them finding out I’m not as attractive to females as they’d think I was. I’m more attracted to males so that’s where that issue comes from. 

I really hate it though. Because the majority of people in my school are these straight men. I rarely speak to them because I hear their homophobic jokes and granted they are just jokes and I know if they had a friend who was gay they’d be fine with it (I think) I still have a fear of getting close to one and them hating me. But by not speaking to them or trying to be friends they hate me anyways and think I’m an asshole because they don’t know me. 

I’ve completely wasted every year of secondary school since I was 12 not talking to people because now all those people hate me, have hear ideas about me and no matter what I do now they’ll still have those ideas. I’m terrified of speaking to them because Ik how they feel (this is for females too) even ones who are so nice and who I’d never hate hate me. It’s my fault though I’m the one who didn’t put the effort in and thats why it’s so frustrating.

Right now I’ve got 4 female friends and one male friend. A small group. The guy doesn’t even go to our school anymore since he moved. I love the girls but I feel so stupid. Just feel like that “gay best friend” even though barely anyone knows I’m bi. I hate going out with them and being the only Male. It’s honestly embarrassing to me to be in that situation. Because people just get these ideas of you right away. Every time I get asked “do you have any guy friends?” I get so upset and embarrassed. I hate the fact all my friends are females but I love my friends. 

I don’t get why I’m like this I just want to have a group of guys who I’m close to and who can accept me and not give a shit about who I wanna fuck (unless it’s them lmao) to just hang out with them. I always tell myself “I’m out of school in another year, once that’s done I’ll have more chances, a fresh start to make friends with people who don’t have ideas about me, who never knew me.” But I don’t trust myself to go through with that. I know for a fact that I’m just as likely to be terrified and not speak to people again just as I was at 12.",12May2020,1

Anxiety or is it my jaw (tmj, tmd)

Is tmj causing changes in my face ? Or am I overthinking

I’m 21. So for some reason mainly this year the past few months I keep thinking my face has changed. I do have tmj and clench when I’m in angry or when I’m stressed also have Bruxism and tmd. Sometimes in my sleep. I think this is a long time thing but worse at certain times.
Lately I feel like my face looks weird. My chin looks bulgy and longer ? 

I have an ovalish face shape! It’s not long long but I feel like it’s getting longer.
I’m getting braces soon! I don’t have a severe underbite but my chin does protrude very mood like it’s more my bottom lip. 

Recently though I feel like I look puffy ! I’m not sure if that’s a bit of weight gain. I’m a skinny person but I feel like what if it’s not face fat but my jaw changing! 
But
My boyfriend saw me after 2 months today and thinks I look exactly the same except for getting more fuller cheeks! He actually said my face looks shorter and the fuller cheeks look nice! My mum said the same thing. She said I looked more healthier! Which is weird I’ve done nothing but sleep all day cause I’ve been so depressed lol. 

Even my friend who I saw after months says she saw no difference !! 
But I don’t see it!! At the same time I don’t know if I’m just tripping. I have bad bdd! I did lost weight last year and was trying to get my face fat back ! I think it’s back but part of me feels like I look bad or the fat is different ? Another part of me thinks I’m getting a square face. 

When I open my mouth I see my massester muscles clearly!! and it looks so bad! I have figured out ways to not grind in my sleep! But I’m scared I damaged my face and it’s already changing! 
What if it’s changing and no one can see it yet. For now it’s giving a “fuller cheeks” illusion but it’s actually something else!!!

Also feel like my lazy eye is getting noticeable !!!
2 weeks ago I felt fine and thought I looked actually normal but it’s started again!! 
I keep taking photos and analysing it! 
My boyfriend sees no difference and says its my 
Anxiety and bdd playing! And the tensed jaw muscles are making me think it’s growing when it’s not !!!
I feel like I look sad when I have a serious face like I look stoned !!! 

I still have a slim face but I’m scared it’s getting puffy looking! 

Right now my jaw feel a bit stiff and now feels like it’s placing itself forward!!! Idk if it’s my anxiety !! 
I’m so scared to eat foods, sleep!! I’ve been avoiding trying to dress up or even wear make up as I feel like it doesn’t suit me anymore cause my face !!!


If I do have these changes can u reverse them ???
Is it permanent?

I’m so scared 
I also have 2 impacted low wisdom teeth I’m getting out soon as well as getting braces!!! 

I’m worried That I’ll need jaw Surgery!!! 
I suffer from bdd and I went from analysing my face shape to then looking at my chin to see what bad change I have! 

My boyfriend is usually able to reassure me but this time I feel so confused!! He says I look the same and he sees no difference or bad change at all!! My mum doesn’t either !

Today my eyes also looked a bit out of place! My right eye (which used to be my good eye) is now going upwards ? But in a more odd way like it’s out of place ! My left eye (least fav side) looks more normal than my right !!!


My bottom tooth seems have also moved forward as it’s touching my top tooth badly !!! 
I’ve also started chewing on both sides idkk if that I ruined my face",12May2020,1
1006,"For the past two years I've been in college and I used that as an excuse for not pursuing relationships despite suffering from loneliness that I'm fairly sure has progressed to being chronic. But now I've graduated and I'm still not ready. I know what the issue is, fundamentally I lack confidence and as a result I don't believe I'm worthy of love, even at my core. I've been talking to a counsellor for months now about it and I'm trying to deal with it.

But in the meantime, this loneliness is degrading my motivation, my sense of accomplishment, and my health as a whole. I'm continuing the chats with my counsellor but I need more than this, I need someone else to talk to. More specifically I lack any female friends and I've found that I can talk to them about things I don't talk to my guy friends about. There are certain things girls just seem to understand better or have more perspective on.

So, I thought I'd get on a dating app and just look for friends but from what I've read online, that's horribly ineffective. The alternative then would be to go on an app dedicated to meeting new friends and maybe that's what I should do but part of that doesn't seem right for me either. The thing about dating for me is that I want to be friends with them before it goes anywhere. I thought that potentially looking for friends could start that process once I was mentally ready. And deciding to take a friendship further would be unfair to those on an app for making friends who are only looking for something platonic. I don't know really what to do, and I know there are flaws in my thinking, but the loneliness is doing a lot of damage right now and it's impossible to ignore anymore. I'm just trying to get out of my comfort zone for once and do something.",12May2020,1

Hello everyone. I’m not sure how much attention this is gonna get or if it’s gonna get any attention at all but I’m in a tight situation that I do not know how to get out of.

I went to a fairly large middle school and had a lot of friends and after 8th grade, they went to a high school near it, let’s call it DHS. It’s a similar school with a large amount of kids. The main focus there is Athletics. The sports teams there are very prominent. Basically everyone who went to my middle school went to DHS because of the convenience. 

The only problem that I’m facing is that my parents won’t let me go to DHS with all my friends despite living so close I can be picked up by the bus. My grandfather works at a school of the same district and tried convincing my mom to let me go to DHS but she won’t let me. I really miss seeing my friends and my girlfriend on a daily like I did at my middle school.

Let’s call the high school I attend LHS. It is a very small school, probably small enough to consider a private school. LHS is mainly an academic school. This is a problem within itself because I’m a basketball player and a track and cross country runner. Unfortunately we rarely win any games and meets because our school focuses on academics which isn’t the slightest bit what I’m interested in. The main problem is finding friends. I have been very lonely at the school maybe hanging out with 2 or 3 friends everyday. I can’t seem to make friends no matter how social or nice I am to people. It’s honestly heartbreaking to me how I could have had a much better life at DHS but instead my mom chose to put me in LHS. It hurts not being able to win at the sports I like, be with my friends, my girlfriend, and everything.

I might be overthinking it because I’m just a freshman but isn’t high school supposed to be where you make some of your best memories? Sometimes I just sit there and feel down about how I have really no friends. I thought this would be a good place to go for my current situation. I’ve never done this before even though I’ve had reddit for quite some time. Thank you for reading!",12May2020,1
1009,"TL;DR I'm a second grade eletrical engineer in Turkey and I want to quit school to begin devoloping my own video games

So first of all some background, I'm a 21 years old guy and currently studying electrical engineering in an average university in Turkey. I've always been passionate about video games and all sorts of technological devices so I thought that electrical engineering would be appropriate for me.

Now that I'm a second grade student I saw that i almost learnt nothing at school and I began to question my future. I thought that university would be crucial to learing a job's essential stuff but i think I can learn 10 times better even if I just watch some indian dude on youtube.

I don't want to spent another 2 or 3 years to finish a school that I think won't be productive for me and I want to dropout of school to learn about game development and begin devoloping my own video games or work at some game devoloping company. If it was up to I'd already do it but my family thinks that having a degree is crucial but I don't think that I can study two more years. I'm begining to be quite depressed and I lost my focus on school already.

He has autism and schizophrenia, probably other problems and hasn't been on his medicine for awhile. Refuses to go to the hospital. He's driving everyone crazy, right now he's screaming, slamming doors and other shit, banged on mine and I've always been nice towards him but I will get ugly if he does it again.

Not my family but I live and pay rent here. We aren't physically strong enough to put him in the car and there's a big possibility that he will get violent.

And I have ptsd from abuse so I wouldn't be able to stop myself if he started hurting one of them. The family might not like how I would react but I wouldn't be able to just stand there or walk away if one of them got hurt even though I'm a tiny person and definitely can't overpower him.

If anyone has a suggestion on what to do, PLEASE let me know. He just needs to get his medicine.

1011,"I‘m about to finish my first Bachelor in Business but am not really enjoying the stuff I studied, it doesn‘t feel like the subject I see myself working in in the next 40 years (yeah Business is a very wide subject in different industries but there‘s nothing I really enjoy doing).

1012,"About a week ago, I felt something on my foot a few minutes after waking up. I took off my sock and at first thought it was a scab or a wart (started freaking out when I thought it was a wart), but after pulling it off I looked closely and to my horror it was a tick. It was at an odd angle though as it wasn't flat against my foot but sort of slanted upward like a scab that was coming off. Also it was not full of blood, there wasn't any blood. I began to freak out because I really fucking hate ticks. It was most likely on me as I slept so it could have taken it's time doing whatever ticks do.

Over time I did scratch it a bit although I tried to avoid doing that. Also it formed like a roundish pimple-looking thing that looked poppable so I squeezed at it a bit, but nothing came out. I might have done this with a little too much force and inflamed it or something.

Now sometimes when I wake up that spot itches. It is now darker than the surrounding skin, I think because I squeezed and scratched it. I didn't scratch it open though.

Should I be worried? What's the worst that can come of this? I am paranoid about this.

1014,"Hi,

I need a foolproof way to make my relationship crumble, I mean, it has to really explode and disappear to never come back again, ever.

My girlfriend is very persistent and never takes a no for an answer. I say I want to break up and she begs me a hundred times not to, threatens to hurt herself, says that she would never recover...hell, once actually got down on her knees asking me PLEASE not to leave her!

So the talking and being honest part, which I tried several times, won’t work here, so I need to make her HATE me, or something close enough for her to end things with me. This is my last resort before I just ghost her (really not wanting to do this because she’s pretty unstable and unpredictable).

Rules: 1 - Nothing physical. I just want to hurt her feelings (jf I could do this without hurting her at all it would be great tho); 2 - No cheating. If she finds out I cheated I’m 100% sure she’ll kill me (literally); and 3 - Gotta make it very clear that things are OVER.

Any suggestions?",12May2020,1

1016,"I had my dental crown replaced a few months ago and haven't been happy with the shade of it. It's not bad by any means but it doesn't look the way I wanted it to. I asked my dentist if she could redo it (and offered to pay again of course) but she told me she wouldn't do it because of the risk of the underlying tooth potentially breaking. 

I didn't completely doubt what she said, but I also didn't completely believe her, because I felt like she was mad at me for wanting it redone after it was permanently cemented. I also went against her advice and chose a different crown than the one she suggested, which I think bothered her. My dad went in to see her during his appointment and brought up the subject again, but she stood by what she said. 

I sent her an email last week asking if she'd reconsider. I was expecting a no, and I would have understood, but today she replied with a long email saying that she'd been thinking about it a lot and that she'd redo it. She laid out the risks and the worst case scenario of the tooth breaking- I'd need a removable denture until I get an implant. So obviously this would cost a lot more money on top of the crown and would be an annoyance. I'd be able to pay for it with a credit card but I don't exactly have a lot of disposable income. 

Am I crazy for wanting to proceed with this? I know it's a risk, but life is about taking risks in my opinion. And I know as a medical professional she has to inform me of them. It would suck if this happened but the crown also bothers me pretty much every day. I did not realize my tooth was in this state until now so it's a shock.",12May2020,1

I am told this all the time by other people who would have no reason to lie to me. But subjectively I just cannot believe it. I don't feel attractive at all. Even at my most fit, I've felt like an ugly slob. I've never liked having my picture taken (I still don't) and I really don't like looking in the mirror. A recent break up has exacerbated this, and despite losing a lot of weight in the past two months and really getting back to working out frequently, I still feel this deep, sinking disgust with myself and how I look.

1021,"This may seem like a strange thing to ask advice for but I really don’t like who I’ve become after being in a relationship with someone who was emotionally abusive and manipulative. 

Before I met my ex, I was the most caring and empathetic person. If anyone came to me in a low mood or if they felt sick, my first instinct was to be there for them and look after them until they were better. I loved helping people, it just came naturally to me. 

Unfortunately my ex abused this trait of mine. He would constantly come to me sulking like a child over the smallest things, like for example if he had to talk to someone he didn’t like at work, or for one instance, when a woman on the bus was breast feeding and he came home to me ranting about it as if her breast offended him. He was immature, to say the least. 

But it was constant. It was every day. He would make an issue out of anything and he would sulk (and I mean literally sulk like a child) over everything then come to me like I was his therapist. I tried my best to comfort him and be there for him but most of the time I just wanted to roll my eyes, pull my hair out and scream. He was a master at playing the victim to *everything* as if the whole universe was out to get him. 

The worst is whenever he was sick with a simple cold or flu, he’d treat it as if he was dying while expecting me to mother him and if I didn’t, he would get insanely angry at me, accusing me of not loving him or caring about him. 

Eventually I stopped caring altogether. I was just an emotionless husk until I eventually snapped when he got angry at me for being depressed. I went to him for help, for comfort, like he did with me a million times and what did I get? Shouted at. For expressing my feelings. That’s when I left his sorry ass. 

It’s been a year since then but I still find myself feeling those same feelings of dread whenever a friend comes to me feeling low or sick. My first instinct now is to instantly roll my eyes, back away and not get involved and it makes me feel heartless. I love and cherish these people so much and this is how I react to them when they need me? Why am I like this to others?

Is this just me or did my ex shape me into this? I hate this part of me so much.",12May2020,1
1022,"Hey reddit sorry if this is long I’ve never been great at keeping posts short lol. So two weekends ago I went to hang out at my moms and help them move my stepdads (we’ll call him John) house as they are now consolidating to one household after they got married and bought a house together. While we were loading up his stuff his stepson came to help with the moving and John asked him if his job was hiring. He said yes and that he’d help me get a job there. Before I had went I decided with places slowly opening up I’d use the weekend and onward to quit smoking pot so I could get a job but wasn’t expecting anything so soon. Cut to last Wednesday I went to fill out an application which turned into a tour and I got a job offer Friday and my first day was yesterday.

When I went to fill out the application they explained it might be awhile before they would have me do a drug test because of everything going on. I figured that would give me enough time to let it clear from my system and secure the job, but then yesterday the person having me do the paperwork comes up to me in the middle of my shift telling me I had a three day deadline to schedule and do a drug test. I thought with other drug tests I’ve had to schedule I’d be able to pick a date so I could have more time and find help getting to the drug test but that isn’t the case.

Currently I have no money so I wouldn’t even be able to get fake pee and no one would be available to help me within the given time frame of 7-11 or 12-2 up to the 14th and even if I could I would almost likely fail. So I guess I’m here because I have no idea what to do. I don’t want to make the person who helped me look bad and I don’t want my parents to be mad at me. I’ve low key dropped that I smoke because it’s almost Impossible for me to sleep without it and it helps me with pains I’ve had since getting hit by a car. I was ecstatic that I was finally going back to work but now it feels like it’s all going to be taken away as fast as it came with what feels like inevitable disappointment.

I also don’t know what to do about my job. Should I mention that I’d have more time to figure how I’d get there? Would it be suspicious if I asked to hold off until at least my first paycheck so I can pay to get to the testing location? I want it so bad and I don’t want to just not show up anymore.

1024,"To start, I’m (18F) a full time student about to end my first year in university. Sorry in advance that this post is very long, I feel as though there needs to be a lot of context.

For nearly my entire life, I’ve lived with very controlling, easily tempered parents. So easily tempered that when I was born, my mom had my aunt take care of me in the Philippines because I wasn’t planned and she was worried that my dad would lash out on my sister or I in a fit of anger. I moved back to America with my parents when I was around 3 years old. 

My dad has always been bad tempered but my mom has now become more bad tempered in the past few years, sometimes worse than my dad. 

Some examples of my dad’s behavior:
- When I was around 6 years old I was crying because I couldn’t fall asleep and my dad punched me in the gut
- We went fishing when I was in middle school and I got the line caught in a tree by mistake and he just got so mad that he threw the whole fishing pole into the river 
- In high school, my family went on a trip to Niagara Falls and when we came back my dad couldn’t find his medication and he tore through all the suitcases and couldn’t stop yelling and blaming everyone in the house that we forgot his medication back in our hotel... his meds were on the table in the room next door

Some examples of my mom’s behavior:
- Whenever she gets angry with me, she calls my friends and tells them why she’s mad at me, often telling them too much (most recently she called my best friend telling her she wants to kick me out of the house and isn’t afraid to smack me)
- She demands to know everything and anything I do at all times and has said that I should not leave my campus at all without her permission
- She hit me a month prior staring college because I was defending my friends who she called bad influences that would get nowhere in life 

Now here is some context of some events that have happened in the past few months:

In February, I began working at a hospital as a clinical care technician in their ICU department. I’m in my first year of nursing school so I really wanted this job so I can get good clinical experience and also just some money in my pocket. (I get paid nearly $18 per hour.) I told my parents that this was a seasonal job because they don’t allow me to work during the school, however I’ve been going to work throughout this semester without them knowing. They believe that I’ve just been staying at my dorm on campus.

In the same month, my boyfriend who lives in a trailer lot moved out of his parents’ trailer and into his own and I’ve been staying with him more than I’ve been on campus, so we’ve been living together.

In order to get to work, I bought an old car from my boyfriend’s dad for $300, registered it under my name, but changed the address of my license so that any mail I received about my car would go to the address of the trailer, not my parents’.

In the wake of COVID-19, my parents wanted me to come home, but I came up with an excuse that my campus was still allowing housing, so as of now they believe I’m still living on campus just in my dorm building by myself when I’ve actually been staying with my boyfriend and I’ve been going to work. 

Unfortunately, somehow, my parents received mail about my car regarding airbag security and to calm them down in the meantime, I told them that I rented a car to drive to a volunteering event a few months ago. They were angry about the fact that I “rented” a car, but they would’ve been much more angry having known I actually bought one to go to work.

Now here is my issue:

If it wasn’t for the fact that my parents pay for my education in full, I would’ve already left. They are expecting me to come home next weekend with information about a car rental that I don’t have. I’ve been lying about everything I do for a while from simple things such as trips to the city to big things like working and staying with my boyfriend and eventually all these lies would’ve fallen apart. 

My question is if I should just come clean and not go home and completely separate myself from my parents. I have $6,000 saved as of now.  The pros of this are that I can keep my job (that I missed two full in-person weeks of school for, that pays well, and gives me great experience), I can keep the private life that I’ve been building with my boyfriend who is the love of my life and has been nothing but supportive of me (we have been dating for over a year now), and I don’t need to keep living my life as a lie. The con is that I lose all financial support for school. Is this worth it to separate myself? 

TL;DR: Should I separate myself from my parents who are my only financial support for school in order to keep my job, my personal life, and good mental health?",12May2020,1

1027,"TL;DR: Was really good friends with my roommate before moving in together last year, she became super bitchy and passive aggressive which made me resent her. Not sure if I want to fix the friendship or drop it.

Last year I decided to move in with a good friend of mine from school whom I’ve known for 4 years now, thinking it would be all sunshine and rainbows. It was fine for the first few months but then my roommate started getting on my nerves and it became distracting and just really annoying to live with her. 

Some of the things that really annoyed me (of the many):

\-She would complain about me having friends over on the weekend. My friends and I would only be there pre drinking for an hour and then we would leave and she could have the apartment all to herself the rest of the night. She would claim that she was having trouble reading her leisurely books on a weekend night when she has so much time to herself alone in the apartment all the other days of the week, as I worked much more than her and she was only doing odd jobs, so she would always have the place to herself since I’d always be out of the house. 

\-She was super anal about cleaning. She would bitch to me that I needed to dust the bathtub, dust the bathtub? I don’t know anyone who dusts their bathtub when it’s in use every day. She had a problem with me leaving my socks in my own shoes that were on the show rack. I think I am a fairly good cleaner. She says she’s allergic to dust, well the way I see it, if you want the wet bath tub to be dusted, you can do it yourself. 

\-I supply all the toiletries in the house. All the toilet paper, paper towels, all provided by me. She also uses a large amount of tp too, don’t know what she does in the bathroom. She’s even used my food supplies (used up a whole bottle of oil, my spices, butter, etc…all hoping I wouldn’t notice. I’ve spent way too much money on things that she’s used most of. Never reimbursed once. 

\-She was rude to my bf. My bf is the sweetest guy ever, very friendly to everyone. He says hi to her and her bf whenever he’s over and sometimes he gets ignored. She’s complained to me that she hates his voice and that it’s so low it just penetrates the walls. I think I have the right to talk with my bf in my own apartment during the middle of the day. I never complain about her bf, so not sure why she is saying this stuff about mine. One time my bf and I were watching a movie in my room and didn’t hear that the door knocked. Well when we came out later my roommate bitched and gave us attitude about us not hearing the door and answering it, when she was right there in the living room the whole time just relaxing. 

\-She would constantly knock on my door to have “roommate talks”. These talks would usually just be her complaining about something or asking to use more of my things (my hairdryer, my laundry detergent, etc..)

\-She has this tendency to just be passive aggressive sometimes and it makes me uncomfortable. 

Bottom line, it got to the point where living with her made me miserable, annoyed and the great friendship we once had felt like it fizzled out. Living there had become a burden and it was difficult to really be able to focus and be happy in my own apartment. 

Fast forward to 2 months ago, I decided that it best to temporarily move back to my parents’ house so I could focus on studying for my nursing licensing exam. The event that prompted this decision was that she chose 2 weeks before my exam to just verbally attack me. She laid it all out on me, and was really passive aggressive. She started saying that it’s annoying when I invite friends over on the weekend (I do this once or twice a month, and I work hard, so sue me if I want to unwind with my friends in my own place), started saying that sometimes when my bf comes over she hears sex noises. We try really hard to be quiet. I figure grow up, it’s just sex, not like I haven’t heard things from her room. She just had so many negative things to say to me, I just felt so attacked and was already feeling so stressed and over the edge because of my upcoming exam. I even told her that week that I apologize if I seem antisocial the next few weeks, I’m really trying to focus so don’t take it personally. But she just took that as an opportunity to bash me when I made it clear I’m not in a good state of mind. I ended up crying and not coming home that night and decided to pack up my things and leave that weekend. That was it for me at the time and I needed space away from her. Prior to leaving that weekend I tried my best to avoid interacting with her or leaving my room because of how horrible and upset she made me.  I continued to pay my share of the rent and internet while I lived at home for the 2 months.

The crazy thing here is that I feel more peace here at my parents’ house than I did at my apartment downtown with my roommate, and I originally decided to live with her to escape my parents. I happened to drop by the apartment last week to just get something and to my surprise, her bf had fully moved in there and all his stuff was everywhere. Meanwhile I was still paying rent and internet. This got me so furious, but I didn’t say anything, I just got what I came for and left without saying anything. How dare she move her bf in without telling me, it’s like she thought that since I was gone temporarily that she could just do whatever she wanted. The place was also a mess with dirty dishes piled high. It was infuriating. 

She had reached out to me a few weeks ago to ask how I was doing. I engaged in conversation with her begrudgingly because I felt like I had to. I was able to voice my side of things, but she only apologized for a few things and refused to acknowledge some other things that concerned me. She basically expressed that she was jealous that when I moved downtown with her, I made so many new friends that I was hanging out with and not being as social with her. She said she valued the friendship. But tbh. Why would I want to be social with someone who just complains, brings me stress, and who uses all my stuff? I wouldn’t. I forced myself to tell her that I’d like to work this out and that I value the friendship and we should talk about this when I decide to go back to my apartment. I thought after a few weeks I’d be more willing to forgive her for everything, and stop being as mad and resentful towards her, but I haven’t been able to. In fact my level of resentment has just increased with this time away from her. Now I don’t know if I want to work things out with her and keep the friendship, it’s a shame since we’ve known each other for 4 years, and everything was great before moving in together. I would move out of this apartment and get away from her but I was the one who chose this place and I love the apartment so much, and not like I can tell her to leave. So I’m really stuck on whether I should try to resolve things and “be friends again” despite me feeling so much resentment, and maybe hopefully bide time for her to want to leave and I can have the apartment to myself, or I should just go with how I feel and tell her I really don’t feel like working things out after everything that happened? Am I overreacting? Or are my feelings justified? 

Thank you in advance for any advice!",12May2020,1
1028,"I’ve been so bored during lockdown, I’m working from home but have literally 10 minutes of work to do throughout the day and that’s it otherwise I’m sitting in front of a computer for 8 hours moving a mouse every 10 minutes so my Skype doesn’t show up as away. 

Anyway I’m quiet arts and crafty does anyone have any ideas or advice on anything I can make/do at home to possibly sell online during the lockdown? Making extra money right now would really help as I’ve started donating some money to charity and would like to make some more and also spend some of it treating my baby brother to some things because he’s been taking this lockdown so well. 

Honestly I’m open to anything even if it takes a while to learn I just want something to keep me occupied (not sure if I have a learning disability but I struggle to concentrate sometimes but when I find something I’m interested in time vanishes) it would help a lot to keep my brain working and control my anxiety and getting some extra money to donate to charity and spend on my family would be nice too.",12May2020,1

1031,"I broke up with my ex a few days ago but we live together. We moved in February just before all the Corona stuff started happening and since then he hasn’t paid me a single dollar in rent and he also doesn’t have his name on the lease so legally he isn’t obligated to stay here. His dad can come get him to live with him but it may take upwards of two weeks. There is no friends he can stay with (and even if there was he’s physically refusing to leave my apartment) he’s kept me up all night just to spite me and while i don’t have any physical marks on me at the moment, I really might kill myself if i have to spend another day with him. I really don’t want to call the police, as awful as he is I’m not sure that’s what he deserves. If i can’t make him leave by force is there anything I can do that won’t involve police ??",12May2020,1

1033,"Friend will be called B
I've known my best friend for 4 years and we are inseparable. She's seen me at my lowest and at my best. About a month ago mentioned B she wanted to move to Arizona which is quite far from where we live now, her younger sister already is moving but she never made up her mind. But today during a casual conversation I asked when her sister was moving. Friend said when quarantine is over, I asked if she was going with and she said yes. I was beyond shocked hurt and all other sorts of emotions. I then said I didn't know she made up her mind and B said ""well I mentioned it on my birthday that I was thinking about it"". We then got in an argument how I wish she would have told me without me asking. B told me she doesn't need my permission to move. I never told her she did all I said was i wish you would have said something. We haven't spoken since and its killing me. 

How can I explain how hurt I am that she didn't tell me?",12May2020,1
1034,"I had previously posted about my supervisor asking borrow money and I went to HR about the situation right before our lobbies were shut down due the a safer at home order.    Now the situation has been addressed and she is still refusing to be civil at work and has gotten our Branch manager on board with making comments about the other Branch manager.    I don't know what do at this point, I'm sick of hearing how terrible the other manager is or incompetent they feel he is because he and his staff meditate each morning.      The other position is still open however my branch manager has said I can not move branches because of COVID 19.    I'm at a loss for what to do but the way I am being treated and they are speaking about someone they don't know is causing me a lot of stress.

1035,"idk if this is the place for this kinda question but it seems pretty fine.

So recently my bestfriend had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and she is currently in a really low patch, just broke up with a toxic boyfriend and is starting to take rather 'sexy' photos of herself to send to strangers which she never did before (she really hates her own body) and just overall really depressed and unmotivated to do anything. 

Getting back on track to today..she disabled her Instagram account, unfriended be on discord (I tried sending more but she came online and declined) idk if she is just trying to get some space or cutting me off because she doesn't think I should get involved? I'm just worried about her mental state but she is blocking off all means of contact and I'm scared of texting her because she will probably block my number. 

Is there any way of knowing what she is trying to do? or any tips of what I should do?",12May2020,1

I've been iffy about telling because my aunt is super religious and I've been worried my family would disown me.

My aunt recently invited a bunch of family members to a virtual Bible Study and it feels like everyone and their mom agreed except me. I don't want to force myself to be in there but at the same time I don't them to start barreling me down with questions like where was I?",12May2020,1
1038,Let me start with I have never had a package stolen. Today I had a $200 package stolen (speakers I had been saving for). My wife was home and waiting for a doorbell and was with my 14 year old and one year old. FedEx did not ring the bell or knock and an hour later there was no package. I called FedEx and the lady who was helping had a thick accent but it sounded like she was doing something and I should get a call. What should I do next? There was an amazon package that was delivered as well but it was on the porch and was delivered 5 minutes prior (according to amazon). Please help. What do I do next?,12May2020,1
