0,"I’ve always been a pretty nerdy kid, being really passionate about physics and economics, and very competitive in academics. I’ve never really been into sports, but I still enjoy going to the gym. I’ve never been really popular, but I still have lots of friends.

My father often criticizes me for my shortcomings and often in demeaning ways. For example, when I was in 4th grade I was not in the best shape. I wasn’t exactly overweight, but I had very little muscle. He would repeatedly call me fat and flabby, and I had extremely low self esteem because of it. When I go out with my friends, he calls it a “sausage fest” because there weren’t any girls or calls my friends nerdy and tells me to hang out with “cooler people”. He compares me to my cousins and family friends, who have girlfriends or are better at x while ignoring our different schedules, work loads, interests, etc. 

My school assigns very heavy summer assignments. I had just finished a 10 page paper for my economics class, and was watching tv to decompress when he came home, only to ask “Are you going to sit on your ass all day?” When I still had online classes, he repeatedly told me that I did nothing all day and would be furious after he “busted his ass all day” only to come home to a messy kitchen. I had a 45 minute lunch break, and I had to make lunch for my sister (who had a 20 minute break) and mother (who was in meetings all day) and eat during that time period. As a result, the kitchen was a mess, and I usually didn’t have time to clean outside of putting perishables back into the fridge. I was still in class by the time he returned home, and it was very embarrassing to be doing a presentation, only for the entire class to hear him shout “THE KITCHEN IS A MESS!” 

When he was home, all he did was criticize me for “sitting around all day” and not having a job.

When I tried to get a job, he wouldn’t let me apply to the ones I wanted to (my options were limited by me being a minor and that I was busy with other things, only being able to work at most, 6 hour shifts) because they were  “unmanly”. One was at a puppy training place and a second was an internship.

Staying away from him isn’t really possible with the pandemic, so that isn’t an option. When I tell him (and I try to be polite about it) that I don’t enjoy being constantly berated, he responds by telling me to get in shape, a girlfriend, less nerdy friends, or a “real” job, or by saying that I’m ungrateful, or if he’s in a really bad mood, he will shut off the internet or take my devices (which I needed for school) away.",22Aug2020,1
2,"So my best friend and I have been friend since 2016. We were so close, pretty much roommates at times during college. We eventually became bar regulars in our town, known for being messy (let’s be honest). During our friendship, she did take advantage that I had money (pay for food and drinks CONSTANTLY) and used my place to stay more than normal. 
In 2019, I started to date my Significant Other (SO) and stopped going to bars and being messy. My best friend started getting upset, saying that I’m not there for her anymore and that my SO changed me (just because I don’t want to start drama anymore). It’s super offputting as she knew where I lived (had a key), had my number and like 6 different ways to contact me. But I let it go
Covid hits. So I quarantine at home with my SO. my best friend doesn’t talk to me as much, almost not at all. We used to talk multiple times a day pre-Covid, to maybe 1-2 times a week (in the form of a Like on social media) at this point. It’s pretty much dead silence. In June, she invites me to a bbq but I tell her that until quarantine ends, I can’t go to anything. Then it’s back to dead silence. We’re at the point, not even a “like” on social media, while she posts several times a day. 
First of July, I move to another state (she knew I was moving for 5 months). Says nothing. Nothing happens. Now (mid August) I get a message from a common friend saying that - she’s so upset that I dropped her friendship, she’s so distraught that I didn’t see her before moving, she’s destroyed by our friendship ending, but she’s not willing to contact me because she’s so sad (???). Common friend suggests I talk to my best friend because it is apparently messed up that I don’t. 
Meanwhile, since May, I’ve been very depressed that maybe my best friend wasn’t really my friend, since she won’t talk to me. I’ve cried a lot about it. (Had prior friend abandonment). 
I honestly don’t know what to do about this. She knew all my information (moving, pre existing conditions preventing my covid interactions) but never talked to me. She never reached out. Never communicated to me. Honestly what should I do? I feel manipulated to reach out to her, since if she really cared then why not talk to me?",22Aug2020,1
4,Everyone just leaves their ex friends on me and I’m not sure why ? all my friends were dumped by a popular girl who didn’t see them as clique enough or were kicked out of a group or because they were just an unpleasant personality to be around and they all came to me? Did they come to me because I’m an easy target and I hate being mean to people or am I just gullible enough to take on peoples unwanted friends because I can never say no. I need to know how to start saying no to bad people and people who overstep boundaries in friendships..when I hate saying no to anyone and don’t like confutation.,22Aug2020,1
5,"A few weeks ago my friend and I were texting and he mentioned that he loves Chick-fil-a, even though they donate millions to anti-LGBT organizations. I was really confused at first, because he knows I'm a lesbian, and he's never been mean or unsupportive about it. So we keep talking and after a while he basically says he doesn't care that they're homophobic and he's ok with it. He said that ""it's real good chicken tho. and it ain't that big of a deal that they donate there. like who cares bruh"" Maybe I'm just overreacting, but it really hurt. I decided to distance myself from him for a while and this morning he texted me again. ""I haven't seen you on ig and i think your acc got deleted so are you ok? Haven't heard from you in a while"" And that threw me off because does that mean he still cares about me? Am I being a bad friend for getting upset at this? The thing I need advice on is should I just forget it and keep being friends with him or not? I'm really confused and I don't' know what to do.",22Aug2020,1
6,"My friend (I thought she was my best friend but I don't know now) has always gone through phases of being an amazing friend, fun, wants to hang, makes plans and sticks to them, etc. 

Until suddenly she doesn't. She stops reaching out, when I reach out she takes a long time to reply. If I try and make plans she won't commit or say no, leaving me hanging. I've told her repeatedly that this last thing in particular drives me crazy and she always apologizes and says she'll be better. The last time we talked about it, she said that I'm the only one in her life that has a problem with it, everyone else just understands that she has no idea what's going on in her life for more than an hour in advance. I find this hard to believe but didn't say so. Then she said that if we have these sort of plans and I get another offer, I should do that thing instead and cancel with her. This seems extremely rude. I make my plans on a first come first serve basis, to cancel to hang out with someone else, even if those plans weren't fully made, doesn't sit right with me. 

Then another thought popped into my head. Is this how she treats me? She won't commit because she is waiting to get another offer?",22Aug2020,1

9,"So I know how cliche this sounds but I went to a small party and I suggested to the guy hosting it to make a group chat so we can all get to know eachother and he said it's too soon to the party so probably not worth it. (Bit of backstory so he said I can invite a few people so I invited 3 of my friends) I find out at the party there was a group chat and that I wasn't invited so he told me he thought I was gonna make one for all my friends I was inviting so I thought fair enough but I find out one of my friends I invited was in it from the very start.

Im not trying to make friends here but want advice on how to make them if that makes sense-

Hi, well as the title says I want to make long term online friends. I’m in a subreddit for friends and made one (so far solid) friend who is currently on vacation and so I thought I should try to make more.

I don’t have anyone irl who I would call a “friend”  and my undiagnosed social anxiety isn’t much of a problem online so I try to stick to what I’m good at.

I have a poor track record with friends, I made posts and some times they are boring, and sometimes they are average which I’m fine with but it can be un motivating to start a new conversation which makes me feel bad because I’m the one who wants friends.

I don’t know what to do, obviously it’ll be tough to find someone who wants to be my friend not because I’m a girl but because they too want friends and are fine with my personality.

I just want to find someone I can talk with until 5am and send weird pictures to (once I get comfortable with them) and not hate myself afterwards for whatever reason lol.

Any ways I can go about on a quest that won’t be pointless?",22Aug2020,1
11,"So last week this 25 year old Black woman messaged me on a dating app - she messaged me because she related to my faith and creative hobbies...

And my goodness, her pictures were incredibly attractive... cute face, great voluptuous body with great legs and huge breasts... 

We exchanged numbers a day later,
texted a lot and talked on the phone twice, and she's super cool...

She told me her instagram and per my request, sent me many photos of her without a filter, photos that she says look exactly how she does in person and dang, she's very attractive.

Apparently she gets a lot of attention from guys, but they usually want to just hook up with her unlike me...

She likes me and we have plans to meet up in person soon, yet I find myself hesitant...

after scrolling through her instagram I found a few photos of her here and there, and they look incredibly different from some of her other photos...

like I would say downright very unattractive photos... these were from like 2015 and 2017...

she told me that growing up she didn't really know how to dress well, and just dressed in an overly modest way, but also she wore no makeup  and her hair was way different and she looked super unattractive...

her photos these past few years literally looks like a different person, which has me skeptical even though she sent me numerous pictures of her without filters...

she told me she's not hiding anything.

I mean those super unattractive photos were from like 3-5 years ago, but idk what's going on? 

I find myself hesitant now, but I do have trust issues. I just hope she looks how she does from her pictures.",22Aug2020,1
12,"Not sure if this is the right place to ask.

My sister had covid so I asked my boss if I could use my sick hours to get myself tested and quarantine. He said ok and that he’d use all my sick hours I had accumulated.

2 paychecks later, he hasn’t used them. I put in my two weeks notice last week so I will be leaving this place in about a week. He  hasn’t responded to my email of resignation.

So right now I’m a bit worried that I’ll be leaving this place without using the sick hours I was told he’d spend.

15,"So I’m a merchandiser for a vending company, and basically on my route there is this one store where the store director is a massive asshole. He is completely unreasonable and rude. I’ve been doing this route for a year now and I’ve basically been his verbal punching bag for a year. The problem is that I only have so much room for my backstock but it’s not enough space because my salesman sends in too much product. The store director doesn’t care and wants me to stack it “up to the ceiling” well first off that’s a safety hazard and probably an OSHA problem and secondly I’ve done this in the past and everything has collapsed and fallen over. It’s happened multiple times. It happened yesterday as a matter of fact. I called my boss and told him what happened and he said that the store director can call him if he has a problem. He assured me I wasn’t doing anything wrong. Anyway today the store director and I got into an argument and I told him to call my boss and he said I don’t want to call your boss I want you to do what I told you to do. At this point I was livid and swallowed my anger. I wanted to walk out but I didn’t

anyway I’m having a lot of anxiety about going back to that store. I’m afraid I’ll snap and cuss out the store director or something. I’d rather not go back to that store. I literally am shaking and am super nervous and angry. I want to tell my boss in the morning that I really do not feel comfortable going back to that store. I just can’t do it. I don’t think he’ll fire me but it’ll put my boss in an awkward situation. I was going to ask if I could just switch routes with someone or if I could pick up a different store and someone else could go do that store? I don’t know, but I can’t even relax right now because I’m worried about tomorrow. It’s pretty bad.

20,"ok, i rent a room. i am behind on rent. i have suspected that the people i live with have been poisoning me. why? three theories: 1) because this person (who I will call X) told them that i have a mental disability (which I do have) so it would be easy to victimize for kicks, also an element of revenge might be in play from X because people are petty and X was acting super sketchy. 2) because certain family members who possibly tried to harm me and hold vengeful thoughts found out where I live (I cut off all contact with them) and paid (or whatever) the people i live with to harm me 3) they are involved in this gang stalking campaign against me that has been going on for a while, quite sure that something fishy has been happening at least. of course, any or all combinations of above are possible.

25,"
Hello! So I’m 18 and recently got diagnosed with OCD. I suffer from depression and anxiety too. I’m still very new to this illness and not very educated on it as it’s all foreign to me. So, my OCD seems to be very specific and detailed that I haven’t been able to find much about it online, nor find anyone who is going through something similar. 

So, my OCD is that I can’t shop at any other supermarket other than Asda. The thought of eating pasta, milk, cheese, chocolate cake or anything from any other shop other than Asda absolutely horrifies me. So, for example - I can only eat Asda branded cheese slices, only drink the green cap milk from Asda, and certain brands of cereal make me wanna vom. My recent ‘obsession’ (?) is that whenever I order from a takeaway or go to a shop such as B&amp;M and a bottle/can of a drink is in a foreign language - I cannot drink it. A huge fear of mine is Lidl and Iceland - the thought of even buying food from there makes me want to cry. I can deal with certain foods from Tesco, for example, but it’ll only go as far as a meal deal.

I’m moving out next month for University and I have to bring cutlery, plates and bowls etc from home so I will actually eat. Another problem I have is cleanliness. I struggle eating at foreign houses as to me their kitchen is extremely dirty and I’m not sure where their food is from. I’m also scared of the temperature that the fridge is going to be in my shared University accommodation. 

This is only a small fraction of my fears and anxieties. I’m still learning about myself and this illness as I always pinned it down to me being a childish fussy eater.

I guess the reason as to why I’m here is to find some comfort. Does anyone suffer from something similar? I would love to have someone to relate to. Dropping a reply would mean the absolute world to me. Thanks in advance!",22Aug2020,1

28,"First off, this is a throw away account. English isn’t my mothertongue so correct me if i make any mistakes.

Okay so me (M19) and my GF (19) are together for a good 6 years and are very happy with each other. 2 and a half years ago we decided that we would be comfortable with doing a threesome (M/M/F) but we were not sure where to start and with whom. Me and my friend (M20) (Let’s call him Mark) are very close friends for over 8+ years. We’ve shared a lot of things together and never had any problems with each other. I was there in his time of need and he was there for me. 

He’s my only close and best friend. I have a hard time making friends that i can trust enough to call them close friends. Mainly because people tend to pull of some shit i dislike and to a degree that i cut them off completely.

I felt comfortable with letting my GF have sex with him and me and asked if he was okay with it. He isn’t very open but i am and explained to him that he could do anything he wants with her when im there etc. 

We had a great time and did it a couple more times. All went off without a hitch until he turned towards snapchat with my GF. (My GF is very transparant and tells me everything)

It started normal but my GF noticed he want to exchange nudes. I said go for it. I trusted him completely and i know he will not make any screenshots etc (iknow it’s risky, but we took the risk). I found it already weird that he did this without asking permission to me.

Fast forward they did exchange nudes a couple of times until Mark asked my GF if she wanted to meet. I was baffled and told my GF that she has to say that i’m not allowed to know anything from the meeting, to see how he would react and if he would let me know anything. But he was cool with it.. i still said ok to my GF to meet to make her happy, even tho she wanted not because she felt bad for me but i had no trouble with it at all. It just bugs me he didn’t say anything to me.

We stopped for a year. Still met him but never told him i knew about it and he never told me. It went bad with my GF regarding our relationship and broke up for 2 weeks. In those 2 weeks we were still talking a lot and were open and thrustworthy towards each other. Mark heard we broke up and asked what was going on to me and my GF. He then proceeded to talk to my GF and if she wanted to meet. (Most likely to have sex)

I lost it. I broke all contact with him without him knowing. We still had a streak on snapchat but i just didn’t want to speak to him anymore. Everytime he texts me i ignore him and he asked what was wrong. After hearing the question for the 30th time i told him everything. That i knew about it and that i never thought he would go behind my back to have sex with my GF etc. 

He apologised for the time he had sex with my GF behind my back but did not apologize for wanting to meet with my GF in our break-up period, saying that his intention is different than i thought it would be.

I told him i need to think about if i still want to be friends or if i want to cut off communication. I need some advice what i should do. Should i keep him as my friend. I know i can never trust him again the way i did, but we’ve had a great time and a lot of memories. I’m going into the same soccer team with him and we’re in the same university. Help!",22Aug2020,1

31," I 21m) dated my ex girlfriend (21f) two years ago. We were both each others first loves and were young. We had a lot of fun, great times and the sex was the best ive had. There was a lot of mistrust because we constantly brokeup or fought and got back together but tried to make eachother jealous when we were separate. We broke up for the last time after a bad argument, she used to walk away during arguments, show up late on dates, and send me manipulative texts from her and her friends phone so i blocked her. In the end she wanted me back and I refused. I was heartbroken and tried to move on. It took me forever to get my piece of mind back. Recently we met at school at a mutual friends and were very friendly and flirtatious, nothing happened we had fun. Then our school shut due to corona.

During quarantine she has been sending me long paragraphs saying she loves me and wants closure and she misses me and wants to meetup. We even talked on the phone multiple times about life/ our breakup. She was very flirtatious and i liked talking to her. She asked to meetup and i was hesistant and said i need time to think but when i was drunk i said sure, later to say i need time the next day. She flipped out. Although she has been flirty and kind, she has also been pretty rude and sarcastic at times and even blocked/unblocked me because i told our mutual friend shes being mean. Shes like this i assume because shes hurt

The thing is i cant get her off my mind. She asked me 4 questions for closure and i answered them. She responded saying shell do anything for me and that i can always call her. I feel sad because im hesistant due to trust and past hurt. I saw her on hinge and it made me very sad and brought back all my old feelings of missing her. Any advice please. Am i wrong for not wanting to see her/ talk and maybe something physical, im going to school soon so will be 2hours away.

Tldr: ex from 2years ago wants to meetup, im hesitant due to trust but still have feelings and saw her on the hinge dating app, she looks beautiful. I still care for her but feel hesitant",22Aug2020,1

To be fair, I had NO IDEA those things were going to happen. If anything, Netflix should be blamed for marking an obviously TV-MA show as TV-14. To put this in perspective, Aggresuko is also TV-14 and the only ""bad"" thing it does is swearing), so now I'm only allowed to watch TV-PG or younger. That's fine and all with stuff like She Ra and Kipo, but after that, the entirety of Netflix starts to become boring FAST. Like, in the TV-14 purge, HALF my list became unacessable to me. She should have just blocked Kakegurui tbh but maybe she thought 

Should I talk to her about it? I'm very scared to talk to my relatives about parental control stuff (I chickened out for months before I told my mom that her parental control device was preventing me from using E-shop at all) and I don't want this conversation to get me in trouble... But if my 18+ siblings get to watch TV-MA stuff because they are over 18, then I should have a right to watch TV-14 stuff because I am over 14. It's only fair that way.

It's weird since my sister knows I watch other TV 14 stuff like My Hero Academia (which has onscreen gore too) and allows my YOUNGER SISTER to watch a TV-14 show (Inuyasha) so I feel like it is very unfair that my sister should do this.

Then again, my other choice is to keep quiet about this and download a free VPN, allowing me to stream whatever I want, but then there's a risk of being logged out of the family netflix account which I am scared of since I don't know the password.",22Aug2020,1
33,Hey. I know this is out of the blue. But do you ever hate the silence. Like I have a million and one things that I want to talk about but the people I hang out with aren’t like minded. So we talk about things that don’t really seem interesting to me but I try to understand listen and learn. But when I bring those things up later they just look at me with blank faces. So I just sit there and listen to them talk but the words are muted in my head and I’m there siting in silence. Any advice?,22Aug2020,1
34,"Whenever I hang out with anyone, I start copying them and I don't even realize it till we are done hanging. I've noticed that my life I just changed myself to the people's expectations. I usually don't notice it till it's been awhile. maybe it originates for my fear that no one actually likes me. Is there a way for to make it easier for me to spot this so I can stop it earlier?",22Aug2020,1
35,"He hasn’t done this in awhile. He’s about 6 years old and he’s a inside dog. He’s potty trained but lately we will randomly smell pee smells on the edge bottom of the couch. And just now he peed on my daughters ball toy for no reason like he’s marking his territory. We have a girl dog also and he has a brother so we have a total of 3 dogs but we had the problem when we first got them years ago. 

Why is he doing this all of a sudden? What can I do? He’s potty trained but I’m not sure why he decides to pee on things in the house like the edge of a couch.",22Aug2020,1
36,"So with Covid rampaging around the globe, and my grandmother unable to return home, she is currently staying with me and my family, sounds like a great idea? Well... that's what I thought at first. So ever since she began staying my mother told me to treat my grandmother like a guest. Meanwhile my grandmother is also trying to push the boundaries of her independence, especially when my mother had explicit told her not try being so independent (My grandma is 71, Btw. Not exactly in her strong years...) So my grandma tries to do things on her own even when I try to offer my help and in doing so I get in trouble from my mother for not doing my best to help her. 

And also when I get told by my mom to do something that is for my grandmother's best interests, and my grandmother opposes it, I end up getting caught in the crossfire, between two oppsing forces, even sometimes my mom even threatens to take away all my electronics just because I didn't help my grandma to the best of my ability despite my grandmother acting as stubborn as a bull.

It's been a long lockdown, and I wish I could do something about this, I'm physically, mentally and emotionally drained, and even waking up to a new day in which I have to face the toil of two opposing forces in my family at home is taking a toll on my my mental health and my academic ability in keeping up with school.

Please help. I need some advice, idk anymore whether it is me who's in the wrong, and how can I keep my sanity together let alone in my own house especially with both my grandmother and mother being under the same roof.

Extra Note:

Plus it's not like I can tell my grandmother to get on the next flight home because my home country's border is currently shut. And it's not like I can walk outside without being told to go home because of the lockdown.

I wish I could move out but I don't have the financial capability to do that nor the educational experience to get a job in the field I want right now, let alone I don't even have the means to get up on my own two feet.",22Aug2020,1

38,"I’m so tired all the time and I don’t know what to do. I just don’t care about anything anymore and I don’t know how to stop or honestly if I even can. It’s not that I don’t care about people’s wellbeing’s or feelings or situations but things like eating, spending time with people, my birthday, etc. None of it feels like it matters anymore and I’m tired. I’m not sad I’m just apathetic about it all. Or maybe I am I really don’t know. I don’t know about anything honestly. Anything to do with me or my life I’m just over. I don’t want to kill myself and honestly don’t think I ever will but I am passively losing interest in my existence. My boyfriend and I are fighting all the time and that makes me really sad and alone. My family lives in another town but I really feel like it wouldn’t matter one way or the other of i was there or not. They’re not mean or bad or anything but I just don’t think it would be a great disappointment if I stopped talking to them or coming around. My job is great, it pays well but it’s so depressing sometimes and so much all at once and lately I’ve thought about just not going to work anymore. I feel like everyone is going to tell me I’m depressed but I don’t think I am I don’t know. I don’t feel like I’m depressed or like what a depressed person should be like. I’m fine I guess. I just feel detached. Like someone turned off a switch and it won’t turn back on. Just off, empty, nonexistent, void. I don’t know. Maybe I am just sad.

39,"First of all, I think my dad needs to spend less time with me. He keeps trying to talk to me, and I don't like talking to him, because he asks too many questions. I just give short, one-word answers, but I still don't like to be around him. Yet he always gets really close to me all the time. He keeps touching my hand or my shoulder when he talks to me, and to be honest when anyone does that to me, I feel very harassed. Maybe my dad is kind of creepy, or maybe I'm just not an affectionate or physical person.

Also, my dad has zero respect for me. I need alone time every now and then, but my dad doesn't  understand that. He always wants to talk to me, and I don't want to talk with him. I don't see eye-to-eye with him on most political or religious issues, and I don't feel close to him. Sometimes, I feel like he's more of a stranger than a family member. 

The worst thing is that my dad is like a monster when is angry. He yells at everyone when he is angry. Literally even a B on a test or forgetting to take out the trash is grounds for him bursting into anger. He is so scary when he is angry. His brows get really wrinkled, his face gets pinkish-red, his eyes get bulgy, his volume exponentially increases by the second, his hands clench into fists, he stomps around violently, and he either makes me go to bed super early (like I mean 7:00) as punishment or he lectures me and scolds me into the night (like 1 or 2). He does this each time I do anything to make him angry. Even when he is angry at my mom or one of my siblings, he vents his anger on everyone else, including me. 

I just wish my mom would divorce my dad. He does not deserve to be a dad He does not deserve to be married. He does not deserve to be around anyone. At least my mom doesn't interrogate or inappropriately touch others or get angry over everything.",22Aug2020,1
40,"My first sign of scoliosis was in 5th grade. When it was the yearly check up nurses do to students. I never thought anything was wrong. But when they started calling students in, I suddenly felt like something was wrong even before the nurse saw me. When I bent forward for the nurse she told me what I was afraid of. A very small curvature. They called my mom to notify her but in that time I needed more growing to do before any action is taken. (That’s what they told her). As the years went by, it got worse and worse. When I started high school and did more activities I felt a little pain here and there. Especially when I got my period it was painful. But nothing so bad that I couldn’t tolerate it. (I like to believe I have a high pain tolerance) I also saw doctors but I jumped through them. Not many of them were optimistic to treat me nor follow up nor give me resources and everytime I would leave an office I would get depressed. The worst one was where I waited for almost 2hrs. The doctor saw my xrays, looked at me and said “yeah there’s nothing you can do. It’s too late.” And then left the room. That was 6 years ago. Money was also a factor. Throughout my school years my family was never financially stable. Fast forward to the recent years, it’s gotten worse. I get more pain, I hate the way I look and I hate looking at myself in the mirror. I only want to wear baggy clothes. Whenever I see girls wear cute clothes on tv or music videos I can’t help but think “I wish my back looked like that”. Even just looking at my mom and sisters I think those thoughts. My parents got separated and my mom owns her own successful restaurant and I’m blessed to finally feel financially stable. But I still feel like surgery is out of my reach. I have 2 fears: 1) never having enough money. 2)surgery. 
Everytime I look into surgery. Doctors, process, procedure, cost, post-op, risks, I cry. And I cry. And I cry from being overwhelmed and scared. I’m a 22 year old girl in texas and I often feel lonely. I try not to express my emotions to my mom to not worry her. Neither to my older sisters because they never want to understand what I’m going through (I’ve tried). Please I’m just asking for advice and comfort from anyone  :’( 
Have you ever gone through a major surgery? 
How do you come to terms with something so life changing? 
P.S. you don’t have to sugarcoat anything I’ve heard the worst especially from my dad. He’s out of the picture. 
P.S.S it is an embarrassingly big curve  :(",22Aug2020,1
42,"I’ve wanted to be a streamer for a while like (like 4ish to 5 years?) Unfortunately, my parents never really supported it and my dad said something along the lines of “since I’m a girl, it would be embarrassing to him because all the popular girl streamers are only popular for their tits”

I tried streaming on just my laptop, I got 15 followers and 4 of them were regulars, but the setup I had made it very hard to interact with them and they all stopped watching eventually. 

I stole my dads old laptop out of our garage and tried to hook it up to my school provided laptop (because it’s they won’t even buy me one) so I could have a second monitor but it had Windows 7 and took 24 hours to go up 1% on the Windows 10 download so I figured that wouldn’t work either.

I’ve tried saving money, I’ve tried asking for things for my birthday and for Christmas or other holidays but it never worked. 

I’m a semi-classical (mainly symphonic/concert) musician. I’ve got a few colleges after me, I’ve been a featured soloist at different universities since my sophomore year, I’ve composed pieces for our high school choir and my parents think this is the only interest I have since I’ve done music for around 12 years. Yeah, jt is my main interest but I’ve tried explaining to them that I have others but they just come up with excuses like-
My grades aren’t the best (I’m an A-B student), 
I should be practicing (sure, but at this point it’s overkill), 
I need to go hang out with friends and be social (but... I thought I was supposed to be practicing?),
I’m not mature enough, (I’m literally one year away from being a legal adult),
I’ll ruin my future, (that’s be pretty hard to do at this point)

I finally decided to give up for about a year and recently during quarantine I’d been getting back into the thought of streaming again and when my little brother found out he decided that’s what he wanted to do as well and told my parents. They bought him a brand new computer, a new gaming laptop, a new xbox and they got him a second monitor. But don’t worry. He face me his old Xbox 360 with sims 3. I have to get my own controller though. 

I’m happy for him sure, whatever, but then I remember that he is a D average student, he sneaks out to smoke weed, he popped random pills in the school bathroom last year (ended up being birth control), and he is only in EIGHTH GRADE. Yet I’m the one who’s not mature. The most trouble he’s been in for anything was being told he couldn’t call his friends for a week but he still had access to his phone so he called anyways. I got grounded off every electronic, wasn’t allowed to see anyone in person, and had to go straight to my room after dinner for 2 MONTHS when I was 15 because I wanted to leave homecoming early because the amount of people there made me anxious. I have been begging for years to get the stuff he got by asking for once.

I know my parents still love me, I’m not saying they neglect me or only give him attention, but I feel like they never listen to me. Am I in the wrong? Why am I being held to different standards?",22Aug2020,1
43,"I (14m) grew up in a lutheran family, but later in my life i started to stop believing in god and other things like hell and heaven, i told my sister which said i would get kicked out, i was scared and then a few days later, my dad was talking about religion (which was very uncommon) and he was talking about islam and Allah which i said was the real god (as they say in there religion) and he said in a very aggressive tone
“WHAT?!” Which scared me a-lot more of breaking out about me being an atheist. 

Im very scared about breaking out and saying I’m an atheist and don’t want get kicked out of my family and becoming an outcast and a terrible example of what i was in later generations (I’m not overreacting i really think this will happen) what do i do?",22Aug2020,1
44,"I work because I have to. I accept it. I'm not looking for a handout. I've just come to the realization that in my area, Charlotte nc, I literally cannot afford to pay rent on a regular job, which is making me feel the pressure to make a ""career"" move.

Right now I'm just a hibachi cook. I used to do tricks for people when we were able to have dine-in customers, now I just cook to-go orders. It's work. Either way, no matter what happens, I'm going to be a slave to someone or something I don't care about, doing something that I don't want to do, in a place I don't want to be, so I might as well do something that doesn't kill my spirit when I leave work too, right? Which is why I stick with my current job. It doesn't bother me too bad. It's hot, there's nobody to talk to who speaks English, the work isn't engaging, and the money all goes to the owner who can afford to put two kids through university where I cannot afford to even feed half a kid. But I mean I can manage to force myself here every day to do the work and my work is satisfactory. I'm just making the most I can make in this job and it's not enough to afford to live.

I know I can pursue something in school because I'm willing to slave away at something for no reason, but it just doesn't make sense to me to work so much harder than I already do just to still be in the same position where I hate my life and I hate working and I have no reason to do it other than money, except it'll be more work and more money. Doesn't make sense to do something like that, especially considering I hate the idea of wealth and success and the pursuit of money in general, I think it's morally corrupt, greedy, and evil and if that's how I gotta live, I'd rather have not been born.

So with that all being said, is there anywhere that I can afford to live and just work a regular job? Keep in mind I also owe over 10k in high interest personal loans that I had to take to keep my head above water back when I didn't make enough money doing hibachi, so factor in the idea that I'm also probably going to be a lifelong slave to debt because the interest comes on just as quick as the minimum payments so the amount never goes down, if anything it's just steadily increasing.

Where should I go from here? There's literally no reason for me to be alive. Don't worry about me committing suicide though, being unwilling to do the best thing I could do for myself is my behavior pattern so you definitely don't have to worry about me offing myself. It's more likely that I'll go get my GED first and I can tell you that's probably never going to happen either.

So yeah where can a lazy high school dropout with no family, no dependents, no education, very little experience in a dying field, no ambition, no drive, no interests etc afford to live on the bare minimum without hating it as much as I would hate going to school for something I didn't want to do either?",22Aug2020,1
45,"Whenever I experience things that are really unusual although not unexpected I feel like I’m not really there, like I’m kind of dreaming. It happens a lot more strongly when I’m tired or if the experience involves a lot of people. And it doesn’t always happen with bad experiences, like disassociating usually seems to (if this even is that), in fact it mostly happens with good experiences. For example I’ve just been on a really really fun school camp, but I felt quite disconnected, especially on the way back when I was so tired. I felt like I was quite likely to say whatever was on my mind and to express my deepest thiughts and feelings which is totally out of character for me. The whole thing seemed kind of dream like. 
Even now that I’m at home I feel like I’m still kind of on camp, or just not really here, like I’m too lost in the memories of what has just happened. Is this normal? And is there anyway that I can try to bring myself back to reality/ground myself when this happens? It’s like I’m aware on too many levels, like I’m aware of what I’m experiencing, and I’m aware that I’m feeling disconnected, and aware that I’m aware that I feel disconnected.

My mother disagreed and I applied to Howard and was accepted. It was my first choice and I was excited to go. When I told my friends they were excited as well and even expected stories from while I was up in DC (I write stories and my old campus loved my writings) 

My problem is....a majority of credits I had weren't accepted here and im a freshman all over again and my benefits are running out. I try to keep positive for my mom, friends and siblings but now my depression is kicking back in full force (I've had it since i was 14... now 20) and my body hurts with countless tears, running nose and less will to carry on. 

This is my second night crying because I want to go home and I suspect so much more. My whole life has been uprooted again. I miss my friends because I found real ones who love me and now I feel more alone than ever... they say ill make more friends and i get that but as a military child i was happy with something stable. life really doesn't seem that great and this isn't the first time i didn't want to wake up

I wouldn’t be opposed to this but he had (and still has) horrible anger and control issues. he wasn’t a terrible boyfriend, he always did nice things for me and was super sweet (when he wasn’t angry). He got along with my family and female friends. It was just the anger that scared me. i was constantly scared he would get angry at something irrelevant and lash out at me for it. He’s never hit nor or anything but i was scared it would happen, and if he did it would be horrible considering he’s 3 times my size. He tried to control them but it felt like i was constantly walking on eggshells. I couldn’t say certain things or hang out with certain people because I was scared of what he could do. He also has pretty bad depression and anxiety. I have spoken to him a few times and he says he’s depression has gotten better now that we’re on good terms and are able to talk to each other. Recently he’s asked if i would take him back. He’s also been saying that he’d be much happier with me back as his girlfriend.

Advice? I don’t have the karma to request and I’m not even sure I’d be comfortable with that. I’ll try and keep it simple. I’ve been a stay at home mom for 4 years on and off with two boys. I try and work meaningless temp jobs wherever I can but it leads to factory work, and  me ruining my mental health and physical health. I know that I cannot complain as these are the repercussions of my own choices. However, it has recently came to my attention that my partner is feeling overwhelmed and like I haven’t been trying to pull any weight financially. Little does he know that I have applied for 49 jobs since January of this year. (No joke, I have the receipts) due to my lack of education, gaps in work history. No employer gives me a second look. I have been trying for years to put myself in a better standing to be in a professional role and yearn to be called by my birth name, anything outside of mom, or babe. Sounds selfish I know. Again I chose this, don’t come for me there. I am coming up on 25 in December and I know it’s not too late for me. So anyway, after those 49 attempts I finally got a call back, it’s my partners sister place of work. She has worked there 16 years so she went through all the hoops to get me there. They sent me an offer and I accepted the position to work from home. They’re providing the equipment, I provide the workspace. I have nothing, no money to buy a desk, chair or headset.

56,"  I don't know if this is important enough for r/advice, I hope this is OK. Here goes.

 I have an Italian greyhound named Jojo and I love him more than anything. A few years ago I got a cat, a Siamese-tabby mix from the shelter named Roll. She was very sweet at the shelter if a little shy. Now that she's out of her shell, she's playful, attention seeking, loves pets. She's also a *bitch*. She'll wack anyone who walks by if she's in a bad mood. She spends a lot of time out in our big yard (far away from any road, ok) and loves to chase birds and squirrels and stuff.

  I thought after a while the dog and cat would eventually get along. Not so. The cat will chase the dog, which, I assume, is just her playing. She wants to play. Jojo, when he gets riled up, will also try to play. But she's whacked him a few times and he's a pansy. He cries like a banshee and sometimes he gets tiny little marks where her claws got him. I keep them supervised and they have separate rooms they usually keep to themselves in. Issue is, not always. Whenever the cats around, Jojo won't go within a mile radius. It used to be I'd have to be inbetween them for him to feel safe, and then he'd be able to move. Now, he cries from other rooms so I can carry him into my room. He won't walk into a room she's in. If she comes near him, he screams, which pisses her off more, and she'll try to attack him more, etc.

  All the info I can find online is introducing new pets to each other. I did the correct steps when she moved in, introduced them slowly, etc. But it's just been getting worse and worse. My cats always pissed off and my dog is always scared. It's not a good situation for either of them.

 I don't want to take my cat back to the shelter, two years later, just because it didn't work out. I'd feel like a complete monster. Everyone says you shouldn't abandon a pet under any circumstances. I love the cat, too, but the dog was there first and is, tbh, a different bond. The dog is my son, the cat is my roommate.

  Does anyone have any advice on what to do? I want my pets to be happy and my house to be calm.",22Aug2020,1
57,"I have known this friend for a few years and I have recently met his parents when I was invited to a trip with them which I thought went well and my friend had told me his parents didn't seem to mind or dislike me and thought I was respectful. I felt I had left an okay impression but that soon changed. Not long after I was invited to that friends' house for a party. There was a lot of drinking between the adults and even some of the teenagers there. I personally had a rough past with drinking and have lost a relative to a drinking related health issue and had many with drinking problems which really effects my perception of it today. His cousin, who was 17, kept pressuring my friend into drinking saying things like ""Your parents told me to get you fucked up"" and ""Tonight it is my job to get you plastered"". He kept denying her and also refused to participate in drinking games which I also did as well. Not long after my friends' dad was talking to my friend saying I was a wuss for not drinking and I was being a buzzkill and ruining the mood of the party and he openly mocked my families' past in front of my friend. His mom was more sympathetic about the whole things with his family members trying to pressure him into drinking but I felt like his dad was being an asshole about the whole thing. How would I go about confronting his dad? I don't want to leave this as something I pretend to not know about and I don't really feel the need to chew him out in front of his family but I want to make sure he knows I wont tolerate this kind of behavior in the future.",22Aug2020,1

59,"So I had sore spot underneath my breast and like a normal person went to look at it. When I looked at it I just thought it was some kinda pimple and popped it. But there was a lot more pus then the usual pimple so I kinda thought that was weird and went to google it. (Like if it was normal for pimples to have this much pus). And it said I had a boil and it said “not to pop it because it can get infection” and this is where I panicked. So because of the pandemic going to the doctor would be a bad idea and my dad just found out he had a tumor. Getting infection would be really bad right now, and it’s kinda being to sting  I already put warm water on it from a now cold toilet paper and I kinda don’t know if I should be really concerned right now. I told mom she said she would put peroxide on it when she gets home (I still live with my parents) and she gets off from work at 11:00 pm it’s 9:00pm so I don’t know what to do.",22Aug2020,1
60,"This started when I saw an eye doctor Sacramento Country and got two prescriptions that didn’t work for me, from two different doctors. 

I net visited a new doctor in Sacramento, California. I brought one frame and extension of credits from VSP Insurance for 2017. After two follow ups and not having good results, I was told to get eye surgery done and they promised to communicate with VSP to have the the glasses redone after surgery. After the surgery, I went back. go back to the doctors office and was told they can’t help me. 

Optician B who had promised to have them redone was moved to a different location branch. I called VSP for help inquiring if they were informed about my surgery and was there any communication from the office about the redo of the glasses. VSP said no communication was received from the Dr.’s office. 

I go to the second location to speak to the Optician B and she profusely lies and claimed the conversation we had before surgery. Good thing, my boyfriend was always with me during all of her conversations and he was the witness. Now the manager W gets involved and confirms she will help me resolve the issue.

In December 2018, I am asked by manager T to use my 2018 benefits for Dr’s visit and new frames/lenses and once we found the good prescription, her office would update my frames and glasses from 2017 at no cost to me ( After numerous back and forth conversations and promises that she made and forgot). Glad I kept the record of her all conversations because it happens to be a routine of them forgetting.

January 2019

We have the good prescription and glasses are updated (with the free redo from VSP) yet the frames are broken by their optician when changing the lenses. They order the new frames and put the lenses in the new frames. I went home and the lenses were foggy, called the office and was told that when they put the lenses in the new frame, they heated them, and that messed up the lenses. Office told me they will order the new lenses for me. I took the pair of  glasses in and asked for the foggy lenses to be saved (Good prescription) while they installed the new replacement lenses.

I was later informed that these lenses were lost by the office manager W, and they have no idea where they went.

Then meanwhile, I get the email that my glasses from January 2018 that were being processed are updated to the good prescription and ready to be picked up. I go in, pick up the glasses, upon trying them I can’t see right and I am dizzy with headaches and blurry/double vision. I call the office and they tell me they checked the prescription and there is nothing wrong and I should wear them for two weeks.

After complaining about the side effects I am told this  because the wrong prescription was filled  that’s why I am getting the headache/doubleVision. I go into the office to sort things out, and it turns out  manager W doesn’t know what the good prescription is.. I give her the right prescription from my copies and hope everything gets straightened out.

December 2019

I want to use my 2019 benefits for  VSP.  I pick sunglasses covered by VSP, hoping all seems good since they finally have a good prescription in their possession. When I get the sunglasses, I am having the same issues, blurry vision/headaches/dizziness. I wear them for two weeks. Upon calling the Dr.’s office, I am informed that they had made a mistake and put a wrong prescription in them again. Now I am calling VSP to help them find the good prescription because clearly the Dr.’s office’s head is dancing with their ass. VSP promises to send me the prescription from December 2018 (Good prescription). I never received a copy of that prescription. 

January 2020

I get a call from manager W, that they have found the good prescription and she will make sure all the glasses are redone accordingly but they will try one frame at the time, any changes will be fixed free of cost.

March 2020

The Dr.’s office informs that they lost my frames and have ordered  new frames hence there will be a delay in processing. Then Covid-19 shelter in place starts and things are delayed.

April 2020

I go to one of their open locations and pick up the glasses. The manager W promises, everything has been examined and is good to go. I pick up the glasses and my right eye starts to hurt and I am getting headaches, yet I try to use the glasses for two weeks to follow the Dr’s office instructions. I email manager W and ask if they can reexamine the lenses because if it’s the good prescription from 2018 then I should not have pain in my right eye. I am asked to see the same doctor I saw back in January 2018, for a brand new prescription., a reset if you will.

A day later, I get a call from the office that my glasses are ready to be picked. I call the office and was told that there were multiple orders placed for frames when they were lost hence all is good and there is no need to worry. Yet I am confused if they found my frames and updated the lenses to good prescription again or not.

August 2020

I see the doctor, get the new prescription and once done with the visit, I am referred to speak of one of the office managers S. He takes me to the main lobby and starts explaining the process and asks for the frames that I picked up. I give him the frame and ask to keep the lenses. He gets upset and wants an explanation for wanting to keep them. 

 I  explain to him the following: 

1- My good lenses were lost in your F branch office

2- Your F office has filled wrong prescription for my glasses twice, blue frames and the sunglasses

3- My frames were stolen or lost in office/lab and then found later

4- Multiple orders were placed and confusion was created for the right prescription

5- I was made to believe that the glasses were done right but they weren't

After hearing all this he gets upset and says he doesn't want to give me the lenes because he thinks I might use them for my other frames and such.  He the back office and brings a sharp tool and scratches the lenses aggressively, destroying them saying now no one can use these lenses, there will be no mix ups and they are doing me a favor for getting my glasses done (not admitting that it has been their fault the whole time).

And also says, **If I have not lied to Dr., when I was in his exam room, the new glasses will be fine!!!!!!** 

Now it’s turning point for me, aside from him being condescending, he humiliated me in front of his staff and other patients. This makes me very uncomfortable to explain to him how accommodating and patient I have been through this whole ordeal. I get upset and after three years of being calm, He and I have an argument.  With a smirk on his face the whole time, he makes sure I am made miserable during the whole conversation for no apparent reason. I leave the office saying I want someone else to help me.

When I get home, compare my eye new prescription from that day and one from January 2018, and find out that both of the prescriptions were almost the similar (Slight variation) that didn’t work in January 2018 pre-surgery.

I call the office in less than 24 hours and asked for a hold on the order because I need to speak to the Dr about the prescription being very similar to the one that didn’t work for me prior to my eye surgery.

The manager S gets upset, he gets the whole office involved and the turns the tables on me. Now district manager G calls me and tells me there is nothing they can do and the manager has every right to say,” **If I have not lied to Dr., when I was in his office with him, the glasses will me fine!!!!!!”** And they use this term all the time!!!! That they have done enough, they will redo one pair of glasses with current prescription no matter what I say, and will not update or redo the remaining pairs like promised.

I email both managers W and the district manager S to make it right like they have promised but the response is the same: they don’t want to help me further and will release me from their services. Today I got the release form and letter from them that states they will not help me further and that I shall not talk to anyone in their office. 

Please help me with this matter, my eyes are suffering after three years of pain and suffering and surgery. I still don’t have a good eye prescription or glasses. I see double when I try to read the computer screen and TV. 

What I want from this is to have them refund all of the money that was spent by me for all of the frames and lenses that are now useless, and recoup the portion that was paid out by VSP so that I can go elsewhere and purchase glasses with that money.

How should I approach this? VSP says that if the Optometrist refunds their portion it will be forfeited as it lapsed. 

They also asked me to email all of my correspondence with the managers to them, should I do this? My experience is that insurance will look out only for themselves.

Should I file a complaint with the BBB? Is there a state board where I can also file a complaint? 

Do I need a lawyer?

62,"Long story short, I started leading a double life kind of online relationship and it’s been four months. I’ve been agreeing to all the things he’s asked like moving to his country and meeting somewhere in the US very soon, even though I don’t feel safe traveling - nor did I have real intent to move to another country for him. 

Today we’re supposed to decide on a state to meet up at and buy the tickets and book the Airbnb but I can’t let it get to that point. Don’t want him to waste money on me if I’m just going to back out. So I want to leave him today. But he’s emotionally manipulative and has threatened to kill himself when I tried to leave before. I know that’s not my responsibility and the best thing to do is leave, but I often choke when he starts threatening self harm.

So original question: do I run and ghost him? Or do I try to explain, or even leave a note?",22Aug2020,1

However, a few weeks ago some shit went down and he said he liked me and I said I liked him the  issue being hes older than me and he has a girlfriend. Now he and his girlfriend worked out their relationship but now hes slowly going cold towards me and getting increasing more rude towards me. Like its a 50/50 whether hes gonna be nice and joke around with me or just be completely cold and not care. He knows about alot of the issues I'm dealing with SH being one of them and he just doesn't seem to care anymore i guess. Like he stills asks if I'm okay and I give the yes I'm fine but he never used ti believe it but now he just doesnt seem to care like hes only saying it for face value. I mean what can I expect though I am saying I'm fine. These guys were my bestfriends but now I just feel so alone and it might just be the fact that I'm growing up and its part of being a teenager but I just constantly feel so sad and its so hard to just do basic things anymore.

He had a job as a book seller (self-employed) and payed tax, but didn't pay his national health insurance contributions for quite a while (this will be important for later). His income is basically nonexistent for the past 2 years. He developed a pretty bad eye problem (high eye pressure/glaucoma) and hardly sees. Me and the family on his side paid quite a lot of money (5+ years of health insurance contributions) so he can visit a doctor, receive prescriptions and get glasses. Now he's depressed, lost a lot of weight and doesn't do anything but sit at home doing nothing. My aunt (his sister) pays his monthly insurance contributions while I give him a weekly allowance, but he developed a smoking habit and started spending it on cigarettes. I try to talk him out of it and make him start working again but he just says there's no point as his eye problem renders him useless.

65,"Hey guys, I'm new on reddit (not that it matters lol), so I had this ex gf back from highschool (5years ago). She broke up with me, so I started ignoring her 24/7 with hopes of forgetting her asap (I kinda succeded on that), I ghosted all her messages and even blocked her from FB. Time went by and I went to university, so did she. 

I eventually unblocked her from fb but didn't add her back, I was curious to see if she had posted any new pics and stuff and I noticed she had got in a relationship (I didn't feel jelows nor ""Good for her""). 

A year went by and a friend convinded me to create an IG account (This was in jan 2019), so I did and then followed her, that was about it until she told me to set a profile pic and if I wanted I could post stories, I guess that's the only reason to have an IG acc. So I posted a couple of pics and some stories of me in a tesla lol (Not mine, my boss' lol). 

That same night she told me if I have had new followers n stuff, I did indeed, people from school and old friends. She also asked me how many ppl had seen my story (She wanted to brag her 200 views lol), it was around 10 ppl and I noticed olds friends, some fake accounts and also my ex gf had seen my story. I told my friend who she was and asked my if she had followed me, which wasn't the case. 

So yeah, I started thinking about her again after all these years and I was just curious to see if I didn't notice something. I also feel bad for ditching and ignoring her during high school, I saw her cry at lunch time and being sad a couple of times. 

Oh and 1 year before the IG thing a friend of her made a post using my ex's account saying that she was looking for someone to go dance to a bar. Someone tagged me and she replied: 😉😉.

68,"For some background, my bf and I have been dating for over a year now. He and my family do not get along due to some shitty encounters ( my family being the main antagonists). 

Currently, him and my sister ( she’s pretty much my best friend) do not get along. He is more quiet/ reserved and when he’s over at her house, he’s very content with sitting off on the side and watching rather than participating. For w/e reason, this offends my sister and she has come to me about his “ behavior” and how she would either like for him to announce he’s in a mood and leave or just not show up in the first place. I’ve told her that if she feels this way, she should tell HIM that and not involve me. She states she feels more comfortable telling me instead. She will also tell me her fears that he is isolating me and that she is just being a good sis by raising the concern. My bf is absolutely loving and adoring towards me. He is a private person though and my family has no boundaries. My family doesn’t even know what the word “ private” means. I feel like a lot of the conflict mainly comes from here. 

I’ve told my bf of our conversations and, understandingly so, he is upset by them. I’ve told him how I defend and try to explain to my sister that she needs to talk to him and not me about it, and he feels like I’m not “doing enough”. He feels that my passive method is not as effective as his more direct method and has made note that I do not defend him appropriately. This hurts a lot because I do defend him. I’ve made it very known that I don’t care for how my family/ sister treats him. 

I feel so overwhelmed and confused about all of this. I had high expectations of how my family and bf would interact when I started dating him and I’ve been really let down by the reality. I wish both of them could just move on or find a solution because I’m utterly exhausted and a little worried about my relationship if this continues :/",22Aug2020,1

i started dating him when we were in 8th grade and i had already liked him for 3 years so of course i was really happy about it. i ended things first because we were starting high school and we were parting ways. then we still had feelings so we tried again and this time he ended it. that was 4 years ago and the last time we ever talked 

since then i've had several dreams about him. the reason i'm deciding to make this post today is that i woke up today after having a dream where i admitted that i still liked him and he told me he was happy to hear that. that's the first dream of him in 4 years where we actually spoke to each other. i was so sad when i woke up from that. i've had a couple friends tell me i should talk to him, but i feel as though it sounds ridiculous since it was middle school and maybe he would find it weird that i'm talking to him 

i just want the dreams to stop. i want to talk to him but i'd feel silly. i doubt he feels anything for me anymore but a part of me wants to talk anyway. on top of that i've been talking to this other guy for a month so i don't know if it would be wrong to try and text my ex. i don't even know what id say to him",22Aug2020,1

I have five brothers, but I only think of one when I see gay related things.

He has never given me a reason to think that. 

It could be that I don’t know my brothers well specially when it comes to their life, their experiences with girls. They don’t talk about them often. 

One of them brother, openly calls girls pretty when he sees them on tv, and the other I saying I think of when I see gay related vidoes, doesn’t.


They are all private. I don’t even know if they ever had a girlfriend or fancied a girl.

I don’t know if I’m projecting my feelings into him only.

They all talk about girls sexually, even the one I think of when I watch something gay related.

I just wanted to know why I think of him and not my other brothers.

The only thing I notice about him is that he cares about his face, he has a lot of face products and face wash. 

He also cares about his hair.

71,"I’m a high school teacher and a mom to a 2.5 year old boy. When I was pregnant with him, I didn’t feel very bonded to him, and I had a lot of anxiety from a traumatic series of miscarriages I suffered when trying to have a child. I’ve gotten help since then, and have really turned my anxiety around completely. With the COVID pandemic, my school district went to virtual in March, then summer break happened, and now we are going back virtually in September for the foreseeable future. So I’m basically working from home. My mother and mother-in-law help with childcare during the week, and my husband works 12 hour shifts as a nurse, so he’s home to help a lot too. In June, after being separated for two months from my husband while he worked exclusively in the COVID ICU, we got pregnant with our second child. We weren’t trying, and we struggled for ages when trying to have our son and couldn’t conceive without medication, so this is both a fluke and a blessing. I’m now almost 14 weeks along with a baby girl, and I am so excited for her to join our family. This pregnancy is completely different from my first, and I feel much more relaxed.

Here’s my problem. After I had my son, I went back to work, thinking that was the right choice for me, and maybe it was during that time. But since March (even before I got pregnant with #2) I have LOVED being this little boy’s mommy, and I am so happy we have had all this time together. I am grateful that this school year (so far) will not include a commute or other things that keep me from him for longer. And I know when my baby girl comes, I am going to dread going back in person even more. 2.5 more years and my boy is off to kindergarten. I really feel like I need more time with my kids, and teaching doesn’t offer me that. It’s a job that I like and still enjoy, but I feel like I can’t care as much about other people’s kids once I have my own.

I need advice on what to do next. My husband is in nurse practitioner school, so in two more years, he’ll be making more money than he currently makes. But at least until then, I need some steady source of income that is above minimum wage, so that we can make ends meet. I’m open to pretty much any (legal) ideas that will afford me more time with my kids. I’ve thought of a few things, but I would love to hear the ideas of others because I know I haven’t thought of everything. Thanks in advance!",22Aug2020,1

I was talking to a coworker of mine today. She was telling me about how she cheated on her BF, had a pregnancy scare, and has guys lined up for whenever her BF pisses her off/ignores her... But, despite this, he's still with her. Essentially, it's almost like a Sugar relationship, but it's not. You get what I mean?

She pretty much treats him like shit, but he's still with her.

Now, here's my complaint:

Yes, of course, she's pretty. Yes, of course, I'm a ""potato"". But I like to think that I at least have *SOMETHING* that could be found as attractive. But, no.

She pulled at least three numbers in our 8 hour shift today alone. I hardly got a glance.

I don't want to be all ""nice girl"". I've done dirt. I've played people. But the thing is, at least I had a guilty conscience over it. She's told me to my face that she doesn't regret shit she's done.

After talking to her and hearing about her ""successes"", I'll be honest in saying that I had to take a bathroom break to cry. Not only do I feel bad for myself, but I also feel bad for her BF (despite him obviously being okay with her behavior.)

Like, I like to think of myself as being nice enough to deserve someone but, I'm bisexual and can't even get anyone to give me the time of day. And yet, she gets more dick than she can handle.

So, now I ask: What the fuck am I doing wrong???

I've been patient. I've gotten over (most of) my self harming issues. I've been managing my depression. I've been outgoing. I've been quiet. I've been fake. I've been myself.

What. Do. I. Do????

At this point, I'm willing to be a one night stand. I'm willing to just be someone's experiment. I'm willing to simply be resorted to nothing but a fucktoy.

I just want to feel, even for a few minutes, like *someone* finds me attractive. Like someone gives a fuck (literally or figuratively.)

I don't care about feelings anymore. I just want *something.*

So, tell me Reddit, what am I missing?

Is it just me?

Do I need to be more patient? 

Do I need work done? 

Do I need to love myself more?

Do I need to just get over it and shut the fuck up?

Or, do I need to finish the job I started 6 years ago and off myself?

Anything helps at this point. I'm tired of feeling alone. I'm tired of feeling unwanted. I'm just tired of feeling, in general. I just want someone to love me.",22Aug2020,1

75,"Working in food service in a large city during a global pandemic is really hard. It’s tough in the day-to-day work and it’s tougher dealing with panicked and demanding bosses making life insufferable at times. 

I’m the manager of a cafe with (pre-covid) five locations in our city. There are currently only three open, and the two other managers and I have really created a bond. I have worked for the company for a little over a year. A and B have been there for 7 and 5 years. And then the managers have a boss C, who is our manager and buffer between us and the owners, and after 8 years with the company, she had a huge hand in the concept, look, operation of the business. 

A couple of weeks ago, our owners let C go. It was a really devastating loss for the entire retail staff, because she was such a mainstay of the company, she had all the knowledge, all the contacts, all the answers. We have all felt unmoored without her there. 

My fellow managers and I have been having a rough time working so closely with the owners now, and A and B are ready to walk. A has found another job and is waiting for confirmation of something or other before she gives her two weeks notice. B is on the cusp of quitting in a rage, especially after a very awkward zoom meeting today where one of our bosses chewed him out. 

I’m getting really nervous about what will happen if/when A leaves. I can see it setting off a domino effect that may lead to them closing my small, quiet, secluded store and make me manage her crazy stressful one in an indoor market. Or they close B’s store and he goes to the other one, but it’s only a matter of time before he’s gone. 

I totally know what it’s like to be at a job for a long time and just have to go. I was at my last job for 8 years and my job before that for 5. I had to leave those places. But my leaving had consequences, mainly the closing of the shop a couple weeks after I left. If A and B leave, that’s great for them, they deserve to have jobs that make them happy. But they will be leaving me here and also making my job/life SO MUCH HARDER.

Personally, I care about the environment; among other things, I am not a Trump supporter.

Lately it has been hard to even come out of my room, because she always brings up the hard subjects. 
I have been proud of myself, with just zipping my mouth most of the time, only mentioning a few reasons why she should question her beliefs...
Until yesterday, I went full speed, I lost my control, and I raised my voice. Honestly, I don’t even remember a lot of what I said, I probably just sounded like an angry monster, yelling about the evil orange man. 
The conversation ended with us both going in our rooms and closing our doors, and I haven’t talked to her since....
Besides Facebook 😳 and this is where it gets really bad. 

She posts a lot of nonsense on there, I should have blocked her from my newsfeed a long time ago, but I didn’t... and today I saw some very frustrating things. I commented on one of her posts, I must admit, it was an awful comment, I dug deep. However, everything I said was true. She posted the “now folks, I never cared” post that’s been going around, and I commented with the really popular comment that has also been going around... 
She disagreed, so I explained to her why it’s true. Saying things like, “you taught me to hate gays” 
Again, very nasty of me to disrespect my mother on social media, no matter how true my words were. 
My brother (who is also a Trump supporter) freaked out on me for my comment. I deleted it. 

Why did I do that? Why did I lose my control? I am usually very good about keeping to myself (sometimes too good). I regret very much what I commented on Facebook, even though it was true, I showed a lot of people what an ass I am, and what I truly think of my mother. 
I would rather people didn’t know that lol. 
And now I have conflicts with my mother, which wouldn’t have happened if I just didn’t speak... 

I don’t want to be a person who ruins relationships over a political dispute, but sometimes it is so hard to be around people with that mindset. Most of my family are Trump supporters, and they always guilt me for not hanging out with them more often. But how can I when I get so angry so easily?",22Aug2020,1
80,"I have 4 puppies (2 and a half months), they're siblings (3 females and 1 male) and I have had them since they were born. They all have different personalities but I don't know what went wrong.
One of the fameles, known for being playful and bite a lot (but not badly or with bad intention) started attacking one of her sister. 
This morning, she bite her sister and refuse to stop, we tried so hard to open her mouth with our hand, but ahi didn't stop until we threw water to her. Later this day she did it again, to the same dog, but ended up bitting my mom's hand too. So she tied her to a tree and hit her with her leash (I felt really bad for this but I just couldn't stop her). She became quiet. 
Now, she has done the same again and decided to keep her tied (we let her free before because she was quiet and thought it wouldn't happen again).

What can we do about this? We're thinking about finding her or her sister a new home, but we're afraid of what would happen to her if the other owner discovers her aggressiveness. Out last option (I really don't want this to happen) is to put her to sleep.

Please, help me. What is happening to her? What can we do to stop this behavior?

81,"I’m generally independent and I was supposed to be going to college this year too. The same one in fact. It wasn’t actually planned. We told each other that we would make our decisions independently and tell each other on the same day at the same time after we both put the down deposit in so we couldn’t change our decisions. She got housing this semester and I did not due to COVID. She left a week ago and I’ve taken it... horribly. 

She doesn’t seem to understand how much her leaving has affected me. Every time we talk about it I feel a physical tightening in my chest. A part of it is jealousy that she’s there and I’m not but a part of me is just sad.

82,"So this is gonna be complicated to put into words because I know I’m crazy and l know nothing will ever happen between us because we don’t see each other at all anymore and as I’m writing this I think it’s best not to wish him a happy birthday. 

Anyways here’s the story, my first crush was in junior year of high school to a guy who well will call H. Anyways, I never talked to him because I was a big ass chicken. Our only interaction was in senior year when we played BS together with some of my friends. There was also a time I talked to him on Snapchat but it ended with him leaving me on read (it was about dogs). Also I talked about him being in LA (we’re both from Austin) because I saw it on his story. The last time I talked to him was about a year ago.

(I KNOW HOW STALKERISH IT SOUNDS THAT I KNOW HOW MANY TIMES WE’VE INTERACTED BUT HE WAS MY FRIST CRUSH AND I HAVENT LIKED ANYONE EVER) 

The issue I’m having is that today is his birthday and I don’t know if I should wish him a happy birthday or not. I don’t want to come off as a weirdo even tho this whole post makes me seem like a huge ass weirdo. 

I feel I should add that we had so many classes together Junior and Senior year. Like so so many, I think I’ve might have stared at him a bit but also it wasn’t on purpose because we would always be seated in a manner that had him in my line of vision. There was this incident one time that I think he looked at me hard as in stop looking at me but also he was talking to his friend. That day I felt really bad and confused because I had just raised my head from my computer and that’s when he did it 

(so he was looking at me first technically but he was talking to his friend but also I’m not sure he was looking at me) 

That was an awkward day.

Anyways, I wouldn’t call us friends more like a acquaintances that had a lot of classes together in high school. I’m in college about to start my sophomore year and I don’t have a crush on him anymore (at least I don’t think so) 

I haven’t had a crush on anyone since him and but I‘ve talked to other guys but nothing serious has come out of that because I didn’t really like them. I just saw that it was his birthday today and it brought up feelings.

I’m a guy btw and I’m 65% certain he is straight. 

TL:DR I had a crush on a guy that I haven’t talked to much and today is his birthday. Should I wish him a happy birthday?

87,"During quarantine my boyfriend and I moved to a rooftop apartment within our current building. This way could have a safe outdoor space for ourselves and our pets. Everything has been great and we spend more time out there than we do inside. 

The layout of the patio is pretty important. So because we're on the roof we have a privately fenced rooftop patio. There is one other apartment that has a privacy fence as well. In between those two private patios is the shared buildings rooftop patio. One of my neighbors has an interest in drones and has gone out of his way to show me and my boyfriend recordings he's made of the surrounding areas with his drone. 

So, over the last few weeks we have had a drone that keeps popping up and hovering over our patio. At first I thought it was random and not that big of a deal. But, within the last week its actually flown onto my patio, right above where I'm laying down or lounging and hovers. The last time it happened I lost my cool and yelled at it and I heard shuffling on the public patio. I tried to run outside to see who it was, but I missed whoever it was.

90,"I’m not trying to sound like a spoiled bratty kid when I say this  but I feel like my dad doesn’t like me at all. I don’t understand how my brother can talk with my dad and not be uncomfortable. When I talk to my dad every time I try to make a joke I’m a smartass and I can’t really think of how to explain this next point so I’ll just give you an example: me, my dad, my mom, and one of my friends were eating at chili’s and I had gotten a hamburger or something and even though I had only eaten 3/4 of it I jokingly asked my dad what we were having for desert and he said something like “nothing because you didn’t eat all your burger” in what sounded to me like a joking way but it was loud so maybe I misheard him but anyway I said I’m a sarcastic joking type way “oh it’ll be alright” and he raised is voice in the middle of the damn restaurant and said “NO ITS NOT ALRIGHT”. After that everyone in the restaurant got a little quiet and looked over to our table. So then I got quiet and a few minutes later the waitress came back over and asked if we wanted any dessert and my dad looked over at me and asked me if I wanted anything like he didn’t just yell at me for asking for dessert 3 minutes ago. Something similar happened tonight at a different restaurant. I won’t go into too much detail but basically I’ve been letting my hair grow out for a while and Sometimes one little portion in the front will hang down and make it look like I have a Karen Haircut and my dad was telling me something about how if I wanted to fix my cow lick I would have to start making my hair go straight back and I told him that I wasn’t worried about my cow lick and that I was trying to make the other part that makes me look like I have a Karen haircut stay up. Then he got mad and told me he was just trying to help me and to not get an attitude with me. The rest of the dinner was pretty quiet. He gets mad over the littlest things but it seems like it’s only whenever I fuck up with the littlest things that he gets mad. He also thinks he’s always right no matter what. I have another story about him thats pretty long and happened pretty recently. I play in my churches praise band for my youth group and I have to wake up early on Sunday mornings to play. This one time one of my friends was sleeping over and I hadn’t gotten a text about having to go to get to church early all day. At around 11:30 or 10:00 I got a text saying they we were playing in the morning and my parents were already asleep. I texted my mom and told her that my friends didn’t want to have to wake up really early to go to church and in my stupid ass mind I guess I thought it implied that I had to get up early to play. Anyway we go to sleep around 1:00 and I wake up around 9:00 and I ask my mom if she got my text about having to play that morning and she said no (I was referring to the text where I told her that my friend didn’t want to have to wake up early to have to go to church but she thought I was talking about a completely different text) this is where it kind of gets confusing but basically my mom told my dad that I did have to play and my dad thought I had purposely did not tel them that I had to play just so I wouldn’t have to go to church. I told my dad I didn’t do it on purpose but he told me that I did do it on purpose and that I was lying to him about everything. This is also the first  time I’ve ever missed a band practice with them excluding times I was sick and when I was out of town and just couldn’t make it. But yeah. I have more stories about him but I think that’s enough for today. If you read this please comment something I don’t care what but please just comment something.

so i recently got a job with the intentions to redo my room with my hard earned money. i just got my paycheck, so i asked my parents if i can get a new bed frame but they said no. 

the bed frame i currently have was my grandparents, so my mother was very against donating it since we have no space to put it in our home. but the thing is that my grandparents don’t even hold any sentimental value towards this thing. i mean they literally live out of the country, what are they gonna if i donate it? fly out to where i live to get it? probably not. my dad on the other hand said that i should think practical with my money, and i am! 

i know this situation is more of a “it’s their house, their rules” sort of deal. but it’s literally just a bed frame, what’s my parent’s problem? the one that i was planning on getting isn’t even that expensive anyways and it’s not like my parents will be paying for it either. i’d really like to enjoy my space in my room and make it pleasurable to my eyes, since i’ll be here til i move out which is very from now. i will take any piece of advice to be honest. thanks for listening to my little rant, and i hope whoever is reading this understands what i mean from my point of view.",22Aug2020,1

I downloaded tinder a couple weeks ago to see if the guy I liked was on there. I used some random pic of someone I found. My plan was to hop on there for a sec and delete. But I matched with this one guy honestly I might have swiped right on accident. But he messaged me I messaged back bc he seemed amazing. He is amazing probably the coolest most fucking awesome person I’ve ever talk to. I chatted with him for the night with full intentions of never speaking again and deleting the app. He believed who he was speaking to was the one in the picture. I didn’t have the fucking heart to tell the guy I wasnt the girl in the pic. We kept talking he begged for my number and I didn’t want him to feel like shit so I gave it to him and we kept talking. Everything was so natural we were finishing each other’s sentences staying up until 7am talking to each other. We made each other happy.

Well, it's 4 days later and the guy came back asking to do a load of laundry. At my house. He didn't bring laundry with him, he said he wanted to ask first.

TL;DR: W has not been doing too well, and Q thinks I'm selfish for not taking better care of W's mental health. Am I being selfish? Should I cut ties with Q? Should I have a chat with her? What should I do?

So, I've been with this group of friends since we were little. We always got along, and we shared just about everything.

W has been struggling with social anxiety, depression and some other ailments which are hard to cure/don't yet have a cure. W and I are pretty close, but I too am struggling with my own problems and from what I've heard people say, it's not selfish to put myself first.

Q and W are really close, like, best friends, so Q has been taking W's mental health into her own hands. Recently, Q and I had a conversation about W. I hadn't seen W in a while, so I asked Q how she was going. Q wrote this really long text about how W was really doing bad and her parent's hadn't bothered to take W to a doctor, so Q was taking matters into her own hands. I told Q that she wasn't exactly responsible for W's mental health, but it's nice that she's trying to look out for W. Q was really offended and we got into an argument. She told me I was being a bad friend and that I was being selfish, which really got into my head and made me question if I really was being a bad friend or not.

After that, Q started to yell at me for little things and would ignore me. She would also get jealous if I got too close to W. By that I mean if us three were having a conversation she would ignore what I would say and try and get W to talk about topics only those two were interested in.

103,"My husband, our 12m old, and I recently moved in with his parents due to getting out of the army, and COVID. We have been staying with them for 2 months now. We both have jobs the baby is being taken care of by SIL during the day we pay her weekly. We pay half on bills, buy all groceries, and pay rent at his parents. 

In-laws have a different over bearing view on how they want my daughter to be raised verses how I want to raise her. They yell, smack hands, and spank my baby when she does something a normal baby would do. I have talked to them, and mentioned how I want healthy boundaries where only her father, and I are allowed to discipline her. This falls on deaf ears, and the “she is my grand daughter I’ll do what I want.” remarks. My husband is not backing me up. He says they had 5 kids, and 18 grandkids they know what they’re doing. Which feels like he’s taking a step back from parenting. 

Then comes the interdependency thing. I have been independent most of my life, so maybe I am struggling here with that which is why I am asking for advice. We have been especially independent the last 6 years with living a military lifestyle more than 1200 miles away from help. I had taken care of her by myself for a 10 month deployment with zero issues. His family keeps telling me to be more interdependent with them to take care of my baby. My mother in law especially. Her last comment was “when you kill yourself don’t come crying to me.” Again I spent 10 months raising the baby by myself. I feel at often times they want to raise my child the way they raised theirs,and I feel it’s an over step. With the way they disregard, and overstep my boundaries with her it makes me uneasy to leave her with them for any extended period of time. 

Am I being paranoid with the interdependency, am I being too independent? Are they over stepping my parenting? I feel crazy, and unheard.",22Aug2020,1

107,"My mother has depression and is very low in spirits. She has a very short temper and takes out her anger on me. It’s rarely physical, but it stills hurts a lot. She has this thing for mathematics and wants me to strive to be “whatever I want to be,” but when I tell her “Oh I want to be a software engineer” or “maybe a writer!” She says things like “You’ll never make it” or “Yeah, because you want to be a nobody.”

Last night she called me to watch a movie with her: Goodwill Hunting, I think it was. It was about a boy who had been severely abused and beaten by his foster parents. He went to counseling and soon found out he was a genius. But through the whole thing, I was hardly even able to focus on that because my mom kept pointing out this side character who went to Harvard and was going to Stanford. Right after the movie ended, she started yelling at me saying how I was going to have to go to tutoring for math because I “spend too much time on the phone” or I “spend too much time playing games.”

Note: that “phone time” I spend is with my best friend - my ONLY friend. And the time I spend playing games? 1-2 hours daily. Maybe even less sometimes. Of course I’m going to talk on the phone - I have to escape from your unrealistic expectations of me being an 18-year-old doctor! I don’t even want to be a doctor!! Also, I spend that much time with my friend because I’m an only child. I have no other friends, no siblings, and my parents are too critical to talk to. One wrong word and it branches off into harsh lecturing. And THEN, she scolds me for “being a bad kid” when I hide in my room from her.

The only group chats I'm in are the ones I've started, but many of my friends have their own that don't include me.

I'm sure these are typical feelings of FOMO, but there's more significant stuff that really bums me out. I've only been invited to 2 weddings as an adult, and both were because I asked someone else to find out if I could go. Meanwhile, other friends have gotten married and not invited me. More than once, I've paid for someone else to go to something just so I could have a friend to go with.

Evidently, I don't cross the radar of many of these people who I tend to think of as genuine friends.

As I write all of this out, it's clear I'm trying too hard and I probably come off as clingy, desperate, etc. But up until last week, I thought I'd just been being nice and working on strengthening these relationships. None of these people have ever said anything to the contrary, at least not to my face.

Nearly all of my friendships are with people I've known since high school or college, ranging between 8 and 13 years of knowing each other consecutively. When we do spend time together, we have a great time and it seems like they enjoy being around me. But then, I don't hear anything from them unless I reach out. And then I see their posts on social media with other people in the friend group doing things together I wasn't invited to.

I deleted all of my social media a few weeks ago because it's just too painful to constantly be reminded I'm not an important part of their lives. I didn't want to announce my departure, but I did and only 2 people reached out to see if I was okay. That was Wednesday, and I haven't recieved anything else from anyone since. I didn't do it for attention, but it's becoming apparent it wouldn't have mattered if I had.

Before anyone says it, I know people are busy and have jobs/relationships/myriad other things going on. And I know that right now is especially difficult due to the pandemic. I completely understand that and I don't want this to sound like I'm whining about being ignored during such a difficult time. But none of this is new; it's just embarrassing it took me so long to realize it. And now that I have more time for introspection, it's weighing heavily on my mind.

Obviously you don't know me which makes this difficult, but I consider myself to be a pretty nice person. I have a good sense of humor and people seem to enjoy my jokes. I tend to be on the quieter side in conversations because I don't like interrupting, but I definitely have a talkative side. I try to ask questions about my friends and keep up on how they're doing. I also have a lot of interests so I don't think the problem is that they think I won't enjoy whatever activity they're doing. We all live within a half hour or so from each other, and there's a pretty even split between those who are single and those in relationships. None of us are married or have kids yet.

I just really want to improve whatever it is that I'm doing wrong because I like these people and I enjoy spending time with them, but my options appear to be (1) stop reaching out and probably lose most of these relationships I've put so much time into, or (2) keep doing what I've been doing and continue being excluded. I asked both my SO and my therapist to give me honest feedback and advice on what I can do better or what might be going on, but they either don't want to hurt my feelings or they don't have ideas, so I'm coming to Reddit.

Thanks in advance.",22Aug2020,1

I joined a server of one of the people I became pretty close to on the old server and we started talking a lot more.

I don't crush on people a lot mostly because relationships aren't a priority of mine but the friend I talk to caught feelings and for a while I did too. but those feelings faded after a few weeks because we live 4 hours away from each other and we probably won't meet each other anytime soon. he still has feelings for me and I'm not sure how to go about it, he even has pictures of me as his phone wallpaper and I think it's a little odd.

117,"Okay, so I will try to make a long story short, my boss and coworker helped me when I was kicked out of staying with a family (knew them for 10 years and they offered to help me when I had health problems- turned out they were a bit abusive) My boss paid the 100 dollar deposit on my camper and when that grew mold and tried to catch on fire I moved into my coworkers sons apartment and took on his lease when the virus hit and he now lives with his girlfriend. Okay, hopefully that’s not confusing. Basically, I love my job and love my coworker and the three of us in a small Chiropratic business we’re like a little family. But here’s the thing:

My coworker got sick with Covid recently and without her there to protect me I’ve realized that I don’t feel safe around my boss. He make stupid sex jokes which I try to ignore but has used objects to hit my butt and has even used his hands to hit my butt a couple times as well. I tried to bury it but not his failure to comply with CDC guidelines in this pandemic are putting not only my life at risk (I’m high risk) but my coworker is too (she went through cancer). I will attach an email that my sister (who is braver than I) has sent to the health department. Also when she reported him they called the next day and I listened as he lied through his teeth about how my coworker has gotten the virus and how “we have changed a lot in our daily routine to increase safety” 
After that call he did not ONCE put on a mask to see patients nor tell patients that we require masks, in fact the people who do come in with masks he makes them take them off to adjust them. Overall I feel unsafe and hurt by his lack of care towards others and his staff. I’m worried about quitting because I will have to train another person (so it may take months to get out) and I don’t want to leave my coworker behind who has been like a mother figure/ grandmother to me. My heart is broken and my mind is torn, I know I need to take action but I’m not sure what to do.

Here is the email my sister sent out: I have taken out names so that he won’t get numerous reports (I want to keep them limited because we don’t have many people who come in who would report his actions right now, a lot are friends of his so this would make his suspicion grow) 

***************************** EMAIL
Good afternoon, 

I am trying to report a business for unsafe procedures and COVID exposure:
not requiring masks,not notifying patients about COVID exposure, not following the 14 day quarantine procedures laid out by the CDC, continuing to see patients before being tested (the owner has supposedly had a covid test, but continued seeing patients throughout the weekend), and not disinfecting the office, or treatment table between patients. 

I am emailing you on behalf of my sister, SleepyOlive, who is currently working at the clinic. Her coworker “Jo” is currently positive with COVID-19 and was bedridden, last I heard. Both Jo and Ms. Sleepy had low grade fevers on Tuesday, August 11, 2020. “Mrs. Jo” had had a covid test Monday evening, August 10th, got the results Tuesday evening (8-11-2020), and then informed Ms. Sleepy and the chiropractor that she was positive for COVID.  Ms. Sleepy then got a COVID test on Wednesday (8-12-2020), and both Ms. Sleep and Mrs. Jo missed work that Wednesday and Thursday.  Dr. Chiropractor continued to see patients throughout the weekend, and messaged both Mrs. Jo and Sleepy, requesting that they come back into work on Monday, August 17th, 2020. 

My sister [me] is currently employed by this business and is at risk.  She was manipulated into returning to work before finishing the CDC recommended 14 day quarantine.  Her boss claimed to be wearing a mask around patients-- in the last two days he has done so only a quarter of the time, and was not asking patients to wear a mask.  She also overheard him laughing with a patient who said ""I'm not afraid of the virus"" last week. 
Also, when Ms. Sleepy informed the woman who cleans the office that she had potential exposure, and recommended that she get tested, her boss, Chiropractor called her to fuss at her and accused her of ""telling all of (my current city)."" 

Dr. Chiropractor told Ms. Sleepy that she needed to ""suck it up"" (via a phone call) when she expressed her concerns and asked if he had had a COVID test, or was asking patients to wear masks, and when she tried to talk to him most recently, when she reiterated the seriousness of this virus, and that it was often fatal (Sleepy was going to let him know that we have already lost a relative to COVID and recently, but he cut her off), Chiropractor said ""so what, everybody dies"" (8-19-2020).  He is also aware that Sleepy is high-risk.  

We are currently trying to figure out what her options are so that she can be safe and secure, and so she does not lose housing along with her job (as it currently looks like her safest option would be to leave).

118,"So I got a car back in 2018 that was priced at 10k but me and my mom got got. The dealer changed the price to 16k at the last moment and told us it was interest and we fell for it bad. My credit is bad so my mom had to be the owner and I had to cosign. We got normal insurance but we didn't for some reason get GAP coverage. Fast forward to the 20th of this month I got into a huge accident. Everyone is okay including the people in the other car and surprisingly no one needed to go to the hospital. I still owe 16k or so on the car because of interest being high and not being able to pay on it since covid started. Since it's technically my moms car and its her insurance the check they cut for how much the car was worth before the wreck will go to her and she's going to put that right towards paying off the remaining balance.   


I live in an area where it's impossible to depend on busses to get anywhere especially cross county. Everything is extremely spread out here and busses run very seldom. Without a car it would be almost impossible to get anywhere for work or anything. I have sold everything I don't use constantly every day to include some of my most prized possessions that I'd never even think sell because they were worth a lot and I needed the money. However that all had to go towards bills and debt.   


I'm feeling hopeless right now without a car and I need advice on what I could do in this situation. If I don't get a car soon I won't be able to last. Getting a loan is not an option under any circumstance and I have no one I could borrow money from.

120,"throwaway for obvious reasons 

I had a Zoom call earlier with a colleague from a different department of our company. 

She was running late and called in briefly on her mobile to let me know she would call back in a few minutes once she got home. The display name from her mobile wasn’t actually her name,  and once she logged in from home her real name appeared. I didn’t think much of it until a few hours later. 

The name from her mobile seemed kind of porn-y (think cute but edgy feminine first + middle name only) and I thought, there’s no way, maybe it was her flatmates phone or something. Sure enough the first google result was her nsfw kink twitter and onlyfans, and it was 100% her. 

I feel weird because of the professional nature of our relationship, and recognize her lack of consent in my knowledge about it. Just a boundary that I’m assuming she intended to leave up was violated unintentionally. I myself am kinky and have no issue with sex work, but I’m not sure how to proceed. I won’t interact with this person often at work, but I’ve seen stories about people getting fired if their boss discovers they’re involved in sex work. Do I tell her so she doesn’t accidentally out herself to someone more consequential or just let it go? 

How do I tell her tactfully that I had a hunch and googled her SW alias? Is a work email address (my only contact) a  safe method of communication? 

Tldr: a colleague unwittingly logged into a work zoom meeting via her mobile phone, which displayed her sex worker alias. I found her nsfw twitter/onlyfans and I’m not sure if I should tell her I know",22Aug2020,1

123,"I (22F) just found out I’m pregnant with my BF’s (23M) baby and I’m not sure what to do. 

It would be an easier decision if we didn’t work together. We’ve been dating for over a year and at the time we started dating, we were both base level employees— totally within company policy. I got promoted at the beginning of this year and we stopped dating for a few months because it’s obviously against company policy. I’ve been doing well in the company and received another slight promotion (not really a promotion in that I didn’t get a raise, but I was given more responsibilities) and am on my way to a salaried position. 

If it wasn’t for this promising job, I think I would seriously contemplate keeping the baby. Which is probably not right. Neither of us are in the position to raise a child. We both have a lot of childhood issues we are still working through. I want to give my child the best life I possibly can, and right now I can’t. At least I don’t think I can. Our relationship is very off and on. We love each other very much, which is why we keep going back to each other, but we have our differences.

My bf and I discussed what we would do if we kept the baby. We’d both need to find new jobs. Find a place to live. Find a way to financially support a baby. Try and make things work between us. The baby would be very loved by me, but my bf has a very hard time expressing affection. I know he’d love the baby and do everything he can to take care of it, but I’m not sure how much he’d show the baby he loves it. 

We found out today I’m pregnant and agreed on abortion. In two weeks we’re going to go in and do it. I feel like in these two weeks I might change my mind. I’m not sure what to think. I’m not sure how to know whether or not I even want to keep it. My bf has his doubts on being a father. He never thought he would be and thinks we’re too young and not ready (which he’s right about). However, I fully have his support on what I decide. He agreed I have the ultimate say. 

Im not sure what to do at all. Any advice is seriously helpful.",22Aug2020,1
124,"TO PREFACE: No, I’m not one of those self-proclaimed “nice guys” who thinks that women owe me sex or whatever in exchange for doing the bare minimum.

I am also FTM transgender (5 years out, 4 years on T, 3 years post-top surgery).

I’ve tried dating apps, meeting people in person, parties, getting set up, spontaneously asking someone out, flirting, “shooting my shot,” and I get nowhere. I end up either trusting too early and getting my heart broken or just being rejected.

Here’s some fun stories because I need to vent:

- One girl had me text her sugar daddy FOR HER while she was driving us TO OUR THIRD DATE. And then proceeded to only text him when we got there. 
- Another girl talked to me for a month and we really hit it off. I told her I was developing feelings, she reciprocated, I was on cloud nine. Then out of nowhere, she tells me she only wanted a fuck buddy. That had not come up once before then.
- The one that honestly hurt the most was when I was dating someone for about three weeks and all was going well, but then I happen to glance at her phone and she’s on Tinder actively talking to someone else. While we were cuddling. On the day I skipped out on work to comfort her because she was sad.
- My first serious girlfriend was manipulative and horrible from the start. She told me constantly that I had zero empathy and would never EVER let me defend myself about anything. She would make me guess what she was thinking and get mad if I got it wrong, ignore me for days, complain about me to our mutual friends, and tell me how often I came up in therapy. Then she dumped me when I got really depressed and told me it was because she figured I was going to dump her soon anyway.

I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. It hurts like hell. I hate to sound cheesy or cliche, but I really am just a hopeless romantic. All I want is to love someone and to be loved. I want to have someone to share my life with. I’m not seeing women as a “prize” or a relationship as a current goal, but my constant failures are making me feel even more humiliated and stupid and depressed. I’m losing hope. Can anyone offer any advice at all, or at least a bit of encouragement? Thanks.",22Aug2020,1

126,"My parents are very kind people. They provide so much for me and my siblings. They feed us, they pay for our tuition, they do all the things they can so that we can be successful. I'm grateful for the things they have done for me and my siblings, but my parents and I never really got along. My mom holds me to a high standard and whenever I do something against her principles she gets very angry. My dad just goes along with whatever my mom says.  Growing up, I was always yelled at or spanked for doing the wrong thing. I was never taught why the wrong things I did were wrong, and it was usually something I had to learn by myself. So, everything I did out of obedience as a kid, I did out of fear. As I grew older, the things I was forced to do as a child never changed. I was forced to take piano lessons until I turned 18, I was forced to pray and go to church, and the only reason I got good grades in school was that I was scared of disappointing my parents. I grew up motivated by subconscious fear. The more it took a toll on me the more I realized how toxic it all really was. My relationship with my parents went downhill around the time I started highschool. I started growing a sense of self-worth and principles. I started to see what was really wrong from right.  I was still being forced to take piano lessons in highschool and no matter how much I begged my mom to stop taking me, no matter how much I cried about it, she would still make me go. And, while its good to have learned a valuable skill, I never enjoyed it. I started to argue with my parents about everything. I'll admit, I have send disrespectful things to my parents out of spite and anger. But every single argument always boiled down to ""this is our house and you have to respect Our rules."" Whenever I tried to stand up for what I believe, they would corner me. Arguments would always escalate. Fast forward to today and my parents still treat me the same. 

My last argument with my parents was about the stupid dishes. My siblings and I rotate days doing the dishes throughout the week. That day it was my younger brother who was respoinsible for the dishes, but my mom assumed it was my day to do the dishes. At around 8pm my mom reminds me to do the dishes and, out of reassurance, I tell her that the dishes will be done. Around this time, I start to clean my very messy room which I share with my brother. By the time we are done cleaning it the time is around 11:30- Midnight ish. My mom comes out of her room angry that the dishes are still not done and she orders me to do them. I tell her that it was actually my little brother's day to do the dishes and that I only said they would be done to reassure her so she would worry about them. She gets upset and calls me a liar for saying that I would do them. I explain to her again that I said the dishes will be done out of reassurance, not out of disrespect. My little brother steps in and says that he would do the dishes, but my mom , angry that I lied to her, tells me to do them. I was angry at how unjust it all was, and how misunderstood I felt. I continue to refuse, and she becomes angrier.  She said that at that point she didnt care that it was my younger brother's responsibility anymore, and that I have to do the dishes now because I lied to her. The more I refused to do them the more she yelled. My mom and I go in circles throuhgout the argument, yelling at eachother. So, my mom decides to wake up my dad. My mom tells my dad her side of the argument and her side only. My dad becomes very upset and starts yelling at me too. I try to explain my side, but the more I do so the more my parents see it as ""talking back?"". The more I argued the more they felt disrespected. I was cornered and scared. I decided to stand my ground because of how unjust the situation was. I try to explain again, and as I do so my dad grabs a stick and hits me with it. It definitely hurt, but I was in shock. At that point that house didnt feel like home anymore. He yells more calling me disobedient, resentful, ungrateful, a liar. My mind went blank.  I decided I would just shut up and do the dishes. I started to clean the dishes, not saying a single word to them. As I do the dishes my parents yell at me, asking why I have so much resentment and anger, yelling at me to change . I finish the dishes.  When I turn around my dad has a look of disappointment. He tells me that he failed as a father for the way I turned out. They go to back to their room and I go to mine.  I looked at my bed and just knew that I never wanted to sleep there ever again. I packed up some clothes and my work uniform, my phone and laptop and I left. I don't have a car so I took an Uber to a friends house for that night. Ever since I have been couch hopping looking for student loans and cheap apartments. 

I dont know what to do at this point. I am filed as dependant. So its hard to apply for student loans. My parents make a lot of money so I do not qualify for financial aid. I am homeless. I dont know what to do or how to move forward. My parents are telling me that they are considering to no longer pay for my tuition. If they do so, i'll have to drop out of school. The thing is , my parents have always raised me to become the person that they want me to be, without consideration of what I want to be. They always did the things they were supposed to do as parents financially, and for that they expect complete obedience in return. They never actively tried to listen to my side, They never validated my feelings or showed much concern towards my mental health. They want me to grow, but only at their pace.

To respond I just put my head down and don’t really say much but for once I want to be able to catch him off guard even if it’s just one playful/charming come back. I‘ve been building up to this. I want to catch him off guard and put him on the spot so he can experience what it’s like and hopefully I can finally approach him and tell him to stop and leave me alone.",22Aug2020,1
132,"For a bit of a background, I am 15M living in India. I'm currently studying in grade 11, which is the Indian equivalent of being a junior in high school. Now onto my question: 

I love programming and want to be a video game developer. As such, I am learning C# and spend a few hours every week on it. However, my dad thinks that I should not do that and should just focus on my studies. He says, and I quote, ""You can have hobbies either before grade 9 or after you're 45 years old."" 

I tried explaining to him that if I want to get into the college I want to get in, I don't need 99.99% marks (Which is the norm in India) and I need to have some stuff on my portfolio. He says that that that's just bullshit and colleges don't care about your portfolio, they just care about your grades.

He has given me a roundabout of 5 hours per day on the computer, 4 for my online classes and 1 for whatever I want to do. I tried telling him I won't be able to do everything in just an hour, but he didn't listen. I would like your advice on what to do. I might even show this thread to him, so please do write accordingly. 

Thanks!",22Aug2020,1
133,"I know this is cheesy and possibly a bit dumb. My fiance and I just got engaged last month, and we're going through the process of buying a home together. Our closing date should be in about two to three weeks. I'd love to hope for sooner, but the title process was killer. However, in order to keep his job, he had to transfer. So he's transferring this monday to the new facility near our home, and staying at his parent's weekend house. (It's not anything fancy, just a tiny cabin upstate when they have an apartment in the city, I know that sounds fancier than it is).  


He's leaving this weekend and taking the doggo with him. (We literally jokingly argued who got her, and I relented because she loves it up there more, more room to play). So I'm going to be quarantined in a pandemic alone in the apartment for 2-3 weeks. Again, I know this is cheesy, but what do I do all day without him? I'm gonna miss cuddling so bad. I'm someone that really needs affection and to be close to someone, but I can't be. I work from home, and there's no wi-fi up there. We can't even get it because it's that much in the middle of no where.",22Aug2020,1

135,"I don't even know where to start. Hi, uhh this is my first ever post on Reddit. I've come here because I really don't know what to do in my situation. I currently am a 22 yr old female living with my single dad in an apartment. I must say over the months it's been CRAZY with his rituals of cleaning/disinfecting/sorting every single day.

 I'm positively certain my father has OCD, as every day he is spending hours on cleaning and rewashing his hands (for minutes at a time, he won't touch anything else until it is complete). There is not one minute where I feel a faucet isn't running. I'm only allowed to buy certain groceries for the house and all these groceries are repackaged in bags following a long meticulous process of unpackaging with strategic finger placement and an array of tools to make sure our hands don't make contact with the outside packaging (maybe this seems reasonable to some, but let me go on). All the produce I have bought, he has drenched it in hot water, detergent, 70% rubbing alcohol for days at a time. I have to use a tissue to turn light switches on/off, to open doors, to use ANY kitchen appliance, the windows, the faucets, the cabinets..the list goes on. He sprays my hair and my body with 70% alcohol even after I'm forced to shower for LONG periods of time. He also showers for LONGGGG periods of time.

I try to help him out with stuff and tell him that these processes are excessive and not necessary, but clearly that's not sufficient because there's something more going on. He also screams at me whenever something doesn't go perfectly according to his routine. I have so much pent up anger and resentment from being disrespected on the daily from being called names, being compared to my dead-beat mom, given no privacy or space to just exist/breathe. 

He opens my packages to disinfect the stuff in it, he won't let me disinfect my own phone when I step inside. We have to also wear clean sandals in order to put our clothes on and to take them off, it doesn't matter if your socks are clean. These are just some of the processes. The worst part is that I can't do anything about it, I feel helpless, I have anxiety attacks in my room after these altercations with my dad. I really try to be patient, but tonight I screamed at him and I understand that it wasn't right of me to do so, but I feel like there's nothing I can do. He doesn't want help, he doesn't even think he needs it! He denies it whenever I suggest OCD being a possibility. I mean it's not expected that he'd take that lightly anyway.

Moving out is not really an option for me right now considering my financial status and how expensive it is in the city. I'm currently saving for when my bf moves from the states to here, but that'll be another 2 years or so. Has anyone dealt with people with OCD or exhibiting similar behaviours? What are some ways you ...idk deal with it? I can't articulate myself properly currently-- I appreciate any advice.

THANK YOU.",22Aug2020,1

138,"Hi guys. I’m (19F) really struggling with my relationship with my father right now. I’ve always been a daddy’s girl. He was always my best friend. Always there for me. We were each other’s rocks when my mom left. We basically parented my sister together. I know that isn’t my job, but I was happy to do it. It all changed when he met his current wife. Or at least when we moved across the country to live with her two years ago. Her and I have never gotten along, to the point where she said that I wasn’t allowed to live with them when I graduated high school. I lived across the country, again, to live with my mom the day after my high school graduation. My dad didn’t fight for me. He didn’t try and make her let me stay. When he’s with her, everything is about her. I had to leave my sister when I left, and apparently things haven’t been great between step-mom and my sister either. My sister has hid from my me how bad things are. My step-mom once physically pushed her out of the house. Dad didn’t fight for her. This isn’t the man that raised me. At the moment, I’m trying to move back to the area that they live and I need to stay with them for a total of about four months. It’s an issue. I don’t understand why. My father has never been the type of man not to welcome his daughter back into his home in when she needs to stay. Until he met her. I asked him tonight (I’m visiting rn), “If [step-mom] wasn’t around, would you have any doubts about me staying here?”. He couldn’t respond. I just don’t know what happened to my father. I don’t know if I sound entitled or what, but we’ve always had the kind of relationship where I knew he was there if I needed him. Until he met her. Now, I don’t know who this man is. But he isn’t the man that raised me. I miss him. I miss the man that had his own opinions. I miss the man that would do anything for his daughters. He’s never been perfect. Not even close. But I love him. And I want my father back. I don’t know how to approach this anymore. I’m debating cutting him out of my life if things don’t change. I don’t need this anymore. I’ve tired of every interaction I have with him leading to tears. I’m tired of it. I want my father back. What do I do?",22Aug2020,1
139,"Hi, it's been a while since I've last touched Reddit but I have become quite anxious lately due to thoughts that have been in the back of my mind

To start things off, I'm 15 years old and an upcoming Sophmore, I have a pretty good GPA at school, I have people who care for me, but I don't think I've made the right decisions to become what I want to be, or at least want to be for now. I've first thought of becoming a musician and joined band in the 8th grade where I quit midway into the 9th after realizing it was putting so much stress with the situation I am under, now my current dream is becoming an astronomer, mathematics and space have always interested me and I believe that I can study and work hard enough to actually become one and earn a P.h.D in it to work at NASA or some other facility that dwells in Astronomy. 

The thing is... I'm unsure if this is who I truly want to be in life, I've changed so many careers before in my life and I don't think I'll stick with this one much more... I'm not that much of a financially stable person, my family of 3 and I are living at my Grandmother's and the school I go to is a mile away, we can't even afford a car, I've been through a shitty childhood but it's made me realize that I am a stronger person going through it and has made me help many others who are going through something terrible, my goal is to help others in life but I seriously want to become an astronomer too. 

Math and science are my favorite classes in school, but I think I screwed up a bit in freshman year due to stress but could I have a chance to clean my act up in these 3 upcoming years? What classes can I take to improve my chances of becoming an astronomer? How can I stay motivated to actually go to college? 

I'm sorry I'm throwing all these questions, I just want to know so much but in so little time...

Please help, and thank you for reading",22Aug2020,1
140,"My best friend lately has been mentioning wanting to hang out more and doing stuff together but always bails or seems to forget about the plans the day of.

Many times I have initiated plans with her and followed up with her on our plans so I’m a little tired of always having to plan something if I’m just going to get bailed on.

142,"My [18F] dad [43] works graves and never sees me except for late at night when he wakes up for work. He gets home at around 10am and by that time I'm usually leaving to get to my job. He divorced my abusive, alcoholic mother two years ago and now has a very rocky relationship. The woman is lovely, it's my dad who can't seem to maintin the romance because of his trauma/instabilites my mother caused.

Here is a typical day for him (from what I've seen):

-Wake up at 9pm and smoke a cigarette
-Eat either chocolate eggos with syrup or reese's cereal
-Watch television for a half hour, then smoke again
-Shower and get dressed
-Smoke again
-Work (several smoke breaks I'm sure)
-Get gas station food or del taco
-Work (eat m&amp;ms at desk, more smoking as well)
-Come home at 10am, smoke and eat cereal (or get mcdonald's)
-Try to sleep, wake up every two hours and get mad about it
-Smoke every time you cant fall back asleep
-Rinse and repeat

He doesn't clean anymore, he doesn't take care of our pets anymore beyond buying their food, and since I started shopping for myself he no longer gets any groceries unless the pets are out of food.

That's right, he doesn't buy himself food. The fridge and cabinets are 90% full of just my food. 

He gets takeout or fast food every fucking day. 

I'm not going to try to cure his depression. That's why he's going to therapy. And I know that quitting smoking is extremely difficult, especially when times are rough.

What I want here is to teach him not to eat like shit and abuse his aging body like he has been. But I don't want to come off as judgemental or irritating when I advise him. 

I don't expect him to ever go vegan like me or anything, but he can at least eat one fucking vegetable or apple or grain of rice once a month. There was a time when he meal-prepped and went for a run twice a week but that was over a year ago now. 

My mom weighs like 90 pounds, has advanced dementia due to alcoholism, and all of her hair has fallen out and she won't eat anything. She won't be around for very long. If my dad dies of lung cancer before his time I'm going to kill myself.

TL;DR How can I try and help my dad eat healthier and be a little more active without sounding rude or like I'm criticising him?",22Aug2020,1

It’s been a couple weeks on this new medication and I’ve been starting to have dreams that seem so realistic. I always had dreams, but I knew I was dreaming. 
The dreams I’ve been having these past days make me feel like I was actually living them in real time. What has me uneasy is that I’m dreaming about people that played a role in my past traumas. Not the ones that did the harm, but the ones that could’ve done something to stop the abuse.

not many landlords will rent to a pair of 19 year old's especially if one of them has a drunk driving flag on the background check. Be that as it may, he's hopefully going to get court sorted out in a month or two, and once thats over this lawyer hopefully can remove that stain on his record and we will rent out an AirBNB for a month to find jobs. and use that as leverage for an apartment.

But he is offering all these things that would help tremendously however my mother and step father both say its a scam and not to believe him and im terribly conflicted.

We would always talk and joke and never argued or had problems until her brother passed away, it was really hard for her and i tried to be there for her but she would push me away and she started to be very irradiated at me and then we started arguing everyday, so i thought the best thing to do was give her space, so i told her i thought it would be good if we stopped talking and took a break for awhile and she got really mad and told me to never talk to her ever again. We didn't talk for 4 months then I texted her and we made up, but things keep going bad, and I keep hurting her and she keeps hurting me, we both feel we are toxic for each other but i feel we both want things to work, she got a boyfriend since we stopped talking the first time. the last time we talked I got mad and blocked her so I feel I have ran out of chances and I don't even know if she would talk to me or if I should even try talking to her again because things will go the same way they always do.

164,"So last week this 25 year old woman messaged me on a dating app - she messaged me because she related to my faith and creative hobbies...

And my goodness, her pictures were incredibly attractive... cute face, great voluptuous body with great legs and nice breasts... 

We also have more in common then with anyone I've met... she's an avid lover of art - she writes novels, screenplays, she loves music, the same movies i do, hiking and nature and so much more.

We exchanged numbers a day later,
texted a lot and talked on the phone twice, and she's super cool...

She told me her instagram and per my request, sent me many photos of her without a filter, photos that she says look exactly how she does in person and dang, she's very attractive.

Apparently she gets a lot of attention from guys, but they usually want to just hook up with her unlike me...

She likes me and we have plans to meet up in person soon, yet I find myself hesitant...

after scrolling through her instagram I found a few photos of her here and there, and they look incredibly different from some of her other photos...

like I would say downright very unattractive photos... these were from like 2015 and 2017...

she told me that growing up she didn't really know how to dress well, and just dressed in an overly modest way, but also she wore no makeup  and her hair was way different and she looked super unattractive...

her photos these past few years literally looks like a different person, which has me skeptical even though she sent me numerous pictures of her without filters...

she told me she's not hiding anything,
and that she looks exactly like the attractive pictures she sent me..

I mean those super unattractive photos were from like 3-5 years ago, but idk what's going on? 

I find myself hesitant now, but I do have trust issues. I just hope she looks how she does from her pictures.

I just feel like those older pictures were how she really looks.... and now she's just changing her style etc to cover up how she really looks... idk though what do you think?",22Aug2020,2

They kept eyeing the phone down and I was thinking in my head, 'why would they steal a broken ass phone.' And my inner thought of 'I shouldn't assume they're going to steal it.' Then one of them grabs my phone and books it towards a road path nearby. Me and my friends chased them down and I ended up getting to the guy who stole my phone. I got a good look at him, and he was about 13-14. I really wanted to kick his ass but I thought about how that won't solve shit so I told him to just give me my phone and I'll let him go, and he did. So I let him go.



I asked him why the hell he stole my phone, and his response was 'someone stole mine.' After hearing that I was thinking 'is that seriously the best you got?'


Anyways, was I being too nice for letting him go? Or was that the right thing to do?

169,"Here’s the thing, when I ask my brother to play or do an activity with me his respond is always “I’m busy”, “no”, “stop bothering me”.

But roles reversed I always feel bad for him if I say no, he just asked me to play a game and I remembered 1 year ago I would always want to play this exact game and he’d never play, he would always tell me “no, go away”. 

I responded in the same way “no, go away” and I feel “guilty” I guess. What the hell is this, the problem is if he has no trouble with treating me like shit and not respecting me why should I, you know?

This also applies to many other things, when we are around are friends I always make sure he’s heard, if everyone ignores him I respond so he doesn’t feel left out but when I talk he flat out interrupts me or ignores me in front of everyone, not giving a shit how I feel whatsoever.

These are just a few examples, in short he doesn’t give a shit about me, doesn’t respect, why should I respect him, and why do I feel guilty when I decline him. It’s “oh I hurt his feelings &amp; I feel bad now” for me, but for him it’s “fuck off”.",22Aug2020,1

- He doesnt really have much in common with me. He goes to the same school and thats about it. 

- He doesn’t have his own interests different from mine either. He seems to just be on social media all the time. This makes it near impossible to have a conversation.

- Hes constantly depressed and that makes up a big chunk of our conversations. I knew this before but im only realizing its problematic rn. I have nothing against depressed people but its just too much for me. I have explained this very issue to him but it didnt seem to help much.

180,"I am in need of moral advice and a bit of guidance. 

I don’t know if this is relevant but a.t.m I’m 17. 

TL;DR AT THE BOTTOM.

All my life, I felt like I had a hard time sharing. Allow me to share the most prominent memories regarding my sharing-issue. 

The first one isn’t really a memory more of a string of memories. So between the ages of 8-13/14 my parents got a divorce and my mom had to downsize our house massively. 

We moved from a house with enough rooms to accommodate all my siblings to a two-bedroom apartment. This meant that whenever siblings would come over (all of them adults) I would have to sleep in my moms room and they would sleep in my bed. Before I continue I just wanted to say I come from a very large family so about every time I would come over to my mom at some point in time a sibling would come over. 

I must say however I did start throwing fits after a while whenever somebody had to sleep in my bed with their boyfriends. It disgusted me that my drunk sisters would sleep in MY bed with their drunk boyfriends (or smelling like cigarette smoke). I felt like nobody respected my room. It didn’t feel like my room anymore. I would just cry hour on ends and my mom would tell me that I’m tearing her relationship up with my siblings (I’m well aware that that’s not the case, however it still scarred me). I would hate finding all my belongings not being at the place where I left them. Or there being wet towels all around my room. Writing this down even makes me emotional. I feel like I’m weird for having these emotions. Or that I’m weird for not wanting people to sleep in my bed. 

In general I’m just really careful with my stuff, because I value everything I own and to see other people treating it with less care than me just hurts every bone inside of me. It just tears me apart. 

When my mom and I moved there was one room that was in the living room which you had to use a ladder to climb up in. So very impractical. I knew that if I would choose this room my siblings wouldn’t want to sleep in my bed anymore so that’s why I gave up peaceful resting at night for my own bed, at least when I’m at my moms. When I’m not there I have walked in on several people sleeping (not sex) in bed. However my mom has lately promised that nobody has slept in it for a really long time, I believe her. 

Alright that’s one of the more recurring ones. Now for a more singular event. (Pardon me for the lengthy explanations)

My dad has this weekend every year where he and his friends do something fun a weekend long. He usually wants me to participate. 

(I think I was like 7/8 or 9 at this point maybe even 11)

One of the times it took place at our home at that moment in time. Mind you most of his friends had kids at that time, around my age. To put it nicely they would treat stuff with less respect than I would. 

So when I went to my dads after staying at my moms. I found 10 to 15 children using my toys, losing parts of my games (again getting all emotional for no reason). Their gross hands all over my stuff which I care so deeply for. I had a huge mental breakdown outside of the house. My dad even KNEW that I found it very hard to share. He said that I was exaggerating, and that really hurt my feelings. 

I feel like I’ve babbled on long enough about these two. I could write a book filled with all the occasions my boundaries weren’t respected, but I ain’t gonna bore ya with that. 

TL;DR, I have a really hard time sharing my belongings, like my bed, smaller things. I find it hard in general to see others using my stuff. I am very careful with it. (In the post I discussed two events which define my issues imo.)
1. My bed used to/gets used by a lot of my adult siblings, when drunk or with their boyfriends. It makes me really uncomfortable and I don’t like it. 
2. My dad brought a bunch of his friends with their kids over. The kids had were around my age back then so 7/8 or 11 there were about 10-15 kids. They were treating my toys and games poorly, had a REALLY hard time seeing that and recovering from that. -End of two defining moments- 

Anyways are my feelings valid or was I being out of touch with my surroundings? I am afraid that most of these (to me) traumatizing events have lead to certain habits, (this is not me self diagnosing, it’s just an easy way for me to identify my behavior by using this terminology) I act like a OCD’er and germaphobe sometimes. 

I don’t want this to become a bigger issue to me.

182,"At my school, in Augusta Georgia, we annually play nerf wars each year. You have a team and you go against other teams. It gets pretty extreme, but nothing too bad. This particular night, tonight, my friend and I got blocked in by two trucks at a food lion (normal). Several other cars came, all friends of the opposing team (also normal). At this point, 10-15 people are just chilling around my car, maybe 7 cars are blocking me in. It was all in fun, I had friendly conversations with them through the window, some called me and my friend ugly, it was just fun and games.

And then one of the team’s friends let air out of my tire.

Me and my friend looked back, there was a guy letting air out my tire. Thankfully, my friends mom was spectating and ran over to stop them before it got too deflated. I called the judge to do something about it, but they didn’t do a thing, claiming they can’t do anything about it because the people who let air out of my tire weren’t in the team. He did, however, make the parking lot a “safe zone” so I could get away without anyone shooting me with a nerf bullet. I swore people out, I swore the judges out for not doing anything, everybody left, I came home. I told my parents, asked them what to do.

My parents are loving, generous people. I love them, and I know I can go to them whenever I need help or advice. They told me to say that the next time something like this happens, That any of my property is damaged or my tire is deflated, I’d willing to sue. So, I told the judges that if anything damaging happens to anything I own, we would be willing to sue them or anybody involved. They laughed, called me a comedian and now everyone is making fun of me. Even my best friends, who were on my team, were embarrassed of me and begged me not to say anything else.

185,"Here's what happened: 2 days ago, I was alone in the bedroom with my boyfriend. He started pulling down my pants when I was trying to watch television. I told him ""no"" multiple times as he started to pull down my pants and I kept saying ""no, I don't want to do this"" loud and clear. I also closed my legs when he tried to give me oral and pushed his head away with my hands while saying ""no!"" He finally got the hint and said, ""okay, fine, we won't do it.""

I went home later that night shaking and crying. I didn't tell him because I was in so much shock the first day and the second day I finally told him about what happened (in my POV) and I asked him why he tried to give me oral even after I kept telling him no and closing my legs. He feels awful, called himself a piece of shit, and said he can't look at himself in the mirror right now.

He ended up saying that he thought I was being playful and teasing him by saying ""no."" Right now in this very moment, I'm feeling uncomfortable to be alone with him and talking to him (in person or on the phone) makes me feel icky and gross.

A bit of backstory: I was sexually assaulted at 14 years old and nothing was done about it. At 15-17 years old, I was sexually harassed by my uncle and his pedophile friends (ages 32-50+ years old.) I'm very sensitive when it comes to anything sexual since I've been sexually abused and harassed throughout my teenage years. It takes me awhile to open myself up to someone and give them my entire trust, especially when it comes to sexual activities and sex itself. (Yes, my boyfriend knows all of this, he knows about my sexual assault experiences and how traumatizing it was to me.)

My boyfriend and I got on a phone call earlier today and I told him what we should do to try and move on past this. I proposed a plan and I want y'all's advice on this: I want to take my distance from him. I don't want to talk to him or see him for however long it takes me to fully heal and forgive him for coming onto me when I was telling him to stop. Is this a fair solution or do y'all think there are better alternatives?

188,"One of my closest friends/roommate drinks quite often, not enough that it concerns me in and of itself but the context concerns me. She talks openly about her mother's issues with alcohol (she definitely is an alcoholic and has been for many years, and has health issues as a result of it is my understanding) which obviously are a risk factor for her own development of an addiction. She doesn't get sloppy drunk or anything like that at all, but it still seems like something I shouldn't altogether ignore and should handle carefully. She's very much the type to joke about her enjoyment of drinking and ""own"" it, so to speak. But seeing her mom go through it obviously weighs on her and to some degree I know she's worried it could become an issue for herself.

I'm not sure exactly how often she drinks, but I know she likes wine most nights and it isn't uncommon for her to drink most or all of a bottle. I wouldn't qualify her as an alcoholic based on the official criteria and based on what I know, but she's skirting the line, and I think it could definitely blossom into a problem. We do drink together on occasion, but it is mainly a glass of wine or two while watching movies every couple of weeks during quarantine, or a bigger night out drinking occasionally pre-pandemic but it's never been frequent.

I do not want to overstep. I do not want to insert myself where it is not my place. It is not \*really\* my business, except as much as is appropriate as her friend. I am not trying to ask how to be her therapist or stage an intervention.

But from my position - one of her best friends - what is the appropriate role to have? What behaviors should I adopt and things should I avoid to be the right kind of support for her? Not to control her, and I am in no way judging her, I just don't want to enable anything that could be harmful to her and I want to be there to guide her the right way if need be.

I offered marriage counseling, but we had a bad experience where the marriage counselor came on to me in three individual sessions, rubbing me in inappropriate places.

So I got a cheap place, 2 bedrooms 1 bath. Kept working hard but after 6 months in I was laid off because covid had hurt the business at the time.

I had $126 from state, 600 federal weekly. That helped my transition into a new job. It was originally to be full time, but they were hiring a new director so made it seasonal until the director got there. I worked had and caught them up on a huge backlog, backed my boss up when she quarantined for two weeks, and then got laid off because I finished the backlog.

193,"Sorry for the essay!! 
tldr one girl is perfect for me but lives far (but willing to move) and mentally unstable. The other girl is mentally stable and also great for me but doesn't get my heart racing like the other one. 

As the title says, I (26M) am in love with let's say Amy (20F) whom lives across the world but I've just started dating let's say Wendy (27F) whom lives nearby me. Amy and I have never met in person but we've been talking (met online) for around 2 years. We've exchanged plenty of pictures and video chatted (nothing lewd in either medium) so I am sure that she's not a catfish at least in terms of her physical appearance. She's ridiculously attractive in every way that I could possibly ask for, the funniest person I've ever known in my life, and a very decent and sincere person. 

She and I have talked on and off but she always makes my heart race when she messages me, and she feels the same way about me. She lives in the UK and I lived in the US and now in Israel. I always considered visiting her but a few things have gotten in the way. She dated a guy, got knocked up, left him since he was horrible, and now she's a single mother with plenty of help from her parents and a house to herself. Her baby is adorable by the way. I reconnected with her, moved to Israel, and then considered seeing her, especially given the lower travel cost from Israel to the UK. I didn't consider dating her to be realistic but I figure that seeing her at least would be wonderful. She and I still have still have strong mutual feelings. I've always been using dating apps so I certainly haven't been holding out for hope. Not long after I moved I started dating someone and put my communication with Amy on hold. The relationship only lasted 5 months and we reconnected once again almost immediately. This was around 3 months ago. 

About a month or two ago we renewed discussions about me flying to her. However, the past month she has had two issues that have caused her to completely disconnect from me for two weeks periods each time. The first time, she was in the hospital for an eating disorder related issue, and the second time she was hit with a surprise custody battle from her daughter's father. I completely understand that these were emergency situations but she said absolutely nothing to me and went so far as to block me both times, later explaining that she did the same thing with literally everyone. Like I said, I understand these were fire circumstances but for all I knew I was being ghosted each time. 

During the second time period I went on a few dates with Wendy and we hit it off. Wendy is much closer to my age, more mature, relatively close to me, very pretty, funny, a decent person, and very mentally stable. She also has no kids but lives with her parents (it's very common in Israel to still live with your parents even in your late 20s). Although she is attractive, I find Amy faaaaaar more attractive and more in tune with my humor.

Amy is willing to host me at her place for a month so I can spend the duration of the required 2 week quarantine with her as well as travel throughout England with her after I'm free and thereby verify our compatibility. There's also high potential for one or the other to move to the other person's country and take things to the next level after I return to Israel. On the other hand, I haven't exactly given Wendy a fair chance yet even though I've only just met her. There are many pros to dating her but I could potentially be missing out on an amazing opportunity of a lifetime since I now have the money and time to go to the UK within 2 weeks of now.

Should I break things off with Wendy and fly out to the UK now to see Amy or play things out with Wendy and see where it goes?",22Aug2020,1

So, first thing, he's talked to my mom instead of me about being concerned about me working 'late', as in 5-7pm. I'm 26F. I don't understand his going behind my back to talk to my mom about me working late when my 2 coworkers, also female, 19 and 26, will work late. We don't have set hours, we know when stuff needs to be done, so we do it. The 19yo would (pre covid) work until 11pm or later on Saturday nights. I haven't heard anybody having any issue with that, so it confuses me why there would be an issue with me working until 7 at the latest. There's stuff I just cannot get to until after 5. After I found out he went to my mom instead of me, I went to him and politely said ""I'm an adult, I am the one working here. My mom has nothing to do with my job. I answer to this company about my job, please come to me, not my mom, about any concerns you may have.

He saw me with one of my guy friends and later refered to this guy as my boyfriend, even though neither of us did anything that would be interpreted as girlfriend/boyfriend. This guy proceeds to tell me that he does premarital counseling and would be willing to take us on as clients. A little while later, while I was talking to somebody else, this guy comes up, jumps into the conversation, and barely connected to the conversation I was having with another person, said ""Well, you should get married and have kids."" Even after I told him ""I will never get married or have kids"", he still insisted I should get married. At that point, I walked away because if what I say will not be heard, there's no use in staying in a conversation.

A while later, when I went to drop off my time sheet in the office, there were several people in the common area, including this guy, the accountant, and 2 female secretaries. Well, this guy asked for a hug, and I backed away and said no. He continues to harass me for a hug, even going so far as to try to grab something out of my pocket. He's 60+, I'm a 26yo woman. I told him twice ""I don't hug people I don't know well or don't trust, and I don't know you well."" He didn't listen. He continued to harass me with ""I'm sure your parents have taught you how important hugs are."" I know that the two secretaries heard what was going on, and I don't know why they stayed silent. Possibly, they thought it was ok and normal, maybe they didn't want to or know how to stand up against somebody who could fire them. I have no idea, and I don't hold anything against him.

I tried talking to my boss about this last thing, and he just said ""try to stay away from him."" I'm doing that. I brought up the last situation to my coworker, and she told me to not tell anybody.

I've told my mom about this guy, and she's friends with him, and she thinks I'm demonizing him on no valid grounds.

I don't know this guy's intent on anything. I don't know why he's doing this stuff. All I can say is this guy has a track record with me for crossing boundaries, minor and major, and if he's brazen enough to try to grab something out of my pocket and harass me for a hug in front of other people ***AND*** a security camera, I have no idea if that's the furthest he'll go, or if he'll go further, especially if it seems like people around the company want to try to brush his behavior under the rug.

But, because of how he's behaved around me, I absolutely will not go near him if I can ever help it, because I don't want to risk whatever bad may happen, if anything bad does happen.",22Aug2020,1
198,"Hey everybody! Before we get started, a little about me. I’m a 13 year old (yeah, I know, probably too young for reddit) girl. I guess that’s all I need to clarify? I’m new to this, so sorry if there’s anything wrong with the post.

So, to put it simply, sometimes when I wake up and I’m a bit dazed I’ll hallucinate family members and friends. Most of the time I’ll hold conversations with them, and they can last for over an hour. But then I look away or get distracted and they just disappear. Sometimes I’ll hear my mom telling me to wake up, but when I do, she’s not even at home. Or I’ll wake up and I’ll se my mom, and she’ll tell me something like ‘I’m gonna make you some breakfast, wait here!’ And then, again, she was never there. There’s also a slightly similar thing that happens with me and my siblings, where suddenly our vision will just get cloudy (like black stuff covering it) and it’s hard to walk. I don’t know if this is normal, and I don’t wanna research it and end up self-diagnosing myself with something completely off. So reddit, can you help me with this?",22Aug2020,1

Now my only social interaction is with my brother and my mother. I love my mother, although we arent super close. And my brother is a violent person. He has ruined any chance of me ever having a good relationship with him. I am not a depressed person but I do deal with my emotions by suppressing them. I simply do no think about anything that bothers me most of the time. Sometimes I kind of feel like I have unusually little emotional response to things. I am just worried that not really being able to get out of the house and see a close friend will get to me. Social interactions with my friends are really the only time I find myself laughing and smiling. Plus, this semester I have a lot more to get done. Usually I just have classes. But this semester, I have classes, pilot training, a part-time internship, and ill be studying for both the GRE and the Air force officer qualifying test. Plus ill be broke from paying for all of it.

201,"I (20, M) have this friend/roommate (20, M) and although he doesn’t verbally or physically disrespect me, he’ll do disrespectful things knowingly. All for his personal gain. 

We’re about to move apart from each other in a week, and I respectfully asked him not to have a certain person over because I have an issue with that person. I asked this last week. 
He’s very aware of my issue with this person and has been for months. 

He agreed not to have them over until after we both move, and he didn’t last weekend..which is great. But tonight that person came over without saying a word. To me, this is disrespectful because I respectfully asked him not to have this person over. And I have a legitimate reason as to why. 

In the past whenever that person came over, they would stay up to a week at a time. My issues with that person were known even before then, but I let it slide. Eventually, I did say something about it and he said he fully understands. But yet he continues to do it. 

Besides that, he’s a good friend overall. That’s really my only issue with him, him having that person over knowing I have beef with them. And continues to do it even after having a talk with him about it. 

I guess what I’m asking is, should I really press the issue tonight while they’re here and possibly cause a negative impact on our friendship? Or should I just let it slide and deal with it without causing any new potential problems?",22Aug2020,1

I made the decision as a light joke but now that I have the time, I can graduate this year instead. I will be 16 when I graduate. I do want to graduate early, I hate being forced by law to be there and I don't like that many high schoolers have no appreciation of life and a lot don't have any self-esteem. I know there are some adults like that but at least I will be able to make that decision if I want to go to school with them. I'm pretty intelligent and I'm very sociable.

209,"i met this girl just about a year ago when i changed schools for freshman year, and she quickly became one of my best friends. we'll call her elena.

IMPORTANT: ELENA DOES NOT KNOW I KNOW THIS AT THE MOMENT. AT THE TIME OF POSTING, IT IS FRIDAY NIGHT.

i go to a very small christian private school in the southern us (high school of 317, graduating class of 87). even though i am a left libertarian and attended public school for 10 years, i absolutely love it, and that's for the sole reason of the community. every student and teacher has a deep, personal connection with each other. long story short, everyone knows everyone, and everyone is friends with everyone.

last year, i was in first period latin with a kid named ""john"", with whom i had an odd relationship. at the root, we were friends and very close. he would KILL for me, and i wish i was joking about that. i told him (almost) everything, and in turn, he would tell me that he has a gun and he's not afraid to use it. he's the kind of guy who shows love and care through teasing, but would always sincerely apologize and NEVER repeat it if it went too far. we also had enough respect for each other to apologize. john is one of the best and truest friends ive ever had.

ive always noticed that i put in more effort than elena. shes the kind of person who will go and cry, rant, and expect you to be there for her, but be emotionless and short when you NEED her. but i never expected her to be as hateful as to say the things shes said.

long story short: so freshman year, elena and john had this weird thing where they obviously liked each other, but one would always turn other down when thy made a move but still HEAVILY flirted. this was elena at first (who turned john down) and then john decided he didn't want a relationship, but then when he grew up and then went after her, she decided he was ""toxic"" and GHOSTED HIM. right after flirting like no other. she even made up bullshit about her parents not liking him and her not being allowed to date.

today when talking to john, bc i only knew elenas side, he told me that he's upset that she made stuff up and talked crap about him, and suddenly said that shes been talking crap about me too. the shit she said was BEYOND petty, it was HATEFUL.

i believe him because ive seen her talk this way about other people, even her friends. i do not put being two-sided to her friends behind her.

\*note: i am apparently NOT the only one she does this to\*

john told me:

\- elena would constantly ""rant"" to him about how annoying, clingy, and unsupportive i was and how much i needed to shut up in classes. he described it as being if i had minorly inconvienced her in some way, she would rant for like 45 minutes. a day. september 2019- may 2020.

\- she then ranted over and over, time and time again how i was stealing all of her friends (there are 32 girls and 53 guys in our grade. bitch, what do you want from me???). john explained that he just thinks she complained because im one of those people who make friends very, very easily and she was jealous that i made friends with everyone in my grade (and others, i was very well acquainted with the senior class of 2020, along with some 2022 and '21) that took her years to be friends with. she has been going to our K-12 school since 3rd grade. as stated earlier, i started attending the school freshman year (i just started sophomore year on wednesday).

\- elena told john that i was a ""whore"" for having CONSENSUAL SEX with my (now ex, but we ended on great terms) bf who (was) 2 years older than me (i was 14, he was 16, were now 15 and 17). and says that i only fuck around for older guys (as if i wasn't dating a guy in my grade a couple months earlier). she also decided that i wear ""too much makeup"" and that im probably trying to ""hide something"".

\- she would also tell him how bad i was at math and how much better she was than me at singing/songwriting/etc. keep in mind that songwriting is the ONE THING that i am proud of myself for. in eighth grade, i wrote a personal song that i felt like had the power to change lives. i showed this song o all my friends, and showed it to my English teacher, where then we had the start of a great relationship (breakfast in the mornings, having her featured on the song, going over to her house to record, crying in her room more than an acceptable amount of times, etc.). i was obviously her favorite, and elena was jealous. she ranted to john about how she was obviously the better songwriter, but shed never get recognized because I was ms. ""william""'s favorite student. however, i got recognition from my coworker and then started writing for their band, and have been making good money off of it. i am quite proud of where ive gotten, and it feels terrible to have my friend shit all over it.

here is the song, for context of the songwriting (THIS IS NOT FOR PROMO, BUT INSTEAD FOR AN IDEA OF HOW PERSONAL AND EMOTIONAL THE SONG IS TO ME. ITS RELEVANT IN THE NEXT PART) elena is the one belting at the chorus before the spoken word: 

**MeToo by ""cj johnson"" on Spotify**

the worst part:

\- and if spreading around my CONSENSUAL sex wasn't bad enough she told john about my extremely traumatizing and PRIVATE rape experience i had in august of 2018. i was 13 years old. as mentioned above, the song i released for my solo career was about my personal experience with sexual assault and rape. i have not publically come forward with my story/reported it, only my close friends, even telling people in my family that it was a song about sexual assault as a whole. elena was featured in the song as a backup singer. in march, after the song was recorded, she told john this about me:

""cj forced ms williams, priscilla, and i to sing this dumbass song about a 'rape' that didn't even happen. some guy just got drunk and fell on her, and she says that was rape. she made it all up for attention.""

and continued to go on about how i made it all up. THIS WAS NOT THE FIRST TIME SHE BROUGHT UP THE RAPE. she had also brought it up around last october when john and i got in a political argument involving rape and i told him he needs to be more aware of who he's talking to. she told him that im pretending to be raped for attention. people like her are the reason i don't come forward.

of all the things listed above, elena has never said any of them in front of me, nor has jonah told me about them. he apologized over and over for not telling me earlier, and says that now he has no respect for her, and feels no obligation to protect her.

but though john can be a lot of things, he has not ONCE lied to me. and he is NOT a liar. i would swear on a bible for something john told me.

could someone please help out? shes in two of my classes, so i see her every day and i cant move any of my classes with her. i see her first thing monday.

this hurts because its not the first, and definitely won't be the last time something like this happens. people have taken advantage of me being nice (im a HUGE people pleaser, and am firm in the idea that being kind means sacrificing yourself for other people. this has not worked out, to say the least) and talked shit about me behind my back just to seem cool. just because they know they can walk over me all they want to get all their anger and frustration and ill just take it. this past year has been so terrible for me, from school, to family, to breakups, and just when i go back to school in person (no, i literally went back on Wednesday) i find out that -who i thought was- my best friend absolutely hates me. there's just been so much piling up and im at my breaking point. i literally cried most of the day at school yesterday because little things (being bad at geometry, my study-hall friend not being at school, not being able to hug people when im a physical-touch person) were setting me off. i CANNOT take anything else.

210,"Alright so a bit of backstory.
I'm 17M, have been single for about 5 months and have had barely any human contact with anyone (the only people being my family, my best friend and his girlfriend). Before everyone started quarentine I had sex for the first time and loved it, but then after lock down she dumped me a week in which made me feel used and depressed so I just stayed in my room and did nothing for a month. I was masturbating about once or twice a day which was slowly going down to reasonable levels until I went out with my friends. During our trip out the two of them had gone into the woods to fuck without me knowing, but I got bored so went to look for them and found them just after he blew his load. Obviously there was a lot of screaming by them and apologising by me but ever since then my sexual frustration has been through the roof and now my masturbating (which shot up to like 4 times a day) has stopped being effective and at this point I really want to do stuff with someone.

It was great to find a community where I felt like I could belong and get along with people. More recently I've been taking on some of the responsibilty of the group even though I don't have any leadership standing. I did this only because one of the officers wasn't doing the job they were elected to do. I enjoyed the idea of being able to do great things with my group and expand and grow and help people. But now it's like no one even cares about any of that. We're currently completely without any officers and I've set my sites on the presidency. I have all of the ideas on how to market ourselves so we can do more and gain more representatives. Everyone I've brought this up to acts like it's nothing. Lately I've felt like it might actually be nothing. This is mainly the focal point of my dilemma. I also work for the department that sponsors our group. Because of quarantine I've taken on even more responsibility to make sure everyone is safe and protected from COVID-19. I clean up after classes, I monitor larger classes when everyone isn't allowed to show up, and despite all of this I can see everyone look at me like I'm some kind of villain.

this hurts because its not the first, and definitely won't be the last time something like this happens. people have taken advantage of me being nice (im a HUGE people pleaser, and am firm in the idea that being kind means sacrificing yourself for other people. this has not worked out, to say the least) and talked shit about me behind my back just to seem cool. just because they know they can walk over me all they want to get all their anger and frustration and ill just take it. this past year has been so terrible for me, from school, to family, to breakups, and just when i go back to school in person (no, i literally went back on Wednesday) i find out that -who i thought was- my best friend absolutely hates me. there's just been so much piling up and im at my breaking point. i literally cried most of the day at school yesterday because little things (being bad at geometry, my study-hall friend not being at school, not being able to hug people when im a physical-touch person) were setting me off. i CANNOT take anything else.

222,"My (17) gf (17) likes to smoke weed. Not that often, but like once or twice a week. I, am very uncomfortable with weed. It gives me anxiety to think about my friends doing it, let alone my gf. But she doesn’t really want to stop. She has, for my sake, but I feel bad and she feels restricted. So what do I do? Whenever she smokes, I get these extreme anxiety attacks that usually ends in a bad night for me. I wish I could just suck it up and deal with it, but it’s really hard to not overthink when it’s something that’s affecting a person I hold so dear. So I guess I’m just kinda asking what some solutions are? I don’t want to even consider breaking up with her, this is the only problem we have.",22Aug2020,1
223,"Maybe this is the place to post, I don’t know, forgive me if that’s the case. 

I feel like absolute crap and have had the worst week at my job since I’ve started, I work with customers, visit houses on a regular basis and due to the nature of my job have been working throughout the pandemic. 

My company hasn’t cared one bit, least of all my boss who is both an anti-masker and believes the virus isn’t real. I’ve been exposed twice now directly to people who had the virus, the first time I asked if I should get tested, and his answer boiled down to “wait to see if you have symptoms and get tested” I didn’t follow that advice and went ahead with testing anyway, luckily I was okay but the couple who I’d been exposed to died a few weeks later.

It’s been bugging me how little everyone’s cared about the virus, how little my company and boss seem to care, and now that it’s gotten bad today they’ve started sending out surveys to ask if we’ve been wearing masks. The catch is if someone says no that person is to be fired on the spot, with no way for us to defend ourselves, there’s the potential for one unhappy person to lie and say no and I’m out of a job.

To top all of this off we’re short staffed, my boss refuses to hire anyone, we’re missing half of our people and he won’t interview anyone who applies, so in areas that need fice or more people we have two, or one which has been the case over the last couple of weeks.

We had some storms do serious damage here, and since we’re short staffed I have been essentially left alone to work an entire area by myself, because he has pulled everyone else to do storm damage, and he’s let multiple people go on vacation at the same time during this, mostly because he’s lost the vacation schedule twice now and we’re forced to take our vacations by the end of the year or lose them.

I’ve taken all of this and kept going, but today I hit me breaking point, for my job we are rigorously timed, and graded on when/if we meet appointments, example, I’ll get a 1-3 appointment I’m supposed to be there by 1, the next will be around 3 and so on, well today I was working a 1-3 it’s around 2 at this point and they give me more jobs for this 1-3 time slot, there’s no way I can get there on time, I call to let him know that and he offers no help, I tell him I don’t want to screw up my numbers and he hits me with “it is what it is” 

All I can think of is “you selfish ass” I stay out late every day working more than I need or want to, I do all these extra things to keep this place running, I take care of customers and fix problems outside of my regular work and the best you can tell me is “it is what it is”  I guess at this point I realize this man is about nothing but himself, I’ve caught him sleeping at his desk, I’ve caught him leaving hours early, caught him doing all kinds of things and I’ve never said anything, but when things are in on the other side, when it’s time for him to at least protect me from things out of my control all I get is “it is what it is”

At this point I’m completely demoralized, I’ve put 60 hours in this week and at this point I’m going in for another shift in 5 hours, I’ve been in a bad mood all evening and don’t even want to think about going back to this place, I’ve worked so hard tried to do so much for this place and it flat doesn’t care about me, doesn’t care about my health, doesn’t care if I get sick, doesn’t care if I die. I don’t know what to do. 

My job options in this place are limited and not much comes close to my current wages, I’ve put a lot of time into this job and I’m afraid of changing careers at this point, I have a wife and a young child to take care of.

229,"i should start off by saying that i am not suicidal, im 19F and recently (two days ago) diagnosed with a life long medical condition. i didnt think it would effect me mentally as much as it is in this moment. it’s really hard to explain, but i am going to try. 

it’s not really relevant, but i will add that i work nights. often i leave my job around 1-2am and hang out with my coworkers (who im very close with, they are like family to me). every time im with them, i generally have a great time, but in the middle of it all i just think “wow, this could really be my last time seeing everyone”, and i think about them without me there. im the loud, random, outgoing one of the group (and there’s only ever gonna be one of me). i just think of how quiet it would be, and how sad it would make everyone. it genuinely makes me upset. i always put others feelings before my own, and for the most part it’s why im still here.

i suffer from a slew of mental illnesses, and i am unmedicated for all of them. i could never find the right thing for me no matter how many pills the doctors threw at me. from the ages of 14-17, i was on and off suicidal. i’ve gone through the whole wanting to off myself thing but inevitably never doing it for fear of how upset it would make others. but this situation im in now hits completely different. /i don’t want to die/. 

i really do feel like my time on earth is coming to an end, and i do not know how to stop it. i don’t want it to end, i want to be here for everything i thought i would never see. i don’t cry a lot, and yesterday i was hanging out with a good friend of mine and i shed tears because i saw a meteor (i had never seen one before, and it was beautiful) because i realized how much i haven’t done yet. i know im young and i have years ahead of me to do everything i could possibly imagine, but i can’t shake the feeling of it all ending too quick.

it sounds super cliché, but i just want someone to tell me im going to be okay. i just need comforting advice and some sort of direction. i cant talk to anyone i know irl about any of this, because they’re just going to say im crazy and irrational.

231,"Kind of long story but there is a TL:DR at the bottom of you want to skip

So I (18M) met this girl (20F) a few weeks ago at work. We started talking during breaks and  instantly felt some attraction for each other, next thing we know we're hanging out a few times a week and on all of our breaks together. I was so happy to have met her, she was extremely direct with me which is the most attractive thing in a girl in my eyes. I have a lot of mental health problems and when I opened up to her about them she was extremely supportive and looked past my flaws which really helped with a lot of insecurities I have. When I would open about this stuff with other girls I'd get ghosted or they would tell me it wouldn't work, when I met this girl I finally thought she was someone I could make something out of this. We had kissed and sort of made out pretty early on in hanging out but during a talk she decided she wouldn't want to have sex yet as that would change the dynamic of the relationship. I said I was ok with that since the meds I'm taking lower my libido anyways. 

One day while I was walking her home from work during my lunch she asked what I was looking for, I wasn't quite prepared for this question as I haven't ever been asked this by a girl before. I kinda choked at the question and said I didn't really know as I've never been in a relationship before. After my response, she said she was still a little hung up on a guy but still liked me and just wanted to communicate that so we were on the same page. We hung out the next night at her place and I went into further detail about what I wanted, I told her I really liked her but wanted to know a little bit more about this guy she had mentioned. She said it was a hookup scenario where she developed feelings for him. I didn't bother asking if they were still in contact as I assumed they still would be. After this talk is when I opened up a bit about my health like mentioned before.

Fast forward to yesterday, I had a video call with her in the evening and she said she had plans to go visit a friend. She was drinking at this point. (I can't drink or do any drugs due to my meds and she knew this) turns out she was taking an uber to my apartment and her friend happened to live at the same apartment as me. When she got to the apartment I went to the lobby to let her in and gave her back something she let me borrow for a bit. Her friend also came down to the lobby too. This happened to be a guy. He was friendly, she introduced us and said she would would text me later because we had thought about maybe getting a ride back to her part of the city since I had to go there the next day. We said goodbye and she went to his apartment, I went to mine.

Obviously I was a bit jealous of this but she did say most of her friends were guys so I tried to think optimisticly of the situation and that this guy was just a friend. She texted me this morning saying she was a little hungover and would stay at her friends place for a bit so I ended up just leaving to go to her part of the city alone.

Several hours later on my way back home I get a text from her apologizing about what happened last night. I said it was ok but asked who that guy was, if he was just a friend or something more. She said it was the guy she was hung up on and felt really bad for thag confrontation the other night. Again, I wasn't really too bothered by this but brought up other things that we're bothering me, like how she doesn't seem to be putting in as much effort as I am in what we have going on. I also said that we don't seem to be getting anymore intimate than what we have been. She thought I was talking about sex and that she didn't want to have it yet, but I made it very clear that I wasn't talking about sex.

We just finished texting and ended it by saying we would see each other at work tomorrow. And I honestly don't know what to think. I feel like she likes me and wants to put in more work but at the same time I've had this suspicion that maybe she's just tagging me along as a plan B in case things go south with the other guy. She hangs with me more than the other guy too, but what bothers me is how she was willing to just hookup with this other guy but not want anything sexual to happen between me and her. I'm an aspie so I'm really bad at reading signals but this is just the gut feeling I'm getting from this whole situation. I haven't been able to sleep these past few nights just because of everything going on and plus I have lots of stressors in life outside of this situation. What do you guys think? Any advice is appreciated.

TL;DR: Met this girl at work and started hanging out a few times a week, talked about what we are looking for between us and she said she's still hung up on a guy. She's still visiting this other guy occasionally and doesn't want to take things further with me just yet, but doesn't mind doing stuff with this other guy.",22Aug2020,1

233,"Hi Reddit, so I'm not really sure how else to research / talk about this but I'm just looking for some advice from someone who has gone through the same thing. I honestly think too much and too hard about my dog passing away. When I was younger and growing up I had a dog and she was the most amazing smartest, loyal dog ever but she wasn't mine she was my parents. When she was in my life yes I appreciated her but I didn't fully take responsibility for her because again, I was a child and she was my parents. When my childhood dog passed away it f****** crushed me and I still think about it 12 years later. I would like to preface this by saying I am abnormally obsessed with dogs in general, I have to pet and talk to every dog I see and I genuinely think they are the most amazing animals anyone could ever ask for. 4 years ago I adopted my dog scooter who was 6 at the time and he is just the most genuine, cutest, funniest amazing, basset hound you've ever met. But one thing that I really struggle with being a dog owner is losing my dog. I do not know how I will ever get past him passing away. I got him in his latter years of life so I know our time is limited. He's a basset hound which they tend to live 10 to 13 years as per the internet and he's 10 now. he does so well and he is in great shape. I feed him properly, I take him for walks and he is so healthy. I know that it's just a part of life losing animals but I'm so heartbroken every time I look at him because I'm dreading the day when he passes away. Every week I will have a dream where he passes away and I wake up and I'm completely f****** crushed and I just need to understand how I'm going to ever get through him leaving me when the day comes. I don't have a husband or boyfriend at the moment so scooter is genuinely the most important thing in my life that I see on a daily basis. Of course I love my family but at the same time they're human and they're going to live decades from now. I just feel like my anxiety and fear of losing him takes away from the time that we have now. I love him so so so so so so so much and Im constantly giving him cuddles and kisses and doing as much as I can just show him that I love him and he is so important but it's still is so hard for me to just function in daily life thinking about him passing away. I want to get some advice from people to understand what it's like to lose your best friend that's a K-9 and to maybe try and understand how it's not the end of the world, things happen and the most you can do is just give your dog the best life they can. I'm hoping someone can give me some kind words and some optimism because I feel like this feeling in my gut takes away from the good moments that I share with my love. PS I know I sound crazy but I just have so much heart for animals and their genuine connection to people and the connection I have with my dog is so pure and it makes me happy but at the same time sad as per above haha.

234,"So I’ve been dating my boyfriend for a bit over a year now and there have been multiple occasions where his mother has made me uncomfortable. Firstly was when we reached four months and she sent me a text saying that I’m changing her son and that I’m ruining his life. Second being her asking me personal questions about my mother’s life (she’s divorced) and third being her asking me again about my mothers life but this time about her income and stating that she probably doesn’t make much. All of this shit made me uncomfortable as fuck for obvious reasons and my bf has never once spoken to his mom about all of this. We have had multiple conversations abt this but nothing’s made a difference so far. Can I get some advice on how to handle this annoying situation? Thank you!!

Update: 
She recently was blatantly racist and said she does not like my race and went on this whole rant about my race and how there are so many bad kids that’s don’t follow our “culture”. For starters I was EXTREMELY offended to say the least. On top of that, my boyfriend felt like it was okay to just laugh along with his mother. I ended up leaving his house and currently we are on a break (sort of. I’m going to be working with him but I’m not going to hangout with him for a while. We are currently talking about the whole situation over text). When I spoke to him about the whole situation today he said that he can’t do much since his mother is never open to conversations that involve her being in the wrong which is completely true but all I expect is for him to have my back which he never does in these situations and it makes me feel so uncomfortable and awkward. It makes me feel like he is not supporting me whatsoever and I need help. After speaking to him about it he basically said he can’t go against his mother or he won’t hear he end of it and he said he can’t do anything about it until he moves out which won’t be for another 4-5 years.

We spent the last year living together since we moved away to college and I was just miserable, she doesn’t trust with anybody ( not even guys) I went out twice during the whole year, once to go to a football game ( for an assignment at school with friends) and she called me in a rage to ask me where I was, second she didn’t call but she pissed I was leaving for like 2 hours. None of my friends from HS ever ask me to hang out and I’m 75% sure it’s because they know if they invite me at a party she’ll be there, and the times they do invite me she is there and she just has this shitty attitude towards everyone, she hates one of my best friends and doesn’t like it when I visit him, and shit talks about him to me.

I mean life itself isn't really going great for me and even though I have thoughts to end life I can't really bring myself to with the guilt of knowing that I will permanently hurt everyone close to me.

250,"About a year and a half ago I finally ended a relationship that lasted about 4 years with a very manipulative and controlling guy. 
To better understand my problem, I'll explain a bit. 
I was almost 15 at the time, he was 20, we met on a videogame and I fell in love. It was a long distance relationship and everything went well for the first year, enough to make me believe that was the love of my life and that I needed nobody and nothing else besides him.

The next 3 years, however, things changed. He began asking me to do things like deleting my entire friend list, blocking whoever was wondering why I just disappeared from Facebook, Instagram and other social networks; he also prohibited me to go out, talk to my classmates, join social gatherings, dress in ways he deemed inappropriate, wear make up, have friends or just play videogames with other people. In case I really had to go out for school projects I had to explain my day step by step, every single minute of it, from the time I woke up to the last second.
And I did everything he said because I was young, stupid and very very afraid to lose him as he continued telling me nobody else would want me.

It's been almost 5 years since then and as a result I have no social skills, I don't know how to talk to people. 
I've been told I have no personality and that hurts more than anything, but I guess I really don't. 

Is there any way I can develop a personality and social skills? Can you please, help me find one?

Thank you in advance!",22Aug2020,1
251,"I have a friend that has had issues with chronic homeless for years. He let me stay in a place he was renting when I feel on hard times a few years back. Long story short he lost his place while I got my life together. Since he had lost his place I invited him to stay at my place while he got back on his feet. That was nine months ago now. When I ask him about helping with the bills for the apartment all I get is excuses. He refuses to help clean up and attacks me when I tell him he doesn't do anything to help. I don't want to be an ass but I considering kicking him out, any thoughts?",22Aug2020,1
253,"I'm going to try to keep this objectively and in chronological order. pls pls read it I need help. I'm devastated I don't know what to do. I am a 23yo(F) student and my BF is 27yo who has a somewhat stable job. We both live with our own parents and my parents are very strict (especially coming from an asian fam). When we first met, we couldn't not be apart. Almost every night, he'd sneak in through the window through my room. and then I got pregnant.

My sincere dream always has been to have a family of my own. So of course I wanted to keep the baby. when my BF and I waited for the pregnancy test result, I told him I wanted to keep the baby, but I'll do what he wants because I don't have anything. He told me he was nervous and even excited for the result. When it was positive, he hugged me and told me we'd get married, move in together, get a little help from our parents and raise this baby.

THAT NIGHT, after talking with his parents, somehow his parents convinced him to get an abortion and get engaged instead if he really loves me. and that the child born right now wont be happy and that we won't happy because we're not financially ready. He called me to tell me that and told me he wanted to get a marriage license with me and move out together so he can take care of me. I felt a thump in my heart but eventually I agreed because I was scared.

My BF and I told my parents that I was pregnant and getting an abortion and asked if we can move out together. At first, my parents were devastated but eventually also agreed because they wanted me to finish school and have my life. My parents went to my BF's house (they were very close friends) to talk and they decided not to let us move out just because the moms were not ready to let us go. They scared each other by telling them that if we move out right now, we'd break up because we were too immature. They started making all sorts of excuses like how they don't have enough money to marry us ( even though we told them we just want to move out together for now).

after a few days, my bf and I agreed that we will move out 2 years later when we are all ready. They convinced us by promising that we will have an engagement ceremony instead and that we could freely stay at each others homes.

When I got an abortion, I got the surgery around 8week and the drug didn't work well so I felt all the pain. As both parents agreed, my BF planned to stay at my home for 1-2wks to take care of me.

THIS is when things started to go downhill. Not even after a week, my bf's mom started telling my BF that he shouldnt stay at my place like that because my mom didn't like him here? and started using my parents' words to convince him. Of course, my BF knew that wasnt the case bc my parents appreciated him and treated him well. Them two had a huge fight (apparently a first fight btw mother and son). and they started blaming me for convincing him to move out with me in the first place, even how he yelled at her was my fault when all the plans were his or his parents ideas and my family just followed up with it cause we trusted them 100%. And his parents started telling him how they didnt like the fact that he was getting married to me, but won't stop him. and discontinued calling my parents and just ghosted all the engagement ceremony plans and promises.

My parents got pissed and they still can't sleep because they trusted his parents. Only plan we kept up with was me getting the abortion.

During all this process, we had so many fights and there were times when he threw my shirt at my face, yelled and threw things on the ground (and the cops came after he left), etc. I forgave him because I didn't want to make things worse and just thought he was having a hard time through all these events.

Thankfully, my BF was on our side and he wanted to get the marriage license without anyone else knowing and just move out together 2years later. and we did bc i trusted him.

There was one fight, caused by him. I was so mad I ended up ripping the marriage license (before it was finalized). for my defense, I told him to rip it, but he gave it to me, yelling at me to rip it 3-4 times.

But i ended up apologizing bc I knew it broke is heart. I got a duplicate of it and thought i made up for it. When we got our rings after, He said hurtful things like ""im pissed, you better not through it out bc you're mad."" WHILE purchasing.

after a week, he went on a vacation with his family and finally had the ""talk"" with his mom. He didn't tell me much but I knew she somehow convinced him into thinking how our family is selfish, weak and stuff. All this time, he told me he was sorry and how he felt bad bc i didn't do anything wrong. but somehow after the talk, he said me it was kind of my fault, how my mom is selfish, etc.etc. That's when I started having anxiety at nights. I was nervous what else she'd do to affect our relationship and my family to hurt us by convincing him too.

One night, I was having a meltdown and called him. he said ""all i can do it tell you to become strong."" I got pissed because that's something his mom told my mom. she told my mom ""don't raise your daughter weak by bringing up abortion."" when my mom said how she didnt keep the promise after getting an abortion and if she didnt even feel sorry??. So over the phone i said ""how can you say that when this is all your fault."" of course i was emotional and i guess he couldnt take it anymore so we didnt say anything after that.

TWO days later, the day to get our License finalized, we made plans to have a date but he went to go shopping with his family instead without telling me. On our ride to court and back, we didn't say a word. he ignored my calls and texts that night. I didn't understand but he said ""idk if this is all worth it when you are blaming everything on me."" I got mad because why would he go get it finalized then? but i was calm and told him i was sorry, i only meant his mom cause what he said sounded like he was on her side.

not even a week after getting it finalized, he used the divorce card during an argument and threatened with a screenshot of divorce document online and told me to venmo him half the price so he can prove that I agreed with me paying partially?. eventually he told me he was just mad and he doesnt really want it.

And now, again, not even a week after, I had my emotional breakdown at night but it was the worst one I had some kind of panic attack and started banging my head against the floor.. I was in so much pain i called him. he didnt answer.

next morning, i told him how I've been feeling at nights whenever I am alone. and told him I want to talk to his parents. (now, i've been wanting to talk to his parents past 3 months but he didnt help.) I could see that he wanted to avoid the problem. I could see that he wanted to escape whenever i brought it up or needed help. So i said ""if i knew it was gonna be this hard, i wouldve broken up."" Thats when he flipped out yelling ""OK LETS GET A DIVORCE. GTFO GTFO."" I hung up. he called back yelling at me how he told me not to say things like that. and i just said "" lets get a divorce. "" and hung up.

Again, he texted me with the screenshot and told me to go to court to pick up the doc. I said okay. he texted me again asking me if I really regret getting the license and think it wouldve been better if we just broke up.

i told him i never said i regretted, how I hate him using the divorce card to get the truth out of me. and told him i meant it when i said it'll be over for good when he uses the divorce card again by assuming that conclusion,, without even talking to me.

behind the text, I knew he was angry. i said i've been trying to get better by myself when only thing he's been doing is avoiding and just telling me to endure it or be stronger. and how he didnt listen (just because he was scared of the outcome and what other will think) once when i suggested counseling, talking to the pastor, how i need help, or wanting to talk to his parents to solve any misunderstanding bc i didn't do anything wrong. and told him I was so fed up.

He replied with bunch of hateful responses saying how stupid i am to say ""i wouldve broken up."" and how i piss him off and he doesnt know what else he can do.

i just told him ive been enduring everything by myself and tried to be strong because he told me to and i trusted him. and how theres only so much i can handle it's driving me insane now. But now that im done because he pulled the divorce card again. and he just said okay.

I can't believe how stupid and blinded I was to endure all this for this family.

I have the divorce papers filled out. and we've been ghosting each other ever since (been only 2days). I have a feeling he's going to apologize in a few days (he done this a few times throughout the relationship). but im just going to go through with the divorce if he comes back with the same thought.

but before that, I want to ask if this is worth fighting for. I honestly want to end things bc It's making me mentally ill. I don't have hope. but i also think ""what if this is just part of marriage?""

My whole life, I thought you marry only once and divorce isn't an option unless an affair is involve. But i havent been happy even on the day of the marriage, promise rings, or finalization because of him and his family. I feel like he's taking me for granted, and because of how he treats me just bc he's mad (he wasn't like this before all this), i feel like an insurance with the marriage license to tie me down until he's ready to settle and then move out together. Also, after the finalization, he's been talking negative about marriages and how a lot of guys regret after getting married?. I felt like he was threatening me again by saying that but yeah. I know a lot of guys change after marriage i didnt know he'd be like that too.

Im young and im going through this by myself without anyone else knowing so I really need some advices... please judge objectively and comment if there's something i can fix too.",22Aug2020,1

257,"I’m still getting to learn a new friend group so far it’s been fine. I got this guy’s snap, and the friend  urged me on the text him. They asked a few days if we texted and when I said yes two of them shared a look. I kept asking if something about him was weird etc and they kept denying it. Two of the other friends also said he seemed like a decent guy, later when I said.

I had stopped texting the guy, just because we ran out of things to talk about. Yesterday the friends who shared a lot said that the guy had “I think she lost interest in me” and my friend swore about it. I thought why the hell not and began texting him again. We even talked about him today. Then I finally ask him if he wants to meet up or just be friends. He informs me has a girlfriend. I tell the two friends and they laugh saying that they knew all along. One of the friends I talked to privately looked surprised and said “you didn’t know!?”

Honestly I’m so big on trust and I just feel like they broke it for no reason. The guy was being shady as well of course, I wouldn’t want my boyfriend texting anyone else like he texted me.

I can just really tell I could get upset about this. Combined with some other things today, I haven’t been able to sleep. It’s 8am and I haven’t slept yet cause I’m just anxious. Would I be overreacting?",22Aug2020,1

263,"Ok this is probs the dumbest thing to be asked but like seriously, I’m 18F, living with a strict mom who doesn’t let me do many things, I work as a tutor with this kind family and I’m pretty close with them as they have invited me to go on picnics, movies, BBQ’s, cook together and have fun etc etc. These are things that I never get to do with my fam so obvi I choose to do it with my friends or with the fam that I tutor because they ask me to come with them
This time they asked me to go camping and I’ve never gone camping before but I’ve always wanted to do so

I asked my mum and she keeps saying no and her excuse “you’ll die out there” 😑 “what if an accident happens on the way” and a bunch of “what if’s” 

I don’t have a good relationship with my fam except for my mum, my dad takes my sisters to travel outside the country for a whole month or they all go out somewhere, I have no intention of going with him or connecting with him due to the way he treats me “and he definitely shows it, and makes it known that he doesn’t like me” 

The thing is for me, I never get to experience anything if it wasn’t for my friends or going out with that family and tbh it makes me happy to go out with them and I have nothing to worry about like for ex. Me being left out or forgotten about 

I told my mom that I’m willing to give the fams phone number if anything were to happen and she can get to talk to her and see that everything is alright

265,"The title sums it up pretty good. For more backstory, about 4 years ago I discovered that my father was sexually abusing my younger sister. It just so happened to be my birthday when I found out. I brought it to light, he spent some time in jail, my parents got divorced, I haven't talked to him since. He was a huge part of my life before that and then my view of him and everything he's ever done got distorted into hatred and contempt. Not a good mindset for *me* to have. I initially didn't talk to him because it would hurt him more than anything else I could do. I feel like I've moved past the hatred in my mind, but after 4 years, I have no idea how to even consider starting a conversation. I especially don't want to make him feel like I'm condoning his past actions, or anything, but I also want him to know I don't hate him anymore.

Then comes along (we will call her B) At this point I wasn’t expecting to get into a relationship at all but I had really fallen for B. She is an amazing person and I love her in a way that’s just different, She doesn’t work with me, we barely argue and our relationship is just healthy.

My problem is that the way I look at A, and when i’m around her just makes me happy, but I can’t do that while i’m in a relationship with B. As soon as A found out about B she wants me back, tells me she loves me, and my heart feels so conflicted. I have a girl who’s so perfect for me right in front of my face or I have A, where there’s chemistry but i’m afraid of getting hurt again. I really don’t know what to think or feel because I don’t want to lose anyone.",22Aug2020,1
267,"So backstory is that for the past 2 years and a half, I've been gradually getting worse and as I said, I recently hit rock bottom in terms of mental health.
And now, I can't really feel anything and I don't like it.

Funny thing is, when I was going through this, I kept wishing just to be numb already. To not have to cry myself to sleep every night. And I just kept jumping action to action. Like reading to watching some yt vid to drawing to doing chores or something else. All to delay the inevitability of laying on my bed and being miserable.

But one day, it just didn't happen, I didn't think about anything. I fell asleep and the next day, I was going about my day normally and that's what happened for the passed week or so. Then, when I was watching this TV show with my parents and it showed self-harm and when that happens my mind used to split 50/50, one half kinda continuing to watch the show and the other half thinking about myself but that didn't happen, nothing happened.

So I kept thinking about it, self-harm, suicide. Nothing. My experiences in those areas, foggy. It's like I can't remember what it was like anymore to be so miserable even though the most miserable moments of my life just happened a week ago. I feel like my worries haven't faded at all, it's like they've just been shoved into the back of my mind. And even though this is essentially what I wished for, I don't like it. 

And I know that my worries are still there because I can still feel a jolt of panic but that's it. I don't think this is a step forward, it feels more like a step sidewards if anything.

So help, please? Thanks for reading though.",22Aug2020,1

270,"For quick context my friend is my age and female (I don’t have a crush on her we’re just really good friends) 
Ok so this situation I’m in is really odd for me as I used to not have that many friends cause I used to be a horrible friend and overall a-hole, though I have become better my past makes me always feel like a horrible friend at times and I just need a solid answer. So I’m going into hs this year and so is my friend,anyway at the beginning of quarantine and up until a few days ago we talked basically every day, told each other all our secrets, and generally we’re each other’s shoulder to cry on. (Quite literally in both of our cases) but I digress a few days ago she basically stopped talking to me and I feel it’s because I just wasn’t being a good friend. Our friendship was full of sarcasm, jokes, poking fun at eachother just general stuff I have seen most friends do. But I feel sometimes I take it to far as I have quite a dark sense of humor (thanks reddit) and I am quite tough skinned when it comes to jokes and poking fun at each other adding the fact I have stopped caring about what people think about me doesn’t clash well with how my friend is a lot more sensitive to those jokes and she does care how some people see her. We have a lot in common but there are quite a few things we differ on, for example she is a lot more diligent and hard working while I like to be more laid back and don’t wanna take life to seriously and I say some pretty stupid stuff sometimes like really dark jokes and I feel she talks to me less because I started saying more dark stuff and have gotten more annoying but I can’t be sure. 
I think I should ask if she would like space or maybe just ask her directly if this is why but I’m still new to these kinds of friendships bc of my past self being a total a-hole. But idk anymore of what to do so I’m hoping someone more experienced from Reddit could help me out.

I'm going to be launching my new cycle repair business as a sole trader soon. I have everything lined up ready to launch to the public. 

I have a few questions, well advice I'm seeking. 

Does anyone have any recommendations for a good business account/ bank? I'm starting my business with £1000 of hard earned money in the business account and I won't be taking a wage from it for a long time, I'm aiming to make money and invest in myself and my ideas to build my business. I've looked about and feel that Barclays are going to be my best bet, but have no experience banking with them before.


I do work full time in engineering and earn on the PAYE system. How is this likely to effect me working a second job? 
I earn over 40K a year in my main job role and I know that I will be paying more tax etc etc 
But will it come from my engineering job or my self employed job?
I'll be paying for the services of an accountant to handle all of this as I'm not completely confident to handle it all myself at this current moment. 

Will the accountant need my personal PAYE wages and all my self employed business earnings? 


I will be doing some sales online and will eventually have an app for booking in repairs etc.
What will be the easiest system to use to raise up customer reference numbers, invoices, payment value and paid/unpaid status? I was thinking of using Excel to log and track every but I am unsure of this. 



Any and all advice on starting my business is very much appreciated,

Thanks in advance",22Aug2020,1

275,"My Girlfriend needs some advice...

She is heading into her senior year of High-School and needs some advice on which path she should take. She is choosing between returning to school -- in an environment where she finds it easier to learn and will receive better education, but could possibly get COVID-19. Her school has made adjustments and masks are mandatory but she will still be interacting with about 40-50 people every day. The other option is that she does online learning, which she's previously done and hated. It was difficult for her to learn this way and it affected both her emotional and mental well-being. 

We live in Saskatchewan, Canada which currently has 134 active cases.

She is asthmatic and with COVID-19 being a respiratory illness she fears that if she were to contract it that she will never recover back to normal (needing an oxygen tank for the rest of her life, permanent lung damage, death, etc.)

So she's basically at a cross roads right now and could really use some advice on making this decision.

Kind Regards,

276,"Sorry in advanced but this is about to be a really long, grammatically incorrect post. I’m very tired as I’m writing this and theres a LOT to explain. Flagging this as NSFW for mention of drug use, idk if that’s proper etiquette or not, I don’t use Reddit.

Ive always been someone who‘s against trying to post personal problems and stuff of that nature online, but I’m at a point where I don’t know what to do, and I don’t know anyone in my personal life I can talk to about this.

So, my best friend (23M) has always been a little off, but so am I, and that’s one of the reasons why we always got along so well. We’re both weird and introverted and creative minded people who come from less than desirable upbringings and have a lot of baggage. We found comfort in relating so well, and although we’ve gone through occasional periods where we don’t talk much, ultimately we’re always there for each other. We even have a band together, and the music I’ve written and performed with him is honestly some of my favorite music, but maybe that’s just my bias talking. 

Anyway, we‘re both heavy users of psychedelics. He does them less often than I do, but way higher doses. Its always been that way. I always assumed he just had a higher tolerance and knew what he was doing, but I don’t believe that anymore. 

That should be all the prior context necessary to understand what’s going on.

It started last year, something like mid october. We played our one and only live show back in early september and bombed because we tried to learn a new song the week of. This made us both pretty sad but it made me just want to practice harder. I noticed he started getting heavy into taking magic mushrooms after this. I’d go to his house and he would always have a full oz. just casually sitting out and would offer me a handful. After a while it started to get increasingly difficult to get him to come to practice. Then he just started to disappear entirely. Not unusual behavior for him, so I didn’t immediately assume anything was up. 

However, around  January, after not seeing him since late November, he starts abruptly hitting me up on Facebook telling me about how he’s gonna move out of the country. This caught me off gaurd, but it didn’t make me think anything was really up. He had spoken before about wanting to be a bartender on a cruise ship so it wasn’t just something that came straight out of left field. I was mainly just sad at the idea of not seeing him again for an undetermined amount of time.

Then he starts saying he’s gonna join the military. This is someone who has never in his life had any interest in anything close to military service, and is actually rather anti gov. This is when the red flags started flying for me. I tried to talk him down but he was insistent.

 I’d ask him “What about all your friends?” And he’d say “they’ll keep on.” Id ask “what about all the projects you’ve started? your film scripts, your books, or the album we haven’t recorded?” He would say “it’s just not for me man.” I knew something was really wrong at this point because this dude breathes creativity. Easily the best guitarist in my state if not my side of the country when he practiced every day, and his film ideas are fantastic too. Guy can write his ass off. To hear him basically say he’s done with everything was an instant punch to the gut. 

The next two months were a lot of me trying to get him to jam or just hang out in general and him occasionally showing up, and otherwise hearing nothing from him. When he would show up, he looked increasingly more disheveled and distraught as time went on. He started to gain weight, he always looked exhausted, wouldn’t really talk, and if we got him to play music it was obvious he hadnt been practicing. He would start half a song with me and just sort of stare at a wall or the floor and slowly stop playing after a minute. 

Then one day, he hits me with a bombshell. I get a message from him saying “I f—ed up. They’re after me man“. 

I, obviously confused, tried to pry more info out of him, but he wouldn’t budge. I get him to come to practice another time after that and after about 3 minutes of practice, he stops playing and starts scrolling through his phone. After a minute he comes up to me and starts whispering in my ear about how he thinks hes gonna get disappeared because he made some dark jokes in dms on messenger and that the NSA is tapped into his phone and that he’s done for. 

Hearing him say that to me is a moment I’m never gonna forget. I thought he was just messing with me because that’s definitely something he’d joke about. But he was dead serious, looking at me with tears forming in his eyes. After that, me and my other friends spent a long time trying to convince him it was nothing to get so paranoid about and that he wouldn’t be getting black bagged for dark humor, as we aren’t quite that 1984 in the states yet. He wouldn’t listen.

We eventually found out what had happened, though. Apparently someone at his work had gone through dms on his phone while he was away and threatened to report him to the FBI because they saw some of the jokes he makes and took it at face value. I had experienced something similar when I was still in highschool so I knew it was BS but he didn’t and it genuinely ripped him apart inside.  

After like 3 weeks of constant therapy/intervention sessions between the whole friend group, he started to snap out of it and feel better. But then one day he went from getting better to way worse practically overnight. The next time we saw him he was just... not there. he walked around from place to place as though walking in the dark or in a fog. shuffling, staring forward as though not even using his eyes with a look of despair on his face. He would leave his valuables in random places regularly as though not even thinking about it and give us random items of his for no apparent reason. Then he tried to give away his camera equipment and guitar gear and we knew something had to have happened but he wouldn’t say. 

We watched him delete all of his social media accounts while he was there. We tried to talk to him but he wouldn’t. he'd just say something to the effect of “we’re passed that point now”. There was a point where the others had went outside to smoke and it was just me and him. He proceeded to try to convince me that it was all real and that he was going to go to a blacked out prison somewhere forever. He started talking about killing himself before they could take him and thats where I drew the final line. Me and another close friend contacted his family and filled them in. His family ended up getting him to go to a mental health facility further upstate and we were left waiting with baited breath for nearly two months right as the pandemic kicked into high gear.

The last time I saw him for another month and a half was me and another friend crying our eyes out trying to convince him everything was gonna be alright while he just thousand yard stared at the ground with a burning cigarette butt in his mouth as his parents came to take him away.

Found out later from his family that basically these two extremely manipulative piece of garbage friends of his that he had been warned about by the rest of his friends an infinite amount of times had convinced him he was being surveilled by sending him messages telling him they were contacted by government agencies looking for him. 

Apparently the coworker who had initially threatened him also quoted something he started to type to someone but deleted before actually sending back to him too, but we think he may have hallucinated this, unless someone bugged his phone (He had a really simple passcode and used his phone to play music over the speakers while at work so it’s not necessarily impossible, but very unlikely).

When he came back in april, he seemed like he might have been doing better. He had gained more weight, but his sense of humor was back and he seemed generally like he was in higher spirits. He even made the choice to stop smoking weed, doing psychs and drinking.

However, when I got to talk to him about how he was feeling one on one, he told me he’s still convinced they were out to get him. He thinks now that they were sending him the message that they could take him away if they wanted to. He doesn’t fault the SOBs that made everything worse at all, pretty certain he’s back to hanging out with them now, too. 

As of now he went from planning to get back into the swing of things to being pretty much nonexistent. He was taking photos and writing scripts again but he’s since stopped. he hasn’t played his guitar since the one time we practiced together in late April. All he does now is work (at the same job this all happened at originally, by the way) and play video games. His social abilities are gone. his creative spark is gone. he went from working out religiously and being a neat freak to his room being a mess and gaining 150 pounds. He’s back to smoking weed and taking psychedelics. I hear from him once or twice a month. 

&amp;#x200B;

So... what do I do? Is there anything I can do or say to try to get him out of this funk or whatever it is that’s besieging him? Am I ever gonna see my friend again, or is the guy I’ve known since third grade gone forever..? I try to get him to come play music with me or go some place and he makes excuses. Thats how I know it’s not over. We learned how to play instruments together. I got my drums right around the time he got his guitar when we were kids. It’s been us vs the world for nearly 15 years. I worry about him all the time and I would do anything to help him see the light and wake up from whatever nightmare he’s in right now.. its tearing me to pieces to see him like this.. Please help..",22Aug2020,1
277,"Looking for some advice because I’m torn on whether I should attend my Ten-year high school reunion *if one is planned*. It would have been this year but due to COVID, nothing happened. I haven’t heard anything about one being planned prior to COVID hitting either so idk. 

In high school, I dealt with undiagnosed ADHD, suicidal ideation/depression, and a bad home life. I was also one of the only alternative kids in a primarily white upper-middle class school. Needless to say I didn’t date anyone or get asked to dances, and my circle of friends was very small.  

To summarize where I am now: I am managing my ADHD, I am no longer depressed or having suicidal ideations, and I’m actually doing quite well for someone who didn’t plan on living past 18. I still prefer alternative styles of dress but I’ve learned how to pass as normal when I need to. I’m married to a wonderful man who is also my best friend and I’m very proud of the life we’ve built together over the last decade. 

So here’s the thing: I dislike and/or I am indifferent toward about 90% of the people I went to school with. Most people either flat out ignored me or made fun of me. I only have a small handful of classmates still on any of my social media accounts and those are only the people who were actually nice to me. I’ve deleted quite a few people either because they made ignorant posts or because I just don’t relate to them and we don’t interact. I have a bad feeling that the people who were rude are just as awful now and I don’t want to waste my time around people like that. 

Additionally, due to some trauma I went through as a teen, I have very limited/spotty memories of my high school years and I don’t know if I’ll either just feel awkward not remembering things that happened or if it will trigger memories of the trauma. I’m not keen on having a mental breakdown in a crowd of people who are probably already judging me. 

Has anyone had a similar experience that went to their reunion? Was it worth it or should I avoid it like the plague? (I’m still limiting trips and wearing masks so that phrase actually applies here.) 

TLDR; I had undiagnosed mental illness and had an unusual appearance that made me not well-liked as a teen. I grew up and got my mental illnesses under control. Is it worth going to my ten-year reunion even if most of my classmates were awful?",22Aug2020,1

279,"So last week this 25 year old woman messaged me on a dating app - she messaged me because she related to my faith and creative hobbies...

And my goodness, her pictures were incredibly attractive... cute face, great voluptuous body with great legs and nice breasts... 

We also have more in common then with anyone I've met... she's an avid lover of art - she writes novels, screenplays, she loves music, the same movies i do, hiking and nature and so much more.

We exchanged numbers a day later,
texted a lot and talked on the phone twice, and she's super cool...

She told me her instagram and per my request, sent me many photos of her without a filter, photos that she says look exactly how she does in person and dang, she's very attractive.

Apparently she gets a lot of attention from guys, but they usually want to just hook up with her unlike me...

She likes me and we have plans to meet up in person soon, yet I find myself hesitant...

after scrolling through her instagram I found a few photos of her here and there, and they look incredibly different from some of her other photos...

like I would say downright very unattractive photos... these were from like 2015 and 2017...

she told me that growing up she didn't really know how to dress well, and just dressed in an overly modest way, but also she wore no makeup  and her hair was way different and she looked super unattractive...

her photos these past few years literally looks like a different person, which has me skeptical even though she sent me numerous pictures of her without filters...

she told me she's not hiding anything,
and that she looks exactly like the attractive pictures she sent me..

I mean those super unattractive photos were from like 3-5 years ago, but idk what's going on? 

I find myself hesitant now, but I do have trust issues. I just hope she looks how she does from her pictures.

I just feel like those older pictures were how she really looks.... and now she's just changing her style etc to cover up how she really looks... idk though what do you think?",22Aug2020,1
280,"Vague title, I know. I wasn’t sure how else to put it. Basically, i’m stuck between staying in CT, or moving to TX on short notice.

To further elaborate i’ve grown up here in CT, and just graduated high school this year. A month ago, my parents said they’re looking at moving to Texas, and now they decided to go. I have around a month to figure out my choice.

I’m not enrolled in college. I can go with my parents to TX, but I don’t know anyone there, and have no job prospects lined up. If i stay here in CT, i’ll have to live with my older sister and sleep on her couch while I try and get it together. Regardless of my choice, I feel like i’m screwed either way. 

Mental health wise I don’t think I can handle a move to Texas like this on such short notice (I’m seeing the proper professionals about mental health). 

Financially CT isn’t the greatest, it’s a super expensive place to live, but I really do love it here, and all of my friends are here. 

My parents pitched the idea that I go down with them for a year or so, and get my license, go to college for a year, work to save money, and then go back to CT. My issue with this is it seems like a waste of time. I already have my license situation planned up here in CT, the min wage is way higher than TX, and I qualify for in state tuition for a state college that I can actually get into. 

I’m very sorry for this whole block of text. I’m on my phone typing this, and having a rough night. I just wanted to reach out and see if anyone had some ideas. Is this move to TX actually a smart one for a young adult like myself? Or should I try and stick it out where i’ve grown up?",22Aug2020,1
281,"My bf and I have been together 4 years, have been living together for 2, and moved long distance together (ie, we are committed. This is not a story about cheating!)
Towards the beginning of our relationship, he told me that after he and his ex broke up, she was ‘dating around’ for a bit with other ppl. Bf and ex were kind of friends around then, but at some point she stopped talking to him except to ask his opinions on women’s rights related to pregnancy and about his detailed family medical history...he later found out that she had been pregnant and had a baby. (The timeline is fuzzy but she had the baby 12 months or less from when they were last together.) they talked and she told him he was not the father. And then she pretty much stopped talking to him. This was all before he and I met. 
He’s always had a sliver of doubt about what if it really was his kid?, bc she had lied abt some things in the past, but he didn’t believe she would lie about something like this. 
Now the kid is 4 or 5, and the “what if” still comes up now and then. He reassures himself that she must have told him the truth, but ‘what if a 40 yr old comes knocking on my door one day saying I’m their dad’ - aka the uncertainty worries him; if he had a kid he would want to be part of his life.
As a female, I couldn’t imagine not knowing 100% if I had a child. I feel like if I were him I would need to be certain and wouldn’t think it would be so out of the question to ask for a dna test or something. He doesn’t want to bother the ex, mess with her life and be perceived as ‘cocky’ (she blocked him and they haven’t communicated in years). I want to support him and I told him if he wanted to do anything further I would help and support him. It concerns me too, the not knowing 100%, bc I want him to know and I could potentially be a future stepmother...I’m finding myself wanting to go down the rabbit hole trying to somehow find when exactly the baby was born, etc...

292,"I really don’t have anyone to talk to about this, until now me being a virgin was a secret I kept out of fear of this exact thing happening. 

So I’m 19 and a pretty sexually inexperienced virgin. I’m not necessarily a good looking guy, I’m kinda odd looking, I have a hard time talking to people, I’m shy, I don’t really get dating or flirting. I don’t know why I’m like this, but since I was like 16 I felt out of place. All of my friends were able to get girlfriends and lose their virginities but me. I got into a relationship with this girl that pursued me when I was 16 with a girl that didn’t want to lose hers and that lasted until I was 17. Because of this I feel like I missed my only chance to lose my virginity at a normal age. I feel like I’m in what should be the sexual peak of my life, and I can’t get a girl to talk to me. I want to be able to have an active sex life so if somehow I do find a girl that likes me, I’m not nothing compared to what she experienced from other guys. I’m also afraid that if I’m going to be alone until I’m like 25 when everyone else is done experimenting sexually and wants to settle down and I will have missed tons of life experiences.

I, in confidence, told one of my friends that I was still a virgin and told him all of my insecurities about it. He wanted to help me find someone and went out to our larger friend group to find someone. A bunch of them thought it was hilarious that I am so old and still a virgin, and have been making fun of me for the last few weeks about it. I feel like I’m such a freak, I’m the only virgin I know, I’m horrified of falling into incel territory, but now that I’m 19 and just can’t get it done I think I might be headed in that direction if I can’t lose my virginity in the next year or so. I know everyone says just let it cone naturally, but that just doesn’t work for me, if it did I wouldn’t be as old as I am now unable to lose my virginity.",22Aug2020,1
293,"This seems like a stupid question but let me provide some context.

My ex broke up with me a couple of weeks ago over text and didn't really talk to me much after that or give me closure when I asked for it but for some reason, she continued to send me blank pictures on snapchat to keep our streak of 1554 days going. I've been doing it for a while now but I feel like it's weird to keep it going with someone who won't even talk to me. Something inside of me wishes that she still has feelings for me just because she still keeps this streak but that's probably not the case.

I told her yesterday that I was planning on ending our streak today along with some other closure stuff but she goes ahead and sends me another blank picture as if we are continuing our streak. Should I try talking to her one last time and ask her what's up with that or just finally end the streak without saying another word.

I have not hate towards her and honestly still haven't fully gotten over her but Idk where she stands and these snaps aren't helping me.",22Aug2020,1

298,"I live with my mom. Several hours ago, my sister visited. I was outside when she visisted, otherwise id stay in my room. She was here for maybe 30 mins then left. I read online that droplets stay in the air for 3 hours. I recalled a nurse telling me its only a few minutes, so i just walked in the house, with my shirt over my face. Im sure it didnt serve much protection. I felt guilty after a little bit, so i went outside, and waited 3 hours.

When i came inside i was in the process if washing my cloths, and beding. I was able to wash my cloths, but not my bedding, when we ran out if water. I was also gonna take a shower, but no water. I could theoreticly use the bottled water, but  used baby wipes on my arms, and face, parts that were exposed, but i firgot to wipe my feet, and those have already touched my pants, as im sitting criss cross...shit. also, when i went to wash my face with te tiny bit of water we had left, i went to dry my mouth of with the inside of my shirt, because it probably wasnt exposed to the droplets. I emmidiatly regreted it, but didnt want to go back to wrinse my mouth, so i just licked my lips, so that if ther was anything dangerous on my lips, then id just lick it, snd get it ovet with. I also forgot to wash my hands bfore i put my new cloths on, so those are contaminated now. Im also not actually washing my hands but using hand sanitizer, because we dont have water, and i dont want to touch the water bottles, because my moms respit kid carried them in, and i know he doesnt wash his hands nearly enough. I could wipe them with a clorox wipe, but then im worried my sisters droplets are on the box to that, in case she went  near them, and it would be a pain in the ass trying to get them out without touching the container itself.

302,"i wanna make this short and brief. I don’t have many friends so i don’t know who to ask. Basically my dad [38M] is really arrogant with money and when he’s got a lot of it, he likes to flaunt/spend it. When the pandemic first started, he created a quick business and made a considerable amount of money. I [20F] just moved away, to a different state and he had already been jokingly trying to get me to come back. With this new found money, he would try and bait me with things i needed and he knew i couldn’t get on my own at the moment. He would brag so much and told me he was gonna make big unnecessary purchases for himself of things that he knew i was in need of. Id tell him he shouldn’t make those kinds of purchases as it would be excessive and other people are in need of things like that. Aka me. Haha. Whatever moved on. Well come to find out, the business died and so did his real job bc of COVID and because he went on a spending spree, now he’s short on money. I on the other hand, had been spending money less because i had less and i wasn’t going anywhere. That money added up. It still is. I ended up using that money to take a trip with my friends. On the way home from that trip, at the airport, i realize my phone service is off. My dad was paying my phone in the meantime while i settled in from my move, but with the circumstances, i understood why he hadn’t paid it. I open the app to make a payment on my service for him. I see that he is behind on the payments by a lot. No big deal. I always told myself if i have it in excess and someone else needs it, there’s no need for me to keep it. so i paid off the phone bill and the expensive late bill. One time thing in my head, just to help him a little. A few weeks go by and my friends and i make a plan to go on another trip. I’m not short on money but I’d like to have that money back that i spent on helping my dad. I ask him about it and he tells me he’s struggling and wondering if i could pay the phone bill again. Because I’m an empath i can’t think of why i shouldn’t do it, because again, if i have it in excess i don’t need it. so i was considering it. I go to my bank statements just to review what I’ve been spending my money on and making sure i have the funds to help based on my spending behavior and thing i myself have to pay. I come across an unfamiliar transaction of over a hundred dollars and i do not remember this transaction at all? It says it’s to a different checking account but i don’t  recognize the account number. I do the sensible thing and i search through my past transactions with my dad to see if the account numbers match and what do u ya know? just 3 days ago, the day before i asked him for the money back? He usually tells me when he borrows money cause he does it a lot. But i didn’t know about this one and I’m confused as hell. and now i don’t want to help because i know i shouldn’t but i feel bad and still want to :( what do i do",22Aug2020,1
303,"29/F A lot of very bad things happened this year, from my 81 year old mother getting a pretty bad diagnosis at the beginning of the year (she had just come home from a 10 day stay at a hospital 2 days ago, but I think she's going to slowly decline), to a sexual breakup that I had hopes it was going to become more serious (I have yet to completely get over it), to my two elderly dogs becoming sick and suffering complications. A close friend of mine couldn't even text me for my birthday, even though I had made sure she got her gift and a call even though she was several states away from me.
 
Everything pretty much happened month after month. 

My already poor self-esteem is worse. I constantly feel as though my mother is going to leave me soon, I'm going to have to come to terms with possibly euthanizing my pets, and I don't feel as though I'll ever have someone romantically interested in me ( never had boyfriend, guy mentioned above was my first). And I am suffering more anxiety and I think I'm slowly developing depressive symptoms. Life right now really fucking sucks, and it's taking an enormous toll on me mentally.

304,"Hello, so background i (F21) have grown up in a very religious household and have had Christian beliefs my whole life. I am completely content in that aspect and honestly figured that stuff out for myself for a long time now. 

My problem is that while I’ve always told myself that I want to maintain my virginity until marriage, I’ve also never been in a serious relationship. I haven’t really found “the one”. 

TMI: I’ve also never been shy about handling my own needs when needed and so I’m not naive in what I like or sex or anything of that nature. I just haven’t had hands on experience. 

I’m scared of a couple things. 
1. This is a commitment I’ve had to myself for about 11 years. I don’t know if it’ll get any harder in the future and I’m at a loss for if I want to keep this up or not. 
2. I’m very scared that when I get married, I’ll compare my partner to past sexual partners. It’s a raw and personal moment most of the time. I wouldn’t want to ruin those moments by comparing myself. 
3. What if I’m not good enough. I’m scared about how my body looks, how I’ll perform, and if my partner will have had partners before me. Which I’m totally okay with. It’s a personal decision. I’m just nervous that I’ll be really bad at it. 
4. Im also extremely scared of catching a virus/disease or becoming pregnant. I wouldn’t want to have an abortion. So having a kid this young is terrifying. 

There are a lot of things running through my mind. Recently I’ve been very interested in a couple of guys I work with and I’ve thought about it. But I’m just scared my fears will becoming a horrible nightmare of a reality.

She acts like I’m her therapist and she vents to me about how she hates work and her boss. She denies that my school has bully and she thinks that it’s fine for people to make fun of me and my friends because they didn’t “specifically target one person”. I told her that I think I’m depressed and she yelled at me and said I was too privileged to have depression. She basically forced me to take Prozac for anxiety since I was 8 or 9, I told her that it made me feel worse, but she insisted that I took it anyway.

308,"Not in the sense that I'm worried about having a job, money, or anything like that. More so about the fact that it just makes me really sad thinking about leaving my parents and being lonely. I'm 21 and I've moved out a couple times already and am moving out again in a couple weeks, but the thought of finally becoming a full in adult fills me with so much anxiety. My mom's recent dreams to start a career in cosmetics were crushed this year and my dad is stuck in an upper management job that he hates and I've noticed he might be developing depression based on how my own depression looks like. My sister is still home but she treats them like shit, and my parents have been on and off fighting for months. When I've moved out before, my parents have heavily implied how sad they were when I'm gone. 

My family likes to go on weekend trips every once in a while and we're currently on one rn and I'm just sitting here thinking this is probably the last time we will ever do this and it makes me so depressed. It makes me so fucking sad thinking I'll never have my mom ask me how my day was when I come home or having my dad come talk to me when he gets off work. No more family dinners. No more of any of that stuff that I took for granted when I was younger. I love my parents and I can't stand thinking about their mental health when I'm finally gone. During my teenage years I was very distant with them for reasons I can't explain and have only recently finally began getting close to them, just before I'm about to leave them. Im filled with so much shame that I didn't do this when I was younger and just wish I could go back. 

My mom had me when she was very young and has spent half her life being a mother. She has dedicated her life to being a mother and now I'm about to leave her all alone. My dad spends most of his days at work and my sister is hardly home, and when she is she treats my parents horribly. And like I said, my parents' relationship has been struggling. Due to my mom's extreme risk of death if she gets covid, she has to stay at home all day long and this has taken an insane toll on her mental health and it pains me to witness. Just the other day I tried taking some food to my room but she asked me to eat it upstairs. As a son does, I insisted it was fine but she told me to just eat it upstairs in a very sad tone. I know she just wanted to talk to me. I realized this and started a conversation, but she just had tears in her eyes the whole time because she too realizes I will soon be gone. This really fucking broke me. My mom will have no one when I'm gone and no one to care for and no more hopes of finding a career. My sister, like I said, is really mean to them a lot of the time which makes her even more depressed because literally all she wanted in life was a happy family, and she didn't really get that. 

I'm lying here typing this on this trip knowing this is probably the last night our family will ever have something like this again. Our family is all having a good time and looking at my mom with this light in her eyes with all our family together just makes me so fucking unbelievably sad knowing this wont happen again and knowing she's going to be all alone in a few weeks.Im thinking about all the amazing memories I've had throughout my life with my parents and I don't want them to end. Obviously I'm going to visit them as often as possible, but you know what I mean. It's time for me to grow up, but the thought of leaving my parents who I took for granted as a teen just...idk man just makes me feel this indescribable depression different than the depression I usually feel. What can I do? I fucking hate feeling like this. I fucking hate thinking about my mom's and dad's mental health when they no longer have someone to parent except my mean sister. I just don't know what to do.

TL;DR: It's time for me to grow up but the thought of leaving my parents and no longer making memories with them fills me with intense sadness. My parents' mental health is already not great and I don't know what is going to happen when I leave",22Aug2020,1
309,"Hi! i recently found out this news from another friend and am really struggling on what i should do. 

For a little bit of back story, my friend (15M) ive only known a little while but i would definitely consider him one of my closest friends at the minute. He recently started dating this girl (14F) and lost his virginity to her which was a big fucking deal. We are all in the same friend group and i’ve NEVER liked her. I think she is a manipulative piece of shit, who fakes her mental disorders, only EVER speaks about herself and situations that she makes up half the time, she is a physically draining person and i don’t enjoy being around her. i’ve always had this bad vibe from her, she openly flirts with my boyfriend and the brother of my friend IN FRONT OF MY FRIEND. She would always fucking talk about his brother, making sexual comments that CLEARLY made him uncomfortable as well as everyone else. I knew at some point something bad was going to happen but i didn’t expect this. 

Anyway, tonight i was told from another friend that she had slept with his brother. She told her this and blamed it on the fact she was tripping on acid BUT she bought that acid from my boyfriend, and messaged him telling him how it did not work and that she wanted a refund. At this point i don’t know what i should do. i have blocked her on social media as i am completely and utterly heartbroken and mad for my friend. He truly loved her and didn’t deserve this, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE ITS HIS FUCKING BROTHER WHO IS 20 YEARS OLD AND SHE IS A LITERAL FUCKING CHILD. 

i really don’t know what i should do, and whether or not it is my place to tell him. i truly want to tell him but i also think i have no place to tell him, as i am not involved.

thank you .",22Aug2020,1
310,"So I feel like I’ve gotten into quite a mess. I’ve been living with my dad and grandma for about 8 years now because he got full custody from my mom. Anyway, he’s bipolar and rarely ever takes his meds and he used to be a hard core drug user and from time to time he would slip up and use again. So anyway now that’s said and done, for the past 3 weeks my house has been kind of hell. My older brother (23) and my dad got into this massive argument and my dad who is bipolar and has this MASSIVE temperament. it got so bad to the point where he had my brother pinned against the wall and left bruises on him. And since then my brother hasn’t talked to my dad. So let’s go to  this Monday. I was eating dinner and my other brother (20) asks me if I wanted to finish the movie we started watching. I told him no that I was going to my boyfriends house and my dad got mad at me and said,”FUCK MAN WHY DO YOU HAVE TO RUIN EVERYTHING!” The dinner table got quiet we were all confused. And my grandma changed the subject. Soon my dad asked why I don’t like spending time with him or being at the house a whole lot. And most of it is because both my dad and grandma are extremely mentally ill and refuse to get help and are too prideful and the environment is literally toxic. I just respond to my dad saying you just have a bad attitude. Again my grandma changed the subject and my dad yet again asked why do you think I have a bad attitude. So I simply told him,” You’re extremely negative. And it’s hard to be around. I love you but I can’t be around negativity all the time and you’re always complaining about work.” I my self deal with mental illness as well and it’s a cool mixture or depression and anxiety and it’s very hard to be around my dad. He prides himself in being bipolar and mentally ill, refuses to get help, never does anything to be a better person, and blames all of his actions on his mental illness. And so we have this quick banter of yes and no and you always complain about work, I understand you work with idiots, you bring work home all the time and you are super negative and I don’t like it. So I finished eating and started to clean my dishes and my dad said,” I just want to fucking die.” And both my grandma and I both said,”See this is exactly what I’m /she is talking about.” Now before anyone says that my dad is suicidal, let me explain a lot of things. He constantly says phrases like that and he has been since like 2014ish when his mental health really took a shit cause he was fired from a job because I believe he blew up on his boss. His ego is bigger than him. And he does nothing but emotionally manipulates the people around him. When he found out I wanted to go to college in Sacramento I think my sophomore or junior year he told me when he worked at this one place he was using Meth and he got clean but was afraid he’d start using again if I leave him because he would be so depressed. And he felt like he needed to share that with me. At the time I was 16, I was really starting to figure out and understand why I was/still am severely depressed and he knew that because he took me to see a therapist he used to see. So I told him,” Dad thank you for sharing that with me but I really didn’t need to hear that. I’m going through a lot right now and I don’t have the mental capacity to support you with that.” And he flipped out on me and called me a bitch and a cunt and saying I was nothing and he just wanted to share something with me cause he felt we were close but apparently he was wrong and all that stuff. So now that, that is settled, and you understand that my dad is manipulative. Again he said,”I just want to fucking die.”  My grandma said,” No son don’t talk like that. She is just trying to tell you that you’re so negative.”
He said,” No that’s not it. I work my ass off for you guys and get nothing in return. My life is so fucked up because of you guys. Your brother won’t even talk to me. He’s got some real problems. It’s all about vain and vanity. You all use me.”
My grandma and I both look at each other confused. And then that was the end of that. 
So Wednesday I had a therapy appointment. Now to clear the air there, I am seeing a different therapist than the one I used to see. I used to see this wonderful therapist that used to be my dads. She was the best, she understood everything and all the complications because she literally knew my dad. It made everything easy. Then one day my dad and I got into this massive fight and he walked into the office and yelled at the therapist and made her feel unsafe and tried to control all the appointments I went to so could monitor them. Not only was she not okay with that but so was I and I felt so bad for my dad for treating her that way. So we both decided that, that was my last session there and I’d find a new one because she no longer felt safe. So I have a new therapist. They’re okayish. To be honest I’m not the biggest fan. And I’ve seen them for about 2/3 months. So I was explaining to them the whole thing with my dad and saying how it’s frustrating and annoying and I can’t wait to move out and all that. And I’ve explained the way my dad is before to them, in great detail. Thinking and hoping it would stick and they also say they take notes (it’s teletherapy) during the session and most of the time they’re just repeating what I’m saying back to me. So continuing, he then tells me, my dad is suicidal and I have to call the authorities and get him taken care of. Just based on him saying I want to fucking die. Yes that is a big tell to see if someone is suicidal, but need I remind you, my dad is bipolar, emotionally manipulative, and I’m 90% sure a narcissist. And again I have also told all those things to my current therapist. And they’re going on about how I need to call the authorities to get my dad the help he needs because he’s at risk, and basically telling me that it’s my responsibility to save my dad because they kept saying,” Would you rather not call and find your dad dead?” Kind of stuff to me. And I kept trying to explain to to them that my dad isn’t suicidal, but they said I was in denial of that, and we spent all 50 minutes of how to help my dad. By the end of the session I was way worse than I was at the beginning of the day. I was so confused, anxious, and deeply upset. 
1. I, a 19 year old young woman, with also a mental illness has just been told my dads life depends on mine who is almost 50, and never does a damn thing in the house, you have to make a doctors appointment for him, basically doesn’t know how to take care of himself.

3. Not feeling truly heard

313,"I made a throwaway account for this reason but I think I may have been groomed. As a kid I spent countless hours online and at some point created a discord. On there I made friends and now that I'm older I realize how disgusting some of their actions were. I was just a kid and I think they took advantage of my stupidity. They'd show me off in servers for having a young sounding voice being a kid, even though it made me uncomfortable I liked the praise I didn't even think how disgusting it was 16-20 year olds called me a ""loli"". They basically desensitized me to anything nsfw, spamming pictures telling me things no 11 year old should've known. I remember one of them had a whole folder full of nsfw? (butt pics, thigh pics, etc etc) of other people in our server.Even thought they knew I was very young they'd teach me about masturbation and even forced another of my friends to do it, i still deeply regret ever even thinking that was okay and not doing enough to stop it. At some point one of them even bought me a game and from there we grew a bond? I feel so stupid but i even gave them my address, it wasn't until recently I remembered id ""pay"" them back by sending thigh pictures.I don't know what to do with this because it wasn't until recently I started to remember everything. I feel so stupid but I was just a kid. Please give any advice on how to handle all this, I really wish I never thought about it more.",22Aug2020,1
314,"For reasons out of my control I have run out of friends and only have about one left. I’ve known them since middle school but had never noticed their mean tendencies til we were no longer in a group dynamic. These things aren’t constant but when they happen are very hurtful. Here are what I think makes them assholey:

When they’re mad at me they pull at my insecurities and personal problems. They were kind of unsupportive when I expressed I was thinking of using they/them pronouns. They’ve said its “fun” to make me cry. They’ve told me to my face that my mental illnesses are my fault for not visiting a therapist. They’ve ridiculed me for not wanting to appropriate other cultures. On the whole they pretty much don’t respect me.

The thing is that this person is my roommate till june and I don’t know what to do to resolve these issues. I’m tired of hearing myself be belittled.

316,"I've been dating a guy for 3 months now. At the start, he told me it takes him time to develop feelings so he goes slow, but will stop seeing someone quickly if he doesn't feel good about it. It's been 3 months now since and he's definitely opened up to me and is more comfortable. 

Through his actions, it's all great and positive, but lately he said something about his past (which usually doesn't bother me at all and I enjoy hearing about it) but it's caused me to be stuck in my own head and wondering I'm just some girl he's seeing to pass time because he hasn't *verbally* said things along the lines of ""I'm into you too"" (even though it's clear in his actions that that's not the case).

I've been trying to get over it on my own, and he's reassured me that the girl was from ages ago, but it hasn't worked and it's affecting the way I interact with him which doesn't seem fair on him. 

I want to talk it through with him but don't want to pressure him into a relationship as I also want to take things slow and assess ""us"" before I want to commit. I'm worried this talk will lead into ""the talk"" and was also told that this is my own insecurity, it's on me to figure it out and I shouldn't punish him like that for it. 

How should I get over this/move forward/approach this? Is there anything I should figure out before speaking to him about it?",22Aug2020,1
317,"Currently living with my mother in Minnesota, that's another story though. My father's family (my step family, I guess) is super religious. Nothing wrong with that, but I don't want to be forced to believe in their values when I'm living with them (they're the type to get offended if I decline going to church with them). How do I take the first steps to move out and live on my own with no credit? I'm not physically capable to work part and full time. My father is planning on getting me set up with disability benefits when I move down there.

318,"My ex and I broke up 2 weeks ago. We were together 2 years and was broken up for a month earlier this year. Since this is on-and-off, he said there won’t be a “next time”. I used to beg him to stay but this time I didn’t. I just walked out gracefully, with my heart knowing I’ve given this relationship my all.

We dealt with our belongings after 2 days of the breakup, mostly telling each other to dump the stuff I/he left (he seemed like he doesn’t want to see me). At the point I really felt like that is the closure. There won’t be any more contact. 

I left him alone and found that he deleted MY NUMBER, and also my mom’s and my sister’s. My sister pointed this out to me as she noticed on WhatsApp. Then a day after, he re-added me. A few days later added my mom’s but not my sister. 

Tl;dr - want to know the reason why an ex keeps your number or follows you on social media after telling you that they want nothing to do with you (not even talking/be friends). Everything has already been dealt with so there’s just no need of keeping contact?",22Aug2020,1
319,"So basically, this TikToker (she’s 16F) wants to collaborate with me (I’m 14M) and do some music. The bad thing is I have to email a whole agency, which it gonna be difficult because she was 1.1 Million Instagram followers, I just hit 500.

I have an email written out, it sounds good so far, here it is:

Hello, my name is Kai O'Neal. I'm a 14 year old musician and I think we should collaborate, like a cover or anything like it. I've been following you for a while and I've noticed that you play guitar, and people are constantly asking for you to play. I've heard you play before and you sound really good, you should definitely use this talent, and I think I could help you make a great cover video.

So here's a little information about myself. I'm a 14 year old musician, I've been a pianist for about 10 years, I've been a singer for about 10 years, I started teaching myself a little bit of dance about three years ago, and I've been producing music for about two years. I've gotten top 10 in my region in competition every time I've entered and I also sang at Carnegie Hall in New York last year in a concert titled ""Buena Onda"" hosted by the DCINY (Distinguished Concerts International New York.) I've also been my church's pianist since I was 11.

Here's the three best things I think we should do, I think we should have you play the guitar and sing, and I could sing with you and harmonize (I saw that video of you singing, you sounded really good), I could play piano and have you sing over it (I can sing with you on that if you want), or I could produce a song and have you sing over it, I reproduce songs all the time to add little things I want. I'm positive your fans would absolutely love it if you did something with your musical ability. You'd also be able to expand your fan base, it's very easy for people to find these music videos on YouTube.

Please consider this, I think it would be a great move. I will link some videos of me singing and playing piano. I also have some music I've produced I can send too. I hope you like this idea!

If you have any criticism on that, let me know IMMEDIATELY.

And I also have to record a few songs, what do y’all think of these:

Piano songs
1. Michael Jackson - Carousel
(Unknown song, but I love it.)
2. When I Fall in Love - Jazz Standard
(Nice ballad)
3. Autumn Leaves - Jazz Standard
(Another Ballad)
4. Wii Shop Theme Song
(Just because it’s a fun song to listen to and it isn’t too simple to play the way I do)

Singing
1. Isn’t The Name
(A song I’ve sang at church multiple times, people love it)
2. I Believe I Can Fly - R. Kelly
(I love the song)
3. Untitled Song [INTRO ONLY] - R. Kelly
(People love when I sing this intro so I think I should include it since the beginning isn’t crazy sexual)
4. I Wanna Sex You Up [SWING VERISON]
(I love this song, I made a jazzier version of it when I was bored and people love it. It’s not as sexual as most things on TikTok are, so I’m considering including it, especially since I’ve produced it already.)

Let me know what you think, I’m nervous about this. I’m probably gonna lay off the advice point thing for a couple of days so I can get as much feedback as possible",22Aug2020,1

322,"I [M 23] skimmed through Reddit for advice on how I can do this the “right way”... and there are many that claim to be the best. Approach her after work, just be direct and ask, ask her co-worker if she’s single, or don’t do it at all.

My views on each option: Asking her after work seems like stalking. Being direct, I wouldn’t know what to say (I just know she has curly dark hair and blue eyes. Not much for a conversation starter). Not doing anything because she’s mainly working makes this endeavor seem pointless. 

The only method that seems “less creepy”, according to my findings, is the asking-the-coworker method to find out if she’s single. From there, though, it seems out of my hands. 

Sorry if I sound like a pessimist. I’ve heard people make asking out a barista sound so easy, and also so impossible. But man, the barista I met was very pretty, so I’m willing to shoot my shot. Any suggestions?",22Aug2020,1
323,"I don't know what to do for my career. Should I get one or create something for myself to do? My interest and what my skill set doesn't feel practical at all.

I have experience working in odd jobs like WWF on-site team(sourcing for donations from public), I have served food in an Italian restaurant, I have interned as an artist for a robotics company(designing posters and flyers for events, editing their 3D models and doing clean up for 3D models)(personally I don't find myself talented in this area but I studied this for my poly diploma). Currently I am helping my boyfriend's business out by being the manager/admin in his music school.

I studied Digital Animation, wanting to learn to design games and create games. But I didn't like it and felt that playing games is way more fun than trying to create one. I am not a skilled artist. I'm a gamer. That's what I got from going through the Digital Animation course. ((Plus my country doesn't pay artists very well either))

My biggest interest and skill set lies in gaming. I played games and loved computer games since I was 4. I don't have any experience playing gaming consoles. I played lots of flash games and transitioned to play Mobile Legends when I was 17 and Dota 2 when I was 18. I love Dota 2 a lot and have been addicted to it a few times. Dota 2 is definitely something I can do everyday if it is a valid career path for me. I would love to create gaming videos or become a pro player if possible.

Other than gaming(which in my country is considered a *no future* thing), I don't know what I can do/have little to no interest.

I’ve always been a angry person ever since I could remember. However since I’m older I’ve realised that I probably have BPD. I do not want to be one of those people who self diagnose themselves and think that just because I am sad sometimes I have depression. Which is also why I want to go to a therapist/psychiatrist to get probably diagnosed.  I really struggle maintaining friendships because people always worry what they say around me. I get angry over the tiniest things I can’t even explain why. But then I feel extremely guilty afterwards. I feel like no one likes me and I really just want to talk to someone and get help. My Dad knows I struggle with my anger and he helps me and I have brought up the idea of therapists and I feel like he doesn’t really listen sometimes. To the people who are struggling/ struggled with mental health when did you start to realise that it was effecting your day to day life and how did ask for help?

He says he isn’t sure if I’m his soulmate and that he believes she could even be in another city. Although he said this he also said that for the time being since it feels right then he’s going to assume I am. (He has also mentioned that we’re very alike but also very different, even seeming incompatible at times) I completely respect individuality and honesty, so I didn’t fuss about it..how could I? Even though this is the case I still wanted another perspective on said situation because aforementioned I’m completely understanding of the fact, but I genuinely don’t know how to go about it? We’re both young so if he feels this way should I continue the relationship and accept if it fails or let him venture off and go our separate ways?

327,"I recently got into some hard stuff again. It's weird...the first time I quit everything -it was easy. I still had a brain cell or two light up. Now I'm dissociating, hallucinating...

I'm prone to psychosis (Schizophrenia is my diagnosis, but the doctor said there is a slight chance I'll make a full recovery from ""insanity"" if I stop doing bs).

Does anyone have any advice? I think it honestly may be too late for me. I'm only 23, but the amounts I do... I no doubt will have this catch up with me/may never make a full recovery.. I turned into a monster, which is weird because most substances make me isolate and obsess over something for a few hours.....you know which one I'm talking about. There's basically nobody in my life left...

I could go to detox (detox/safe use site/homeless shelter nearby) in the morning. I could probably get into rehab pretty quick, maybe even direct entry. I love Canada, free health care ftw...but the problem with me has always been that I can't admit I have a very serious substance use problem long enough to still be interested in whatever program calls me weeks/months later... I probably robotripped two hundred times.... drugs aren't even drugs at this point, they just turn off reality a little more. What's the point in that?

I’ve always had “friends” throughout school and so on, but I could never open up the to them about anything (whenever I did, I was met with criticism).  I was just kinda there, was out of the comic relief of the group, also the listener of the group, and then after a few years they would turn on me and throw me out like trash.  I’m never rude to people, I go by the policy of treating others the way you want to be treated, so I try to be a supportive and caring friend.  I’m just getting a little discouraged at this point.  I currently have one friend that has been with me for quite some time, but they live far away, so we don’t get to hang out in person.  I have another kinda-friend, but we don’t really hang out, outside of this class we are apart of.

332,"My (F21) BF (M20) and I have an amazing relationship, very best friends, no fights, same interests, litreally became exclusive within 2 weeks of meeting, almost 2 years ago. However, he has OCD and it gets really exhausting. One of his main compulsions is confessing, he has confessed bad thoughts he has had about me or thoughts about how hot other women are etc and wow, they hurt. He doesn't mean it and is always super apologetic, it's clearly his OCD but he doesn't try hard enough to control it. He won't go to an OCD specialist and was reluctant to get help  until I pushed him to try free college counselling a few months ago, where he found out he probably has OCD. *I really don't wanna leave*, I love him so much, he loves me too, but for a few days I've been wondering if maybe there is someone out there as amazing as him, minus the OCD, or who manages it better. I feel super guilty for this and the thoughts of ending this have made me cry, I can't imagine life without him but I also can't imagine staying if he doesn't take more  responsibility for his OCD. 

Today he brought up us getting a place for next college semester (October-January) and I felt a sense of dread, thinking ""oh no I really can't, we might not be together then"" but only a week or 2 ago I would've jumped at the chance (things have escalated these last 3 months).I've sort of dodged this suggestion twice today. What do I do? I still have hope and I would miss my best friend incredibly, but isn't it really unfair to wait another 2/3 months for improvements if I'm unsure? Should anyone ever be unsure?

334,"I'm hoping this is the right sub for this...

I'm 22M.

Let me start with my work situation.

I hold down a grocery store job in what we regard as the hardest department. I seem to be valued by my coworkers and receive a *lot* of compliments from customers, specifically against the rest of my team. They value me above my coworkers  which is frustrating to me because 1.) I can't understand how I stand out above my team (imposter syndrome?), 2.) they are my friends and they can give what I think is even better service than I do, and 3.) I helped train most of them so they should be close enough to being up to speed with whatever ideal I apparently embody. Sometimes they specifically request my help. It's insulting. I'll try to be humble but I almost got into an argument with someone the other day who swore I'm the only one there who knows what he's doing, which is an uncomfortable thing to risk losing a customer over. 

They make me feel like I carry the department.

""You're so peppy/nice/fast/..."", basically every good thing you wouldn't want to hear on a date, they tell me, never or rarely to the others.

I get out late, with really nothing to go home to, spend an hour unwinding in my car, go home, stress out over something I think I forgot to finish before leaving, do virtually nothing else, and spend an hour trying to get out of bed the next morning before work, usually clocking in during the late-arrival grace window. 

Outside of work, I've started hitting up the gym on my off days. One of my two best friends (the other died 2 years ago) goes there routinely, but we're in very different places in life and he's such a hunk of a man now that it's hard to relate to each other like when we were younger. 

I'll go home from the gym and do more nothing. Sometimes I'll grab a guitar (I'm a bassist) and try to work on a song I've written, but it gets dull thinking and playing alone and the guitar's still in tune by the time I put it down. 

Sometimes I'll listen to what songs I do have half-recorded. They're great, they get my blood pumping, but I can't feel motivated to finish them. 

I don't really trust other people well enough to work with them. I left some bands two years ago in which I had my boundaries violated and/or had limited respect and no given room to grow. To distance myself from those bands is to distance myself from the reputation/social groups/networks I'd been building since high school. Again, it's been two years since and I've long been out of my element.

I don't think I've gotten wasted with others since March. Haven't really had anyone to talk to much too deeply, haven't had a real date since November, haven't felt like hitting up tinder matches, haven't been with a woman in 2.5 years, haven't felt a sense of purpose in a long time. Sometimes I drive out to places to explore, always alone.

The last time someone invited me out to hang, I was so out of touch with getting out I thought he was hitting on me.

And I feel like I'm not growing up much, with no one around outside of work relations.

I could easily/cheaply move. I really hate where I live, but I feel like I've peaked and I'll probably just plateau elsewhere if I keep going on like this, but I don't know where to start the change.",22Aug2020,1

I feel extremly alone, everyone there already has their friend groups that they knew before highschool and I do my best to talk to my classmates whenever I get the chance (I am very shy around strangers so I really am doing everything I can) but noone ever leaves their friendgroup to say hi to me or talkt to me.

My friend goes to a small highschool in another city that is 2 hours away by car, and so far she is having the time of her life. The school offers rooms to students who dont live in the city, and most of the students there live on campus. Its mostly an art highschool with photography, art and fashion majors.  

So now I wonder if I made the right choice in choosing a difficoult major over the thing I enjoy doing very much. But at the same time, i am going to have a very uncertain future if you major in art, although I will say that if highschool continues to be this bad the whole time, there is no way im not dropping out. My parents also don't like the idea of me going to an art highschool wich just adds even more stress. What do you guys think I should do?",22Aug2020,1
343,"I really don’t know where to start but my (17) friend of about 4 years (20) started our friendship through many mutual friends. I tell people we both hit it off so well because both of our moms had died from cancer and we really bonded over that. 

She lived out of state but when ever she came to my state she would stay in my house with me and my dad. Again my dad doesn’t really understand online and mutual friends but he trusted her because we bonded over dead moms.

I have always been pretty suspicious to say the least because she said her mom died at a young age and her dad remarried shortly after. But her step mom (turns out actual mom) and her look so similar it’s crazy. She always said it was because her dad had a type and that her mom and step mom were friends and always were told that. Her (mom/stepmom) has a disability that leaves her unable to complete a lot of tasks alone and she said it was really hard on her and her dad when she got sick. She would always tell me that she felt so bad for her dad because he took care of his wife with cancer until she died then married another woman who got sick and is spending his whole life taking care of his wives. 

I just found out through some digging one day because it was too coincidental and I called her out and she freaked on me that I’m insensitive and I don’t understand her pain with her mom so she copied my story so I would feel bad for her. Like WTF. I was 13 when we met and I finally felt understood by someone and turns out the whole thing was a lie. She knows everything about me and our whole relationship  was formed on her lie. Like it’s been a couple days since this all happened and I am so upset and distrust to say the least. 

I really want to message her mom on Facebook and tell her what happened and how she has lied saying she has been dead for years because I am so upset. I blocked her on many social media’s and I won’t answer her messages. Can someone tell me what I need to do?? Like what I am so confused and hurt. 

TLDR - friend lied to me about her mom being dead, copying my actual dead moms death story to get close to me and blames me for when I find out",22Aug2020,1

Height -&gt; 1.83/6^1 
Weight -&gt; 78.5 kgs 

I’m a 20 year old guy and I lost about 28 kgs (slowly and healthily) in 2017. Ever since then, I’ve tried numerous combination of exercise, ab workouts, body workouts and cardio... yet I’m still in bad shape. 

If anyone thinks they can help me out I’d really appreciate it. I’m willing to send pictures and everything for further context. If anyone can help me out, please do. I’m just tired of being unhappy.

What I’ve done:
1) 4 days a week in the gym. It includes a mix of cardio, 10 min abs workout and Full body (2 machines for each body part estimably)

2) cardio and abs only

3) full body with each day focused on certain things/more body building oriented. (I was still under eating though)

My weaknesses are: 
- I’m conscious about my weight and always end up going back to cardio and underrating.  

- I’m scared of gaining back weight so protein and things like that always mentally affect me, and I’ve never seen any improvements in my body. 

- I’ve never seen my body/chest toned. It’s never happened no matter how hard I try or what I do. I can’t say it hasn’t discouraged and frustrated me.",22Aug2020,1

Well last night at about 6pm he went for a drive with his mates, which is normal from him. Then he told me about about 9pm he was going to fetch another two mates. He went on to say how they were all having a laugh and that, all good...

At 2am I was walking back from the pub I had gone with my mates and he had just got home so he rang me, it turns out he was driving around with two girls for 3 hours, and never thought to mention it.

I don’t want to be one of them crazy girlfriends but I can’t help if something hurts my feelings, and this did a lot. I just messaged him saying can we talk about it because it’s still nothing me a lot, I’m just waiting for him to wake up now.

I messaged them and asked them about it but after they said their goodbyes they stopped replying to my message. I didn't know what else to do so I called the police and told them about it and they sent someone to check on them and I was left in the dark after that. I tried calling hospitals in the area to see if they had checked in there and one did say my friend was there but the operator said they were a discharged patient so I assumed it was a visit from a different time unless they also use that term for deceased. There's no response from my friend no matter how I contact them and it seems like it's too early for any records to be released of their death if they passed away.

354,"Hi all, 

Recently somebody I knew in high school reached out to me keen to hang out and catch up. I will preface this by saying I'm that person who tries their best to be as nice to absolutely everyone, which means that I ended up ocassionaly becoming friends with people out of pity. That sounds cold and horrible but it's the truth. Recently one of these friends/acquaintances messaged me after not talking since we left high school senior year 6 years ago asking me how I am and trying to meet up. The truth is, I really don't want to. I found them clingy and annoying. But i feel so bad ignoring the message. Reaching out like this makes me worry they're feeling very alone and that by ignoring them I could be being a total tool. Equally, I have no intentions of being friends with them, so don't want to lead them on by meeting up. Who knows, maybe 6 years down the line we will hit it off. I just feel right now I'm content in my social life and don't really have a desire to rekindle old friendships. Do you see people just because you feel you should honour their desires?

359,"77° doesn't sound bad for weather outside, but it's MISERABLE to live in a house that warm during a very hot summer. 

My dad insists that he's cold, and that the thermostat display must be broken since he's always ""freezing."" Except, that's definitely not true. My brother and I both live here too and agree it's sweltering hot. 

I'm sleeping very badly due to how warm it is in here every night. I regularly toss and turn and wake up repeatedly. In the morning, sometimes I wake in a puddle of sweat. 

We've tried talking to him and explaining how it's impacting our health/jobs. He flat out refuses to wear warmer pajamas or use another blanket on his bed. I've suggested a space heater, but he says ""didn't move to California to use a heater."" Sometimes he will agree to try something, but then sneaks downstairs when we are all asleep and turns the heat up anyway. Oh, did I mention that he sleeps during the day and frequently walks around during the night? Since I'm unconscious I have no way of stopping him. 

We've asked him if it's about the money involved with running the A/C - he denies it. 

I've tried leaving my window open at night - (1) it's still 90° out there at night and (2) there's a loud dog that barks in the yard next door, which also wakes me up.

361,"So I’ve been looking for a job for quite a while. I accepted the first offer I got at Job A, because I need to pay rent so time was a pretty important factor.

Well after I was hired, Job B finally texted me basically saying “*hey we saw your application and want to set up an interview.*” I ended up texting them back to say thanks so much for considering me, but I’ve just been hired elsewhere. I feel stupid now for telling them, but it is what it is.

It turned out to be a big mistake on my part. Job A is a complete shitshow. Job B also pays more and has better hours. The only reason I took Job A was because I needed a job, any job, ASAP.

I’ll stay at Job A if I have to, but now I want to interview at Job B. Is there a way to tell them that I changed my mind and I actually do want to interview with them? How would I phrase that? What do I tell them? Or can this problem not be fixed?",22Aug2020,1

363,"I’m aware the title is weird, but please just read. Ever since i was around 11 I’ve seen.. things, I guess. I don’t like talking about it and after a certain age I stopped entirely because obviously not everyone sees things or believes in this kind of stuff and it’s made me the main point of jokes a lot of the time. I also have very bad anxiety and depression and have had it for most of my life because of my mother, and this year I finally got my medication for it. About two years ago I started dating my current boyfriend who I love with all my heart, and him and (most) of his family are potheads. I was never against it, just never had the opportunity or the need to try it, so when he (respectfully, he never pushed me and when I said no he’d stop immediately) asked me if I wanted to try, I did. To this day I still smoke because holy fuck it helps me so much when I need it. My meds help too obviously, but not to this extent. Back in March of this year I was hospitalized and diagnosed with CHS. If you don’t know what it is, google it. Long story short, my body can’t handle too much smoking. I get extremely nauseous and get horrible upper abdominal pain and only constant hot showers help soothe the pain. It gets so bad, most people with this condition almost always end up in the hospital because it’s just so painful. I stopped smoking for about half a year but I knew I wanted to try slowly getting into it again after doing a bunch of research and finding that as long as you don’t overdo it, you’re ok. Once you start feeling even slightly nauseous or uncomfortable, stop immediately and take a break. I’ve been on this schedule for a long time now and I’m fine. When I feel the pain, I stop and let my body take care of what it needs and then take it slow again. 
Now for the point of the story.
My brother passed away in June. It’s august, and I’m obviously still in pieces from it. I cry all night every night while my boyfriend is at work and the cycle repeats. If I don’t have music or a video on, I’ll cry. If I take too long to fall asleep and think a little too long, I’ll cry. If I don’t have anything to distract me when I’m eating, I cry. I don’t think this will ever go away, we were so close. He was 21 when it happened, I’m 19. We were extremely close and I’ve never had that relationship with anybody. I was expecting to see him somewhere or in my dreams at least after it happened, but when I got nothing I just figured he moved on which made me slightly happy. Then my step sister texted me to let me know she had a dream that he came to her and told her he was ok and he was going to take a long trip. This bothered me. We were so much closer than they were, I’ve known him my whole life and she’s known him a few years. We were the closest out of my other 4 siblings. Every night after that I waited for a dream of him. Anything at all. I got absolutely nothing. About a month later I finally started having dreams of him. At school, in old houses, going shopping, etc, but he wouldn’t talk to me. Every time I saw him I immediately knew it was a dream and would desperately try to talk to him. I’d hug him and cry and scream his name and beg him to talk to me, tell me he’s okay, let me know everything is going to be fine, ANYTHING. Nothing. No words, and a lot of the time he would just look upset with me but wouldnt act upset, just continued with dream stuff. I didn’t tell my sister this because I don’t like bringing him  up when it’s not necessary because it obviously makes us all sad. She did know, however, that the month prior I was upset because I didn’t have any dreams of him.

I never told my family that I was smoking again when I was, because I didn’t need them to deal with this too or be afraid for me. I kept it to myself, didn’t post anything, never told anyone except obviously my boyfriend who would smoke with me. (I live with him, I just realized I should have said that earlier lol, sorry) my sister called me the other day to ask me if I was smoking again. I told her straight up, yes, because I want to keep it from them but if they ask me plain out then I’m not going to lie to their faces. I asked how she knew and she just said everyone knew and wouldnt elaborate further. Today she called me, at 2am.
She told me that my mother talked to a psychic and didn’t give her any info on us or anything besides that she wanted to talk to her son. She said that, besides a lot of other stuff that my sister says was scarily spot on, she said he wanted me to stop being mad at him and to stop smoking because he takes me places in my dreams and talks to me but I’m too high to remember. Here’s the problem with that:
1. I remember all of my dreams. I’ve always had extremely vivid dreams and I even have night terror almost every night and when I wake up I can’t tell if I’m still dreaming or not. I know he’s been in my dreams but he never talks to me and never takes me anywhere.
2. I’m not mad at him. I haven’t felt an ounce of anger or resentment towards him at all since it happened. Of course I’m upset, he’s my brother and not having him here kills me every second. I wish he was safer, but I’m not mad at him.
3. I never go to sleep high. Going to bed high with CHS is horrible, as the THC stays in your body longer and is harder to get rid of. I’m not “too high to remember my dreams”, so I honestly don’t know what she means. 
This has broken me. Although I’ve seen stuff in the past, I’ve never believed in psychics or anything like that. I know that sounds hypocritical, but I can’t explain it. I know these things exist from first hand experience,  but it’s just so hard for me to believe what they’re saying about someone I love. I’ve been thinking about it and I don’t know what to do. Obviously if not smoking means I get to see my brother even in a dream, I’ll stop. I don’t care about weed the way my family thinks I do, I’m not addicted, I stop frequently for my own health, it’s just something my boyfriend and I have together that’s relaxing for both of us. 
However, if I stop and nothing happens, I’m scared I’ll feel stupid and abandoned by him. I don’t know how to explain it, I just don’t know what to do.
Do any of you know more about this kind of thing? Is it true or is this lady bullshitting me? I’ve thought that maybe my mother found out I’m still smoking somehow and just wants to get me to stop. I haven’t stopped crying knowing I might be the reason he can’t reach me. 
Please let me know what I should do. Do I stop? Is it bullshit? 
I’m posting this at 5am and my mind hasn’t stopped racing since the phone call. Please let me know what your thoughts are on this. Thanks for anyone who read this word vomit.",22Aug2020,1
364,"I know the answer is simply that there's nothing we can do so this is maybe nothing but a vent of frustration. 77 year old aunt. Lives alone. I've noticed that she bruises extremely easily the last few months. Her dad, my grandfather had the same thing the last decade of his life and ended up dying of multiple myeloma. So that's in my head. I alone took care of him at the end. She's a different person mentally though. He ate, moved around, remained active, read, etc. She has this mental tick, idk, she use to be married and had a home 25 years ago. Since then she's divorced and downsized and downsized until now she's living in in a converted storage shed paying $800 a month in some dump. She won't live somewhere else since she limits herself to being within walking distance of her church, which she doesn't attend anymore even before the covid cooties. So who knows there. She has this thing where she always says ""I was born in poverty so I it's ok I'm where I am."" WTF!? She's a mental case, genuinely. Always has been so it's not dementia or anything. No tv, no internet, no books. Sewing, talking on the phone and praying. Occasionally when I or my mom get her to come over to visit and when I take her to the store or bring her over to do her laundry. 

Worst of all is that she doesn't seem to eat. She's noticeably thinner which I know old age plays a part of of course but still. She's done this for years and years now. She stayed at my home while we went out on vacation last week. I made sure my pantry was stocked, juices, tea even sodas. I got her to buy herself some salmon to make and told her to defrost any meat she wanted out of my freezer to eat. Anything out of the pantry. Anything. Nothing, as usual. She claimed to eat canned beans and store bought potato salad. And that's it! What's worse is that she does this crap at home on her own too. All the time! And don't make any mistake, this isn't a money thing. She chooses to live like this and starve like this. I think she's genuinely malnourished. Her weekly grocery list is beans, yogurt, ice cream and the occasional boxed salad like potato. Maybe cookies and grapes once in a while. Damn it! There's no talking to her. There's no convincing her to eat better. She's not a vegetarian mind you. She'll eat a hamburger from fast food I we offer it to her. 

We've noticed too that she doesn't brush her hair or teeth like she should. She wears fairly garbage clothes. And she knows better. She's lived better. That's what kills me.  It's some twisted self-flagellation for god bs I think. God it's stressful.

365,"Important for this story: I'm a female and I'm almost 13. And all of this stuff in the story happens in front of many adults, so don't go taking it out of context.

  
Ok, so I'm just gonna start.  
Me, my brother and my parents were at one of my mom's friend's birthday party yesterday. It was all fine, but a bit later into the night people started getting a bit tipsy or drunk. -Ok, nothing wrong with getting a bit drunk and having fun- I thought.

  
But here comes the reason I'm writing this: When I was getting cake, one of the adult men (who I don't know, or at least don't know that well) grabbed me around the waist and started like... half dancing, but not quite (since he's drunk). I gave my dad a ""I'm uncomfortable, help me"" kind of look, but he was half asleep by then and didin't see it. He let me go after like 10-20 seconds, but I was really uncomfortable.

This has happened to me before, but it was always drunk men at a family gathering (more specifically, my great aunt's husband) and not a stranger. I was always uncomfortable when someone did this at family gatherings, but didn't say anything since we knew each other and I thought it was normal as a kid.

So my questions are: Am I overreacting? Is this a normal situation for kids to be in? (Since I said earlier that it has been happening to me since I was small) And can you give me advice on how to get over it? Its probably not such a big deal and I'm probably being a sensitive and a stupid kid, but I really did feel uncomfortable.

Maybe not as a main enterprise, but something to provide me with a secondary source of income and success, or at least have a few prolific short stories out there like the users of nosleep have. 

I’m in the process of finishing up a novel and I think the first segment of the story is fit for short story consumption in the vein of creepypasta or nosleep. I’ve tried posting it around several short story subreddits but there’s not been much traction. It’s to be expected, of course...but negative feedback—if it was constructive, no matter how scathing—would be better than no feedback. I have no idea how I’m doing, what I’m doing well and what I can improve on. And yeah, I’ve posted it to social media, but there goes a saying: “your friends are not your fans”. It’s nice to have friends say nice things about your work, but what I think is truly a test of how readable your stories are is if strangers enjoy it. 

What are some platforms to get my short story noticed? Are there any YouTube channels that narrate “user written” short stories other than the big creepypasta channels? Having my story narrated would be the coolest thing ever, but I obviously need to know whether what I’ve written sucks or not. 

Also, say if I was to pursue writing as a career. I’d probably take the non-fiction route. How the hell do I get connections going?

I want help, and don’t know where to even start. I’m in the UK and haven’t seen anything to help individuals like me. I’m scared that one day this disorder will consume me. I have such a bright future ahead of me. I don’t know what to do. If anyone can help, please, help me. (UK info only)

p.s. I am in no way glorifying this horrible disorder. I despise those who act upon it.",22Aug2020,1
374,"I like to explain everything thoroughly so sorry if this gets long, I'll try to keep it as shot as possible.

Anyways, I am currently in the process of unbecoming a complete nerd (literally face full of acne, speech impediment, short, not good at any sports, insecure, 8+ hours of video games a day, heavily abused by ""friends"") since 2017. The reason for that is a girl I met at the start of high-school, it completely turned my life upside down and now, I can confidently say that I am doing fantastic, most of the things I mentioned are not even present anymore. 

But the thing is, there are some lingering feelings that won't let go from the past, here are some examples:

* The girl that made me change - She's been my ex for quite some time now. The thing is, from time to time when we talk (especially soon after we broke up) I keep having this blockade of being unable to be myself when around her and that is strange because normally, I am that overly confident guy who talks to everyone and goes out every weekend. TBH, the blockade is starting to fade because I can clearly see that she is into me again but it is still there, and there are others...
* One of the friends that abused me the most - He was like (and still is) the leader of the pack. I was a go-to for picking on and I don't blame them really when I look back at it now. I left the group eventually and after not seeing each-other for quite some time, they just started wanting to hang out with me again, and we do from time-to-time nowadays. And yet again, I can't get confident being around the guy, I just stop being as talkative and have a harder time cracking a joke or something and I can't seem to find my way around it.
* Also my dad - I think he is the reason I was the way I was in the first place. He is that stereotypical ""communist"" I'd say, strict to his kids, loves to argue but won't admit he is wrong, he's also racist. He really doesn't have any understanding for anyone and besides that he let a 7 year old become addicted to video games, he also abused me mentally a lot. I don't let him do that s\*it to me anymore though but there is still that tension. Feeling when we talk becomes similar to the one I have when I am around that friend I mentioned; And for example, he trashes me in chess but at the same time he and my brother are equals while my brother and I are also equal when we play, that is just a type of a blockade I have.

There are more examples but I think you get the point. I couldn't really find any tips on the internet that could help me. Has anyone had a similar experience? I'd be grateful for any info you could provide me because this is starting to annoy me a lot.",22Aug2020,1
375,"I'm really really mad. My best friend (18M) who cheated, let's call him R, has been my friend for over 3 years. I know that's not a really long time in comparison with other people and their friends, but I really felt like I knew him. My other friend (18F), A, is a really sweet girl. They've been in a relationship during the time we all got to know eachother. Now, I already knew their relationship was a bit rocky, and R was planning on breaking it up for a while, but he never did.

Now, a few days before coming clean he was confiding in me, behaving like a kicked puppy because A was the one talking about breaking it off this time. I was sympathetic, obviously it's hard to let go of a relationship, so I listened to him and tried to give him advice.

Apparently though, he'd been cheating on A with this other girl, and she had found out by THE OTHER GIRL MESSAGING HER. It wasn't even R who had the balls to do it! Knowing this had been going on for like 2 months, I have a feeling he wasn't even planning on telling her. Which is so damn disgusting to me.

Now, the thing I need advice on is on how to proceed. The first thing I did was simply tell him I was disgusted with his behaviour. Now you see, if he had cheated on anyone else, I would've been just as disappointed, but I don't think I'd have broken up our friendship. But now, it's my close friend he's hurt, and that's all I can focus on. He cut the conversation short and said he'd go to bed, telling us to message him in the morning if we wanted to know more. I told him I didn't need to hear shit from him about this and that I made up my mind.

Am I too harsh? I'm so mad and heartbroken on behalf of A, but if it hadn't been A I would've been there to help R at least realize his bad decisions and steer him a little as that's definitely something he'd appreciate right now. But I just can't bring myself to do it.

I don't want to break up our friendship because of this. He's still my friend, he just fucked up big time. I told him I'd hear him out after he at least got a genuine apology for A that wasn't half assed, and she accepted it. Until she does, I'm 100% on A's side and won't be talking to him. Am I being rational or should I at least hear him out?",22Aug2020,1
376,"And for that I’m asking for some advice on how I should improve as a person.

I don’t disregard others’ feelings every time, but I always realise that I hurt them too late. For example, I respond to people negatively when I’m clouded by negative emotions, which made the person feel terrible, and I never notice that happening until it damages the relationship. I see myself as “better” than some others even though there’s no proof of it. Thinking back, I’ve apologised for the same shit I’ve done so many times, promising that it will never happen again, yet I still don’t catch my behaviour in time. 

Any advice will help. I wanna become a better person and not a dickhead driving people away.",22Aug2020,1
377,"I (19m) am always horny and masturbating and doing things I regret after I climax. I just feel like a pos after each time, but I do it again the next day or 12hrs hours later.

I masturbate everyday, in the morning and at night. It's honestly stupid, I'm not even horny sometimes and I just do it. But when I am horny, I do things I regret. I have a gf and our relationship is great but a part of me feels like I'm not good enough or that she doesn't find me attractive so I go out for validation online and send nudes to girls I don't even like or know. The fact that they find me attractive is what gets me off. 

I seriously have a problem, I don't know if it's just my hormones fucking with me or am just fucked up in the head? I know I'm a pos for cheating on my gf, for always masturbating, and just being a pervert. But I don't know what's wrong with me, I hate it and want to be a better person but I always do the same thing the next day. Worst part is I'm not horny when I start, I just do it for the sake of doing it sometimes. 

What should I do? I feel like I am a scumbag and don't deserve a good life. I just want to stop masturbating, stop being horny and just be a better person. 

I'm sorry if this post disgusted anyone, or creeped them out. I'll delete this immediately if anyone finds it disgusting or disturbing.",22Aug2020,1
378,"for context i have absolutely lovely friends. i am so grateful for every single one of them. the difference is, i’m from a much different background than them. my friends from university are all very well off (as is 95% of my course), whereas i am from a very average background where we have enough for the bare necessities but absolutely not for any sort of luxuries like birthdays, holidays or meals out, etc. just a standard paycheck-to-paycheck life.

the issue is, my friends are incredible. they love to go all out for everything. one day it’s a meal out, the next day is a massive party for my birthday and expensive gifts, etc. they do all those things and i feel SO extremely guilty because this is something i 100% can’t do for them because of my situation, but they don’t quite understand what it means to not have money, for them it’s just £10 or £20, it’s okay. 

the same happens when getting joint birthday presents: your budget is £5, but they found something nice for £20 so suddenly the budget is £10. no matter how much i stress and say “please, let’s stick to it, i genuinely can’t do more”, i have to adapt and they say to pay it back at a later date. this is causing me such stress because i know that once i move out back to university i will be having to deny myself of basic necessities to compensate for this; i’m not in a position where i can ask my family for financial help. my mom already gives me some extra money monthly for me to save aside of my student loan, but i know that she’s trying to change her job to save up and buy a house next year so my priority is to help her save up for a deposit with all i have. 

i really don’t know how to tell my friends nicely that no, i can’t afford this. no, don’t do this for me. no, i’m not paying more than i can and that’s final. i don’t want to come across as a bitch because i truly do love and appreciate them all so much, but nothing i say nicely is getting to them because to them not having money means stuff like spending less when they go on holiday”. please give me some advice, i don’t want to hurt anyone with my words but i can’t keep up anymore!",22Aug2020,1

Or was disappointed by me? I am a introvert so it’s hard for me to talk with people, form connections and a deeper relationship. I often come out has annoying or boring. 

So anyways last semester I was running into this person like everyday but still we didn’t talk. We often look at each other and keep it moving. I guess she realized that I’m just weird or something. Maybe she wanted to be my friend and didn’t see me has anything else. Anyways we talked in the library in December, however I never got her number or snapchat. I know her name but I’m scared to think about the fact that maybe she doesn’t know my name. I’m sure I can search her up on Facebook and find her but I haven’t used facebook in years. I have deleted my fb and she probably doesn’t have one either. I tried ig but nothing came up. I don’t want to lose a connection to a cool person. 

So if I see her next time, I would like to ask her for her number/snap. Is that considered weird? Will she know that I like her? What if she deems me has weird? What if she has a boyfriend?",22Aug2020,1

384,"I am writing this as I watch our living room from our make shift security camera i set up in our home via face time and Ipads so my fiance feels safer and can sleep. I'm at work (20 mins away) and my fiance got home at 2am from her job. We are both females in our late 20s in a safe neighborhood.  Never had any trouble with anyone.  We aren't loud, our dog does not bark (stays inside) and we have no kids.

Back story we have been here a year before I noticed anything strange happening. I may have started to notice because I changed jobs which kept my schedule not regular and home more often. My fiance is a doctor and rotates shifts so our schedules are really crazy over the past 5 months. So April, May, June and the beginning of July I noticed our neighbor was watching me walk my dog late at night, 11pm-ish. I would look up and there he was smoking and just watching on the third floor.  No wave, never spoke to me. This went on for awhile until I waved one day and it stopped in July. Along with his smoking?  I also got 3 flat tires via small punctures and my fiance got a flat tire as well during may-july. During this last time in August when i found the flat I heard him listening on the other side of the fence right beside me, 20 mins pass and i thought he had left and he closes his car door and leaves.

End of July. I am driving home from work and he stops in the middle of the road in front of our drive ways i honk, and wait thinking he didn't see me. Nothing. So i go past him and he darts into his home leaving his car mid-road and the neighbors across the street contemplated calling the cops because of this odd behavior. They are not fund of this man either they stated it is an ""odd family"". He eventually moves it after my fiance went outside to look. I've not seen him smoke since or watching from the window.

So I ask my neighbors about this family. The one I described is the families' grown son, 30-40 and he has a known drinking problem to the community and often when he spoke to the neighbors said very strange things but was never mean.

August I installed outdoor cameras facing our cars, and part of their house is in the background. Caught nothing really until tonight. My fiance got home at 2am and then another light in the neighbor's house came on (not the third floor one) for the duration of her walking the dog then cut off after she got out of the view from our windows. I went back to review and the same light and all lights on  street were out by 1240am, the latest. So he has been using another room or light to watch us that I wasn't aware of until tonight. I just have a fight or flight response almost always when I'm home alone now, the same for my fiance.  I just ordered a security system and plan to do more cameras tomorrow.

 I also saw a space behind our garage today, it looked like someone was walking on, grass pressed down and boards covering the ground where it was muddy and i followed it up and it lead to a path directly behind the neighbors garage. With this someone could easily walk my fence line out of view of the camera and lights and make it to our bedroom window. This area my dog frequently fins interesting to the point I have to drag her away sometimes from sniffing it.  Its a dark alley way that has our windows on it and my neighbors high fence.

We only exchanged a single email each last month, and it’s been a month since I sent my last email. I’m worried that she’s lost interest in our conversations. 
Maybe it’d be useful for you to know that I have mild autism, so maybe I’m misreading this situation and maybe this is how penpan-ship is? Idk. I just wanted to ask your advice: do you think I’m being ghosted, or is this just how pen pal stuff goes?

386,"I have been on a weight loss journey for almost 3 years now and lost about 30 kg so far. In that process I have realised that a lot of my eating habits are very emotion-based and/or leading back to my childhood. I am now in a much better place and can not imagine going back to my old habits. Now my problem is: My mom has about the same body type as me, but is approximately as heavy as I was at my highest weight, if not heavier. I can see a lot of the unhealthy eating habits that I used to have in her behavior and at this point me and my sister are worried about her health. Looking back, I realise how much I would have wanted someone close to me to talk to me about my weight in a non-judgmental way and support me on my journey. I have been thinking about doing the same for my mom, because I love and care about her. I thought about sitting her down in a calm setting with enough time and talk to her about her eating habits and what she could possibly change to be healthier (like the things I had to change). I want to emphasize that I am aware that she is an adult who makes her own choices, but I care about her and want her to be healthier/avoid any health problems related to weight. I just want her to feel a similar way as me, which I didn’t think was possible 3 years ago (for example not being out of breath all the time or sweating less in the heat).
Do you think this is a good idea and/or do you have any advice on how to do this? I would be very grateful about helpful tips and/or suggestions. Thank you!",22Aug2020,1

I don’t want to follow a “diet” because I’ll most likely gain the weight back when I stop so I’m trying to do change my lifestyle a bit by just eating less and eating healthier. This was working until school started then I started getting stressed and getting cravings and gaining weight back and it makes me feel so shit about myself. I know obsessing over weight isn’t good but I can’t help it and I feel like it’s controlling me. I’m also starting to write college essays and I have to study for the ACT which just adds on even more stress :/.

I’ve tried to subtly bring this up to my friends family and they just say things like “ur skinny u don’t need to lose weight” or “ur body looks fine just the way it is, in fact you should gain weight” and I know they mean well but I get so angry whenever I hear things like that.

392,"I saw my ex in the store, we even locked eyes and I still ignored him as if I never knew him. We were together in a complicated exes with benefits/on and off relationship for a total of a year before he ghosted me. I was so shocked when he did it because I actually thought he loved me. I later found out that he had got with another girl even though he had asked to get back together with me. So seeing him made me just feel really bad and uncomfortable. I saw that there was another girl in his car and I just felt really awkward to run into him. The fact that we had both been claiming to be in love with one another for all that time might have meant we had been more serious than to just walk past each other like strangers. The look on his face was like he was surprised and my first instinct was that I didn’t want him to feel like he had to explain himself to me right in the middle of the store. I didn’t want him to be uncomfortable just seeing me. I wanted my existence to remain as fond of a memory in his mind as possible because despite everything I had always genuinely loved him and I felt that he shouldn’t think poorly of me. It made me uncomfortable that he might have felt weird seeing me because he chose to ghost me for some other girl. Like that isn’t my fault that he handled what could have been a breakup with no response. So in that moment I’m pretty sure if I had said anything he would have felt like he had to explain himself and I wasn’t even going to bother him any more than my existence already does. So I ignored him. I still have his number because I have my old phone. If I wanted to reach out, it would be a better opportunity to finally get closure. But part of reaching out would mean I might have to apologize for ignoring him and explain why I did it. And while I would if necessary to get closure and to finally make amends, I don’t think he deserves an apology for being ignored. I never got one. And to reach out to him to have to ask for one is already demeaning enough. I just want to know why he ghosted me so that I can finally let it go",22Aug2020,1

We were inseparable to the point where were were always mixed up. Second semester of my freshman year she stops talking to me and slowly everyone in my cohort does too. I’m not saying I’m the most likable person I’m just saying it’s a little unnerving when 10-15 people you were on good terms with just stop talking or even looking at you. The guy friend stopped talking to me as well and when I confronted him about it he told me he’d rather get high than talk to me.

I ended up going to therapy that summer because I started getting anxiety/panic attacks when I saw them. Since then I feel as though this girl I once considered my best friend hates me (although I’m on okay terms with the guy now). I know it’s bold to assume things but just based off her petty actions and attitude around me it feels like im just demanding to be treated like a person by her and that seems to be too much to ask.I tried to have a mediation with her and a non bias acquaintance to both of us but upon arranging this meeting she said I was making a big deal out of nothing and when she walked into the room she told my friend she didn’t even know why she was there and that the mediation was stupid.

397,"I own a real estate business in India dealing with land development and residential construction. As the RE sector has been suffering for the last 3-4 years, I was looking for funding for my company in various avenues to complete my on going projects. I got approached by a few people who said that if I have certain amount say $1 million in my company account, I could get funding through something called Private Placement Program (PPP). 

As per their explanation, The term “Private Placement” represents a category of investments that are not available in the open market. There exists a special type of PPP that is sometimes referred to as a Private Placement Investment Program, Private Placement Transaction Program, Managed Buy/Sell Program, or Bank Trade. These are private and by invitation only. 

PPP Trading takes place all over the world from the limited platform among top – tier banks. They are only available to Ultra High Net Worth Individuals or Qualified Institutional Investors. They occur at the upper echelons of the world financial system and are not available to the general public. The returns are usually contractual double-digit monthly returns and the capital is not put at risk in the trading. With properly structured programs, the Investor’s capital never even leaves their own bank account. Trade proceeds are usually disbursed weekly, over a 40-week period (international banking weeks over 12 calendar months).
These are regulated by strict guidelines established by the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, and the Bank of International Settlement (BIS). But most of the time it is looked by Federal Reserve.

So for example, if I have $1 million in my company account, after signing some documents along with bank statement and confirmation from the bank regarding balance in the account, the trader trades this deposit amount in the international market for a period of 40 weeks. I, as a investor will be getting weekly returns for the amount held in my account. Returns will be in the range of 10 to 25 percent of $1 million dollars on weekly basis (not yearly but weekly 10 to 25 percent). Please note that the amount will never leave my account in Indian bank. I will not be giving any signed cheques or anything else where I will be risking my funds being withdrawn. I will only be giving signed document with my company information in their format and signed bank statement with verification of funds. The funds will be blocked for 40 weeks in my account in India bank (that’s the only opportunity cost for me) and after which I will be free to use my amount in whatever way I want. I have googled PPP and there are some website that talk about it and explain the same thing.

I know all of this might sound fake but I also know that there are a lot of bank instruments and transaction which common man like myself will not be aware off. CDOs and MBS where very uncommon terms before 2007 and if someone told these things existed, people would probably laugh. Therefore my question is, 1) is PPP genuine or fake? Has anybody heard of such things. Does such transactions actually happen in the US or European Money Markets? 2) if it does happen there, is it something that happen in India? 3) if it happens here, how does it work? 

I am desperately looking for some genuine answers.

400,"This is my first post here !
My SO in-laws have never been the best to me his father and sister are JUSTNO and his mom is mildlyJNO and they’ve done a lot to me if I said it all we’d be here all day but it ranges from sneaking into my postpartum room during covid (made it clear no visitors, so did the hospital) to refusing to feed my daughter the right way( she has GERD)  and basically just throwing fits when something doesn’t go their way, and lots of boundary stomping. there’s been family meetings called because I finally told his sister off. Just a whole lot of mess, my SO never once defended me. We had a big blow out fight last month saying they were his family and blah blah blah and I finally say okay but me and our daughter are your primary family that YOU created. They are a secondary family and he finally decided to start speaking up for me and his daughter. He’s spoken to his dad about the issues and he just said he understands (haven’t seen his dad since) and he says he’s speaking to his mom but it’s been about a month and he hasn’t yet. Anyways I’m sorry that was long but here’s the issue. I cant help but hold some type of resentment towards my SO , I sit here waiting for him to stop defending us. I don’t know what to do I love my SO to death we have a lot of plans etc. I just can’t get over the fact I went through hell and back for the past 2 years. I just I don’t know it’s great he finally showed his spine but I just don’t think it’s going to stick around. I can’t see myself going over to family dinners and holidays. I keep telling myself to hold on and it’ll be better when he’s not living with his dad and sister but I just I don’t know. I truly don’t think he understands how shitty his family is. He keeps saying “I want you to have a family here since your family isn’t the greatest” or “ you don’t know because you never had a great family “ and I feel like I may not know a perfect family when I see one but I sure as hell know when I see a toxic one and that’s what his is. His SIL has never spoken to my daughter , never even looked at her . She’s 4 months old, his mother has met the baby 2x because she can’t respect boundaries, and his dad gets to see her from her carrier because he can’t respect a no kissing rule (he has cold sores and gave them to my SO as a baby) I just feel like I’m absolutely losing my mind here because I think these people are the devil in disguise and he doesn’t see it at all.",22Aug2020,1

404,"For context, I (18M Bi) joined a Discord server a little bit ago and started talking about stuff and playing videogames with people for fun, and I met this one guy who is super funny and was beginning to get flirty with me which I liked. I talked more with him earlier today about if his flirtatious actions we're just how he acts with others or if he was actually interested in me. Unfortunately, he's just been lonely lately and gravitated to someone who fit his physical criteria the most, but he wasn't really interested in going further into a relationship; Kinda sucky, but more importantly we then kept talking and got into a conversation about dating apps and such.

He says he treats sex as a separate entity from a relationship. He thinks that they definitely share a part in each other but treats relationships a lot more seriously. Me on the other hand values sex much more. I think that it's an important part of every relationship and if I were to just do it with anyone and not care about the emotional aspect of it, that it would devalue it for me when it becomes important in a longer term relationship. He says that if I use apps like Tinder and Grindr that he can help me hook up with someone in an hour; Implying that it's real easy. Personally though, especially because it would be my first time, I feel like it should be more significant. Like, I should do it with someone I love, and with someone who loves me back, at least at the time that is. Not with a stranger. I'd just prefer someone I can trust.

TL;DR The guy I met and later became interested in didn't reciprocate the feelings but offered to help me hook up with someone easily on a dating app like Tinder or Grindr. However, I value sex a lot more than he does. Should I open myself up more to more casual hookups like him, or are my views on sex not skewed by my virginity and I should keep valuing sex highly?",22Aug2020,1

407," So I've been in college for about a year and everything was going fine. I was diagnosed with depression as a teen and a few suicide attempts but these last two years really seemed to give me hope. I was studying hard and got A's in my mid-term exams. this year and last year. An internship was lined up for me this year that would have landed me with a guaranteed job in 2 years.

Then the COVID-19 lockdown happened and really fucked things up. I got talking with my cousin and decided to reveal to her that I was gay and had experimented with another man. I thought I could trust her..Biggest mistake of my life. She acted all fine on WhatsApp but then proceeded to tell my mom. That was two weeks ago. My mom found out last week and is giving me until the end of the month to leave the house. I don't have any family where I live so I'll definitely end up on the streets.  There is a homeless hostel which charges €35 per month for accomodation but I can't even afford that. I've been applying for any jobs but keep getting rejected mainly due to my lack of experience as well as the crashed economy.

409,"Recently I've gotten myself into a serious debate about what to do....I've two options, to move to my grandparents house....or to stay living with my current parents. 

I'm 18, and starting full-time college while unemployed, so apartments aren't an option. And my college is not gonna give dorms during the pandemic, so...not an option.

Reasons why I should move:

They could prevent me from hurting myself. More worrisome is that my dad purchased a firearm recently, although (he was very abusive a time ago) he's a lot better than what he used to be....I get nervous. I've had a lot of rough days recently, and I've thought about ending my life with that gun. 


Where I currently live, it's about an hour away from my university...but my grandparents live about 15 minutes away from the University. 

My grandparent's house has always been a safe haven for me, it's one of the few places I truly feel like I could be genuine and to myself.

I could take care of them better than my 37 year old uncle can.

I can avoid my toxic household, way too many terrible memories living here.

Easier to focus on school.

Reasons why I shouldn't move:

A lot of work to move my stuff.

I feel guilty for leaving my family, when I know they depend on me a lot to do stuff for them. (Though, they are fully capable of doing what they needa do on their own. I just help them with electronics, or any chores they may need me to do.) They still have my 25 year old brother who doesn't pay rent, but still doesn't do much chores.

I'm terrified of something happening to my mom when I'm gone. (My whole life, my dad has had explosive and sometimes violent outbursts that he unleashed on my family. And this has been happening since I was like 4, that's why my house has a bunch of patched up holes.) Sometimes, my dad would get drunk and act stupid and abusive to us. I feel like I should stay to defend my mom. (She'll never leave him.)

I feel like I'd be a burden for my grandparents.

My parents bought me a new car recently, and I feel terrible for leaving them.

I fear my parents may cut me off financially.

I don't want any anger towards me, my parents have told me before they would hate it to see me move.

I'm really stuck on this, I'm really torn. My friends and gf have told me I should move, but it's such a big move and I'm scared to find out what the result would be of be leaving the house.

What do you think?",22Aug2020,1
410,"so basically there is this app called tellonym where you can send someone questions or just tell them anything anonymously. my boyfriend and i downloaded this app out of boredom about a year ago and a few months ago people kept sending us hate towards me. things like „she is so ugly why did you choose her“ „i wouldn’t touch your disgusting girlfriend even if i was drunk or someone forced me too“ and worse things. 

when it first started i ignored it and had a lot of self confidence, i kept telling myself i‘m beautiful as i am and that the people who sent these things anonymously must be kids who are bored. but today it started again. people telling me how ugly and disgusting i am and telling my boyfriend that he should break up with me and date someone prettier. i honestly don’t know what to do. i want to cry but i feel numb and i am starting to hate myself again. i don’t know why they send me these things i have never done anything to anyone. i barely talk to anyone because of my social anxiety and i am very introverted. i wouldn’t even hurt a d*mn fly. i just want this all to stop and i really don’t know what to do. so if you could please give me some advice i‘d be very thankful to each of you",22Aug2020,1

My friend's sister goes to the same school as her, and told me that my sister is smoking weed. (I know, this isn't a direct account (I didn't see it first-hand), but I'm still going to consider it as truth for the time being)    
    
My stance is neutral against weed.     
My main worries are the legality of it, and that she's doing it at such a young age as well as knowing that our parents would not be happy if they found out.     
I'm not sure how to approach this, whether or not to sit down and talk to her about it. Whether to just ignore it. Whether to tell our parents (I would think this isn't a good idea, as it kind of violates trust but Idk).

My dad has 2 apartments, one that we all lived in before and another he rented out. Now my mom lives in the one where he used to rent out. Its a tiny 2 bedroom apt with 1 room that basically the size of a queen bed.

Today a lawyer came and asked me. If your parents swapped houses, would you still stay here with your mom, or go stay in the othe house with your dad. I picked the one where my room had space to walk in and had space to fit my things. Alright, all fine and dandy, we moved on.

After a while my dad stopped me and told me that if I don't like him and don't want to stay with him, I can go stay in the smaller house with my mom right now and that he will move all my stuff for me in a angry tone. 

Now i love my parents equally, but cmon. I have no idea what to say to this kind of thing. The day before he told me to be honest with the lawyer and I was and now I'm getting shit for it.

I chose the place not the parent but he thinks it's all about the parent and that I don't like him or something and it just seems he's butt hurt over it. I'm 19 btw.

417,"Hey guys so just to let the next two years of high school be a little easier, and because this pandemic allows me to take them online, I chose to take two summer school courses where I could do them at home instead of going to a school that’s relatively far away. I took them from two different areas of learning, one being History from a newly introduced form of summer school online that took one month to complete from the start of July to the end; I aced this course with 100% probably due to the fact it was about the 20th century wars that I’m really interested in. The second form of the summer school is offered every year which is self-paced and you have the whole year to complete it; for this one I took a French course as for the University I want to go to you need a second language and even though I already have one, they don’t accept it if that makes sense. Anyways, my goal was to complete the French course starting from the beginning of August until the end as school is supposed to start in September. Now there are two problems here. First of all, I’m not that good at learning more languages other than the two I learned at a young age. Secondly, I’m an incredibly lazy person and procrastinate a lot; with this being a self-paced course. It’s hard to motivate myself to do any work. So I was supposed to grind the course out this whole month but things like videogames and friends put me in a situation where it’s one week until the end of the month, I have done only 15 out of 200 assignments, (each assignment is really short with 8 questions and 10 of the 15 I did were introduction assignments) and I am still procrastinating to this day. It’ll be hard to balance actual school with this course so that is a problem too. I’m pretty sure every 5 minutes I get that stress spike through my body because I’m scared of not doing the work and it prevents me from sleeping well. My sleep schedule is broken as I sleep at 6-8 am (I know it’s incredibly late) and I wake up from 3-6 depending on how my sleep goes. I tried getting my family to motivate me but it’s barely working. On top of this, I’m scared for how this will affect my future in Uni as I want to major in engineering and I know it’s known for tons of work but tbh I like Physics and Math a lot so that’s why I want to major in it. I don’t know what to do I keep saying I will do the work tomorrow and I never do and even if I do, it’s like 2 assignments until I panic because I don’t understand. I get good grades in my classes and am confident in my learning skills but I’m just so uncomfortable and unfamiliar with this language. Again I don’t know what to do.",22Aug2020,1
418,"I wouldn't call myself the type to control people, but I definitely have the feelings of one. Whenever my bsfs do something without me (not like they exclude me, more like one on one hang outs or hanging out with people they never told me about) I can get pretty upset. Of course I dont say anything because who am I to impose my feelings on someone like that? I wouldnt want someone to do that to me. And I'm not one to be clingy either but in a bad way. I distance myself a lot without meaning to. How can I stop being so jealous? It's not that I think they'll leave me just because theyll hangout with other people (though I do worry about them hating me in general but not for this reason). It just feels kind of like, ""oh, I didn't know you knew this person before...are we not close enough for you to tell me?"" or ""I thought I knew everything about you"" (I also feel that way when my closer friends keep something private from me) but I know logically it doesnt mean we arent close, and I know that them not telling me something shouldnt make me upset.

419,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. What I did was really dumb. I know, please don't remind me. I need advice. 

I (15F) am friends with someone (19M) online. We have been friends for about 4 years. For context, we became friends for 1 year, then due to a silly argument he went no contact for 3 years but contacted me after that time and we reconciled. We talked a bit, but we were both busy so eventually fell out of contact except for the occasional 'how have you beens.' 

For more context, I don't like talking much to people. I like to do things by myself and play games by myself. I do enjoy company sometimes. At the same time, I really want real life friends and I'm really lonely because no one at school wants to be my friend because I'm ugly and boring - I know that's my fault for not trying to change anything about myself, and for not putting more effort into relationships. 

For the past few weeks we have been talking again and playing games together and I really did enjoy it, but eventually I got tired and just wanted to play by myself (I also really got interested in other games like animal crossing that helped my escapism of my stupid life). He would always ask me to play, and though usually I would look forward to it, I just didn't want to play (games like league). I would say no sorry, I'm feeling a bit tired today :)' and he would handle it kindly. I also try to say things like 'yeah, I'm really busy, sorry I can't talk much!' but he always keeps trying to initiate conversations and asking if I wanted to play league with him. 

A few days ago he says, hey, i want you to be honest to me. do i make you feel uncomfortable? i feel like i bother you alot. maybe thats just my insecurities hammering down on me haha. I am a total idiot and say no of course not! i just don't respond that much since i'm a bit busy! Which I know is a dumbass thing to say because I know I should be honest and god I know I fucked up okay? Then he responds with 'i just wanted to know you're a big part of my life. i really enjoy talking to you and playing league. you're important to me.' and I cant help but just... not care. I feel awful and stupid and mean. He keeps trying to talk to me about his life and how have I been and all I can think of is, jesus, leave me alone. I want to do my work and play games by myself. He keeps saying hi, how have you been? And I try to respond shortly like hi! going good so he thinks its just the end of the conversation but he always keeps on talking. I feel terrible for doing this to him. 

I have thought about going no contact and cutting him from my life, but I know that is an extremely cruel thing to do to someone and leave them like that. People say 'just be honest and tell him your thoughts' and I know that's the best thing to do but I can't. It's not easy like that. I know I'm a shit person. I know I should be there for him. But I can't bring myself to develop apathy for this person. Please don't call me an asshole. I already know I am.  Help.

So since the lockdown my roommate and close friend, brought her boyfriend for about 1,5 - 2 months. Since I pay all the bills I asked him to pay 1,5 month of costs which is about 65 euros. 

After this I said to set up a rule, if someone stays over for 7+ days a month he or she has to pay a part of the bill, help to clean and pay for things as toilet paper and the amount will be higher the longer he or she stays ( ie. 2 months is 80-100)

Is this realistic? Do you think it was okay for me to charge my friends boyfriend? I mean this is not a hotel right and I'm just a poor student.

424,"I am a teen and I confronted my parents about the politician they support. (To be clear: I'm not hear for political issues, I just want to know what I should do.) I provided facts and all that, my dad and I went through some sort of debate. In the end they ended the conversation with ""I respect your opinion so respect ours"". I don't think this is right cause the ideas they support actually caused a lot of lives to be lost without proper justice. (They aren't directly involved with this but they voted for the politician responsible for this and they continue to support him blindly.)

The problem is this - I feel like I shouldn't be eating the food they provide or living in the shelter that they are paying for. I have lots of relatives who have the same political views as my parents. Sometimes I feel that I shouldn't be asking favors from them. Like for example my aunt invited me to bake at their home (she paid for all the ingredients). This is actually a big deal cause one of my ""dreams"" is to be able to bake something. I feel like I should cut down all connections from them, although I cannot leave home or anything (I do not have any confidence or courage to leave home, I have been to dependent on my family all this time). I feel like I should never talk to them normally anymore. I am ashamed to say this but I don't help out with chores cause the only thing I'm ""supposed"" to do is study well so they say they do all the work and I'll just have to study. But then they will say I shouldn't act big if I cannot provide for myself on my own. I really don't know what to do. I mean I genuinely love my family, they are all that I have. I am somewhat introverted so I really don't have a best friend or friends that can be mfidant, most of the time it'll be my mom. As of now, I act normally - I make jokes with my mom and dad, I always call my relatives and act as if there's nothing wrong going on. I am always confused, I try to keep myself distracted all the time but sometimes when everything's quiet, I feel this sadness take over me. I feel like there is nothing I can do. I am also envious of people my age that can post and express their political ideas online freely. I really don't like posting anything on social media.

""Unrelated"" but one time I told my mom about my suicidal thoughts and she doesn't get why I have them. I kind of understand because I feel like I am somewhat spoiled by them. And also my mom actually attends seminars about mental health provided by our school and she said my dad has a lot of behavior similar to those with depression. I think my parents have gone through a lot of childhood trauma which caused them to resort to supporting such political ideas. I don't think my family takes ""mental health"" seriously. They are also extremely religious but when the sermon points out that the politician they support is wrong, my dad gets angry and send that religious should no be involved in politics. However the ""politics"" here refers to extra judicial killings and red tagging and a lot of other stuff.

I am just wondering if there is any sort of solution for all of this, or is there anyway that I can continue to live normally without any guilt or anxiety because of all of this.",22Aug2020,1

428,"I'll try and keep this short but its a long story in the making. 

I need to give context first: For the entirety of my secondary school years (age 12-16) I felt so many people treated me as though I was lesser than them particularly the boys, I was bullied around age 14/15 and had so many comments said about me to my face that were just rude and hurtful for no reason, and just in general I could tell a lot of people thought I was inferior to them, because of this I never spoke to people outside of my friendship group, I struggled to make eye contact with any of the boys let alone speak to them. This caused my self confidence to take a massive hit, I wondered why I was being treated like this but my friends weren't. I tolerated so many things I shouldn't have tolerated because I was weak and probably a bit scared.

I'm 18 now and while I feel I'm a lot more confident its evident that a lot of what happened in secondary school still impacts me. Whenever I go out with my friends I am genuinely shocked when a guy speaks to me in the same respectful way as he does with my friends and genuienly takes an interest in what I have to say (not even in a romantic way or anything like that just in a normal conversation with a stranger/acquaintance sort of way) because I literally just expect guys to either pretend I don't exist or be horrible to me. 

Yesterday I was out with my friends and this boy from my secondary school came over to our table. This guy was probably one of the worst at my secondary school, he was probably as horrible as horrible can get. But I thought I'd give him benefit of the doubt that he might have changed since I hadn't seen him in 2 years. He then preceeded to pretend he didn't know who I was, made a mean comment about my appearance and make a racist remark to the guy next to me while I was also there (I'm mixed race) yet was all nice to my friends. I at first, just like school, sucked it up and didn't say anything but then with the racist comment I just exploded on him and told him exactly what I thought of him. It was a bit out of character for me but I think it was anger that had just been building up for so many years, and it brought me right back to how I constantly felt in secondary school, of being looked down upon and surpressed. I then left after that and was quite upset, and my friends came shortly after. 

I had made a fair bit of progress on my confidence over this quarantine period and I feel like this has just brought me right back to my 16 year old self. 

I'm basically just wanting to know how do I build up my confidence when it feels like I'm just waiting for the next person to walk all over me or disrespect me?

They broke up after this. Recently she told me one guy asked her out on a date. She said the guy is very sweet and so she said yes, but is not looking for anything serious. I asked her why it is so and she told me she thinks she can never sustain a healthy, monogamous relationship. She thinks she's an evil person who's probably going to cheat on her partner. I told her it's okay not to be non-monogamous, but she kept telling me that she's a bad person and she doesn't deserve the happiness a long term relationship can give her. This hurt me a lot. I've known her for years and she is definitely one of the best people I've known. I think she's learned to suppress her feelings, good and bad, because of something she did in the past. Now, I'm not selfish enough to believe I can fix her, but I really want to help her. I know what it's like to be scared of feelings and it's a very lonely place to be. It's really sad to see how good people let mistakes in the past define them. Is there any way I can tell her that she is not a lost cause? I'd really appreciate any kind of advice.",22Aug2020,1

Today I noticed that she was quite cold to me but I did not think much of it since that was normal. Later on, C, a temporary staff, came to talk to me privately about my mistake. I’m a pretty sensitive person by nature and I can’t hide my emotions well. During the conversation between C and I, I started tearing up as I felt embarrassed and indignant. Since she was the supervisor, shouldn’t she come to speak to me privately? After reflecting, I decided to apologise to B. However, I started tearing up again (honestly i have no idea why) and I overheard her telling everyone again. Right now I’m so embarrassed and I just want to dig a hole and bury myself.

I know that I am young and I shouldn't think about these things so early, but I just can't help it. Also, I know that death is not that horrible thing and that in our culture it just became so strange for us and that is why I am afraid, but what if I don't live my life to the fullest and I die with regrets? That is also my biggest fear. 

It's a bad cycle, because these thoughts make me depressed and I don't do anything and I just waste my time, so it's making me do opposite of what I want.

441,"Hi this has been going through my brain since I found out

(Backstory) me n my bestie (T) have known each other since primary school (age 6) to now, we’re in high school now (16) we’ve been each other’s side for a long time and we share everything to her first time to our shits. 

T and her boyfriend have been together for year and like 4 months and he’s her first offical boyfriend.

So it was a week before her birthday right and was away from school for the whole week and I asked about it and she said she would come the next week, I didn’t really think about it but when she came on the week I was sick and didn’t go the the week the came.
T snapped me of her showing a red card ( at my high school, if something happened you can get a pass where you can go out of class and stay at the office and calm down with a deputy) and I asked what it was about, T responded with ‘coz’ and I got hella suspicious because she’s my best friend and she can tell me anything, but I didn’t ask any more questions because I respected her privacy 

When I went back to school told what I suspected a abortion to a mutual bestie and she confirmed, it hurt my feelings at the time because T and I tell each other everything and didn’t know how bad it was at the time

So fast forward to a day ago I was making a joke to a MUTUAL friend of ours in our PE class it a sheet of scenarios and one about teen pregnancy. I said this reminds me of someone, we looked at each other and I thought she thought I meant someone else, so she mouthed T and I just gasped because she was just a friend she wasn’t close or anything just a friend. I looked at her and told her T hasn’t even told me yet. And she started talking ab it, and I cried because I felt bad for T, so me and the friend went out of class to talk. She explained more in-depth 

My bestie was pregnant. She found out at 16 weeks. T and her bf wanted it and was preparing for it they bought baby clothes and had ultrasounds. She could feel it when both of them lay together in bed. Both families supported them and she was going to move in with her boyfriend but her dad didn’t like it and booked a abortion without her knowing and made her do it. It was 18 weeks when it happened. They didn’t get to see gender

Also crying while typing this because she had a physical being in her body like a live little cute baby, it could be alive rn, it’s so heart breaking 

She hasn’t told me but has mentioned a few things for me to suspect and leading me to finding out. Our mutual best friend has said he has told her to tell me specific things so I don’t find out. T acts total normal like nothing happened 

I don’t hate her, I just don’t understand why she wouldn’t tell me, she told a friend but not her best friend. I just want to support her and make sure she’s feeling ok, way before she was pregnant I have mentioned I would support her if she got pregnant so idk what’s the reason.",22Aug2020,1

444,"So i was never a big “study person”. For 8 years i went to a small village school, i was never really taught how to study, i didn’t push myself either. then i went to a Gymnasium, in the city, were i had to study like crazy because i didn’t have a good basis. It was mentally very hard, i became depressed and lost my confidence completely. I was also going trough bullying, but i didn’t want to give up so i pushed myself and finished, i wasn’t the best student but i wasn’t the worst either. After that i wasn’t sure what i wanted. So i decided to follow my dad’s footsteps and try law. I did that for 2 years but i was exhausted, i would study but i wasn’t really learning, so i thought, okay maybe it’s not the university for me. I felt like a looser and i thought that i just should choose something that is maybe easier for me, so i chose languages ( my second language is german, so i went for that)

Now, again two years later the depression is coming back. I don’t feel like doing anything, i don’t go outside, i sleep a lot, i have a battle instead my head all the time. 

When i think about my future i get so scared because i am not sure if i fit in anywhere. 

My escape was always horses. I had horses all my life and working with them always made me so amazingly energized and motivated and happy. But everyone in my family thinks that is not a realistic future for me. They think i need a university because otherwise life will be very tough. 

I know a bit about myself, i know i seek for adventure, i love challenges, i love when i can help people, and i just love being around horses. Right now i found a horse ranch not far away from the city i live in, and i pay to go riding there. But i also love working there. Mocking the stalls, feeding the horses, cleaning the barn. It is my safe space. Now that my exams are coming closer i stopped going there because i felt guilty. I would stay there all day, and didn’t study much. So for the last few months i am sitting in my apartment, trying to gather all my willpower to study, and i feel so tired. I feel so lost.

I don’t want to disappoint my parents, they are my heroes, i respect them deeply. And i know they just want me to be independent and happy. So i act like everything is okay. But i feel like their shadow. I am not as intelligent and heroic as them. They had me very late in life, i am basically razed like an only child, but they were always an amazing example for me. They did a lot in life, they made a name out of themselves, there is no problem that they can’t solve and they are regarding all that very modest. They went in for the money, we aren’t crazy rich, they were in for the freedom. And they got that. 

But how the hell am i gonna be like that when i cannot get myself out of bed most of the days. And i just feel like a waste of money. I feel like an ungrateful child who had the perfect setup to become something great but messed it up. 

Should i just pause my university and take a break and try to find myself? How do i explain that to my parents when i have been acting like everything is okay? I don’t want them to worry.",22Aug2020,1

Because of Covid I wasn't able to go to the hairdresser for months and my hair has grown out of a very short pixie cut into basically a ""curly"" bob of sorts.

My mom has completely straight hair while my dads hair is very curly probably 3 or 4 C and my hair is something in between where some parts are curly and some wavy, it's also very thick and frizzy.
My mom doesn't like my hair one bit and thinks I should stop with my shenanigans of using all those products and special shampoo and wear it straight.


I've never really liked it and people constantly have something to say about it just like they have about everything about me. Either it's too big and messy for the straight haired folk or not curly enough for the curly haired people.

452,"and I don't know how to channel it. You'd make a cross sign on your chest and pray in Español if you'd know the age I had started masturbating. I have always been that way since the early times of my childhood. I gotta touch myself every other day, sometimes consecutively. Sometimes out of boredom, mostly out of stress and depressive mood but always with an erupting urge to do it. Maybe some of you would say that there's no wrong in masturbating and it is a way of relaxing... etc. but

Sometimes I do have to admit that it really relaxes me but this frequent pattern also causes these:

1. Excessive usage of porn that leads a foggy mind. Sometimes up to 3 hours of watching nsfw videos. Loss of time.
2. Now I don't want to brag here but I am kind of a creative person that loves dealing with music, writing, different languages (can learn and speak really good in a very short amount of time.). I have the passion, man. But I can't channel my focus and energy through these.
3. I am a well shaped man and I love exercising. Not gym but running and bodyweight training but when I'm on a daily whipping row I don't have the energy to exercise and when I exercise after or before masturbating it is just a lost cause. It is just more energy draining that doesn't make me feel good more.
4. Regret that causes a general depressive mood.
5. Not always but sometimes it is harder for me to engage in a relationship with the opposite gender. 
6. I think this always hindered me to perform my best in anything. I feel like I'd be more successful if I wasn't this way.

455,"Around October last year, I started chatting with this person online. I was drawn to her from the very beginning - she had an amazing sense of humor, she was smart, she was kind, she was ""normal"". We quickly started chatting to each other (almost) daily, sometimes for 5, 6, 7(!) hours. However, I should point some important things I find relevant at this point:

- From the very beginning (I will go as far as saying from the first day), she said she didn't want to be involved in any romantic relationship;

- She never asked anything crazy about me (personal information, like my address, or money - so I absolutely never gave her things like those);

- We never exchanged nudes.

In December, I could tell something was off with her. She stopped responding my texts until, suddenly, around Christmas, she sent me what seemed like a goodbye text. I don't remember the exact words that where in it, but it was something among the lines ""I'm so sorry, you didn't deserve this"", etc, etc, typical guilt message. At this point, I realized what had happened - she had tricked me. But to what extent? I finally got ahold of her and was able to get the ""truth"" out of her - she was not the person on her profile pictures. No big deal, I thought. We all have insecurities and I was definitely not in love with her pictures. Afterall, I never really paid much attention to them, I really, really just didn't want to lose this person that was starting to become so important to me.

Despite this, I did not get to see her real self. I also don't want to ask her for pictures, because I feel like I'm not entitled to ask her for that and she never, never asks me for anything.

One more month goes by and I felt happy - I thought our contact had been reestablished. But... I didn't feel comfortable anymore on being on a site online, even more because she was the only person I texted there. I decided to give her my number if she ever wanted to contact me again and delete my account. If this was the end... then it would also be fine. Afterall, no romance was involved between us and she knew how to contact me.

To my big surprise, she texted me the same day. I use the word ""surprise"" here due to the fact she always appeared very reticent to give me her phone number. I didn't tell her this, but that simple action made me feel special - like I was someone she had learnt to trust. On her WhatsApp (this is the app we use to text now), I should point out her profile pic is not of a person and, until today, I never heard her voice - we have never been in a phone call.

But why am I writing all of this?
Well... It's August now. I just can't shake this feeling that there is a great chance that this amazing (and she is, believe me...) person that I have been texting to for almost a year now may be... a man. She said she was around my age, which would put her around her 20s, but the fact that I never saw her physical appearance or heard her voice, makes me also think that that is not the case. I guess I just wanted to know other people's opinion on this case.

And I would very much appreciate if you could give me ANY recommendations on what to do now. I like to text her, but should I just stop?

458,"My brother (18M) is becoming insane. And I (14F) really need some advice on how to deal with this situation.
Here’s the story:

This happened today when my mum was cleaning my brother’s room while he was with his friend’s house for 3 days. He has 2 cats, Boku and Pico. Both females. My brother got them from a rescue center so they were both strays before. They weren’t the house pets kind. Pico was the cuter and friendlier and more pet-like one while Boku was cold and unfriendly and very strange. Boku was the one who went missing earlier today. After cleaning his room she realized that only Pico was in the room and Boku was no where to be found. After searching all over the house and calling her name over and over again for almost 4 hours she was still missing.

My mum and dad assumed it was because of the vacuum cleaner that scared Boku away this morning, since the cats were very sensitive to loud noises. So we tried looking at the security cameras, searching all over the neighborhood, asking all our neighbors if they saw any cats passing by,.. We found nothing.

But I was sure I haven’t seen Boku since last night.

Boku and Pico only stays inside my brother’s bedroom, which I often go into to feed and play with them. Last night, before dinner, I was going in there to feed them, I swore I did not see Boku anywhere, only Pico. I didn’t question much since Boku usually hides behind the curtains (Which were opaque). Althought it was oddly quieter than usually yesterday, I didn’t think of it much.. The thing is, since the room had a horrid smell of cat shit, we often leave the windows and doors opened until it’s bedtime to get rid of it. We know the cats wouldn’t just leave. But this time, apparently, they might did. So our theory is; Boku, for some reason, left the house last night between 8-10 PM through the windows since there were no security cameras installed there.. And just disappear.

We didn’t know the cat left. And we wouldn’t want to blame it on ourselves because we had no idea why and how it left. And you know cats they leave us very easily. Excellent climbers.

So I had to tell the devastating truth to my brother through text. I told him that it left and we were truly sorry and we tried finding everywhere. He was angry. Very angry. He was so angry that he warned us that if we don’t find Boku by Monday, when he goes home, he’s going to drop my poodle dog named Pinky, down from the 5th floor of our house. I know that he was probably overreacting when he told me that. But I am worrying my butts off for Pinky’s safety. I don’t want to get my dog murdered because his cat ran away. My dog has nothing to do with this situation. The way he told me that he would do it makes me really scared. 

I tried calming him down, apologies after apologies. But he was my brother, stubborn as always. I don’t know what to do.

Even if he wouldn’t murder my dog, I still want to have some advices so that I can tell my brother to calm down. There’s no way we can find this cat. We have no idea where it went. We will try to hang up posters and stuff to at least try to find Boku.

461,"The situation is quite dramatic and lengthy so I’ll sum up the main points. 

My ex (21F) and I (21M) broke up in late February of 2019 after being together about 7.5 months. The reason for this was our was relationship getting toxic because we both didn’t love ourselves and codependency was prevalent so we decided to mutually end it. I couldn’t handle the heartbreak and I tried getting back with her for months afterwards, but it was clear she wanted space. I gave up around May, thinking it was best to let it go and move on. 

Months pass and it’s now September in the summer of 2019 and somehow she and I are in contact again. I was over the break up, but pretty much still in love with her and I knew it when we met up for the first time. During this first meeting we were both curious of the potential sexual or romantic partners each of us had been with during our time apart. I told her my amount and she told me hers. I specifically asked if she had slept with a guy at her job that I was cautious about when we were in our relationship, she told me no. We start dating for the next month, as in going out together, having sex and being inseparable again. It’s amazing how quickly and seamlessly we picked up where passion died in our relationship, but I suppose all things must  come to an end. 

In October while she was at my house and sleeping, i immaturely went into her phone. I know this was wrong and I’m aware of it stemming from insecurity on my part. I saw a video of her and the guy I had asked her about vividly having sex, which I must say has scarred me for life. I felt an influx of emotions ranging from being on the verge of tears to intense fury. I calmed myself down realizing this could be karma for my toxic behavior and betrayal in the past during our relationship. I forgave her, but already seeing as I didn’t trust her enough not to go through her phone, her lying made the trust I had for her almost non existent. 

This was the turning point in our reconciliation. Things went downhill from here and it was revealed she had feelings for this guy. She was confused and I didn’t want to be around for someone that had to contemplate between me and another. I tried walking away but we always came back together. The love (if it was even love, I’m still trying to figure out what that shit even is at this point) we had for each other was strong, but this was a test to that strength. I hadn’t recovered from what I had seen as well, but she was very important to me and my best friend, my only friend really. No one else knew me like she did and I was afraid to let that go despite being hurt immensely from what i had seen. 

Eventually in November she decided it was best to separate, sending me a lengthy paragraph apologizing for what had happened and saying it was best to let what we had go. Me being weak and taking her gesture as offensive rather than the maturity and kindness that it displayed, I called her the next day and let her have it. I was extremely emotional and let all the hurt I’d been holding in following seeing that video out on her. I said things I didn’t mean and regret greatly. It’s clear that after that she wanted nothing to do with me and we stopped speaking. 

I had wanted to apologize long ago, but I thought it was best to leave her alone. I’ve questioned if I’m apologizing for myself or her and honestly the answer is both. I know how it feels to have someone say things and not be aware of the effects it has on you. I want her to know that I didn’t mean the things I said and they were coming from place of hurt as well as poor emotional intelligence on my part. I also would like to stop thinking about her and move on as I’m pretty sure she’s moved on with that guy. I think apologizing would also give me that closure. 

I’d just like some opinions on the subject. Whether or not it’s best to let it go or apologize to her.",22Aug2020,1
462,Ok so i was talking to someone online and i ended up lying about some minor things as i didn't believe this would be an ongoing conversation. But then we kinda bonded and then we started chatting and now we've been talking for over 1 and a half years. She is one of my best friends but I just kept up with the lies and I got more into detail with them now I feel like I'm dug a very deep hole. part of me is saying that I should ghost her and just cut her out of my life for her own good. But I don't want to hurt her like that... But I feel like I already have... She just doesn't know it... I mean exaggerating things to strangers on the internet is just a thing we do... I just happened to befriend this person... I dont want to keep up the lies as not only do i hate myself for the lying but i also feel like im gonna trip up eventually and thats not how i want her to find out....should i just cut them out? For their own good? I really dont want to come clean.. It scares me. Growing up in the household I grew up in I was always taught to lie as much as possible just to win an argument or to get myself out of a sticky situation. I know that is a dumb excuse but it's my shitty excuse....any advice would help.,22Aug2020,1

Does forgetting equal not caring? My friend said they would check up on me that day but they didn't. Maybe they forgot but it hurts. I'd rather they not say it if they couldn't promise it or if they didn't care. I feel bad now because I feel like a bother.

466,"So i started a new job a couple months ago and a month after that, another girl started too. Yeh first day she started, i just got a bad vibe. She had missed the first couple days because she was sick and then the when  she came in she was donned up in a mask and gloves and said she was still feeling sick. When i asked, she told me she had a fever for a day and a couple other symptoms, but that it had only lasted a day and she didn’t want to miss more work. I then asked if she had been tested and  she said no. So right away, i was annoyed at this irresponsible behaviour ; we’re in a pandemic for pete’s sake. Anyways, she called in sick the next day by showing up and then leaving her shift partner to work alone. When i came back on monday, she was there and said she stil wasn’t feeling well, but wanted to tough it out.  This is just the beginning. 

Her overall personality does not mesh with mine, we seem like really different people and i have a hard time connecting with her. She’s really soft spoken, but also passive aggressive, so it often feels like i’m walking on egg shells.

There’s been a few incidents where i really have to take over and do the difficult work/ act like the bad cop ( we work in a mental health facility) while she’s stays silent and doesn’t show me support. i get that she’s still newer than me and this has gotten a bit better over the last few weeks so there’s improvement at least ! 

Working with her can also feel like i’m walking on egg shells.  Recently, i was walking back to the main floor when i saw her talking go a client and i saw another client waiting for help and since i wasn’t doing anything and she was in the middle of the convo i ran and helped him . She looked absolutely shocked and when i did this then in the office she was being very silent and seemed pissed off, i could feel her energy , but when i asked if she was okay, she said she was and then went to sit outside. When she came back, she confronted me about what happened earlier and said she felt it was impolite for me to take over like that and let her know next time before doing it.  I was shocked! I thought i was doing her a favor bc she was having a conversation with somone and me belong tje guy out would allow her to continue, but she took it as me thinking she wasn’t working/ capable of doing it herself . I explained myself and left it at that, i did not feel the need to apologize. 

more recently, we finished our shift and i was giving shift exchange and she was grabbing some stuff from the staff rooom. When she came back, i asked if she could hear what we were talking about from the other side. I didn’t specify that it was because i wanted to know if clients were able to hear us when we talked but i think she took it the wrong was because she didn’t answer me and then i asked again and walked away saying “ i don’t know” in a pissed off tone and then threw the keys on her way back. I’m thinking now she thought i asked because we were talking about her ? It’s the only explanation i can think of why she acted that way. 

Im sure she thinks i’m difficult to work with too, i’m not saying i’m a perfect angel . She probably thinks i’m loud and maybe bossy. She does have some good qualities and she’s connected really well with some of our clients , but with myself and other staff members, it’s been a bit harder. 

The fact of the matter is i need to work with this person and i’ll have to be civil towards them and work as a united front  to provide good care. How can i learn to get along with someone i just don’t like ?",22Aug2020,1
467,"Some backstory: I was in public school (which I loved and had some great friends) until 6th grade. Then my parents got the fucking brilliant idea to homeschool me. I lost all my friends from public school and made no new ones in homeschooling because they are super left and don’t hate me, but I am not left or right politically, I am in the middle, I agree with lots of stuff from both sides, but that doesn’t matter. I am going on my junior year of high school and I have hated homeschooling for the last 4 years for several reasons: 1. I can’t okay football, I am a great running back in flag football, but I want to play real football on a high school team, but I need to be in that school. 2. I don’t learn well in a teacher-less environment, I need someone there but my parents are too busy 3. I want to play chess competitively for a high school team as well as football since I have a 2000+ rating online. I have resented my dad for the past 4 years because of his decision to homeschool me, I don’t resent my mom because she basically has no say in anything. 

My dad is, well, think of a UFO junkie, but minus the UFO part. Some of the stuff he does: 1. He won’t have a tag sale to get rid of some of his junk because he doesn’t want people looking at our stuff and business equipment (septic and water business) 2. He never admits he is wrong or says sorry, he is always right. 3. I can’t talk back to him even if he is wrong because he gets pissed off at every little thing

So now back to the reason I am writing this post. I went to a supermarket yesterday and I thought the cashier looked familiar, and when I looked at the name tag, it was an old crush of mine. I feel like I have thrown away the best years of my life saying “yes” to my dad all the time, whether for homeschooling or other BS. I feel like I have missed everything and that all my old friends will be totally different than 4 years. 

I don’t know how to tell my dad and mom this, and that I want to go back to public school. My older brother wants to run the family business because he doesn’t have any life goals besides that. I want to play football and maybe go to college, I know my dad won’t pay for college so I probably need to get a chess or football scholarship of some sort and get a job to pay for the rest of it. 

TL;DR Feel like I have wasted the best years of my life and don’t know how to tell my parents I have life goals that I want to pursue.

472,"So this maybe long and I'm sorry

So her now ex boyfriend that dumped her, who was apparently supposed to give her all the money he made and marry her so she didn't have to work, was apparently cheating on her, That's what she told some family members, apparently he had become distant and not at home very much, What we found out later was she was doing these things and when accused she literally cried for him thinking any of that, to bad what happen nest to her proved everything I already knew.

Recently My parents had their 40 year anniversary Me and my husband planned to pay for them and a couple family members to have dinner at their favourite restaurant, We texted both my sister and her boyfriend, Her boyfriend said yes but my sister had ""more important plans"" apparently.

So the thing is nobody but me and my husband knew where we were eating out and everyone was supposed to meet at our house and follow us to the restaurant, Well what a shit show that was, when we got to the restaurant my parents were super happy and thanked both me and husband and when we walked into the lobby to sign in something caught my husbands attention, we all had to sign the book for safety reasons but getting my husbands attention was hard so I looked over to what he had his attention on.

I couldn't believe it my sisters "" more important plans"" were sitting on this guys lap practically eating his face off, Her boyfriend saw and walked over and tapped her on the shoulder, when she turned around he asked who this other guy was and she said he was a friend and when her boyfriend told her everyone saw her making out with him she denied it, Her poor boyfriend then continued to go on about her denying cheating on him, and she literally rolled her eyes and ignored him while he talked, she then saw me standing there and started saying I had ""set"" her up on this date, and had given her a new phone and I had started texting this guy for her, Her boyfriend and everyone knew she was lying and told her so, and after arguing with her for awhile she started screaming and we all got kicked out of the restaurant, She then accused me again but this time for getting her kicked out of the restaurant, She then left with this new guy, needless everyone was pissed off and put off of eating so everyone gave my mom and dad a hug and some people hugged my sisters boyfriend and told them they are sorry this happened to him, My husband told him we would call him the next day to check on him. every one went home after that.

The next day in early afternoon me and my husband were outside with our 4 kids when my husband phone rang, it my sisters boyfriend was calling to tell us, my sister was extremely angry and was heading our way, turns out he had the locks changed on his home and he threw everything of her's on the front lawn, When she got back to his place she tried to get into the house and started screaming for him to open the door, he opened the window to yell down at her they were over and she needed to leave, apparently she kept screaming at him that they weren't finished at to let her in to  ""her"" home, he after awhile went into his office to work while she screamed, after a while, she stopped and said ""I know who's to blame for this"" and got into her car and peeled off leaving her stuff on his lawn still.

Well we were waiting for her when she showed up and arranged for my mother in law to watch the kids until she was gone. When I opened the door I acted like I didn't know about anything that had happened already, and she practically tried to push her way in my husband had to come up behind me and hold the door so she could open it and she yelled at us both to let her in because she was now living with us, We told her we would let her live with us if she payed rent but that would never happen anyway because she was toxic and would only cause more problems and our kids don't need to see that, She then went on to say we owed her for ""ruining her relationship"" and then just went on about unnecessary shit, after awhile, my husband told her we were calling the police and went to get the phone and when he got back to the door he pretended he was on the phone, so that's when she shut her mouth and stepped back from the door, So I took the opportunity to slam the door in her face to which set her off more and through the glass I could see her literally jumping up and down, stomping her feet into the ground screaming again, we just walked away and left her there, After awhile someone called the cops on her and they arrived to talk to her, I could she her pointing at my house and knew We were getting blamed, they came to the door and we told them exactly what happened, she was given a warning and sent away.

Later on I got text message's from other family members about ruining her relationship and then apparently allowing her to live with me but not opening the door and denying her entry when she got here, which wasn't true I tried to explain the situation to these people but they haven't believed me, apparently she has been very ""distraught"" about everything.

474,"(Long one)
A couple years ago, my best friend of 10 years needed a place to stay with her two children. She was escaping an abusive situation and I was happy to clear out the nursery to give her a room. The nursery is attached to our bedroom, and you cannot leave our room without going past the door. This is important. 
Leading up: My husband and I work the same amount of hours, and I also go to college full time, so Im not home much. Additionally, I expect to have to do less housework and cooking because I'm leaving at 7am and getting home around11pm. I'd nag that he's not cleaned in weeks and all the while she's looking at me like I'm crazy. She's quite slovenly,  which also caused tension. A clean, if not tidy, home is important to me so it was a sticking point. 
She acted wierd and jealous while here but I just chalked it up to how bad her ex had been (we're talking living off of her, physical, mental, and emotional abuse). I couldnt blame her for wanting the easy love and affection we had. But my husband started getting more and more hostile towards her (he's typically very sweet and readier to help than I). She eventually moved out and by that time he'd developed a simmering hatred for her. Once again, made sense. He loves my pride and strength, whereas shes quite simpering and promiscuous. 
Recently, after a bad fight that she advised me on, we were talking and he said something derogatory about my bestie and I confronted him. 
Why does he hate her so? What the hell?
He tells me, ""she's a snake"" to which I obviously required an explanation. 
He bursts out with how shed tried to seduce him whenever I was at work. Wearing sheer clothing a lot, making insinuating remarks, and most telling: on two occasions she masturbated in her room naked, with the door wide open only while I was gone, and he was in our room, no kids in the house (rare). 
WHAT THE FUCK. This is 2 yrs later nearly, and I have no idea how to proceed. Confront her with nothing but his word? Meanwhile, Im rethinking the advice she'd JUST given, ""hes not the cheating type for sure"".
I believe him, but.... She's moved on, and I want so much to chalk her behavior up to her not being in her right mind. But I'm also ragey because SHE IS SUPPOSED TO BE MY VERY BEST FRIEND.

It doesn't smell bad or anything with the door closed, but I'm wondering what to expect and how to deal with it. He's quite embarrassed about the whole thing and doesn't want his neighbors to find out. We do have to bring the trash down through his apartment building and his apartment is on the 5th floor.

At the same time, my lease for my apartment is up and my roommate has decided to move back home with his family. 

I'd like to stay in the area. My friends are here. I have roots here. But, it's difficult to rationalize locking myself into another apartment (for a 1 year lease minimum), without a job. Not only is it money lost while looking for a job, getting an apartment will also mean limiting my job search. 

Or, I could move back home with my family. My parents have already expressed that I can live with them until I get back on my feet. I'd save money. 

While I recognize that it's probably a smarter, safer decision to move home and live with my parents again, I feel like I'd become depressed being alone and in my own head all day. I still am in my own head, but at least I can look forward to seeing my friends.

480,"In the past year or so my mental and emotional health have significantly improved and I've been feeling much better and happier. In that year I opened up to the world like never before, took care of myself and met a lot more people.
I've made a ton of friends who support me and that I really like and appreciate, and when my mental health was at its best I could easily handle that amount of friendships and contacts and I was feeling great.

In the last month or so, my mental health went into shit, I've been having anxiety attacks several times a day as opposed to once every few days before and I'm just generally feeling down and less energetic. I don't know what's the cause yet so I cant really help it or at least solve the problem from the root. 

Anyway, as soon as my emotional health went down I almost immediately felt just how straining it is to talk regularly with so many people and keep in contact with so many friends, and how they're draining away all my social and emotional energy without doing anything wrong. I've started to talk less and less to all my friends and just isolating myself from people. Especially my boyfriend, which I really do love but I feel that I just can't handle a romantic relationship. He noticed that something's wrong with me but I can't just tell him that. 

I don't think at all that it's fair to cut or at least reduce contact with people who have done nothing wrong but i also don't feel that its fair to tell them the cause, and the fact that I might be coming out as rude and an a-hole just worsens my already shit anxiety.

481,"TLDR: I’ve suddenly stopped feeling much for my boyfriend 

(Sorry I ramble so much, I’m really stressed about this and also am bad at explaining things)

So I don’t know why any of this is happening so I’m giving an excessive amount of context  in hopes any of it could be relevant 

I (f16) had a crush on him (m16) on and off (and according to him vice versa) since I met him (around two years ago) and we ended up just kind of happening in mid February of this year. 

He’s my first actual boyfriend and I was really anxious at the start of our relationship. He had a relationship around 2 years ago (before we met when we both joined the same high school) that lasted 10 months or so.

I was really anxious that I wasn’t good enough for him (he’s fairly popular, but not friends with popular kids, if that makes sense. He’s respectful, kind, funny, very smart, athletic (star of the track team athletic), and i know of 5+ other girls who have been interested in him (there’s bound to be much more). (Oh, and he’s very cute)

Honestly, for a first relationship he is all I could ask for, and again for months I was anxious that he was too good for me and I wouldn’t be enough for him. 

Our relationship is very healthy, we haven’t really argued because whenever we have a disagreement or if someone is bothered or hurt by something we talk it out and so far we haven’t fought. Though it took some time, I did work up the courage to talk to him about my insecurities regarding not feeling good enough, and his previous relationships and we had a long talk about it and I felt much better after. 

Because of coronavirus, we only got (exactly) one month together before quarantine. We live in America (one of the cities that had one of the first coronavirus outbreaks) so coronavirus is pretty bad here and basically for 5+ months we’ve been semi long-distance, we visit each other at least ever week but for short periods of time and with coronavirus precautions)

Every single night since we were quarantined we’ve fallen asleep on a discord call together. Every single night for 5+ months we’ve been doing this, and honestly I’m surprised we’ve managed to keep such a long streak. 

I feel safe around him, I trust him, he is understanding, kind, attractive, we share very similar opinions regarding life and morality (we bonded over both wanting to adopt rather than a more traditional form of obtaining a child) and honestly I’ve been head over heels for him since we started dating. 

I was scared he didn’t like me as much as I liked him, I felt insecure when he talked about past relationships (which we talked about), but the more time we spent together the less worried I felt, and the more content and safe I felt. 


Around three months into the relationship (I know it was early) I started saving up to buy him a Nintendo switch. It started as just a nice thought but my parents gave me an opportunity to make some money (something they never do, and it was a FUCKTON of work) and I actually managed to make enough money to buy him a switch. (I’ve got one and the only game we’ve been able to play online together is Minecraft and he wanted one but was hesitant about the price tag)

My point is, this was the theoretical best boyfriend I could possibly ask for and I was head over heels for him. I spent like a month working to get enough money to get the perfect gift for him, and approaching 6 months I had a moment where I thought I might even be in love with him. (I understand I’m not really old enough to have a concept of what love is, but I’ve never felt more safe and special and understood and respected and I’ve never adored or been more thankful for a person (other than family), and if that’s not love idk what is but I guess I don’t know what it is because I never decided if I actually was in love with him, not that I would tell him either way)

Then, about two or three weeks ago idk why but something changed. I’ve been stuck on summer break in quarantine and honestly (hot take) it fucking sucks. For the last few months I’ve been slowly loosing more and more energy, I stay up till 6 am and sleep in till 3pm (it’s currently almost 6am as I writing this bc I couldn’t sleep) 

I only became aware of how much I was checking out of my emotions around a week ago I wanna say (but looking back it’s been longer than that, it just has escalated in the last week.) I’ve stopped enjoying things I usually do, I eat absolute shit food (I’ve got a poor history with food, I’m pretty underweight and have adhd meds I take during school that reduce my apatite by a lot, combined with a fast immune system and for some reason not eating much as a kid culminates in a poor relationship with food)

Around 3 weeks ago I discovered a rising YouTube community in the Minecraft genre and since then (I am not proud of this) it’s become my only source of happiness. I wish that was an exaggeration but it’s really not, it’s fucking sad. I wake up and check their channels, it’s the reason I’ve gotten back into drawing this summer (well, making fanart but also I think I got back into drawing bc it’s the only thing I’ve ever felt good at and I feel like I need a consistent in my life or something idk)

It’s really the only thing bringing me positive chemicals and I’m only bringing this up because my boyfriend used to be the only thing that really gave me those good brain chemicals. The highlight of my days used to be our nightly calls, but the last week I’ve noticed I end up more annoyed when he calls because odds are He interrupted me watching a YouTube video and drawing. 

For our 6 month he cooked a meal for me (I’m very picky, he prepared some of my favorite food, he baked me desert and everything) and I know I loved it, it tasted amazing, he put in so much effort, but for some reason I just didn’t really feel much. A month ago I wouldn’t have been able to stop smiling, but we just kinda sat there and ate it. Don’t get me wrong, it was amazing and we had a nice time (and I made sure to thank him and gave him a well-deserved glowing review) but I don’t think he really noticed I wasn’t all there. 

I don’t know what’s wrong with me. We hung out today and went to a park where we just sat and talked for a while. I started ranting about how nothing really is making me feel anything anymore and things I used to like don’t make me happy anymore and he jokingly asked “I hope I’m still one of the things that makes you happy” and when I said he was I think it was the first time I’ve ever really lied to him. 

I feel like the worst person in the world. I thought maybe it’s just social interaction in general but I’m excited (almost desperate) to see my friends whenever we are able to see each other. 

I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to break up, I don’t not like him, I just don’t think about him much anymore. I don’t feel insecure or worried about how he sees me, I feel like I almost just don’t care at all and it’s scary. 

Sorry if this is tmi but I’ve just completely lost my sex drive the last month. We consistently did  stuff on the phone (no photos tho that’s illegal) but I just haven’t been in the mood in ages and that he definitely noticed. 

Less than a month ago I thought I was in love with him, and now I feel like I don’t really feel much for him and it’s so fucked up. 

He deserves so much better. I feel fucking terrible and I don’t know what to do. I want to talk to him about it so bad, whenever I talked to him about anything I always felt better after but how am I going to tell him this? It would break his heart. I don’t want him to feel like I did, like he isn’t good enough because he’s more than enough but I just don’t feel anything and I feel so shitty. 

Today he suggested I talk to a therapist about not really feeling happy much anymore and I didn’t think much of it at the time 
(I was in therapy when I was much younger bc I was kinda suicidal (I don’t remember much of this, I think I blocked it out or something, most of this is things my mom has told me about) but the therapist did some weird thing where I watched a red dot go back and forth and she talked to me about my experiences and like, rewired my brain (I’m being serious it’s an actual technique I think it’s used mostly for children with ptsd idk look it up) and mom thought I’d be in therapy for 10 years but it ended up being 10 months so I guess I’ve always seen therapy as for more serious things and I feel like if my situation (quarantine) was different I’d be much happier so it’s def not like depression or something bc that’s like an actual problem and anyway I’m rambling but the point is) looking back on it maybe therapy isn’t such a bad idea. 

I brought up the YouTube thing because maybe it’s a problem, idk, like I know it’s not really healthy that that is the only thing making me feel anything but I also don’t think correlation is causation and I honestly don’t know. 

I’m just confused and scared because I pride myself on understanding my own emotions and when things (especially my own emotions) don’t make sense I get really upset and I’m kinda panicking because I don’t want to mess up my relationship because this is one of the best things I’ve ever had going for me  and I’m so scared I’ll loose him but I don’t know why because at the same time a part of me doesn’t care and it’s so confusing and it would mean a lot of anyone could give me any advice or any ideas as to what caused this or what to do 


I’m really sorry I just ended up ranting, but thank you so much for reading 

Post script: re-reading this I really do sound depressed or something, and I’m a big “self-diagnosing is harmful do not do that and talk to a professional instead” kinda person so um I don’t think I am, usually I wait for things to just kinda fix themselves (nothing really like this though) and usually they do but I might ask my mom about talking to a therapist or something I’ll think about it if this doesn’t just fix itself 

Post post script: Okay I use some confusing language and I just want to clarify idk how clear this was I was rambling like a lot, I just don’t really feel anything towards him, and that is scaring, confusing, and worrying me and I would really appreciate any advice anyone has

483,Okay so my girlfriend has really strict grandparents which she lives with they never let her out anywhere and always watch my girlfriend move. They even have cameras inside the house just for my girlfriend and she has never done anything bad. So I've been coming over my girlfriend house after she got caught sneaking out with me which was 5 months ago. So yesterday me and my girlfriend went to the backyard swimming they have cameras in the backyard but its pointed towards at there back entrance door. They also have a car in the backyard and I told my girlfriend lets go behind it to have sex real quick. So we started playing badminton next to the car there are windows that can see us but the blinds were closed which is the living room. The grandparents were watching TV all comfy but the grandma couldn't see so she went to the blinds to open them but we already went behind the car. So the grandma goes upstairs to my girlfriends room and spies on us from her window and she saw me having sex. Then the grandma went to the backyard and stopped us asking what are you guys doing. We pretended we were looking for a ball under the car. Then she went away. Me and my girlfriend were mortified and upset that she saw. My girlfriend never has any privacy because the grandma always has to see her and when im there she always on the cameras watching us. Which is just creepy and a violation of our privacy and I know its stupid to have sex when they are there but. They never give her any freedom to let me take her out to the park or over my house. My girlfriend got yelled at by her grandma saying she's a stripper and degrading her and I feel bad. I don't know why the grandma literally has to concern herself with what we do just cause she couldn't see us downstairs she takes time to go upstairs just to spy on us.  She wants to move out as soon as possible but covid and college makes it difficult for her.,22Aug2020,1
484,"Yesterday, I FaceTimed my brother who I never get to talk to and I wanted my SO to be on the call with me as we are engaged and I want him to get to know my brothers more. Right before the FaceTime with my brother, my SO had a virtual happy hour with his coworkers and he had had three beers.

I noticed when the call started my SO was a bit tipsy, acting louder and more obnoxious than normal, slurring a bit, gesturing sloppily. I was a bit annoyed but let it slide.

Then he spilled his beer on me during the call. This is a common thing for him to spill drinks when he is drunk and I was pretty upset. I told my brother we would call right back and hung up.

My SO knew I was mad and I told him I wanted him to stop drinking for the next part of the call. He didn’t want to and said that the couch was fine and I was fine so what was the big deal. I left it alone and FaceTimed my brother back. My SO poured himself another beer. The rest of the conversation he was slurring even more, talking even louder, almost fell over, and would barely let my brother talk before he interrupted him with questions. I was very annoyed now.

When we were done talking to him I was very mad with my SO and he could tell. I told him that all I had wanted was for him to stop drinking and not be drunk during the FaceTime call, and that I didn’t want to be around him if he was drunk. He said “well I don’t feel like I did anything to you or your brother, the call went fine, it’s no big deal, I don’t know why you’re so upset.” 

I left the room and he followed me a short while later, accusing me of being overly upset and treating him unfairly. This continued into a big argument, in which I would say “what I am upset about is you were drunk during that call and I didn’t want you to be”. He went through many of the same tactics my narcissistic parents use to try and make it seem like that wasn’t why I was upset. He tried to deflect, gaslight, dismiss, project, and I felt like I was back home with my parents going crazy.

I asked if I could record the argument, because I was getting sick of him not being able to respect my wish and not recognize my feelings and try and change the conversation and muddy the waters. I recorded it and when I played it back, the third time I played it back he was able to recognize what a giant manipulative asshole he was being.

He shared with me that he knows he does this and he doesn’t like it, that he has felt stuck lately and knows it is not an excuse but that he knows his first reaction to being told to do something makes him defensive. I listened, but I still don’t trust that he will actually change as my narc parents never have. I do not want to live in that hell that was growing up with them. I love my SO deeply but I will not risk my wellbeing to be manipulated again.

How do we work through this, or can we?",22Aug2020,1

She just came back from work having to stay back super late to correct a subordinate's bullshit mistake and all she wanted to do was sleep but the cat kept meowing.

487,"So, I'm a guy, and my closest friend is a girl. And I know, some people say opposite sexes can never be ""just friends"", but I dunno, it's whatever. Before her, I really never had friends, and I struggled socially, then she came along and really kind of changed my whole world for the better. We've known each other for several years, now, and she's been in a relationship the entire time I've known her. About half way through the time I knew her, I finally formally met her boyfriend, and we became buddies, too. He's always been super cool about me hanging around, and being close with her.

Well, their relationship recently came to an end, and we're currently in the ""in between"" process of everything. She and I will definitely remain close friends for now, and he and I are going to try to stay in touch, but he's moving pretty far away, so I don't know how difficult that's going to be to maintain, yet.

In any case, what I'm most worried about is how things will change when she eventually begins dating again. I feel like she and him were a bit ""unique"" in how they invited me in, and I feel like it's probably very unlikely that she can easily find another guy that's going to be cool with me hanging around and being close with her. Granted, she seems to have a pretty strong attachment to me, and I don't think she'd easily cut me out of her life for some guy, but I mean... If it really came down to her having to choose between me or the potential love of her life, I wouldn't want her to be in a position where she'd have to make that choice. I do very much want her to be happy, of course. I care a great deal about her, obviously.

But I really do not want to lose her, I don't want to lose what I have with her. She means so much to me, she's helped me in so many ways that she doesn't even know about. I can't even imagine not being able to have her around.

And it's scary, because it's all completely out of my hands. There's really nothing I can do, I don't have a say in her life and the decisions she makes, and I respect that, of course. I mean, at some point in the future, yes, I'll probably bring up these concerns with her, though I don't think it's going to be an appropriate discussion to have any time soon, considering she has a lot on her plate dealing with the break up and all. But in the meantime, it's all I can think about, and I don't really see a good option, other than hoping that maybe lightning will strike twice and that she'll somehow find another guy that's totally cool with me. I'm just... very upset, right now, because I'm worried that it's ""doomed"", and I can't really talk to her or anyone about it right now, because she's already going through a lot. I just don't know what to do.",22Aug2020,1

492,"Hello Reddit, I am currently a 2nd year law school student.

It was never my dream to become a lawyer. It was my parents'. We are not rich, so my becoming a successful lawyer would significantly improve our lives. 

The thing is, I am not happy with this career path. I've always had a penchant for the arts, the very antithesis of the pragmatism of law. I often envy my classmates whose inspiration is their ambition to fight for justice, etc., whereas I, unhappily and tediously, do it for the prospect of money. Call it valiant, but I call it sad.

Now this particular battle I've debated with myself for years now. I've long realized that this kind of dilemma is a problem of privilege. I cannot possibly leave this career path just for the sake of my own happiness. There's no money in art, especially in a third world country like mine. It would be selfish to quit. 

I guess what I'm trying to ask is, how do I ground myself to this monotonous reality, especially during those fleeting times when I just want to give up and run away to the big city and pursue art? (This will never happen btw, just a recurring daydream.) I've been drilling into myself for years now this mantra of ""do it for your parents and for your little sisters"" that it's taken a huge toll on me. 

I'm not asking to be convinced to quit law school. I'm asking to be be convinced to hold on in spite of myself.",22Aug2020,1
493,"I’ve (29/M) been this way ever since I was around 14 due to LOTS of trauma but it’s never really gone away. I don’t feel love and I don’t really care for anyone including my parents. 

I spend the majority of my time alone by choice, and when I’m around people it doesn’t take much for me to really wish they’d just go away. Im insanely detached from people and i just want it to stop. I feel like I’m seeing the world in 3rd person, like I’m going with the motions but I’m not really present. 

If I just say the right words and do the things that are deemed normal, I won’t draw too much negative attention. I haven’t dated since 2013 (but I’m definitely the hookup and leave type), I live in my van, and I purposely seek places that are far far away from people (all by choice btw). I make decent money and I could easily get an apartment, but then I’d be around people 24/7 so vanlife has worked out VERY well for me for the past 3 years. 

I’m not violent. I’m actually the polar opposite. I don’t watch porn at all or indulge in movies or tv shows much. I spend the majority of my day just working on my computer, skateboarding in empty/abandoned parking lots, and working out vigorously at playgrounds after dark (once everyone’s gone.)

500,"Weird situation I need advice on...

Im gonna start by saying I’m a bicurious guy and have realized this the past few years. Never acted on it though and everybody thinks I am only into women.

There’s a guy I met a few months ago through mutual friends. There was a party at his house and I was only introduced to him briefly and he was really drunk. So the next time I saw him I didn’t expect him to remember my name and hug me. Since then we became really good friends. We moved to California with another friend of ours last month. He’s a real ladies man, when we were back home he would have sex with multiple girls a week and doesn’t really have to try much to get girls. He always talks about girls and how many he’s been with. He’s super good looking, great body and amazing heart and personality.

I always had a hint he might be bi because around the time I first met him, somebody was talking about him to a friend of ours and I was only a few feet away, and he said he grabbed him or touched him in a way that made him uncomfortable. Other hints over time were certain things like a few weeks ago we just went out one night out of boredom and rode electric scooters. We stopped at an intersection and I wasn’t looking towards him and he put his face real close to mine like he was gonna kiss me. I felt him closer to me but never looked his way. There were just a lot of subtle hints until the past week.

A few days ago we were in the car with friends and it was just me and him in the back seat. He asked me to pass him a puff bar so I did and he took a hit of the vape and put his head on my shoulder. I waited like 5 seconds for him to move his head but he didn’t so I kind of rested my head on his and we did that for a few minutes and our friends in the front didn’t notice. Then last night we were on the swing on our patio listening to music and he started cuddling up to me. Put his head on my shoulder and we stayed like that for about 30 mins. The past few days he’s been talking about astrology and asked me what my sign is and he mentioned twice today about how our signs are most compatible for each other in a relationship. Also he said my name in his sleep twice this week.

Whether he’s interested in me or not, I’m gonna let him keep making the moves because I’d rather accept his advances than make one towards him and get denied.

But in your opinion, does it sound like he might be interested in me?",22Aug2020,1
501,"Okay, first things first, I'm at least self aware I'm not the best person out there. I've been called a bad influence by my friends' parents before. I don't light things on fire or fight people or anything like that lol, I'm never violent. It's just that I can't control my cursing habit and my opinions seem a little weird sometimes, I think. (Just think I don't really support anything at all, but some things I do take a side for if I feel it's right, but I'm generally too careless.) 

Anyway, my best friend sees me as their role model. They haven't done anything I do that I would consider bad. They always reach out to me for advice, my advice seems to help them. They also reach out to me for mild emotional support. I talk over things with them, and I know I handle that well. But I some how get worried what if I say a wrong advice and steer them down the wrong path? I'm probably just overthinking lol, but I don't know.

I see them as a sibling and want them safe. I'm kind of like a second parent to all my friends. I'm pretty mature when it comes to giving advice and support, yet I'm here. I've always told my friends if I ever say something that makes them uncomfortable, to just tell me, I'd never get mad, I'd feel horrible if I found out they were feeling that way. I also find it challenging that I contrast greatly compared to my friends. My best friend is very religious, I'm not religious at all, I don't want to rub off on them or anything. It's completely fine to be religious and I've told all my friends this. One of my friends asked for my view on religion and I told them. It messed with their head and they questioned reality for awhile lol, I told them it's okay. It's just that this was a time i felt I was a bad influence for an example.

505,"Hey everybody! 

So i'm in a serious pickle right now and i'm searching for any kind of advice. (Excuse my english, i'm an estonian). So, i'm a 25 year old gender fluid girl who was in a relationship with my soulemate for 3 years. i know him over 15 years. and i know he is my soulmate, bc when we where kids, he was my brothers best friend. we didn't make contact then. some years past and we always where in the same room, but never talked. then he was a friend of my current boyfriend and baby daddy. still didn't make any contact. and then couple of months after my baby daddy dumped me and i went to my cousins place and he was there. we talked, drank and watched a movie. then one night stand happened. i always liked him, but on that night i felt something i never have felt. i wanted to be with him, but he didn't want me. Couple of months passed again and we where on a birthday, i got drunk and wanted him, he stood me up and i was so hurt. but when the morning came i wanted to see the sunrise and went on walk. i found him sitting in a chair and watching sunrise. i sat in his lap and we kissed. that was it for 8years. after eight years when my a year long toxic relationship ended, I was about to end my life, but i felt that someone right is here for me and he's really near. 

And then it happened.. we met again. went on a coffee, witch lasted about 12hours (all night talking). the next day, same thing happened and we where together for 3 and a half years. 

We had a fun relationship, he always made me laugh so hard a little pee came out. we didn't have a lot of conflicts but when we did I yelled and he cried. he is a calm person who doesn't like to shout or scream. but he's a person who doesn't show emotions. And I was a person who searched for deeper meaning in everything and wanted to control every aspect of my life, including him.  And that were because I didn't accept uncertainty (I grew up in a chaotic and aggressive household, got beaten and basically raped by my father) . One day he had enough of my behavior (emotionally unstable, control freak, loud, obnoxious etc). 

It's been 3 months of constant self improvement, constantly trying to be a best version of me and everything. We still talk a little, he knows I'm never letting go of him. because I took a vow to love and cherish him for the rest of my life. 

But he's in a place where he doesn't believe me, that i have changed and still am changing. He ignores me, blocked me. and basically doesn't accept the fact that I'm doing this for me and for him. 

I'm a budhist and my awakening has been the best thing in my life 5years ago. I was stupid to let me  subconscious impulsive behavior and thoughts take control of my mind and life. And it's never going to happen again. 

Now you know the story behind my pain and I'm asking for advice: 

How can I get him to trust me and my change? how can I make him see, that I have learned from my mistakes and from the lessons the Universe have thrown in my path? 

I am so grateful for every little advice you can give to me.

Hello everyone, i had this issuses for years now and it comes on my mind from time to time. It seems like everyone is moving on and I am still stuck. I mean my life is great, I have a wonderful girlfriend, good friends and a direction to head to. But still from time to time i feel super nostalgic and sad. Yesterday something happend that really mad me see that i got a big problem with forgetting stuff that happend in the past.

I had a dream with one of my exes (nothing sexual, just her being there), woke up and felt super hurt that I don't see her anymore. It's not like I'm not happy with my current gf, i really love her and enjoy every day with her. It's just this feeling of knowing that you won't have that time back.

There are a few more things like this which make me feel that way. I feel like I have to clear all that stuff up and have to talk to all those people who I ""lost"".

Online school is even worse for me since I also have adhd and struggle to concentrate outside the classroom. I only have one semester left so starting again in the spring won’t affect my graduation year since I am meant to be graduating early. I just don’t know what to do ? Should I go back and at least try and take a leave of absence if I can’t handle it or should I withdraw now or just go back",22Aug2020,1
510,"For the past 7 years my mom has been verbally, physically, and emotionally abusive towards me. She still is in multiple ways just not as physical as she used to be. 

For some background here’s a list of examples:

• She tried to beat me in the head with a pot cover, then when I ripped her shirt she called the police on me and lied and told them I was mentally ill

• In 3rd grade she lied and told my teacher I tried to call CPS on her, my teacher then went to school the next day and told the entire class what my mom said. 8 year old me sat there confused and embarrassed because that wasn’t true. 

• She told me to commit suicide/sell myself for money 

• Told me and my 5 year old sister she wished she had a boyfriend who would rape us so we wouldn’t want to be around her anymore. 

• She texted me in the middle of class in 8th grade and told me she had contacted a group home and that she was sending me there when I got home. Because I didn’t clean my room. I had a panic attack and ran out the class. 

• At 8 years old I was punched in the stomach and struck in the face for not wanting to go to school

And among many other things. 

Our relationship goes up and down every other month, one minute everything is fine, the next it’s not. We have talked about this about 2 months ago and instead of me finding some closure with our discussion I still harbor feelings of anger because she proves to me that she is not a changed person and never will be. She has this personal animosity towards me to which I have never understood until about now. My mom has her nice moments, but overall she is miserable, and I believe that she like myself also harbors feelings of anger deep down inside of her probably due to her rough childhood or whatever else she’s going through. Which is why she’s such a mean person with a short temper.


I am tired. I am mentally drained and the anger grows everyday, I don’t want this feeling anymore but it’s hard. I can’t get rid of her until I’m 18 and it feels like a decade from now. I want peace, I want genuine happiness, I am depressed and fortunately the desire to kill myself has went away but I’m afraid it may come back. I don’t want that at all. I want to live, I want to be happy and really mean it. I know what I’m asking for may sound impossible since I have no way of escaping her for now but I’m willing to try. I know for sure that I don’t want to still be angry even after I’ve cut her out of my life. I can’t let my life be taken over by anger and rage just like it has taken over my moms. I need peace or else I won’t be able to move forward. 


Please, any piece of advice would be appreciated.",22Aug2020,1
512,"Hello, I (19M) am a teen with an identity crisis, first let me take you to my past. When I was 4 me and my family moved to America I lived there till I was 9, when we returned to my country (Saudi Arabia) I had a culture shock for example, when I was in USA the schools had boys and girls and such but in KSA it’s totally different boys are separated from girls. it’s even scary to talk to a women because she will probably call the police for just speaking to her. So it’s stuff like this that alienated me from everything and everyone. At school at home even to my own family I never talk and when I do Iam afraid. I believe in god and I believe in my religion, but it can be hard to believe in sometimes. I am bringing this up because all my life I have stuck myself with TV shows, movies and YouTube as they were my whole life and I see how people fall in love and stuff like that which I want I want to build a relationship I want to build a life with a women and eventually get married. When I told my mother she threw a fit about how crazy I sound and how Movies and tv shows warped my mind. She said that once I finish uni she will have a wife for me but I don’t want that I want to build a relationship first, but I can’t because my religion and country won’t allow me. This sucks because I have no one in my life to talk to I have no friends no family my age and I feel like i am in a bubble I can’t get out because of fear.
.

I know real life isn’t like the Tv and movies I watch, I just want to feel real love if you feel me.

Iam sorry for making this longer than it should I just want to get this out of my chest. Also sorry for being unorganized I am really emotional right now.",22Aug2020,1
513,"So from late October-early December of 2019 my long distance boyfriend and I were on a break and at the time had no intentions of getting back together. At the time we decided to stay friends with benefits and we talked more than we did in the few months prior to the breakup. We were on the phone constantly, every night and I felt like we had been connecting more. About week after we broke up when we were talking everyday he wasn’t responding for about an hour from 10pm-11pm and he called me after saying he wants cuddles. I knew he had been with someone and he admitted it. I didn’t handle the situation very gracefully but we went through with the trip for thanksgiving and got back together. I think he may have been with someone on Halloween too but he may have just been at work I don’t know but he’s never corrected me when I brought up that he slept with only that person that one time. He ended up blocking the girl and all the other ones he was talking to and I thought that was the end of it. I didn’t think about it for months and then about a month or two ago i started thinking about it. Why did he do it? Was he so desperate to get rid of me initially that he couldn’t even wait a full week? Was our sex bad? What did they do? Was it more than once and he’s sparing my feelings? What does she look like? Is she prettier than me?

On our last visit I had a moment and said “well clearly if the sex was good with her you wouldn’t have gotten back together with me.” And he said “Our relationship is more than just sex.” My brain interpreted it as he liked it more with her and I feel so immature about the whole situation tbh. I know you can enjoy sex with more than one person and I know we were broken up but it still felt like a betrayal of sorts since we were talking constantly and he called me directly after. I wish he would’ve just said something else to ease my mind. I had some jealousy issues in the past but I worked through them I though and now they’re flairing back up.

I keep telling myself he chose to be with me and that’s what matters. We’re moving in together and he’s chosen to do that with me. We’re buying a house together and he chose to do that with me. He loves me. But my mind still can’t get all these negative thoughts out of my head. I’m not going to break up with him and I don’t like to bring up the situation (I’ve only talked to him about it 3 times) but how do I cope with this? I want to get over this so bad and with all the progress I made working through my jealousy issues this feels like so many steps back, except instead of being angry I just get this feeling in the pit of my stomach and I get really upset. Should I just suck it up and ask him why he did it?",22Aug2020,1

516," Seeking honest advice and input.

Is it okay for guys to want or even enjoy getting piggyback rides from a girl? I'm apparently on that boat. Yesterday a friend of mine I met earlier this week at a college group came to my place of work. We chatted, she mentioned she did football in high school and we both mentioned that we like to weight lift. So we asked how much we can; dead-lift, squat, bench, leg press, etc. After that, I said, ""You're pretty strong. You could probably squat me on your back or piggyback me if you wanted to."" She said, ""I probably could."" Then I asked, ""Want to try?"" She then laughed and said, ""Right now?"" I said sure if you want to, she said that she didn't care. So I jumped on her back, she squatted me then asked if she like to walk around for a little bit...so she did just that. After that was done I asked her how that was she said it wasn't too bad or anything. I asked if she like to try that again if one of us ever brought it up. She said, ""Maybe.""

P.S. In case you're wondering, I offered her one in return however, she said she is skeptical about getting on peoples' backs. She said she doesn't mind giving them but she has a problem receiving them.

My question is was she just laughing because it was pretty funny, was she uncomfortable, or did it just surprise her? Also, again is it okay for a guy to want one or enjoy receiving one or them from a girl.",22Aug2020,1

OP: Serious question, why are you friends with me?
F: I don’t have time for people being suicidal rn OP 
OP: damn just answer (I never confront people,  it's a problem)
F: 😳 (not sure if you can see the emoji)
OP: We've been friends for almost 4 years and you have nothing to say about why that is
F: Bro you suicidal or sum?
OP: no I was legit just asking you a question

I know that she's probably toxic but we've exchanged secrets, we have inside jokes, we've had lots of good times and I don't know I'm just scared of losing her even though I have other friends who are way more supportive who I've been friends with for a shorter time.

519,"Hello. Looking for some advice about whether I should stay or quit an internship that will look great on my resume, but the problem is I am horrible with deadlines and have a lot of course pressure.

I am a final year undergraduate, and I got a chance to do an internship with a top school in my country. But I also have tons of coursework and extra classes I cannot back out of. Also, I am horrible at time management. Hence, I have been getting bad scores at my internship and classes. Which is all my fault, really. I am working on it. I have terrible mood swings and anxiety, almost paralysing, and it makes me not able to do my best on most days. 

Also, I feel really guilty, about not giving my best, because every other student at this internship does like twice the work I do. I feel like a burden to my guides. I really want to continue the internship, but I feel like I can't manage, at my current circumstances. My guides at this place and my professors back in uni have been really kind and understanding, but I do not want to trouble them with mediocrity.

521,"My ex and I broke up a while back. We were together for almost a year before that, with ups and downs.

During the lockdown we talked everyday. We were having ""sex"" regularly on video. She seemed really into it.

A few day before the lockdown ended she said she cannot be in a relationship with me anymore because she could not trust me to not be with other girls while we are away. She could not trust me to not fuck some other girl during LOCKDOWN while I loved her with all my hearth.

I said ok and ignored her as I figgured she would come around. She did. We talked for a bit after a few days and I told her that I have done only one thing that would have upset her in the meantime. She said the same thing and asked what mine was.

I told her I bought a game. She didn't want me to throw away money on stuff like that.

She told me she went over to her bestfriend's and there was a guy that we both knew wanted to have a relationship with her since he told that to her bestfriend.  That happened just in a few days after we broke up and the lockdown ended. While I was playing the stupid game I bought she was playing, a game I only installed and got good at because she liked it and we could play together, with that guy.

Perhaps it sounds very petty but that really hurt.

I was very upset and mad and I didn't wanna see her again so I burned that bridge.

After some time passed I still missed her a lot so I tried messaging but I was blocked.

We had some group chats that we were in together, I kicked everyone out and told her I wanted to talk. I got a video of the stupid face of that guy at some party from her account. She has almost never let me touch her phone.

He told me he would cut me or some shit if I don't leave his girlfriend alone. I could've easily found him and kick his ass but I didn't. That was the last time I tried talking to her

After that a girl told me some time ago that they were together and went on a trip to the sea together. She also told me I should move on.

I still have our framed photo on my bookshelf and the letter that she wrote me beside it. It is the first thing I see everyday when I wake up to feed my cat.

I feel ashamed that after all this I still post love letters for her on my tumblr, which I'm pretty sure she is lurking, and shitpost on my facebook and instagram telling her I still love her.

While I am confident the guy is beneath me in every way imaginable I still feel defeated and betrayed.

I am sorry for the long context. I am wondering what I should do and wether or not I have done the right things. But most of all I am glad I was able to put it all down into writing like this. I would love to hear your opinion and advice.

Have a great day and thank you",22Aug2020,1

523,"Ok so i was driving home from class and a cop whipped around behind me as i approached a light. He waits until I get to the light and wait through the whole light for it to turn green. Then AFTER i start driving, turns his lights on. I was about to veer onto the highway so instead I continued straight looking for a safe place to pull over that wasn’t in front of the highway exit or entrance for my personal safety. There were two dark bridges also between the distance so as a black female I definitely wasn’t stopping there, especially in today’s climate. The cop had to have seen me constantly breaking hesitating to find a place to pull over but decided to turn his fucking alarms on and yell for me to pull over on the speaker as if I wasn’t clearly trying to find a space to. I pulled into the first turn which led to a restaurant parking lot. I pulled into a space as to not stop traffic. At this point i’m MAYBE .2 miles from when he initially turned his lights on IF that.

He pulls up behind my car (so i am stuck in the corner parking space) and approaches my window asking why i didn’t pull over. I told him I’m not from here and was getting on the highway so I just continued straight and found a place to pull in and wasn’t pulling over under a dark bridge or by a highway. I feel I have the right to ensure my safety by finding a safe (and public) space. He tells me I don’t have that right and had to pull over immediately where he wanted me to??? Then pokes his head in my window and peeks around asking if ai have weapons in the car?? I said what the fuck? um no and argued that I didn’t feel safe stopping by the highway and he argued back claiming he wasn’t going to argue with me at which point I’m irritated and say “then don’t. stop arguing and just tell me why you pulled me over”. He then continues to bicker about where I pulled over rather than stating why i was pulled over in the first place.

He said it was for running a stop sign. I didn’t run the stop sign because I was following someone and had I run it, I would have hit her in front of me. Either that or she would have run it too. But I definitely stopped. We argue some more. I give him my ID and he asks if I have my insurance on me. I said no. He asked if I have insurance. I said yes. He tells me it’s illegal to drive without insurance. I said I just told you I have insurance I just don’t have the card on me, I’ll bring it to court. He asks again about my insurance and I told him to go run my fucking information because I already answered his question multiple times now.

While he’s back at his car I facetime my friend and catch a glimpse of another man to my left (driver window). Another officer had arrived and parked his car behind me, and was standing to my left completely blocking me into the corner parking space.  I asked him what he was doing standing a few feet from my window just staring at me. He said he’s “doing his job”. I ask what job that is exactly and why he is guarding me... He says he’s not guarding me he’s just “watching over me”. I said are those words not synonymous? He argued they weren’t so I pulled up dictionary.com and proved him wrong. He couldn’t justify why he was staring at me so I asked him to look away and stare at my car or something because he’s making me feel uncomfortable. I explained the situation that I am a young woman and 2 grown men quite literally trapped me into the corner of a parking lot alone and I feel uncomfortable having him just stare at me. I said I feel it’s bordering sexual harassment. He said “i don’t care you sound stupid i’m going to keep looking at you”. At this point i’m increasingly upset as a victim of sexual assault. I begin passive aggressively saying mean things about him to my friend on facetime while he snickers and calls me dumb.

The other officer eventually comes back with a ticket (20 minutes later not sure why it would EVER take that long). He wrote me a ticket for the stop sign and 2 warnings- 1 for expired tags and 1 for failure to yield. I explained I got a ticket a few weeks ago and the officer told me because of covid closings, it was fine as long as I got them by the end of the month. And i’d already explained the yielding. We argue and then he asks for my phone number to write on the ticket. I uncomfortably asked why he needed my phone number for a traffic stop as I’ve never been asked that before. He says in case the courts need to contact me. I said they have access to my information and can send me a formal letter in the mail if they have to reach me. After already voicing I felt sexually harassed, there was NO REASON he needed my phone number. He smugly says “i’ll just write refused”. I ask if all the information i’ll need for court is on the ticket. He says yes and I reply I’ll see i’m there bright and early with a sarcastic smile and he says “me too with the video”.

Aside from the obvious fact that the whole thing was petty, I cannot get over the way I was treated. First of all, why are you peeking your head into my car? WITHOUT A MASK DURING A PANDEMIC. How is that not fucking assault? Should be attempted murder really. At the very least trespassing like what the fuck? Secondly, the other officer had no need to stare at me. A uniform should not justify harassment. And I made it clear I felt sexually harassed, even if he didn’t intend it that way. How do I not reserve the right to pull over where I fee safe? Yeah fucking right. It’s not like I drove miles away I was literally on the same road. I could clearly look back and see the traffic light he turned his lights on at.

I know I sound dramatic but the whole situation just didn’t feel right. There is no way this was okay....",22Aug2020,1

The jist is, I have several personal and family issues, in addition, my high school grades came bad and most of my school friends stabbed me in the back. After struggling with things, I decided to actually become an adult and improve.

I built a routine, started practicing a healthy way to get back up but after all that and a gap year, I've managed to not get far, almost as if I'm back at square 1. I managed to get into the cs program in a good uni and since I didn't have a good background in programming, I decided to learn everything I could during the pandemic.

Fast forward to now, I basically know very fewfundamental stuff about programming, I haven't been able to stick to my routine and grow myself into a better person, totally wasted my gap year and now, knowing that my classes start soon, I'm fearing that unlike my other classmates, I'm gonne be far behind since everyoneelse utilized their time. I'm gonna eventually fall into depression if my grades take a hit and I'm gonna suffer.

From my point of view, I can pinpoint My main problems down to two things, lacking a mindset to be resilient and almost zero self discipline.

It's like a cycle, I suffer, decide to do something, don't do it due to no self discipline, get inundated with goals and deadlines to meet, I fail to achei6ve them, get anxious, panick, wallow in self pity and repeat. It's a toxic cycle and I'm on the brink of just breaking.

I still have time to atleast get some stuff done before uni to be ahead but this anxiety is killing me. And on top of that, I have a few other problems that I need to handle, either myself or by taking help from friends, but that's for another day. 

Do you think I have a chance at redemption? No I'm not seeking self validation, I'm genuinely lost and need advice.

I don’t exactly want to talk to my mom about it because it’s kind of embarrassing so I really need opinions. 

An overview of some stuff he did: he more than once shook my hand and it lingered way more than usual. Once, I asked him about a test mark and he held my hand and walked to his desk. I had no idea what to do, so I basically did nothing. 

When he would correct my notebook, he would draw like a heart next to his corrections. He even wrote my name in his book (in front of me). 

We had a school party and when I came, he looked me up and down and told me how good I looked. I felt really weirded out. 

There was this one time where he gave us a free period in class to correct our tests and I was feeling a bit tired, so he called me to his desk, made me sit in his place, and hovered over me to tell him what was going on. Proceeded to ask if it was about my mark in the test and added more marks. There wasn’t anything actually wrong with me. 

Oh and I remember this one time where he put his hand around my shoulder and called me his soulmate in front of a classmate. I was so flustered.

She lives all alone, I think she is divorced, and she has 2 or 3 daughters, whom also have 4-6 kids a piece ranging between 10 years old to newborns. We never really see her family come and visit. We do know that she is frequently asked to come and babysit the newborns, often overnight, and sleep on the couch. She comes home exhausted after a couple nights. 

She used to be able to drive, but her car broke and she can’t afford to get it fixed. So we usually bring her grocery shopping with us or we will pick her up a few things if she calls. She does not work, and I don’t know if she has state health insurance, or any insurance. She has always expressed concern that she is super broke, and she may get kicked out of her apartment and have to live in welfare housing. Her daughters refuse to help her out. 

Now. We live in the desert. It gets to be about 115 (F) degrees here. I guess one of her daughter’s houses air conditioning broke, and “one specific company needs to replace one part on it, because of a warranty.” And this supposedly happened over a month ago. This daughter and her whole family have been coming to stay the night, every night, in my neighbor’s one bedroom apartment. That’s right, she brings her kids, too. So there are now 7 people staying in this tiny little place, for over a month. They are extremely rude and they litter all over our shared staircase. They are loud, and my neighbor has expressed that her grandkids “hate her because she disciplines them.” We know that the kids frequently shuffle between daycare, relatives, their home, and our neighbor’s apartment; and their parents work during the day. 

Yesterday we got a call from our neighbor, asking if we had any cough drops. As you know, our pandemic situation is not going well here, so I rushed downstairs with some cough drops and some Tylenol cold and flu that we had. Guys, the woman is so sick. She could barely talk or breathe when I went to check on her. I immediately got in my car and b-lined for the pharmacy, and bought 2 more bags of cough drops and 2 more boxes of Tylenol. Along with some Sprite and soup. I came back with my mask, gave her the goods, and ran back upstairs to disinfect and shower. 

Low and behold, we went to pick up dinner last night, and we came back, and the whole family is here at her apartment again, even though she is sicker than a dog. They’re outside having popsicles and throwing their wrappers all over my staircase. They have their roller skates on outside at 9:00pm in the dark. No one seems to care that this poor woman is sick because of them, and that she desperately needs a COVID test and rest. I refuse to be the one to have to drive her to a test, as it should be her family who has stayed there and got her sick. They’re in her apartment running up the electric bills and A/C. I have a feeling no one is going to help this poor woman. 

Do you have any advice? Should I get involved? I know it’s a family matter, but now you’re littering all over my stairs. It’s not my business, I just want to help this poor lady. We’ve developed such a great relationship over the year that we’ve known her. What would you guys do?",22Aug2020,1
535,"I honestly don't know which subreddit to post this in so I'm posting it here. Two days earlier, I found one of my friend's self harm twitter and I was honestly unprepared. And I want to support her and help her but I don't know how so maybe a little bit of advice?",22Aug2020,1
537,I’m 18m and she is 18f she just went to college 4 1/2 hours away and I’m afraid she’s slowly going to become distant and I become just a friend to her and I’m wondering if I can do anything about this feeling she says that she won’t forget about me just I struggle to trust that.,22Aug2020,1
538,"My (23f) ex (29m) broke up about a month ago. I initiated the break up but he was being extremely cold and mean to me in the days/weeks leading up to it. He was likely planning on breaking up, but I don’t know how long he was going to wait. When I did break up with him he couldn’t care less. We lived together and I just moved out a week ago. So we were still living together for a few weeks after the break up, but we were being friendly and nice. Unfortunately we did continue to have sex. I don’t regret it because I knew it wasn’t going to continue, just while I was trying to find a place to live. But, I knew I wasn’t sleeping with anyone else. He probably did the day after we broke up. So that’s not a fun feeling. 

I totally understand that he is an ex and I SHOULDN’T care, but that is much easier said than done. He is dating another girl (might possibly be his ex, they were texting while we were together) and I found out. When he was being cold and distant while we were still together, was he already dating her? If she’s just a rebound it wouldn’t hurt so much because I get it, we all have needs. I can rationalize that. What I can’t rationalize is how I was a great girlfriend and I did so much, I did everything and got nothing but abuse in return. I know I should have been smart and left as soon as the abuse began, but I was scared and trapped. I’m happy that I am out of this relationship. But obviously I’m still caught up in it because I care that he has another girlfriend. It just makes me feel like shit about myself because he presumably left me for someone else and/or cheated on me. I know this is stupid and I don’t want to be hurt by this.",22Aug2020,1
539,"For a long time now (probably around when the pandemic started) I’ve been getting dreams where I try to wake up, but only end up dreaming of waking up. It’ll happen over and over before I actually wake up for real and I will awaken feeling pretty freaked out or stressed. It frustrates me because it has been so long since I’ve had a good nights sleep. I wouldn’t call them nightmares because they aren’t necessarily scary but they will almost always have something that I get creeped out by or something I feel uncomfortable about in them like a weird looking alien, being in a boat on choppy water or some sort of supernatural thing. They feel semi-lucid too, as in I can sort of feel things in the dreams but can’t control them. Sometimes it makes me not want to sleep at all, but I know sleep deprivation will only make it worse. 

Does anyone know anything I can do to try and get a better nights sleep and possibly avoid dreams like this? I know it’s probably impossible to choose what you dream about, but I’d like to know if there’s anything I can do to help me sleep better.",22Aug2020,1
540,I am looking to join the army and I’ve wanted to since I was little but my school specifically my principle is refusing to release to school’s ASVAB scores. This has been happening for years but at some point she will hand them over. But this year it seems like that will be the case. I’ve been requesting my scores and my transcript since April. They were able to give other student transcripts but not me.the school would ignore my emails and phone calls. On the first day of school (this Monday) I went to the school in person and the admin gave me an email. What I was I revived a different email then those who ask for their transcripts too. I am sick and tried of being blown off. I’m tired of constantly begging to them. I’m retaking the ASVAB at the recruiting office.  This is unfair to any student being denied their ASVAB score. The some thing  happened to my boyfriend last year and other classmates. There has to be some law prohibiting this or something.,22Aug2020,1
541,"I'm in highschool and I don't really get any privacy. My mom makes me give her the password to my accounts like Instagram and my gmail account. She constantly checks up on what I'm liking/saving and dms on Instagram as well as my gmail account. I don't even know why she does this though. It's not like I'm an idiot who's going to go talk tot a random stranger on the internet. 

If she sees something she doesn't like she'll come to me about it, but not in the most understanding way. I don't really intentionally do anything wrong, especially when it comes to this. She always assumes the worst. I don't really do anything with bad intentions but that's how she sees it. It gives me a lot of anxiety because I never know what she might have a problem with so it makes me not want to do anything at all.

I've explained how she gives me anxiety and all of that before. I even get scared to ask her for something or to do something because I think she might get mad, when I explained that to her she basically told me I should be scared to ask her. I've also explained how I'd like privacy but she finds stuff that I and my dad sees at fine but she sees it as not fine therefore she can't trust me and let me have privacy.

I'm pretty much stressed all the time because of this. I can either not live my life or I can live it but never know what she'll be upset about next, I feel like this also holds me back from creativity for some reason. I've tried to explain to her and so has my dad but she thinks that if she wasn't like this that would make her a bad parent. I never feel like I can actually talk to her about anything without her getting upset. I told her she was strict and how it makes me feel and she doesn't seem to care. I feel like when I get older it'll be like this weight is lifted off of my shoulders but I know I'm still going to be constantly bothered by her. 

I just don't know what to do at this point because it makes me depressed and makes me feel like everyone is so much better than me because there parents let them live their life without having their parents on their backs all the time.",22Aug2020,1
542,"The way he talks, just doesn’t seem like the way he does it now. I hope I’m not doing anything wrong. I have a tendency to overreact and immediately go to the worst possible scenario, so I could be overthinking. But if I’m not, what do I do?",22Aug2020,1
543,"Hi

I(16M) recently went through my "" journal"" and discovered the unexpectedly big amount of quotes like : ""still hating my life"" or ""my life sucks"" or ""fml"". I have always been kind of sad most of my times but didnt acknowledge it since know.

I took an online test for depression and got only a 8/27 so now i dont know if i am just sad became of beeing a teenager or i am depressed. 


I had a lot of bad stuff happen in my life in the past 3-4 years.
For example: i got bullied because of my hieght (150cm) in 5th grade, my parents arguing since my childhood and feeling not understanded by my family. Also i hate most of my traits(fisical and moral) and i tear up when i remember the good times 1-4th grade when everything was normal and fine.

My mom is a good person but she can be emotionally manipulative. She once said she wants to die because of me(that was 1+ year ago and it still hits me hard) so it is hard for me to feel that much close to her even if i try.

My dad is a cool guy abd we get a long most of the times. In the times where we dont get along we mostly argue and whatever i say to support my point i never win. This is leafing me to never say something against his poont of view as it will just spiral into an argument.

My best friend of 12 years told me 2 months ago I am boring and that he doesnt like hanging out with me which hit my like shitstorm because i thought of our friendship as ok and nothing bad going on. He later apologised but its tlnot yhe same.

By the 3 stories above you can deduct i dont feel really loved. I dream of having somebody to like me for who i am and understand me (i know it'll sound cringe but i refer to a girlfriend) but i am small ugly and when i got a chance in the past the girl i met was actually living in another city like 100km away or more.

And yeah... I dont know.",22Aug2020,1
544,"I don’t want to make this too long, but this guy I’m dating goes on these angry long-winded rants about how he feels about certain things politically and it is starting to take a toll on me. He is great otherwise, but it’s his fixation on politics and how strongly he feels about certain things that is really starting to get to me; despite trying to politely bring up the fact that this is not all I care to talk about 24/7, he will still go on these insane rants that can last an hour over the phone or he’ll type out a novel over text that takes me 15 minutes to read. He has apologized before and admitted that he gets a bit too passionate, but it still doesn’t stop. And he’ll bring up the same damn points, such as how much he hates the radical left, “stupid liberals”, communism, and “rich spoiled white liberal kids” and I don’t think he understands how belligerent he sounds at times, and it makes me tense and uncomfortable, and furthermore I find it draining to talk about nearly all the time. It’s pretty much every day, he will find some way to shift a normal mundane conversation into an angry political rant and sometimes I really have to suppress the urge to be like will you just shut the hell up!!

549,"Hey (insert persons name). don't know if it's okay to make a post in search of advice, but I've just had a very interesting encounter and now I am feeling confused. My question is that do we have to hate and feel disgusted by people who do bad things or did bad things, but who are actually good people though they are misguided? I'm asking because I was on youtube and stumbled upon an interview with someone who had worked in the sex industry (Mia Khalifa, it was the interview with Anthony Padilla from Smosh) but who was now opening up about how they had been manipulated and tricked into it. Out of sympathy I started to see them in a different light, but my husband tells me I should not follow this person and also now questions my loyalty to him. I have no interest in viewing the ''work'' of this person, and merely was surprised and sympathetic from hearing their story. Am I wrong for not hating this person who used to work in the sex industry? Do we as muslims need to hate people like this? 😕 I'm just feeling very confused and don't know whether I am now completely in the wrong. My husband was telling me that I have no fear for God I lost God and so on. I don't think I agree with what he is saying... I'm not trying to do anything bad, I just stumbled upon the video and it opened my eyes to her perspective. Idk, maybe I am just also very misguided. What do you guys think?

Please do not judge, be harsh or laugh, please be serious because I actually want and need help.

Under 18 = Please leave.
___

So for a while I've had a kink for masdurbating or being naked outdoors. I just love the feeling it gives me, the feeling of total freedom, the breeze on my genitals, the excitement of getting caught. It started off with watching public porn videos but now I've been trying to experiment for it myself. (I do not masturbate in front of people or too people in person thankfully)

It hasn't been that long, only two or three weeks a few  times. I normally go out late at night, 12am - 3am when nobody's around. So aside from liking the feeling.. I really want to stop. I don't want to get caught, labeled as a pervert or anything. Get a fucking record.

Today I was going to masturbate in the front yard, I got my things ready and then all of sudden my neighbour catches me. Fuck. I got up as quick as I could (I was dressed at this moment thankfully) and pretended I was looking around on the floor for something. I'm pretty sure he's not dumb though. Normally he says hi and we talk but he said nothing and kept walking. Mind you this neighbour lives in the same house as me. Its a shared home with two other people. I was sure everyone was in their rooms and I was the only one up but nope..

Fuck I want to stop and I want to resist the urge and thrill to masturbate outside because if I keep it up one day I'm going to get caught naked and.. fuck I don't even wanna think about that.

What the fuck am I meant to do when I see that neighbour again? Act like it never happened or something? Fucking hell hope he doesn't know and I hope to god he doesn't tell the rental manager.

Anyway, I really want help and I want to stop doing this.  P L E A S E",22Aug2020,1

I work in IT as a Desktop Support Technician in Illinois at a hospital. I’m a sub-contractor to the hospital and my company supports all of the hospital’s sites.

My company is currently looking for my position for the a hospital site that is closer to my home and would total the drive roughly to an hour in total for there and back. I left this company almost a month ago and came back due to the new job not being what I thought it was. My job took me back in a heartbeat and I’m grateful. They even gave me a raise when I came back. My manager is the best and I know for a fact he appreciates me. I’ve done a really good job at site my current site (the site wasn’t doing well before I came onboard). Would I be asking to much to request a transfer to the closer site? The drive sucks and takes a toll for enjoyment at my job. I also have had 3 instances where I’ve had car trouble (drive an old beater). I feel the closer site would bring enjoyment again.

I’m now in my early 20s and finally figured out a business idea and strategy that has worked and brings a good income. My sister knows my business has been taking off and wants me to share with her boyfriend my business idea and strategies (so he can do the same thing I’m doing). Due to my traumatic family history I don’t have a close relationship with them. I saw my sister one time last year and we text maybe once every 3 months, the other day she randomly called me and the first question she asked me was “how much money are you making” which I found highly uncomfortable to answer especially since I’m quite a conservative person and asked if she can visit my office with her boyfriend so that her boyfriend can “watch” and learn how I do things and so I could teach him to make what I’m making. (She’s been with her boyfriend for about 4 years and I’ve only met him 3-4 times and he doesn’t really even talk to me which I don’t mind but I don’t consider him anything other than a stranger who’s with my sister). I’ve put so much time, years, risk, trial and error, sweat and tears into this, I’ve lost all my money from some mistakes I’ve made along the way but luckily made it back and I don’t want to be greedy but I worked SOOO hard to just give out my ideas so they can skip all of the “hard work” and just begin to make money off of my business.

And i'll say something along the lines of, ""Gender dysphoria."" And she'll huff and leave me alone.

558,"I live in a condo on the top floor, and I have a developmentally disabled toddler. The only interactive game that he will play is chase, and he likes to run from one room to the next. We recently got new downstairs neighbors (in their mid-60s) and they have complained to us several times about being able to hear us walking around during the day. We don’t wear shoes inside, we have carpeting, we never have gatherings here, and I don’t do exercises in here or make other big/loud movements.

Yesterday my husband told me that the downstairs neighbor came up to him in the parking lot and said he’s concerned about me because he hears me “pacing frantically” around the condo when my husband isn’t home. I find this surprising and offensive. I certainly don’t pace frantically around the condo when my husband isn’t home or any other time.  My son gets therapies (over video/zoom now) in the morning, then naps, then has more therapies in the afternoons (e.g., speech, OT, PT, ECE, ABA, and feeding). I’m not sure what our neighbor is hearing. Maybe me walking from room to room picking up the huge mess when my son naps? My husband told him that I’m fine and that it must be our son running between rooms, but the neighbor said that he can tell the difference between my son moving around and me, and that he was sure I was frantically pacing. I am really bothered because it seems he was trying to tell my husband he thinks I’m crazy.

I don’t know what this neighbor expects us to do - we try to walk softly but the walls are very thin. Honestly, I don’t think that we are doing anything unreasonable, and I think these neighbors should not have moved into a lower floor unit of a multi-family building if they are sensitive to overhead noise. They should insulate their ceiling if they are that disturbed. We already have thick carpet and it’s not like we are moving around at night. Any ideas on how to handle this?",22Aug2020,1

560,"I'm nineteen-years-old and, following the mishap that was my academic year in 2019-2020, I was looking forward to staring anew this year with an IT degree of some sort. The pandemic, on the one hand, that is raging on isn't doing me any favors and, on the other hand, I also have a girlfriend, some two-hundred-fifty miles away from me, with whom I had planned to move in together in the next year or two. She's in her senior year of high school, while I was supposed to start my freshman year (once more), but I have no clue of what to do.

Im very ugly too extremely dark skin and just gross looking which might be why people avoid me. Its like the SpongeBob meme catching the ugly. Its embarrassing honestly its hard to take compliments because I feel how disgusted ppl are with my existence.

My main problem is most people see me as a loser. People refuse to even sit next to me and maybe after talking ti me like me but thats it. I don't like forming relationships because if I'm black I should be able to ""run fast and jump high""(I have been told that by people who wanted to join some of the sports 9n campus). I'm pre med so a lot of my time is spent studying. Despite ppls belief on affirmative action moat black ppl aren't handed shit because we are black. 

What is worse is living in the suburbs and just trying to have ppl respect me. I have to be the best at everything or I'm garbage and I've always been a loser i guess I just thought I would grow out of it. Every relationship I have is always predicated on the fact that I'm some nerd but I really just want to be a doctor. On the other side of it I'm not adverse to drinking or smoking or having fun but I take my studies seriously and people constantly make me feel like a dork for that. They treat me as defective. Im just in my head so much because its impossible for me to feel normal. I literally lef the door of my car ooen yesterday because my head was pounding from just the constant code switching and feel in adequate.

I have had to live this life of racism for being black. Now that I'm an adult im not black enough. I have talked to other black ppl and they told me it is tied with our identity things like gang culture, thievery, and being a general nuisance. When i was younger I acted like that and thought it would make me cool but just seeing how it affected others changed my perception and realistically I did not want to be a statistic. I literally still get followed and watched in stores they even search me sometimes when I leave. Even if I haven't stole something the sensors go off so they can search me. Pretty much I have to deal with being a ""criminal"" because of my skin but am not black enough elsewhere.

I get that its noble to want to face your goals and achieve them but the ride is so bumpy. Everyone treats me like im a fucking gay(I've been told im gay because ive turned down when I was not interested in), loser. A lot of these girls had sex with ex friends and made them miserable do I dodged a bullet but yeah. Life sucks in general. 

I have very strict parents so even though I got invited to hang out with ppl(parties) in highschool I never went because I know my parents would flip. They wouldn't let me talk to girls telling me basically white girls were the devil, despite me going to a private school. I got in trouble a lot in class i never focused always talking just trying to fit that role. I was the funny black guy on the football and track team. When I switched schools I became super quiet and extremely nice. Partially because basketball and football guys made fun of me and called me a school shooter. I made it my mission to be super kind so no-one would say that but I felt so weird. Like the nicer I became the less black I was the more of a dork. The more I tried to focus on school the more I became everything I hated and I kept telling myself its just until I reach my goal of doctor.


I struggled a lot in college and spent so much time studying in hopes of keeping alive a dream I've had since I was 15. I'm still struggling and feel like sacrificing my social life has been stupid because everything failed. I ended up in the ER off a suicide attempt and in a mental hospital. I met someone only to have them tell me my wariness to make friends or have any close ones made me a psycho. I had pushed everyone out of my life prior to trying to kill myself so it's hard. Also, everyone treats me like I can't read a room and tell when ppl don't like me. A positive attitude goes a long way but if ppl don't like you they will try and tear you down so quick its sad. Also the same self awareness to know if someone likes you helps you realize when ppl are upset, angry, or sad.

My parents pray for my likeability and it infuriates me. I know the only person who knows you is you but for fucks sake. What should I do not to be a cool black guy but just to be cool guy. It's not that i don't like to have fun its just i have goals in life. My goals are becoming a doctor having my own money and space and getting far away from my parents. I love them now and appreciate what they've done for me but I need my space to be myself. How can I feel like I'm worth it or valuable? What is the point? Am I dork? 

If you have read this far here are my main issues of incompatibility with most ppl. I don't play video games i wouldn't mind playing with friends but im not that good at them and could never afford videogames growing up. Im not bad in pick up im just not the best player and will probably just hit clutch shots in the post. I enjoy watching sports. I don't know much about cars but i really want to learn and build one. I LOVE fitness and the gym. I just don't know how to make friends because who wants to be friends with a dork(i know that's counter productive but its just my mindset now).
Years of bullying and shattered dreams have shattered my once strong confidence.

TL;DR: A bunch of personal issues have made me turn off my social life but I just want to feel like I'm worth it and be somewhat cool.",22Aug2020,1
562,"Long story short, I'm having a social-distanced date tomorrow at a picnic pavilion. 

Though I am okay with staying 6 feet apart the entire time, I like the idea of being able to sit closer together but with a barrier/clear partition between us to stay safe (but still see each other and talk). 

I am not clever/savvy when it comes to DIY projects, so any ideas, tips, and tricks would be very appreciated.  

The issue is that I came up with this idea last minute and leave very early in the morning. I am unable to go to a store for several reasons, so I am stuck creating a makeshift barrier from things I have at home. 

Anyone have any safe, fullproof ideas that'll help us stay safe?

Just one face reveal, that’s all.  I really want to because of these two reasons: 

I’m curious to know what other people think.

I want people to know that I’m not a troll.

 I mean, I wanna be able to post at least one picture including my face on here. One time, I was called a troll on Reddit by someone for saying something that they disagreed with or didn’t expect from a teenager. It’s honestly not fair when people do that.

So she texts him and asks if he wants to come over and fuck, as apparently that has been a trend with the two of them lately. Almost immediately he responds that he is coming over. 

I’m still at the house and he gets there, but I was hiding with the other girls so he wouldn’t see me, even though a part of me wanted to show my face and expose him. 

I’m not really sure how to handle the situation now as he doesn’t know I was there. But I want him to know that lying to me like that is not okay and I don’t want a friendship built off lies.

First off, I have a sister that's very toxic to her boyfriend for a small matter such as mistakes, recently I left a group of friends since they kept making fun of me I.e calling me fat, a pedo, multiple things I'd rather not say here etc and now I'm alone with no friends, my girlfriend has been the only thing that's been keeping me standing on two feet these past years and kept me from suicide.

Around an hour ago I argued with her because she raised her voice at me. I didn't want to argue with her.. But I loathe when people raise their voices at me. Not only am I afraid of doing something wrong, I'm afraid when people throw it in my face and cause a problem for me. After that, my sister started calling me names.. Saying I should get a job (current trying my best to), saying I should go kill myself and saying I should go live with my girlfriend. She then started throwing shit at me for no reason other than she is an awful person.

And now here I am. I don't want to live but I want to live for the sake of my lover. Everyday I feel like I'm existing just to be someone else's punch bag.. It feels everyone wants to throw everything at me because I'm useless. I try my best.. I always try my best but it just feels like I can't go on anymore.

572,"Last night I went out with a friend to get some drinks on a patio. We ended up drinking quite a bit, and went to a show afterwards. After the show a few guys came up to us to start up a conversation. They seemed really nice and they said we should come with them to check out a rooftop patio. It’s a really fancy hotel with a patio that’s open to the public at the top. We were trying to figure out somewhere to go because we were bored of the other patios around. So we went with them, and they brought us to their room instead. Keep in mind we were both quite drunk at this point. I didn’t even really notice that’s where we were going, they said we were just going to stop there and go back up.

One of the guys was genuinely very nice and seemed like a good person, but the other one was creepy. He kept trying to get me to kiss him and get me alone with him but I said no and I didn’t let him do anything. My friend went off with the other guy for a little bit and left us alone, so I wasn’t sure what to do. I didn’t want to leave her alone at the apartment and she seemed like she was having a good time. I don’t think she really noticed how creepy this guy was being towards me. He asked me if I liked sex toys and then he took out a vibrator and he tried to get me to use it. Like he physically pressed it against me and I was kind of scared so I let it happen for a few seconds and then pushed him away from me to try and find my friend. Keep in mind I’m 20 years old and these two men were 28.

Obviously we both ended up leaving their apartment. I just feel guilty for even going up in the first place, like I thought that they were genuine guys. But looking back as a sober person it’s obvious what they were trying to get, I don’t know why I didn’t even realize. I don’t know whether to tell my boyfriend but I just feel bad about the whole situation. I feel like he’ll blame me for what happened and I really feel like I had no control over the situation. I never said yes to the vibrator, I physically pushed him away, I didn’t let him kiss me or anything. But I feel like it’s all my fault because I agreed to go in the first place and I’m a terrible girlfriend.",22Aug2020,1

574,"I (14F) have a fear of horror movies.

I watched one horror movie when I was like maybe 11/12 and it scarred me. It wasn't the gory kind because I don't flinch at gore but more of the jumpscare and ghosts and demons thing.

I couldn't sleep properly for about six months after my first horror movie.

Now, it's easier to sleep but I still lowkey have this fear that something's gonna get me in the middle of the night and I'm scaring myself by looking at the posters of horror movies and reading some creepy Reddit stories.

It's currently 12:17am where I am right now and I just decided to raise this issue.

I would also like to say that I've looked behind me multiple times as I typed this post. The only thing that makes me able to fall asleep at night is thinking of anything OTHER than horror.

I rescued a female cat from my parents shed when the mother had abandoned her at around 2/3 weeks old. 

Since bringing her back to where I currently live, my flatmate has seen her as 'our' cat and I've been okay with that. 

This little kitty has basically become my baby - I syringe fed her every 2/3 hours when she was still blind and also took the time to wean and litter train her. 

I've also paid for her insurance, vet bills, shots, spaying and microchipping totalling over £450. 

I've also paid for all her food, toys and cat litter since having her in my care. 

This kitty is practically my baby and I was her surrogate mum and all she knew for the first month or so of her life. 

I move out in September to start back up at university and planned on taking the fur baby with me to my new house but my flat mate turned around to me and said ""Ohh aren't you going to miss her when you move out? I bet you're only going to come back here to see her 😂"" 

I don't know how to tell her that I'm taking my baby with me when I move out, after all she is insured and microchipped under my name.

578,"Me and my best friend have been through a lot together. I love her and we get along on most subjects and she is loyal to me and I am to her. We keep each others secrets, have each others backs and have a lot in common. But this year has changed her for the worst.

She started dating a Trump supporter, which, whatever. I have some Republican friends and we have managed to make our friendships work, we just do not talk about politics. It works fine. But because of the mask mandate, it's a harder topic to avoid. Ever since she watched that stupid ""Plandemic"" youtube video, she is a totally different person.

Yesterday we went out to dinner and I immediately got anxiety because I knew she would be upset that a mask is required to get to your table. I offered her a mask, and reminded her it was only to be worn for a second and to please not cause a scene. She doesn't complain and I am relieved.

She sits down and asks our server what they had on tap. He directs her to the virtual menu via the QR code. Here we go..

""I'm not fucking scanning anything. Bring me a physical menu."" I cringe deeply and word that I'm sorry to our server. ""Don't you know what those things mean? They're trying to take away our freedom!!"" I bite my tongue very hard and take a large sip of my beer. In my head I'm thinking ""Just scan the fucking code dude. QR codes have been around for at least a decade.. like.. chill out."" But what's the point? She is intolerable.

Then a old friend of mine sees me and comes over to say hello. We start small talking about how crazy this year is and saying how much we miss socializing, typical 2020 small talk. My bestie chimes in ""Today at the store, a lady had the fucking nerve to come up to me with her son and tell me I was selfish for not wearing a mask! I told her she was selfish for making her son wear one and weaken his immune system!!"" My friend, who isn't an idiot, stood silent.

She asked him, in an angry tone, ""What? Are you a libtard too? She (me) is a libtard as well. How can you guys support child molester BIDEN!"" I stop her and say ""Remember, we don't talk about politics. We have different opinions. Lets leave it at that."" But she persists. Calls me a libtard again and it took everything in me to not just fucking drag her with facts and science. But its pointless..

These are the anti-maskers. They are angry and refuse to see other evidence and thinks we are all ""sheeple"". I don't even want to hang out with her anymore. I hate how masks have become political. Can I even say anything to get through to her?? She didn't graduate high school so you can see there is a lack of education on the topic but I obviously do not want to insult her intelligence..

583,"
So 4 years ago I (22M) went off to college, and it really dented my social confidence. 

For a bit of context; I went to a relatively small high school where I was very sociable and a pretty easy-going guy, so I was generally well liked. I enjoyed spending time with friends and meeting new people, and if you asked around I’d think I would’ve been described as pretty outgoing. 

Enter, college. The first few weeks I was out a fair bit, trying to meet new people and kick-off my college career. My school wasn’t the most diverse (unlike my HS) and so the other students for the most part seemed to have a good amount in common with each other, but not myself - or maybe this is just an excuse I’ve convinced myself to be true. Anyway, at some point I stopped putting in the effort, and ended up having one “friend”, my flat mate. The rest of the year continued like this, no parties, no clubs, just a lot of time spent in my/flatmate’s room puffing the magic dragon.  

I learned to be ok with my situation and though definitely not happy, I convinced myself it was a brief period of my life and would be over soon enough as I devised my escape plan. After the first year, I left and went straight into work. 

Despite this just being a year of my life, once back out in the real world and interacting with people, I realised just how much my social confidence had been dented. I was overthinking my contributions to discussions, my sense of humour, it was as if my old social self had evaporated into thin air. Meeting with friends and going to social events became a chore for me, I stopped enjoying time with people and instead began to enjoy my time alone more. I’m not sure I’d say I’ve reached social anxiety, but if not, I’m damn close to it. At the surface I’m still confident and with old friends I sometimes slip back into my old ways, but otherwise I feel consciously awkward in most social situations and feel this is undermining my true self and preventing me from getting back to where I used to be. I have noticed this has impacted not only my personal social life but my life more generally, I’ve adopted an attitude where I’m willing to “settle” (though consciously convinced myself that’s not the case) and have begun to put in minimal effort in myself, my GF, and effectively every area of my life, bar work.

I stopped making plans, continued to put in 0 social effort as in college, and slowly closed in on myself. I am now 3 years down the line and have no desire to be social, and genuinely feel I have lost what used to bring me so much happiness in life. 

I hate it, and I want it to change. But I really don’t know where to start. Advice anyone?",22Aug2020,1

585," I'm 28f. I'm ebarrassed to say it, but I still remember my college years fondly, especially the first one, and I find that was the best time of my life. I'm deeply nostalgic of the city I went to college in, but that's more of a byproduct. When I go back there I'm saddened by how things, buildings etc. have changed. I'm more nostalgic of that time in my life, and less of the place itself.

I've always been a quite nostalgic person, but the difference is my high school years were indifferent at best. In college I finally found my place, and I loved the new identity I built. The last year was already a bit worse, since I was cramming for exams and things had already changed a lot. Nowadays I have no debt, a good job I like (although at times it's pretty stressful, but I wouldn't want another one), a great boyfriend (who was already with me back then), but still I can't help but feel my best years are already behind me. I've never felt as happy in the last few years as I was as a 19 year old. During that time I actually feared that I would have missed it so much, but brushed it off and thought it was just a silly idea. Nope, it wasn't. Now everything is more gray and dull, and I feel like I'm just getting older and my life is just boring. And I'm not making it better than it was, if I read my diary of those days I was literally happy 99% of the time. And I'm sad that I cannot have anything back. I had new relationship excitement, had several other boys also chasing after me, was young, pretty, alone in the big city for the first time. Now I'm almost 30 (still pretty, but terrified of aging, lol) and I feel pathetic for still not having found anything better than that.

   I am a lead hand at a warehouse company. I lead the night shift. Now I have this supervisor that follows my shift for  dayshat is a real problem. All he does is bitch and moan about EVERYTHING my shift does, to the point where he made an email about a bloody small dust pile my supervisor accidentally left off to the side. Instead of cleaning it up, he left it for us and emailed all management staff and lead hands about it. It was not a near miss, it was out of the way. No safety hazard at all. But that the level of having it out for us he has. Thats just one example. I am sick of it. I try addressing the issues to make sure they dont happen again with my guys, but it just doesn't stop and by no means is my shift bad or leaving things on purpose. He LOOKS for tiny things to bitch about, things that every shift and person usually miss. Inconsequential things like a small dust pile. Also, at one point for about a year my guys would stay on to clean up for 20 minutes off the clock to make sure everything was perfect for his shifts start up. He never thanked us once. Hes a POS that favors his shift, portrays them as perfect.

I asked if he wanted me to leave him alone and he basically says “I don’t WANT you to but I do think I need some space right now” so to make sure I asked him if he was gonna talk to me later or just that he’s done with me and he said later. He also told me he was leaving to visit his family that night. I said okay and drive safe. Then he started posting on his snap. I texted him two days later to tell him that I know he needs space but I just wanted to tell him I miss him and he left me on read a little over a week ago. Since then he’s been posting on his Snapchat and it’s mainly just his dog and his family since he’s still there and he views my story almost immediately but it’s so weird to me that he doesn’t even bother to check in with me. Like how can you say you care about me and like me and then do that? I thought I’d give him a week after he gets back and if he doesn’t reach out, I’ll take him off of snap and let it go.

She’s been coming over and staying the weekends for whatever reason and it makes both of us kind of uncomfortable. 

They’ve been kind of disrespectful to the house they don’t pay for, and taking advantage of the kindness of my boyfriends parents by letting him move in for the 4th time. We woke up this morning to cigarette butts on the stairs, beer cans and cigarette butts outside the front door, and even some out back. We all do our part to take care of things because we’re adults but they don’t take care of any of their stuff. 

I don’t know if I should say something to his parents as she doesn’t like a messy house or if I should just not say anything and let my boyfriends mom take care of it herself, so she can see what they’re doing in their home.

I’m very concerned but I also don’t want to make things awkward between us, so I haven’t said anything judging his lack of social distancing habits.

I texted him that I’m not gonna go to the dinner yesterday, and he read the message but didn’t say anything.

599,"Hi there. I was hoping to get some advice on how to help a family member who has started to open up about some rather ‘interesting’ beliefs he holds.

Some backstory. My oldest brother was a wild child growing up, getting mixed up with a lot of drugs, and overall a toxic way of life. Him finding religion and faith really helped set some life guidelines again, and he is now successful career wise as a programmer. He’s always been a little bit of a conspiracy theorist, but it was never harmful, and was played off as just a quirky personality. Recently, however, it’s crossed into some disturbing territory.

He is always talking politics, inserting his beliefs into conversation, and doesn’t shy away from an argument. One day, he called me and wanted to discuss the George Floyd protests. Me being fairly liberal and participating in a BLM protest the day before, I was happy to try and have a chat, knowing that he would probably turn it into conservative talking points. After going back and forth, he said that his friends called him a white supremacist. I was curious, as he was just saying normal republican talking points (I come from a conservative family), and he said,”well it’s because I brought up Floyd’s genes and bloodline into the conversation, and my friends started freaking out. I was just making the point that it’s an important factor is all.” I was so so shocked to hear that, I didn’t know how to respond. 

After that, I started noticing things. He regularly uses what I assume to be 4chan terminology, having to explain certain terms he says all the time to me. I’ve seen him browse 4chan boards on his phone, and most recently, I picked up a book he was reading that covered Martin Luther’s extreme antisemitic ideas. His conspiracy theories he brings up are not cute anymore, because I know at least a small part of him believes in it. We almost got into a fight because he thinks the coronavirus is a hoax, doctors are not to be trusted, etc.

I’m worried about my brother. He is 7 years older than me, so when I try to talk some sense into him, I get a condescending comment and some ‘life advice,’ ending the argument. What is the best course of action to help him get out of this dangerous rabbit hole that he has gotten himself into? Is there anything I can do?

Tl;dr - Oldest brother is a regular on what I assume to be the 4chan POL board and actually believes some of the crap on there, what do I do?",22Aug2020,1

601,"I am a normal everday person, who leads a normal life. I'm not depressed, I don't have anxiety and I have healthy relationships.

But after I woke up, I'm shaken, scared and I want more than anything to see my new family again.

Last night, I fell asleep late while watching YouTube. Pretty usual for me, but I somehow got completely different results.

The dream started in a ex-friends apartment. I remember walking up to them, saying hi, but something wasn't right. When they turned around, they were angry, and they stabbed me, leaving me in a weird pain, that wasn't real but still hurt. They called the police, claiming ""He assaulted us so we stabbed him in self defense.. ( there was conversation I can't remember. )
I ended up running, fast, and ripping the knife out of the flesh in my leg. 

I remember I got everyone from my family in my car. My mom, my uncle, my sister, brother and highschool crush. 

We ran, ran and ran to someplace I could only describe as desolate. We bought a house across a ( latino? ) mother and her child.

We lived in quiet, having deep conversations.

One night, about 10 hours after moving in, I got hit in the head. Hard. And I couldn't remember anything.
My family couldn't do anything, because we couldnt risk us getting caught, so for the rest of the year I learned everything I forgot. Except for the history before me getting stabbed.

One night, when I went to sleep, it wasn't like before where it just magically skipped 9 hours.
I dreamt I could teleport, and create anything you could imagine. This time, the higher powers were hunting me down. 
I remember frantically going about, teleporting and being scared, but I coped through thinking about my family. But I remembered two.
They were real but I can't have two, and it hit me:

I'm in a dream.

Suddenly, everything stopped.

I was awake.

I couldn't say goodbye to my family, who I made new relationships with. I felt scared, because I was vulnreable again. I cried.

How can I cope?",22Aug2020,1
602,"About 2-3 months ago i got out of a 10 year long abusive situation that was mentally and sometimes physically abusive. I’m young so i still live with my family just not the abuser.

My life now is great, I’m truly happy and have been working on myself to be a better person by going out more (when corona allows), eating healthier, and forming better habits but I still get triggered when I hear things that remind me of the past. Like I said I live with family and if I’m in a different room and someone is talking loud but I can’t distinguish their voice it’ll bring up memories of the verbal abuse we had to go through and my adrenaline will start going or if someone drops, bangs, or hits something for whatever reason it’ll also bring it back. 

I’m still living in the same house as everything took place I don’t know if that could add to it but any advice on how to get over this would be appreciated. I’m finally happy and able to live a “normal” life I just want to stop being trigged by these normal everyday occurrences. Thank You",22Aug2020,1
603,"Lately I’ve been wondering what do people do on their free time, days off etc, to stay busy and/or relax?   

I’m a 24 M, I’m single and live alone. I moved out for my job about a year ago. For the most part I actually really like my job, the people I work with and just life in general. But I find myself getting so excited for the weekends just to get really bored and not really do anything. Then I feel guilty for wasting time literally not doing anything.
  
I think I’m still adjusting from the college life as I honestly kinda do things when I want, I’m finding it annoying to not have real structure in my life. I’ll usually go to the gym, do some grocery shopping, wash my car/clothes. But then it’s noon and I’m done with that stuff and am at loss of what to do so Ill end up smoking weed then essentially stay doing nothing other than watching tv for the rest of the day/night. I just feel so boring, some people will ask me if I have plans or what I’m doing on the weekend and it’s the same old nothing.
  
I think part of it is not really having any friends around me, and not knowing how to make new ones. All my friends live pretty far away, closest is ~2 hrs, and most in different states now so just linking up isn’t really an option. And also Covid isn’t really helping. I’ve been trying to think of hobbies for the past couple months, the only thing I can think of is going traveling/hiking/kayaking, but I don’t know where to go and feel hesitant to do these things alone. I also was interested in improv classes, but that has been delayed due to Covid.

He doesn’t know what he wants and wasn’t able to focus on improving himself. He was unemployed, friendless and was going through depression. He kept saying that he wanted to start working out, finding a new job and so forth. But he never felt motivated to do it. I guess all his time and energy did go towards me.

I can not stand him! Since they been together, I was not allowed to spent one minute without her. When they are at my house, even when she goes to the bathroom, he stands by the door. She works, he does not, so i have to come to her work to talk to her alone.

My marks were good enough to get into universities overseas and I also managed to get a sports scholarship so I took my chance and went to a D1 university in the States. I’ve always been a very sporty and fit person and hardly ever used to drink or smoke (only once in awhile at social gatherings), when I was 18 I started smoking marijuana, I felt that I had an increased awareness of my thoughts and ideas and I got addicted to that over the next 2 years. I got really introspective and started analyzing the way I spoke to people and get really in my head. For awhile it was great and I learnt a lot but over time it started making me depressed as I was disassociated from reality. Now I hardly ever smoke anymore ( once every few months with friends) but I feel like it has affected me a lot. When I have time to think about my words and what I want to say then everything is fine like when I get write out a message and think it through, but when having conversations it’s been really tough for me to convey my thoughts into words and say them clearly without mumbling or stumbling over my words and when someone speaks to me I struggle to truly understand what they’re saying unless it’s a topic that I’m used to and speak about regularly. This made my self-esteem drop rapidly. This made me depressed for a while as I felt like it was making me stuck in my head constantly ruminating about my problems and that something was seriously wrong with me. So now I’ve stopped smoking weed as much as I can and I’ve started reading books to try and gain knowledge on different topics. Do you guys have any advice on what I should do to help get me out of this rut and get to a place where I’m confident in speaking and having and bringing value to conversations again ?

My (23) sister is skinny so that only makes it worst because theyre always comparing us and my cousin who is 8 is also overweight is heavier than me and honestly im worried because she will have health problems if she keeps eating so much junk food, they never said anything about her, they ALWAYS talk about me, anyone has any advices? im afraid that one day i will cry in front of them and they will laugh in my face.

614,"I live in a small village that has for the last 2 months ranged between 0 and 5 total active cases of COVID in a population of 500,000 people. We're expecting a baby next month so our restrictions have been significant. We told my parents they couldn't visit us for the last 4 months. But after the cases have been so low for so long and info has show that COVID cant be passed through surfaces -- it feels like it's time to start becoming a bit more lenient.

Earlier this month we adjusted our rules for them:

They can visit but must wash hands
They can visit but must wash devices
They can visit but must come right here from home (no stops along the way)
My parents welcomed these changes as did I...

My SO set these rules for me:

No visiting playgrounds with our kids
No attending family get togethers that are inside (ie. all of them)
No going inside stores (until last week)
Not allowed to get the mail without washing hands or wearing gloves (until two weeks ago)
Not allowed to open any packages for 1 week (until last month)
No visiting friends inside (unless approved friends)
But now my S/O wants to add additional rules:

They can't visit after work. They must go home and shower first.
They have to wear a mask for the visit.
They can't hold our children.
They can't come inside the home. Only outdoor visits.
No kissing the kids
I believe this is excessive but will go along with the no kissing rule and only visiting if they come directly home only rule (even though I don't see the logic here). We currently only see my SO's family who follows the first batch of rules but doesn't have to follow the other rules because they don't do anything besides visit us.

My family on the other hand works FT and has obligations to other people like my grand parents. These obligations and interactions with other people is what makes my SO uncomfortable with them visiting. My parents haven't had COVID, neither has anyone else in my family.

My thought is that there have been less than 5 active cases at any time (all travel related) for 2 months and that all of the rules are a bit much. My parents are becoming more distant because of all our rules.

AITA for suggesting to my SO that it's time for us to go back to start accepting that COVID might always be a thing and we shouldn't live in fear / have all of these restrictions ?

I find myself locked in this mindset of not being good enough, I play with a group I’ve been with for a long time, and they are quite toxic, never have anything nice to say about anyone and I often wonder what they say behind my back. But I stay because I feel like eventually we will do all the highest level achievements and content together, and I get so jealous when I see friends in other groups doing things I aspire to achieve in the game. When I consider just leaving them to find a new group, I worry that they will just talk about how much of an asshole I am for leaving because the community is small. 

This all impacts me so much because in lockdown I work remotely so this game seems to be all I have that occupies my free time and is the only chance I have of social interaction. I’m basically afraid of how alone I’ll be without it. Also, I feel as though I’ve invested so much time getting to where I am in the game that it will be all for nothing if I walk away completely. 

It’s starting to make me really depressed, I feel obligated to join in the daily raid times, I feel obligated to stay in this group of people, I don’t have fun on it anymore. How do I just put it down and walk away? How do I overcome this?",22Aug2020,1

620,"My dad is 48 years old, and he has no sense of cleanliness. He walks the house shirtless, wearing just a pair of disgusting checkered boxer shorts with long cords hanging out of them. He drips a lot of sweat, and he doesn't clean up after himself when he eats.

The grossest part is that he is really gassy. He constantly rips stinky, nasty farts. His farts sound like a mix between a trumpet and an airhorn. I don't even know what he eats that makes his intestines so squeaky. He drinks milk straight out of the carton, even when we eat dinner together, and he just releases a lot of stinky farts when he does that. He farts really loud in the bathroom and the shower, and he has massive diarrhea that make the bathroom impossible to use. I swear I will just rent a port-a-potty for my dad to use. Only my dad shall use the port-a-potty, and my dad shall use only the port-a-potty. He doesn't even bother to flush after he uses the bathroom.

It's so embarrassing when my dad farts. He does it when guests come over, and everyone freaks out. He does it in the restaurant, in the store, in the church, at the dentist's clinic, and it smells awful after he toots. Yet he doesn't even try to apologize for being so loud and smelly. Once we were in the swimming pool at the gym, he farted non-stop, and everyone just stared at him.

When my dad showers, he uses too much shampoo, and he leaves his dirty underwear in the shower, and he tosses his dirty clothes on the bathroom floor. He always farts uncontrollably in the shower, and he burps all the time. He burps around others, and it smells disgusting because he doesn't brush his teeth either. My dad always sticks his hands down his pants, and it's so frustrating because his hands are gross after he does that, and I literally have a panic attack when he touches anything. 

My dad is really open about bodily functions. Apart from burping and farting 500 times a day, he also picks his nose all the time. It's so disgusting. He just smears the booger on the bottom of the kitchen table or on his napkin. It disgusts me when he does that. He also slouches on the couch, and he gets angry and lets hell loose and releases several dozen burps and farts if anyone tells him to sit up straight. When he watches TV, he eats a lot of cookies, chips, popcorn, and Cheetos, and he smears his dirty hands on the couch. He lies down on the couch, and I constantly hear him squeeze a few farts each minute. If he farts that much, he might as well wear a diaper that is engineered with sound and odor proof fabric.

And he never shaves either. He has really long stray whiskers popping literally everywhere on his fat face. He has puffy, bulgy hair, and round eyes. He never shaves his eyebrows, and consequently he has an ugly unibrow that makes me want to throw up. He has really long armpit hair, and it's so gross when he walks around shirtless. He has a lot of gross hair on his chest and belly. This is exactly why he needs to put a shirt on.",22Aug2020,1
621,"I (24F) have been talking to this guy from campus because he said he wants to be friends with me. We texted once every few weeks, made plans to hangout but I made up a story of why I couldn't go because I was afraid to meet his large group of friends (this was before the pandemic). With the pandemic and lockdown we still talk and I enjoy our conversations but he says and does things that hint a fuckboy vibe.

He lovebombs me with compliments and comments of admiration. Asks me for advice on his recent breakup, suggests series and movies that he thinks I'll like. I follow up with my opinion on stuff he's suggested and we get a good convo out of it. So I also started recommending stuff to him, but he doesn't watch nor read anything I suggest. I usually text first and he always says things like ""I think about you all the time"", ""I miss you so much"", ""I might have a crush on you"" but I feel it's not true because I'm the one initiating contact most of the time.

622,"I'm 21F and a student.

2020 was supposed to be the year I graduate and get my bachelors.

I was straight As student throughout my entire schooling and college has been a real slap in the face for me. Because of this, I won't be graduating this year, but because I still need to pass couple more classes, only next year.

I've been incredibly stressed in the past year. I feel stupid because I'm failing at my studies. I'm not even sure if I like my chosen field anymore (IT). One of my parents had a major injury this year and has been laid off from work. So the finances are a bit tight and it stresses me out that my parents will have to pay for my next year of college. I mean, they could manage, but I just don't want to put that kind of pressure on them or on me.

Last years, I've been able to work during summers and finance myself. But this year, because of you know what, no one is looking for seasonal workers so I'd have to rely on my parents for financing. I'm in Europe btw, school year here costs around 500e.

I couldn't work and study because presence in classes is mandatory and classes are pretty much in the middle of the day and it wouldn't fit well with shifts for jobs i had in mind (waitressing, working in a bakery, store or something similar).

I am struggling with constant stress and anxiety and I just want to take a break. Not be under constant pressure through my entire day that I have to do something, that I'm not doing enough and not being good enough. 

Would it be a mistake to pause my studies and continue next year? Why or why not?

624,"DISCLAIMER: I am absolutely currently seeking professional psychiatric and medical help for this. I'm looking for advice on what to do/research on my own or links to resources in the Vancouver, BC metro area in case someone familiar with it stumbles across this post.

Until extremely recently I (27f) had always considered my childhood to be privileged and idyllic. We definitely had family problems at home, but nothing on the level of physical/sexual abuse from a parent or whatever else you would tend to think of as abuse. For years I've always joked that I have no idea why I flinch if someone reaches towards me unexpectedly since I was never hit.

I've always known this isnt entirely true, my younger brother and I fought viciously until I was in middle school. I had some memories of him trying to kill me and he usually thought it was funny when people reacted in pain to something he did even as a child, but I supposed I just sort of glossed over it after a point. For a myriad of other reasons I've brought it up in therapy that I grew up with a sociopath only to be told repeatedly that I must be exaggerating.

Having put in some more work with therapy and related exercises, I've recalled other parts of my childhood that leave me feeling lost (if I'm only just remembering it now, surely it cant have been real and I'm lying) and also more than a little betrayed. The first time my younger brother made an attempt on my life I was 5. He beat my head into the floor hard enough for me to leave blood behind. Other instances included attempts to drown me at the pool or chasing after me with a 10"" chef's knife. I've always been the favourite child, but I was regularly punished for defending myself or running away (with the knife incident I ran down the street to get away), his actions were minimized, and it always felt like i was being accused of lying.

To add complexity to the issue i also always felt the need to be the protective older sister because i regularly used to see adults take advantage of my brother or worse. If our parents werent there, I was regularly the only thing standing between school admin and my brother - he got labeled as a problem kid in kindergarten so it stuck until he graduated and got ready to go off to college.

Apologies on this being vague, but what sort of thing do people with weird realizations of childhood trauma do while they wait for therapy and meds and such to get on track?",22Aug2020,1
625,"Backstory, my (18f) friend has dipped into a depressive state over the last few months of quarantine. They tell me that they have zero motivation to attend online classes, do any work and pretty much do anything at all and just resort to doing nothing but watching tik toks and sleeping. They tell me that it's like a cycle of hate for themselves for being unproductive, which leads to bring more unproductive and then hating themselves even more. And that they just feel empty and purposeless and that they just want to fade away (not suicidal) because they don't know what the point of doing anything is. They were already seeing a psychologist for help, but because I'm not the best at comforting people or having inspirational experiences/encouragement, I asked them if they needed support in going to school because I thought I could at least support them like that and they agreed. 

At first I thought, okay I'll encourage them to go to school because at the rate that they were missing classes, they wouldn't pass their final year of school. I thought I could call them every morning, message them every period reminding them to go to class, supporting every step they took in the right direction. But how they responded was by ignoring my messages, saying that they don't want to go to class because they're tired and scared the teacher is gonna make them do work or completely sidetracking by sending me memes or tik toks to look at. I wasn't expecting an overnight change, but this was constantly happening and it made me so fucking frustrated and angry that I began to hate them. And I hate that I started  hating them because I know it's not they're fault, that something in their brain is inhibiting them to fight back this depressive state and that if they could, they would get out of it but they just cant. And I expressed to them my frustration to them without blaming them, and they said they really do appreciate my efforts and that it is helping them but the more this goes on the more I get so fucking mad to the point where I have to leave and go take a walk because my emotions can't comprehend this invisible disease of depression. 

I get so angry because some part of me just can't comprehend the fact they they're unable to just pick up a pen and do work, or go to class, or get out of bed, or a anything at all. It just seems so foreign to me that they can't make that choice because of the state that they're in. And I want to keep supporting them but I cant keep my emotions in check and I'm scared I might snap at them even though I can acknowledge that none of this is their fault

634,"My cousin, with whom I have always been closer than anyone in my family, just invited me on a road-trip to California this coming week from near the east coast. It would be her, her husband, and myself which is the usual way we hang out seeing as he was immediately initiated into our bond when they started dating. They said they could use the help driving as well as the extra company, and they both know that seeing the Giant Redwood Forest has been on my bucket list for as long as I can remember. I haven't seen them in forever since before even the start of this outbreak and I miss them dearly but I am also extremely concerned about safety. ***My question is really do you think there is a way I could make this trip right now safely?*** I am inclined to tell her no, as much as that would break my heart to miss the whole experience, but I am not so sure about the timing.

They stayed isolated for a while but have since decided to continue with their lives as usual which really only amounts to work and chilling at home most of the time, so they have had minimal to moderate exposure. I have stayed home except for essential runs to the store, opting for online delivery in most cases. Somehow still I have managed to remain somewhat ill the majority of the quarantine(tested regularly for corona virus and all thus far have come back negative), possibly due to my struggle with my mental issues affecting my physical health. I've distanced myself a great deal lately due to those issues from everyone including my cousins and I don't want to keep turning their invitations down but, I know that the trip could be a huge risk for those around me, including myself. There must be precautions I could take so as to not miss out on something like this, right?

I know it sounds dumb to hope for this, but I feel like with my issues I won't make the trip of my own volition in the future if I pass this up and that if I refuse their invitation again they might further think I don't want them around which I really do. My mental health issues just often get in the way as well as this virus(which I know has been devastating to so many). I feel like the trip and time with my cousins would be good for me but ***is it worth the risk?***

Citing that her parents feel that ""her job as a female is to always cook and clean without being told to. While my \[her\] brothers sit around - until once a month they might have to lift something heavy"" And she cannot protest because that's simply how her culture is.

Her parents don't care when either of her brothers go out or ask where they're going, whereas if she goes out she gets called on and told ""you go out all the time"", ""you never spend time with the family"". Even though she works from home-

We've been together for a few years and this is nothing new to me, but lately, I feel I'm having a hard time comforting her/empathizing and doing my job as her partner to help her feel better and work through this.

After all of this time, I feel I've reached a mental and cultural block and I'm not quite sure what I can do or say to help her anymore except hope once we move she won't have to focus on it much anymore.",22Aug2020,1
652,"My best friends wedding is in October and I am the best man. I was so excited when he asked me to be his best man in the beginning of the year. I was beside myself because I have never been anyones best man, ever. 

Now here is the thing ... My wife is about six weeks pregnant. This has brought me so much joy. We have been trying for YEARS to get pregnant. It has finally happened. We have tried so many different things with supplements, tracking cycles, and have finally found IVF treatment. It worked. 

I haven’t told my best friend that she is pregnant yet because we have an ultrasound this week to confirm everything. It is still so early on in the pregnancy to know for sure. 

I talked with my doctor about the bachelor party and the wedding and implications of my wife’s health with our COVID world. He highly recommended me not to go to the bachelor party or wedding. 

My best friend and his fiancé are adamant on having their wedding and all the festivities around it. A house for everyone to stay at for the week. Partying a lot. 

I know I need to talk with him about everything and I will later this week. This has been KILLING me for weeks. Do I go to the wedding to support my best friend and risk the health of my wife and her pregnancy by contracting COVID, or do I not go to my best friends wedding so that I keep my wife and pregnancy safe. My gut says it is too dangerous with all the people that will be around without masks, not social distancing, photos, and lots of people being drunk.

My wife isn’t going to go regardless. It will be too much for her. She has been ordered to rest as much as possible. Which brings me to my last point. I have to take care of her as much as possible because her pregnancy is at higher risk than others for a miscarriage for various reasons. If I get sick, I cannot take care of her. I cannot cook, clean, work as much, etc. Thankfully I have a job that I have been teleworking from for the past few months. 

Any thoughts or advice would be much appreciated. Thank you!

TL;DR My best friend is getting married. My wife is pregnant. At a crossroads if I go or not because of COVID and health implications to me, my wife, and our pregnancy.",22Aug2020,1
653,"It has been a week since I moved into a new place for graduate school, and I’m homesick. 

Some background info: I attended undergrad at a college 7 hours away from home and initially battled with homesickness during my time at that college. I was able to overcome it, but I find myself in a similar situation as before as I moved even further to a uni 10 hours away from home in a large city. 

The university is set to open this Monday. We had the option to go remote or attend class in-person. Despite my concerns for COVID, I elected to take them in person as I felt that I wanted the experience. Now that has all changed. I have come up with a plan to attend in person for the first half then during a mid semester break, switch to remote learning. I’ll either move everything in my apartment to storage or find a way to take everything back home and break my month to month lease. This would give me the chance to save some money, but I’m not sure where I would live if the university opened in the spring. 

Am I thinking too much? Is it homesickness that’s validating these choices/feelings I’m making? Should I go back home and finish the semester remotely? I feel like rushed into things and should have started remotely. I’m grateful to be in this program. I just wish it was in a different environment.",22Aug2020,1

655,"Sorry for the confusing title but I can’t think of a better one

Me 21M and this girl 20F dated for 4 months and broke up in June. I kept my TV and Xbox at her apartment 5 hours away because I couldn’t keep it in my barracks. This was stupid but at the time I was visiting her every weekend or so and saw no issues with it. I should mention that it hit me by surprise when we broke up so I saw no issues with leaving it there on that end either. 

Since June she’s become more and more aggressive with how she’s acts towards me, and in regards to my stuff she offered to have it shipped to me back in June but I didn’t have an address (mailing address is to a Ship). Once I did have an address and got back in contact with her she belittled me and refused to have it shipped saying that it was too much work for her. 
She requested that I drive up to her house to pick it up and also drop off her blanket and pillow. She’s 5 hours away kinda sorta in the direction of my hometown so she suggested I drive out of the way to pick up my stuff then go home. This is annoying but something I would be willing to do if the military didn’t have us on AOR restricting which basically means we can’t leave the surrounding area of where I’m stationed. She also lives in one of the Corona hotspot cities so it would be dangerous anyways. It’s been three months since we broke up and even longer since I last had my things. This has taken somewhat of a mental toll on me as things around where I am are shut down and besides that the military has heavily restricted our ability to go out in town.

I guess I’m just asking what I should do here, she refuses to ship it even after I’ve explained this multiple times and offered to pay for the shipping myself. I’ve even floated the idea of getting the police involved but I’m not sure if I have grounds to do that or if it’ll be worth it. She continues to be unreasonable and I’m at major roadblock in any direction I try to take it with her

658,"I’m in college but I don’t like it anymore. I am still interested in psychology but I don’t think I have the deep level of interest required to study it in depth in grad school. I’ve taken many courses and I like economics, history, and psychology the best. However my interests keep jumping around so much that I can never see myself focusing and specializing on any one subject in grad school.

Right now I’m interested in business and film. And also comedy and art (design, fashion, drawing). Also music, and I can play classical piano, but I want to learn pop/jazz/rock, and maybe guitar.

But I can’t take business or film classes or art classes at my college since they are closed to non-majors. Except intro film which I took. I also took an Intro acting class Recently.

I signed up for the film, art, Music, and business classes Outside of my school at The Community college. Except their all online unfortunately.

I know that going to law school is required to become a lawyer and going to medical school is required to become a doctor. It’s straightforward. I thought I would become a psychologist and therapist and get my PhD in psychology originally. I no longer want to.

But in these Other areas (art, film, music) I have no idea what path leads to careers in them. I’m not in an art, music, or film program either. So idk how to learn them or how to plan ahead for a future career in them.

Do I just try to teach myself? Do I take private lessons and random online courses, creative my own program? Then just do job searches in these careers like I would anything else?

668,"I'm going to try to keep this objectively and in chronological order. pls pls read it I need help. I'm devastated I don't know what to do. I am a 23yo(F) student and my BF is 26yo who has a somewhat stable job. We both live with our own parents and my parents are very strict (especially coming from an asian fam). When we first met, we couldn't not be apart. Almost every night, he'd sneak in through the window through my room. and then I got pregnant.

My sincere dream always has been to have a family of my own. So of course I wanted to keep the baby. when my BF and I waited for the pregnancy test result, I told him I wanted to keep the baby, but I'll do what he wants because I don't have anything. He told me he was nervous and even excited for the result. When it was positive, he hugged me and told me we'd get married, move in together, get a little help from our parents and raise this baby.

THAT NIGHT, after talking with his parents, somehow his parents convinced him to get an abortion and get engaged instead if he really loves me. and that the child born right now wont be happy and that we won't happy because we're not financially ready. He called me to tell me that and told me he wanted to get a marriage license with me and move out together so he can take care of me. I felt a thump in my heart but eventually I agreed because I was scared.

My BF and I told my parents that I was pregnant and getting an abortion and asked if we can move out together. At first, my parents were devastated but eventually also agreed because they wanted me to finish school and have my life. My parents went to my BF's house (they were very close friends) to talk and they decided not to let us move out just because the moms were not ready to let us go. They scared each other by telling them that if we move out right now, we'd break up because we were too immature. They started making all sorts of excuses like how they don't have enough money to marry us ( even though we told them we just want to move out together for now).

after a few days, my bf and I agreed that we will move out 2 years later when we are all ready. They convinced us by promising that we will have an engagement ceremony instead and that we could freely stay at each others homes.

When I got an abortion, I got the surgery around 8week and the drug didn't work well so I felt all the pain. As both parents agreed, my BF planned to stay at my home for 1-2wks to take care of me.

THIS is when things started to go downhill. Not even after a week, my bf's mom started telling my BF that he shouldnt stay at my place like that because my mom didn't like him here? and started using my parents' words to convince him. Of course, my BF knew that wasnt the case bc my parents appreciated him and treated him well. Them two had a huge fight (apparently a first fight btw mother and son). and they started blaming me for convincing him to move out with me in the first place, even how he yelled at her was my fault when all the plans were his or his parents ideas and my family just followed up with it cause we trusted them 100%. And his parents started telling him how they didnt like the fact that he was getting married to me, but won't stop him. and discontinued calling my parents and just ghosted all the engagement ceremony plans and promises.

My parents got pissed and they still can't sleep because they trusted his parents. Only plan we kept up with was me getting the abortion.

During all this process, we had so many fights and there were times when he threw my shirt at my face, yelled and threw things on the ground (and the cops came after he left), etc. I forgave him because I didn't want to make things worse and just thought he was having a hard time through all these events.

Thankfully, my BF was on our side and he wanted to get the marriage license without anyone else knowing and just move out together 2years later. and we did bc i trusted him.

There was one fight, caused by him. I was so mad I ended up ripping the marriage license (before it was finalized). for my defense, I told him to rip it, but he gave it to me, yelling at me to rip it 3-4 times.

But i ended up apologizing bc I knew it broke is heart. I got a duplicate of it and thought i made up for it. When we got our rings after, He said hurtful things like ""im pissed, you better not through it out bc you're mad."" WHILE purchasing.

after a week, he went on a vacation with his family and finally had the ""talk"" with his mom. He didn't tell me much but I knew she somehow convinced him into thinking how our family is selfish, weak and stuff. All this time, he told me he was sorry and how he felt bad bc i didn't do anything wrong. but somehow after the talk, he said me it was kind of my fault, how my mom is selfish, etc.etc. That's when I started having anxiety at nights. I was nervous what else she'd do to affect our relationship and my family to hurt us by convincing him too.

One night, I was having a meltdown and called him. he said ""all i can do it tell you to become strong."" I got pissed because that's something his mom told my mom. she told my mom ""don't raise your daughter weak by bringing up abortion."" when my mom said how she didnt keep the promise after getting an abortion and if she didnt even feel sorry??. So over the phone i said ""how can you say that when this is all your fault."" of course i was emotional and i guess he couldnt take it anymore so we didnt say anything after that.

TWO days later, the day to get our License finalized, we made plans to have a date but he went to go shopping with his family instead without telling me. On our ride to court and back, we didn't say a word. he ignored my calls and texts that night. I didn't understand but he said ""idk if this is all worth it when you are blaming everything on me."" I got mad because why would he go get it finalized then? but i was calm and told him i was sorry, i only meant his mom cause what he said sounded like he was on her side.

not even a week after getting it finalized, he used the divorce card during an argument and threatened with a screenshot of divorce document online and told me to venmo him half the price so he can prove that I agreed with me paying partially?. eventually he told me he was just mad and he doesnt really want it.

And now, again, not even a week after, I had my emotional breakdown at night but it was the worst one I had some kind of panic attack and started banging my head against the floor.. I was in so much pain i called him. he didnt answer.

next morning, i told him how I've been feeling at nights whenever I am alone. and told him I want to talk to his parents. (now, i've been wanting to talk to his parents past 3 months but he didnt help.) I could see that he wanted to avoid the problem. I could see that he wanted to escape whenever i brought it up or needed help. So i said ""if i knew it was gonna be this hard, i wouldve broken up."" Thats when he flipped out yelling ""OK LETS GET A DIVORCE. GTFO GTFO."" I hung up. he called back yelling at me how he told me not to say things like that. and i just said "" lets get a divorce. "" and hung up.

Again, he texted me with the screenshot and told me to go to court to pick up the doc. I said okay. he texted me again asking me if I really regret getting the license and think it wouldve been better if we just broke up.

i told him i never said i regretted, how I hate him using the divorce card to get the truth out of me. and told him i meant it when i said it'll be over for good when he uses the divorce card again by assuming that conclusion,, without even talking to me.

behind the text, I knew he was angry. i said i've been trying to get better by myself when only thing he's been doing is avoiding and just telling me to endure it or be stronger. and how he didnt listen (just because he was scared of the outcome and what other will think) once when i suggested counseling, talking to the pastor, how i need help, or wanting to talk to his parents to solve any misunderstanding bc i didn't do anything wrong. and told him I was so fed up.

He replied with bunch of hateful responses saying how stupid i am to say ""i wouldve broken up."" and how i piss him off and he doesnt know what else he can do.

i just told him ive been enduring everything by myself and tried to be strong because he told me to and i trusted him. and how theres only so much i can handle it's driving me insane now. But now that im done because he pulled the divorce card again. and he just said okay.

I can't believe how stupid and blinded I was to endure all this for this family.

I have the divorce papers filled out. and we've been ghosting each other ever since (been only 2days). I have a feeling he's going to apologize in a few days (he done this a few times throughout the relationship). but im just going to go through with the divorce if he comes back with the same thought.

but before that, I want to ask if this is worth fighting for. I honestly want to end things bc It's making me mentally ill. I don't have hope. but i also think ""what if this is just part of marriage?""

My whole life, I thought you marry only once and divorce isn't an option unless an affair is involve. But i havent been happy even on the day of the marriage, promise rings, or finalization because of him and his family. I feel like he's taking me for granted, and because of how he treats me just bc he's mad (he wasn't like this before all this), i feel like an insurance with the marriage license to tie me down until he's ready to settle and then move out together. Also, after the finalization, he's been talking negative about marriages and how a lot of guys regret after getting married?. I felt like he was threatening me again by saying that but yeah. I know a lot of guys change after marriage i didnt know he'd be like that too.

Im young and im going through this by myself without anyone else knowing so I really need some advices... please judge objectively and comment if there's something i can fix too.",22Aug2020,1
669,"Hi guys 

 
I’m 18 yo I recently graduated from high school and pass my final exams. 

Since begining of high school I wanted to study political science, few days ago I got information that I got accepted to uni X for political science and to uni Y for social policy course. Both univerities are located in the same city in with i lived until i was like 8, next 10 years I spent in suburbs. Unfortunetly beacuse of my mental health problems, drugs and other stupid shit i done my reputation is heavilly damaged. 

I was planning to start fresh in uni but recently I found out that my mate from high school is propably also going to study political science at uni X. When i saw his name on the list i felt fucking mad... In september I bought few social studies course books and for the whole year I was learning a course that was not in our school program just in order to write final exam from social studies with I did and got good results. Entry level to political science at uni X is low but when on the list of people who get in  I saw a name of the person who knows about my past and dont know anything about what is he going to study and barely pass „basic finall exam” in the first place I started questioning my choice. 

I also wanted to apply for political science in the best social/human uni in the country, but beacuse I got part time job and my familly owns apartament in the city in with uni X and Y are located in with i could live in case of going to uni my mother discouraged me to try to apply I listened to her and thought about mayby going to best uni for master in the future. (I regret that)

Now I dont know what to do I can also study social policy at uni Y which i also found interesting but not as much as political science which studying was my dream for few years. Uni Y is economic uni and degree from there  will help me more than political science degree from uni X in the future. 

I need to make decision in like 3/4 days...

670,"I saw a reddit post about “grooming” and it made me start to think. I’m 22f. My fiancé is 33m (we’ll call him Nate). My mom is 40f. 

So Nate and my mom dated for about a month in 2013. I met him during that time when I was 15 years old. 

He was so kind and handsome, he liked my art and my favorite bands and books. I always enjoyed talking to him a lot while he was over. 

A few months after my mom and Nate broke up, he messaged me on Facebook. He never said anything creepy or anything like that. It was always harmless conversation. 

Things were great. We talked almost every day, and I considered him my best friend. We have been best friends for 7 years. But now I’m starting to worry a little bit. I don’t know :( 

He was 26 and I was 15 when we met. We started dating when I was 21. Was he grooming me? I don’t know what to think anymore. 

He was never creepy to me when I was underage. But now when we have sex, he tells me that I’m a “little girl” and he wants to sneak into my room and get me pregnant and that we have to “be quiet so your mom doesn’t hear us”. Is it a kink or something more? I feel naive but I don’t know what to think anymore.

They would hit me with sticks and belts and they bruised me. I can’t remember a single thing I did to deserve it. All I remember is that it hurt really bad and I would cry for hours. It wasn’t until I was talking to my girlfriend (more on her in a bit.) that I found out this that wasn’t normal. They haven’t beat me in over a year but they still sometimes threaten to take all my stuff. My parents told me a story about my older half sister and how they took all the stuff she owned except for her clothes and a mattress on the floor. She was 12 I don’t know what she did but I can’t imagine what an 12 year old could do to deserve that. And they say they can do the same to me.

I don’t have a phone of my own so I’m writing this on the iPad that we use for school. (I’m homeschooled) they don’t know that I have reddit. I’m pretty good at hiding things. I’ll have to delete it after I get some answers.

So now, about my girlfriend. About 5 months ago we moved to a new house. I fell in love with the girl next door. She’s 13. I tried to hide the fact the we liked each other for awhile but my sisters went through my phone and found out that we were messaging through Pinterest. (Sneaky, right?) Anyway, when they found that out I was texting her they put in house arrest for 3 days. I couldn’t leave the house at all. Then they said I had to break up with her. I did... but not really. we are still in love and we still sometimes sneak a hug or a kiss but to stay safe we have to pretend that we’re just friends. They only allow me an hour and a half per day, outside and I can’t go inside my girlfriend’s house. They’ve done absolutely nothing wrong. They said if I get caught hugging her, or even holding hands I wouldn’t be able to see her again.

I need to know what to do. I can’t live with this. I need to do something, maybe demand more respect. Call CPS on them? Run away? My 15th birthday is in 3 months.

674,"Hi! I suffer from generalized anxiety disorder for a few years.

I had been on xanax, then antidepressants when it got worse, turned my life around and now I take the occasional pill mostly when visiting the dentist (haha).

So, I do have a dentist phobia and to be able to go I have to be heavily sedated. Job prospects aren't good in my country for my area and I'm not seeing how I would be able to leave my parents house, that I currently live in with my boyfriend as well.

Come to a few weeks ago I was sedated after the dentist and sending out cv applications and I did send to the uk without thinking much.
I actually got a message back and I panicked and cried and told all my family members, everyone was telling me to do the interview since it didn't mean I would be called after.

I let the days go by and did the interview, of course I got the job.

675,"This is my first time so please bare with me!

My (66F) grandma has a neighbor (76F) we will call her Mary. So since my grandma has moved into her new home about 6 months ago. She had introduced herself to multiple neighbors and one of them who lived across the street was Mary. 

Mary and her husband cannot go anywhere due to the husband's lack of heath reasons and Mary can't drive. So my grandmother offered to help her out occasionally with shopping and that was about it.
So my grandmother gave Mary her phone number.

When Mary got super needy was when she got out of the hospital after having her gallbladder surgery. This means leaving her husband at home alone. He is also very hard of hearing and hardly pays attention to Mary. 

Anyways when she got back from the hospital she would call my grandmother 2-4 times EVERY DAY. Mary has been calling my grandmas phone every day since june 27th. It is August 22nd now and she has called over 246 times from then till now.

Now her husband is in the hospital and she's even needier. She is always calling my grandma to ask if she wants to come over to sit and talk. Now Mary is a very sweet lady, grandma has been overwhelmed with feeling like she needs to take care of Mary all the time.

Grandma has taken her to church, the pool and even out to dinner a couple times. She thought doing that might lower the chances of her calling again but it hasn't and she still calls multiple times a day. 

Mary even said if her rent goes up she could move in with my grandma. And she almost had a heart attack.

What can my grandmother do to solve this issue? She is getting very annoyed at the amount of times Mary has needed her. I understand older people need more connection but this is obserd. Please and thanks.

676,"Hello guys! My question is actually very simple, it’s the situation around it that makes it hard for me to answer. I’ve seen many good questions on here, and amazing answers from good people that want to help. So I thought I give it a chance. Back in 1999 when I was six years old. Me and my family fled from Kurdistan ( Iraq ) because of the old dictator Saddam Hussein and the ongoing wars. That’s basically the only 6 years I had as a child. From there we were crossing borders to get to Sweden, no children should ever see those things we saw during the wars and the smuggling to Europe. After a couple of really hard years we finally made it to Sweden. In Sweden the problems kept coming, my parents got divorced, I was bullied for many years and kept getting reminded of my relatives back in Kurdistan. So I really didn’t get a childhood. Today I’m fine, I got a decent job, really good friends, my own apartment but I always feel like I have so much time left. I don’t have anything where I can be and get creative. I’ve studied a lot about hobbies and why and how people enjoy and get good at what they are doing with their free time. According to studies, whatever the hobby is, in most cases the person have been enjoying that specific thing or something related to that. I don’t really know what I enjoy doing, as far back as I can remember I have never done something creative just because I feel like it or because I enjoy doing it. That’s where I’m stuck.

This question may be silly, but I’m actually very sad about this. And this is a big deal for me. 

( I apologize for any misspelling or grammatical errors, my English is very limited). 

Many thanks guys!",22Aug2020,1

678,"My long distance exgf and I have been together for 1.5 years. I live in Europe and she’s in California. The relationship has always been on/off with breaks initiated on her end. She’s always been jealous of my past (she lost her virginity to me, while I had fwbs in the past, but she’s the first girl I ever loved and was my first official girlfriend). 

Over time I guess she grew more resentful of me. She felt like I had my years of fun, casual sex and she never had that. (For context, she was very religious before deconverting, and was saving her virginity for marriage, and she felt betrayed that I hadn’t done the same, even though I’ve been an agnostic my whole life). 

A few months ago, turns out she actually cheated on me. That day, she told me she was going to a park to hang out with a female friend. I had a weird gut feeling because she spent some time getting ready putting on makeup, but I decided to trust her. She spent hours there and wasn’t responding to my msgs, so I decided to go to bed. 

The next day, she acted completely normal. It was only until MONTHS later she finally confessed that she had seen a guy at the park. Apparently he was pursuing her and she was flirting with him behind my back before agreeing to hang out. She told me things “got sexual” at the park but they didn’t actually have sex. I was really hurt obviously and I never cheated on my gf because I love her, even though she always accused me of cheating because of my “past.”

I was willing to forgive her for this but a few days after she confessed, she broke up with with me and blocked me. I spent weeks miserable missing her and knew I still loved her, so I reached out 3 weeks later and surprisingly she had already unblocked me. She said she missed me a lot and wanted to see me again etc. 

Well lo and behold, a few days later she confessed she actually slept with the same guy she cheated on me with. And that was the day before I reached out. Apparently after they hooked up, she cried for 2 hours and then unblocked me, but didn’t message me first. She told me how she now realized the difference between “making love” and just “fucking” and that she really missed me. 

Anyway, my mind is a blur. I don’t know what to do. She was once my best friend, the first girl I ever loved, I really gave that relationship my everything. I forgave her so many times and always tried to make it work. I really loved her and felt this special connection with her. But now I’m finding it hard to feel connected with her and many of our memories are tainted. 

Tldr: My long distance exgf cheated on me when we were together and then slept with the same guy after breaking up with me. She regrets sleeping with him and wants to get back together. Should I forgive her?",22Aug2020,1

682,"I have no friends, no real hobbies, nor any sense of direction. I spent the past two months being haunted by horrible intrusive thoughts of an unspeakable nature. I've managed to get somewhat of a handle on them (so that I'm not completely dysfunctional), but that's another two months that have vanished from doing nothing but go to work, ruminate, and browse the internet. It just feels like my life is completely devoid of substance, much like I am devoid of any substance as a person. I keep lamenting lost opportunities in the past and memories I could've made, instead of looking to the future (since I was such a shut-in during high school, from which I graduated in June, my memories are few and far in between). Doesn't help that everyone else seems to have those kinds of memories, or at least seems to have a promising future. 

There's just this shadow of crippling dread hanging over my shoulder at nearly every occasion. It started in sixth grade with my alienation, and it's waxed and waned, with some stretches of time even being happy and optimistic, but there's always been that regression to the mean. I've tried searching for answers, both inside and outside, but truth of the matter is I'm stuck. I feel mentally stuck to that point of time. I feel like a 12 year old in an 18 year old's body.

683,"Hello everyone,

I’ve been upset the since this past Thursday due to a purchase I decided to make off Swappa for a MacBook Pro. The seller described the MacBook in good condition and posted photos of all angles of the device which to me seemed legitimate. I asked him to confirm there was no repairs or damage on the MacBook as well as delamination and he said confirmed it was fine. 

Once UPS delivered my item I had my camera ready to record. I noticed the box it was shipped in was in very bad shape. That immediately gave me a red flag. I decided to proceed with the unboxing of the item and low and behold found dents on the corner of the MacBook and HDMI port. The speaker grill is also bent on the left side as well. I went all the way to confirm it at least booted properly as he didn’t even factory reset it to default, however, it did have a username and password to log into it. 

Once I finished recording I immediately uploaded it on YouTube and replied to the seller stating I want a refund as the item was not as described. He immediately responded and claimed the condition was good and never had any damage when he shipped it. I opened up a PayPal dispute and pushed it to PayPal’s resolution center. 

PayPal is telling me since the seller purchased insurance I need to contact UPS. He gave me a number 866-706-6894 which doesn’t even seem legitimate as I called UPS and they can’t confirm that number even though when you call it, it states UPS closed on Saturday.

UPS did find a claim in their system and is saying if the claim passes then he will be written a check for the refund and then the seller will give me a refund after I return the item.

Can someone please explain this and help me out?",22Aug2020,1

685,"  

Okay, I need help and advice.

I'm 22(Nonbinary) recently found a new apartment with a friend (2 bed/1 bath). My apartment is a quadraplex, so only four apartments, and my landlord is a really cool (albeit kinda socially awkward) guy who really cares about his complex and his tenants.

 

The previous tenants were evicted for smoking and subletting their apartment (both violations of the lease), so my roommate and I spent nearly a week scrubbing down the entire apartment to clean out the cigarette and weed smoke. Neither my roommate nor I, nor our significant others, smoke at all (although my roommate used to do some weed). One of the reasons we worked so hard to clean the apartment is because I'm terrified of the second hand smoke effects on me and my partner (think uncontrollable anxiety attacks and sobbing--even though I'm not an emotional person) After a few days, my roommate and I noticed that the smoke smell kept appearing almost every single day, several times a day. At first, I got freaked out that the smoke smell was coming out of the walls (although the previous tenants that smoked only rented for a weeks, so from my research, it doesn't seem likely that the smoke penetrated that deeply into the walls and floors).   
 

About two weeks ago, my roommate walked into the complex and saw our next door neighbor (probably late 20's, early 30's) smoking a joint in the hall. He ran into his place when he saw my roommate. We realized that every time we saw our neighbor smoking (or see his butts on the floor: we have photo evidence), our apartment would reek of smoke. Initially, my roommate and I agreed to try and talk to him personally. He has a wife who smokes cigarettes, and they have at least two kids under the age of 5. I'm really worried about the health of the kids breathing in second hand smoke all the time, but I also don't want to be an asshole and have them evicted with COVID. But since we decided to try and have a conversation with him instead of reporting him, he has ducked into his apartment every time he sees us (or when the landlord pulls in for maintenance on other apartments) and it's been impossible to find him. However, both my roommate and I are developing sore throats and congestion every time he smokes and we are worried how the second hand smoke is impacting our COVID risk. Also, let me add that my neighbor is a black man and I am not willing to call the cops about the weed because my town has a proven track record of very nasty interactions between the cops and black men.

So reddit—what should I do? I feel like an ass for wanting to report my neighbors to my landlord, but my health (both mental and physically) is declining and I don’t know how to do what’s right in this situation.

NOTE: please note that I am not discussing the ethics/morality/legality of smoking weed, I just want advice on handling this situation.",22Aug2020,1
686,"I'm 16nb (nonbinary), turning 17 soon. It's ok if you're not comfortable talking about this :) have a good day!

My experience happened like 2/3 years ago and I'm still not sure. I was in a relationship with my ex at the time and I was quite shy and insecure and wanted to fit in so him wanting me in that way was validating in a way, even if I didn't see myself in a sexual way and was uncomfortable with doing things. It was a very unhealthy and emotionally abusive relationship, I've come to terms with that, but I'm not sure about the sexual things we did. 

Some things I sort of enjoyed like hugging and kissing but he pressured me into a lot of other things, the first times for all of the intimate actions were very one sided and I felt like I had to consent because he wanted it and because I wanted to want it. But I eventually did sort of consent and it wasn't bad, it just felt ehh inside, emotionally you know? I sort of pushed feelings away during everything, and our relationship was mostly based off of physical things anyways, there wasn't much of a geniune connection.

I question things because I technically consented and it wasn't bad, but when I think of things I just feel so horrible and guilty inside, it was for the wrong reasons and I regret it but that doesn't mean it was assault, if I technically consented then that's that right? What do you guys think? Any advice is appreciated :) (and thanks for reading my essay of a post)",22Aug2020,1
688,"(TL;DR on the end) I'm a guy and ever since I can remember, I despise body hair. I don't know why. It's not socialization. In fact, it was a long way to be brave enough to shave my entire body and I still sometimes get hurt when I get them weird looks.

As unfitting as it seems, it's beautifully ironic that my gf doesn't shave anywhere. I can handle her leg hair - and her armpits, because I don't really have business in there. But her pubic hair is rather long and it just kinda turns me off. I'm happy with her in every other regard, so this is a no brainer. If she doesn't want to shave, that's cool. But as of now it would mean less sex, definitely less oral sex. Even if I want to, I find myself being kinda like ""not in the mood"" in the heat of the moment and we just do petting. (Luckily, she can even orgasm through kissing and less and has a super-sensitive clit. So she's fine with me receiving more oral than her, but I'm kinda just not ... feeling that. I don't like to just get, even if it's a bit irrational since she *does* orgasm, but it still feels not entirely equal somehow?)

I'll definitely ask her if she might wanna trim once like every two months for me. Or maybe just once for me to get used to more and more. As a shaver, I know how much work is involved in keeping it smooth and how goddamn irrational it is in the first place. Trimming is fine and all, but I'd like to know if anyone has experience here, woman or man who dislikes hair, on how to get used to it better? I try to watch some hairy porn every now and then, but seeing is a different thing than reality. And it's just not my preference. It is what it is.

And what it is is, aside from my stupid brain, a very trivial ""issue"" since I've fallen hardcore in love with her character and the chemistry is buzzing too. So I will get over this. But I'm also king of anxiety, so - Do you get used to it after a long time of sex? We haven't been together that long. Just some experiences would be nice.

**TL;DR**  
I have a problem with body hair, even shave myself a lot. But my partner is the opposite, she doesn't shave at all and it's a turnoff for me. I'm happy with her and the problem lies within me since it's her body. That's why I'd be grateful for y'all to give me tips on how to get used to it. :)",22Aug2020,1
689,"I'm F(26) and an introvert. I have been alone in my entire life mostly. No close friends and I only speak to my parents. I also never had a boyfriend. About 3 weeks ago I started talking to a guy who was attempting to help me with my problem. I'm not the type that like to lie and pretty much try to be honest all of the time. However, I like to keep things to myself rather than venting it out. This is perhaps one of the reasons why I have a depression. Long story short I got rather comfortable around him and perhaps way too comfortable since I found him to be almost similar to me in a way. This caused me to voluntarily vent out to him. I told him about the incidents where I was sexually harrassed. And after that, I did feel somehow relieved. It felt as if a burden had been lifted off from my chest. However, afterward it seems that he was kinda distancing himself from me. Maybe I'm just being paranoid but I'm not really sure about it and it's kinda making me sad thinking about it. I did try my best to distract myself from overthinking but it would just return back some time later. I think I like him because I'm concerned about what he might think of me. Or could it be that I somehow got attached to him because he is the only person talking to me now? Is there any advices on how I can handle this matter or an insight of what I'm actually feeling?

I am broken right now. I don’t know how to feel. This guy was in my life on and off for almost a decade. We broke up for awhile and recently reconnected and started sleeping together again from Aug 2019-Feb 2020. He even asked me to move in. I was in DEEP. Thankfully things didn’t work out and I haven’t spoken to him since.

I woke up to a text from my best friend this morning. Someone made a post on FB of his mug shot along with a bunch of other people’s in an attempt to out sex offenders. I thought he probably got another DUI because he’s had a drinking problem lately. But then I scrolled down and it said “enticing a minor for sexual purposes” 

I was shocked. I immediately reached out to an ex girlfriend of his who has a child with him, bless her heart. We have been good friends for awhile. And she was upset but said the minor tricked him into thinking she was 18, and when he met up for sex cops and the SWAT were there.

That doesn’t make any sense to me. I just don’t believe a whole ass SWAT team would be there unless they had hard evidence he KNEW what he was doing.

Anyway, this isn’t about me, but I am broken. I could get over him being a shitty person to me, but I NEVER in a million years thought he would touch a child. I can’t believe I let someone inside me who is capable of such evil. I’m currently mourning the person I thought he was.

I also can’t imagine what his baby’s mother and his daughter are going through, especially now that there is a whole post on FB about it. His daughter is so young and innocent and doesn’t deserve to be made fun of for his horrible actions. Also I’m pretty embarrassed for people to know me and him were ever together or having sex.

But I told my mum last night that I really was struggling - to put it lightly - but she refuse to take me to A&amp;E because they wouldn’t be able to do anything for me. Was she right - Am I being silly ?? I’m just doing really badly and I’m not getting any treatment right now .

709,"I am a digital artist and I regularly do commissions. I charge £10 for portraits and £15 for full body as each piece takes a minimum of 6 hours.

Most of the commission requests I get are from family but I don't know if I should charge them. 

My parents run my PayPal because I'm a young adult and can't open my own.
 I did their art for free as gifts, so my parents are saying if I do art for family I can't charge them.

I asked if I could do a reduced rate of £5/£10 but they said they'd have to think about it.

I think that they should pay a bit but I'm wary of asking in case it would be rude, so what do you guys think?

Heres a list of everyone:
Me- (23M)
GF- Girlfriend(24F)
R1- Good roommate and friend(24M)
R2- Shitty roommate 1(31M)
R3- Shitty roommate 2(31F)
(R2 &amp; R3 are married)

Long Version:
So I moved in my GF and her roommates back in March after the covid stuff happened and I lost my job. They started renting a house late October and everyone is on the lease except for me. 

Everything seemed quite nice and no one had any issues with each other when I first moved in, but everything started to go south once R3 wasnt getting any attention from my GF. My GF started hanging out with me a lot more instead of with R3 and R3 seemed to have gotten more jealous and guilt trippy as the months went by and its just gotten worse ever since then....

R3 is the type of person that never sees anything as her fault. Its only everyone elses fault for her suffering/sadness and its everyone else that does her wrong. Any argument that involves her being in the wrong will result in her attempting to flip it around on how the other people are in the wrong or how the other people could have done things differently to avoid her doong what she did. Basically ""I only did this because you did that instead of this"" type of BS. 

She likes to be in control of what people think of her by having this fake face on around them to the point that she will act all nice so she can play the victim card later on and most people actually fall for the BS she tells them... R3 has even attempted to turn my GF's friends against her by telling them her delusional side of her being the victim and it almost worked until the friends contacted my GF to hear her side of things.

Fast forwarding to around now. We have found out that R3 most likely hasnt been paying the utilities on time. On top of that, we have our suspicions that R3 has also been asking for extra money to cover the late fees on said utilities...(more on that a little later) We send her the money for the utilities when she asks for them to make sure that they are paid on time but the water company put a week shutoff notice on our door about a month ago and the electric bill showed that it was $520 behind payments. We confronted her to show us the full 8 page pdf of the electric bill but she has had a panic attack each time that we have asked for the pdf file. The 2nd panic attack put her in the ER since it was at work and they wanted to make sure she calmed down. 

The first page of the electric bill showed us that our suspicions are most likely correct since she asked for $72 from all of us totaled to a $360 month bill. We thought this was odd that it was this high and thats why we got the first page of the pdf. The bill showed that we owed $294.25 for this month and had an outstanding amount of $520 total....

They also have started to turn off the ac and fans in the house when they leave to make sure that its hot in the house... Its late August and its still getting near the high 80's outside... The up stairs thermostat is in their room and they have told us that we arent allowed in their room and that if we are complaining about jow high the electric bill is ti not run the ac at all.... Every time it gets turned off I go in there to turn it back on because it being in their room does not mean they own that damn thermostat. Im mostly worried about our dog because he has showed signs of panting excessively when they turn the ac off. He is a husky and does not prefer hot areas from what Ive seen.

They never offered to pay the internet bill so to retaliate for bills not being payed and R3 not giving up the 8 page pdf we have moved the internet modem router combo into R1's room and have changed the password so they cant use it... Which resulted in R2 getting upset and screaming at R1 for ""being this petty"".


Short Version: 
I moves in with my gf in march after losing my job and after a few months of being here things have gotten very stressful. R3 is the type of person that will play the victim card to make sure that people will side with her. She likes to control the narrative to make sure the other side is hated without a fight.

We pay R3 our share of the utilities but it seems that the water and electric have not been getting paid on time since the bill R3 showed us said that there was an outstanding amount of $520 that had not been paid.
They have also started to turn the ac and fans off on the central air when they leave to make sure that its hot all day. The thermostat is in their room and they have told us to not touch it or go in their room. Im mostly worried about our husky since he has been panting excessively because of the heat...

In retaliation we have made sure that they cant use the wifi on any of their devices any longer including lan by moving the router and changing the password. Which resulted in R2 getting upset and screaming at R1 for ""being this petty"".

R2 and R3 have started to say things to other coworkers to make sure that they can control the narrative to make them seem to be victims without our side being said... R3 has also tried to turn my GF's friends against her by telling them things from her delusional perspective. This almost workee until the mutual friend contacted us about the issues going on and has since sides with us.


Need advice on- The lease on renting the house ends September 30th and R2 and R3 are just causing so many issues for us. We are at the point that we feel sick to our stomachs when we have to go home or when they get home. We have a dog and a cat so its been difficult to actually find a place so we arent sure what to do.... Weve searched every website that comes up to try to find a place to rent but theres nothing.... We are afraid that they are going to do something to our animals and our valuables so we want to get out as soon as possible... R3 avoids us at all cost so confronting her about it isnt going to work and R2 only does what R3 says... Were not really sure what to do at this point other than hold out for a place... Tension is just getting high and we feel stuck in this stressful environment. 

Again sorry for the wall of text... It might just seem jumbled and might be missing some details since Im very stressed lol",22Aug2020,1
712,"
I am unable to wake up, get work done or find motivation to look for work. I lost my job earlier this year due to the pandemic. 

Like the rest of the world I've been stuck in a rut but I feel like my problem goes back to 2017 when I was first laid off. For the next 6 months my sleep cycle had reversed and I would feel unwell all the time. I got another job in the 7th month but 2 months into that job my mum passed away. I had to move back home to take care of some family stuff and I remained unemployed for a year. This was probably the worst I have ever been with sleep cycles reversed, eating junk or not eating at all, not bathing for days and not talking to anyone.

Then I moved out of my family home to another city found a job by the end of 2018 and things were all ok for almost a year but in aug 2019 my grandmother (who I was very close to) passed away leaving me shattered once again. This time to prevent the previous cycle of doom I went on a holiday soon after her funeral and it worked. I was able to get over the sea of sadness and continue working normally until in april this year when I was laid off due to covid.

Since then, I've landed two freelance gigs none of which I was able to hold on to due to my inability to wake up, meet deadlines, lethargy and constant exhaustion. With only 4 months left for the year to end I feel like a complete failure and I don't know where or how to pick myself up. 

I want to be able to wake up, go for a walk, make myself healthy lunch/dinner, find work, read etc. But all I do is sleep or binge watch tv or scroll twitter or instagram. I can't delete social media completely since I work in journalism/content. Someday are so bad that I find it really hard to wash my hair. My sleep cycle is ruined and I have constant headaches. Life is passing by. I did manage to be productive for a short period (when I figured out the gigs) by listening to podcasts (Tim pychyl and some other people) but I lost that drive soon after.

Whoever is reading this: Do you think I am just a super lazy person with no self control? Everyone seems to have to together. Am I just being a sloth. I've thought about getting counselling but it's not easy to find someone where I stay.",22Aug2020,1

716,"I have autism. I've never really been able to show people that I like them, and to be honest I've never really liked most of them anyway. There's someone that I care about a lot and I need advice.

We were best friends like a year ago, maybe a few months less than that. We would talk everyday. She would always message me to tell me good morning and we would talk all throughout the day. She is the popular girl that everyone likes and knows everyone, I don't have any friends or a nice family and am failing school. We are the opposite. 

She has saved my life multiple times from when I was really suicidal and depressed. She was the person who helped me realise that I had autism and reassured me after giving me the confidence to get tested. She's always been the one to tell me that I'm not strange and it doesn't make me any different. She's always respected me. She is the sweetest and most accepting person I know, she accepts everyone for who they are including the lgbtq+ and poc. 

We stopped being close and it makes me really sad. I don't normally feel like this towards other people. I normally don't feel emotions towards them. I don't understand how to tell her that I care about her. I've always seen other people find it so easy but I don't understand how to do it. I want her to know that she is the strongest person I know and that I miss her. I've never cried because I missed someone before and I've been crying really hard for the past hour. I've never really missed anyone at all I guess. I want my best friend back. I understand that if she doesn't want that then that's that but we've never got into any arguments or anything. 

I still talk to her and see her sometimes but it feels different. We talk about once a week/month and see each other like once every 6 months. It seems like we have both noticed that if we don't put any effort at all then we will just never talk again. I don't want that. I am scared.",22Aug2020,1

I apologize for the HUGE wall of text too (surprisingly, this is the shortest version i could get it down to). &lt;/3

&amp;#x200B;

So, let me take you back to July (last month) when my brother moved out. Literally 1 month and 1 day ago. I was able to secretly use his phone that he didn't take with him because he bought another one. I already have my own phone but it's an old hand-me-down that was used by my mom, brother AND my other brother as well and I've been using it since 2018. It's a 2013 (or 2014??) model (Nexus 4) and is an Android 5- pretty old, I know. I've begged my mom for a new phone and she's been saying that she would get it but has only gotten new devices for herself, my other siblings because they're older, friends, etcetc. Don't get me wrong, I'm absolutely THANKFUL for having a phone but this just acts like a toaster nowadays and overheats within a minute or two when I want to play a simple game like Roblox or some other fun games or even when I want to read an article - it'll heat up within 10 minutes. And my mom broke the center part of the screen lol.

&amp;#x200B;

Meanwhile, my brother's phone that he doesn't need anymore is a really nice Samsung Galaxy a8 so I use that instead when my mother isn't around. It runs any game or app perfectly with absolutely little to NO lag. You're probably wondering why I \*secretly\* use it? Oh, because my mother doesn't want a single soul touching it. It's only meant to be used for phone calling and her checking up on me and my other sibling while she's at work or elsewhere. Anywho, I disobeyed those rules (obviously) and used the a8 phone for other purposes.

&amp;#x200B;

I cannot use social media unless it's either YouTube or Reddit. Those are the only 2 things that my mom is okay with me using. I can't comment on YouTube/Reddit though for my own safety. And when I play Roblox/other games, I disable the chat whenever my mom is watching me play so she doesn't know there's a chat to begin with. Mind you, I'm 15(F) so yeah she's pretty strict but whatever I'm used to it haha.

&amp;#x200B;

So while my mom is outside or in another room, I use Discord, Snapchat, Instagram, etc on the a8 phone. I download and screenshot things like crazy like any other normal teenager, right? I always make sure I delete these things right after and even delete them from the trash bin. I try my BEST to get rid of any evidence. I'm also tech-savvy, my mother isn't, but I still erase these things off my phone just in case. I do leave stuff I might need the next day in the trash bin sometimes, though. 

&amp;#x200B;

But to my horror, something happened this morning. I woke up, did my morning stuff, came down and guess what? My sibling said that when he turned off an alarm, he swiped the alarm tab away but there were several other tabs open on the back button. 

&amp;#x200B;

The last time I used the phone was yesterday and cleared up everything so the only person to have opened this was my mom.

&amp;#x200B;

The VLC app was open and was left on this folder of saved videos. 1 video was a clip of my friend who made a hilarious tiktok and sent it in an active groupchat I'm in but Discord has trouble sometimes with playing videos so I have to download it and view it from the gallery on the phone at times. I did and it was really funny except she kinda twerked near the ending which was concerning that my mom has viewed that part. I left that video in my trash bin - completely forgetting to clear it. Then another video of my really pretty friend was also in the folder. I tried downloading it before because again, the video wouldn't play, but it wouldn't download. It finally did but I couldn't find it on the phone so I just gave up searching for it. This was followed by another video of my friend's cat that I saved for fun because it was so cute.

&amp;#x200B;

Last but not least, there was a k-pop gif I was saving for a profile picture of BTS' Dynamite MV (which I'm so proud of them breaking YT records once again). But the worst thing about this one is that I can't listen to non-christian music (I'm not even joking) so... I hope my mom doesn't know what k-pop is?? For those wondering how I listen to music: low volume in different room from my mom or just listen to it normally whenever she's not at home.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't talk to her right now due to reasons for an entire week but once the week is over, what's my explanation for these videos?

&amp;#x200B;

What do I do? My mom probably strongly believes that either 1) I use social media and talk with these people because where else would I find this videos? or 2) I'm lesbian or something (I have nothing against that, I'm actually bi but can't come out to my mom due to her strong beliefs) or 3) my sibling was using it or 4) my oldest brother, before he moved out, had these saved on the phone (which would be weird)...

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, I know it's my fault for even TOUCHING the phone but I'm stuck at this point and need advice right now. Should I delete the videos and pretend that nothing ever happened, praying that my mother forgets about it the week later? Do I just say that it must've been my oldest brother who left these videos on the phone before he moved out? (even though it can't be, he only likes medical and science-related videos. He also hates k-pop e.e) Please help, thank you. 

&amp;#x200B;

TDLR; mom searched through a phone i'm not supposed to be using and found ""girly"" videos i saved on it that indicate that i use social media or smth behind her back without her permission. i have a week to figure this out so i'll try &amp; calm down but right now i'm just frantic for help/advice. what do i do? what do i say? thank you!! :))",22Aug2020,1
721,"I feel like she doesn't really care about me but she expects me to call her but she doesn't do the same since she met her boyfriend.
They spend so much time together that we barely hang out anymore. And when we are together (like once a month for half a day) she only talks about her boyfriend. She would interrupt my story every minute like ""The same happened to my boyfriend!"". And she would continue telling her story.
I feel horrible about the fact that sometimes I wish they'd broken up.

I started making new friends (better ones) and going out more so I feel way better than before, because they are way more understanding, we have more things in common, but when I tell her about them she gets jealous. And on top of that when I try to confront her about her bullshits she acts like she is the victim.

I don't want to end our friendship because I still love her but I can't solve this problem without her.

I know I should talk about it with her but I think it wouldn't help at all. 
I just can't think of anything that will make her realize that she shouldn't simply throw away every friend she has for a relationship that won't last for more than five years (and if it will, I'm pretty sure it will end in a divorce).",22Aug2020,1
722,"I am a care aide at a dementia facility, I went to school for 6 months after highschool for this position. 


I love caring for people and that's what drove me to choose this job. My plan was to work as a care aide and save enough money to go back to school for nursing.


I have been doing this job for five years and I have learned that it is way too stressful for me. I don't feel stressed when I'm at work, in fact I'm one of the calmest staff members to have in an emergency, but once I get home I cannot stop worrying about my residents and their families. I lay awake for hours worrying if everyone is safe and happy, and this has developed into chronic insomnia. 


So I am now realizing that going into nursing would not be a good idea for me, all those extra responsibilities and duties would most likely make my after work anxiety even worse. 


I'm trying to decide what to do now. 


Here are some things I don't want in a job:


I would like a job with less stress, where I don't have humans to worry about once I go home. I am also very anti-social and wouldn't want a job where I have to be constantly meeting new people. Working with a small consistent group is fine. I cannot travel for a job as I do not have a car at the moment. 


Here are just a couple skills I would like to be able to apply at a new job: 


I am very detail oriented and a bit of a perfectionist. I like jobs where I can creatively find new and more efficient ways to complete tasks. I prefer to work alone. I like having something to show for my work, whether that's a finished product, a happy individual, or just a sense of pride. I am a very fast learner! I exceeded in school.


My favorite job I had was actually being a housekeeping supervisor in a long term care facility. I loved working alone, focusing on a task with a clear goal, and being able to change my routine. I liked not being managed. I also liked being able to show other staff better ways of doing things and helping them to be more efficient. Unfortunately this job didn't pay enough so I couldn't stay. 


I am 100% open to going back to school for another career. The only thing with this route is I would there to be a decent pay off: I currently make around $27-30/hr so if spent time and money to go back to school I would like to have a higher paying job by the end. 


I am also open to suggestions of jobs that are around my current pay rate that I wouldn't need years of schooling for. 

I live in Canada.

If anyone has any ideas or suggestions, please let me know! I have been thinking about this for months and the only things I have come up with are: architecture (being able to create something would be cool) and other jobs in the health care field with less stress (X-ray technician, medical tool sanitizer). But I'm sure there's probably tons of jobs that would suit me that I just haven't thought of. Truly any suggestion is appreciated. Thanks so much in advance!",22Aug2020,1

I have three people I genuinely like and almost trust but still..

My fellow trainees talked shit about me when I was fairly new. I am very sensitive and take things so personally. 
I feel like almost everyone at the office doesn’t like me. I feel like I am fairly likeable. I get along with my family. In fact I have such a good relationship with my family. I have few friends yes but I don’t think I’ve had this issue.And I think I have never had issues with people. So I can’t seem to get why I can’t seem to have that click with my co-workers.
I like being happy and myself. I really don’t like it there because I have to be sth I am not. Like being fake and just being obviously chatty with people Ik don’t like me. It’s just I can’t hold them accountable because obvs.
So in short. Guys am I a bad person? Like does this mean I am not as cool, nice and likeable like I thought.  Does the fact that my co-workers don’t like me translate to who I am as a person.Should I let this experience make me self reflect about who I am.  Or is because it’s so competitive and it’s normal for people to hate each other??!

I am 22 years old and a student. Currently I have semester holidays and I am with my boyfriend in Italy (who is Italian).
I always had difficulties with being completely satisfied with me and what i am doing and i was rather jealous if someone else had success instead of being happy for them. But I thought i was just a bit too ambitious.
Since some weeks i am in Italy at my boyfriends place where everything is perfect: nice weather, beautiful landscape and my boyfriend is with me, who i really love. But then it all started with my parents telling me that they are getting divorced, as my dad found a new girlfriend. It was really unexpected for me, as my parents seemed to love each other and it was always an important backing for me to have a peaceful family. Since then i started being sad often and cried a lot. And i started being really unfair to my boyfriend. I started accusing him for unnecessary things or blamed him for being not supportive (which was really unfair, as he was there for me all the time).
This goes on now since 2-3 weeks and we fight a lot and i nearly destroyed our relationship with that. I can not recognize myself anymore and feel like a stranger for myself. But while i want to be just happy again, i have hard times fighting against my mean/bad thoughts. I don’t want to destroy my relationship because i really love this boy and need him and it breaks my heart every time i hurt him.

730,"My big sister has had a fever of over 100 for 2 days. She says that her lungs hurt along with other symptoms. I have told her that she needs to get tested, but she, along with the 4 other people in my family have made up every excuse in the book not to do so. She insists that she does not have COVID and that she does not need to get tested. My father believes that the tests are completely fake. No matter how many facts and statements that I read from google and the CDC, they all believe that I'm wrong. 

They've told me that you don't start showing symptoms until 2 weeks after, so it's no use to get tested because we'll all be infected anyway. They tell me that (apparently), you're supposed to wait 5 days after having symptoms to get tested. I tell them that she needs to visit a doctor anyway, and if all of this is true, then the doctor will confirm what they have claimed and accounted for it, but of course, they refuse.  They are insistent on believing rumors that they've heard and self-assessing the situation rather than visiting doctors or listening to the CDC guidelines. 

My family is very socially active. My brother and I play sports, and we, along with my little sister also go to school 5 days a week. I live in a very conservative state, and everyone I know either doesn't believe in the virus or is skeptical.

Hi Reddit,

I have a question/complaint I want to share.

Currently an Undergrad.

I'm interested in pursuing a Ph.D. in STEM (virology/immunology/genetics) because I think DNA rocks and it's fascinating to learn about that stuff. My stats are goodish and I'm planning to apply in a year. (GPA above 3.9, 2+ years of research, presented work at the symposium, 2 years of teaching as a TA, volunteering 300+ hours, part of 2 clubs which I love and enjoy).

I usually go home for the breaks and when I talk about applying to grad school, my folks make fun of me or say that I'm stupid. Usually with comments like, ""you're not good enough"", ""you won't make that much money' and ""doing actuary sciences is better and can get you a better job, why are you even trying to go to grad school"" or just tell me to shut up.

Not really sure who to reach out to.

Thank you for reading kind stranger",22Aug2020,1

738,"Im going to try and summarize this as much as i can. 

I am a Brit that has lived my entire life in Spain, I have reached an age where i must choose whether i am going to remain in spain and study here, or go to a university in the UK.

Initially my plans were to go to the UK and study comp sci at Bristol, a top university. However, due to the pandemic, my current financial situation doesn't allow me to go this year, i would have to take a gap year. 

As summer comes to an end, i am begging to think of how i will cope with a gap year while all of my friends go along with their lives. I have come to the realization that i get lonely quite quickly , as the deadline to apply in spain approaches, the more insecure i feel about making the decision of taking a gap year. 

Any advice would be appreciated very much.

741,"So recently my friend got in touch &amp; asked for my help with her coursework. We do the same course at uni &amp; I decided to ‘help’ because she’s currently going through some shit at home. When I said I’d help, I meant I’ll help brainstorm ideas with her or find definitions of things that she’s forgotten about. I also told her this. She has a pattern of coming to me to do quite hefty tasks (part of our course is practical based too) &amp; so I wanted to subtly tell her what I meant by help this time. I’m aware that this is partly my own fault as I’ve given in without saying anything before but I’m slowly learning to say no to people &amp; be more assertive. She seemed to have glossed over what I offered to help with &amp; simply made me listen to the source multiple times, jot down all the ideas I thought of &amp; then word it for her. After this, she sent me her essay &amp; told me to read over it &amp; change whatever needs to be changed. That’s essentially me rewriting the essay for her. I rewrote a few things &amp; added comments on what else needs to be changed/mentioned. I gave examples instead of actually writing it out but I’m pretty sure she didn’t bother to think of something herself as she called later &amp; said that it’s perfect now &amp; she knows that if she sat down &amp; properly did her work it would be good. Then she sent over her next essay &amp; told me to do the same again. With this I was stricter &amp; simply added a bunch of comments on the side &amp; gave her prompts because it’s not going to be useful to her if I did everything at the end of the day. What bothers me is that she asks of such tasks without thinking twice (I again recognise that I’m at fault to an extent so I’m not solely blaming her) &amp; was also checking up on me to see if I had done it. Her deadline is a few days away yet she gave me a deadline because she wanted to hand it in yesterday. I just thought that that was a bit distasteful as I am under no obligation to do that much for her &amp; then have her call &amp; text me asking if I had done it yet. I have my own life &amp; shit to take care of but it seems like she doesn’t understand &amp; I don’t want to feel like I’m being used by her. I need advice on how to let her know she’s asking for too much &amp; it’s frustrating that she keeps coming to me to do her work for her.

742,"I don't know now if I should post this here. 
I'm gonna try put this all as well as I can, but struggling to write this post properly. 

So I'm struggling allot in both dating and life in genneral. A short description of me would prop. be a ""Self-destructive depressed kisseless lonely virgin with social anxiety"". 

Basecly i got social anxiety, very little confidence ( actually like I'm the opposite of confident tough il get into that in a bit) and have very little social skills. ( Mainly due to getting bullied, mocked and outcasted trough allot of my childhood. The last 4 years I've mostly just been alone in my room all day, ever day. I also get very easily stressed among people my age, I see everyone as a possible ""danger"" perse. 

Also fair to mention two things, tough not so important I guess. Basecly most people would say I got body ""dysmorphophobia"" I think. Pretty much most that have seen me claim I look normal, but I disagree. In reality mostly what I think about is how I look ( hair, height, skin, face, so on). I'm more or less obsessed with it.

Secondly its fair to mention I have a toxic and self destructive personality/mindset/ideas. For starters I mean I follow the ""Blackpill"" allot ( Was part of the Incel community for some time, then left).

 I think I have sociopathic traits, such as little empathy and compassion. Like I felt nearly nothing when my grandparents died and I honestly feel little to no affection for my other family members. ( I can still see right and wrong, I tried to be nice in school and help out some people ik online when I could).

 I don't know why I'm like all this, but basecly I think it's fair to say I'm hollow, broken and maybe ""locked"". Like I rarely feel affection or empathy for others. This may not have been how I always was tough, from what I may recall I was a bit different when younger. Tough I always had big anger issues I think, even extreme ( Like I could just completely snap and think like dark toughts easily"". Tough I got way less anger issues and such now. 

Some of this stuff may be related to bullying, outcasting, lonliness, bitterness and whatever else I've experienced in life. 

I just don't know what to do tbh. Like I'm just kinda a really bad broken hollow person I guess? Like I'm just not there? I don't love anyone in my life or feel affection for them. I have zero interest in having a family. I don't consider my words might hurt someone before I speak them. I don't feel much remorse. So on. I try to be a decent person and so on, but idk.",22Aug2020,1
743,"One of my closest friends/roommate drinks quite often. She talks openly about her mother's issues with alcohol (she definitely is an alcoholic and has been for many years, and has health issues as a result of it is my understanding) which obviously are a risk factor for her own development of an addiction. She doesn't get sloppy drunk or anything like that (it's happened but isn't often) but it still seems like something I shouldn't altogether ignore and should handle carefully. She's very much the type to joke about her enjoyment of drinking and ""own"" it, so to speak. But seeing her mom go through it obviously weighs on her as much as she shoves it under the surface and to some degree I know she's worried it could become an issue for herself.

I'm not sure exactly how often she drinks, but I know she likes wine most nights and it isn't uncommon for her to drink most or all of a bottle. It has increased during quarantine, as is the case for I'm sure very many. I wouldn't qualify her as an alcoholic based on the official criteria and based on what I know, but she's skirting the line, and I think it could definitely blossom into a problem. 

We do drink together on occasion, but it is mainly a glass of wine or two while watching movies every couple of weeks during quarantine, or a bigger night out drinking occasionally pre-pandemic but it's never been frequent.

I do not want to overstep. I do not want to insert myself where it is not my place. I am not trying to ask how to be her therapist or stage an intervention.

But from my position - one of her best friends - what is the appropriate role to have? What behaviors should I adopt and things should I avoid to be the right kind of support for her? Not to control her, and I am in no way judging her, I just don't want to enable anything that could be harmful to her in the long run and I want to be there to guide her the right way if need be.

Any advice is appreciated!",22Aug2020,1
744,"So I was talking to a friend about dreams and I talked about always being able to lucid dream but because of that I experience sleep paralysis and night terrors, which are different from nightmares. I might have a hyper imagination because my dreams seem very real to me, I can taste, touch, smell and hear things and sometimes I mix up dreams with reality. It’s hard to explain but depending on the type of dream I had in the night will determine the kind of day I have or what mood I will be in. 
  
   I have developed a habit of biting the inside of my cheek and tongue to the point of drawing blood and blisters inside my mouth and sore when I wake up in the morning. I have a certain sleep position that I have to be in order for me to fall asleep, and it causes my arms to fall numb all throughout the night, I’ll wake up with a sore neck or my back will hurt even when sitting straight. I never gave any of this much thought as I’m used to all of it and don’t find it weird but he said I should go see and specialist for sleep therapy because and I quote “because they could be caused by extreme stress and anxiety” and I just??? I used to smoke marijuana to see if it would help with my anxiety and it did but it causes me to have insomnia and sleep apnea. So I stopped beginning of this year. I was diagnosed with insomnia and was provided medication for it which helped me sleep through the night no problem but I woke up drained and tired still. I am a nervous person but It’s not serious, I think most introverts are this way and are just uncomfortable around people and groups. Everyone acts different in certain situations. 

  All these things I listed are some of the very necessary things I need in order to sleep, even if it’s cause for discomfort. It’s like a person with ticks, sometimes you have to count all your steps before you get to your car and I you miss one number you HAVE to restart. Sometimes I will try to not to bite anything but then a few seconds later I’m back to biting myself, I’ll try different sleep positions but wake up with my  limbs completely numb and an aching neck and back. I just wanna hear from others to see if I’m really in need of help or if it’s all just normal, I never paid attention to it but now I’m second guessing everything about myself.",22Aug2020,1

He would always sit next to me, close to me.

I started secondary school here 3.5 years ago and since then I have predominantly been depressed and frustrated with the fact that it’s so hard to get stuff done and express yourself the way you want. As a result I wanted to move out (technically run away but I’m 18 so it would be moving out) without the knowledge of my family (however I would still be keeping in touch with them at my new place).

The problem with this is that:
1. I’m still in primary school and on my last year but I told myself that I would either kill myself or move away so I’m choosing life 
2. I would be moving back to America without any diploma’s ect. so I would need to get everything (e.x. Ged, SAT, ACT). These aren’t hard for me but just take up a lot of time.
3. I do the highest level of school in a foreign language and am on my last year but really can’t take it anymore.
4. My family is the only reason I’ve been here for so long so I don’t want them to get angry about this decision. I would want them to support me through this and be there for me.

I feel like I just put up with him specifically. I never really wanted another younger sibling especially cause I have so many (now 4) and I was under the impression that the now 2nd youngest was gunna be the last one.

This younger sibling is the spoiled brat in the family as the only boy and the youngest in a VERY traditional Chinese family.

The school is allowing us to live on campus and has a mix of in-person, online, and mixed classes. However, I only have online classes, so there isn't a big academic attraction. 

Seeing all of the colleges closing and having problems, combined with the worrying outlook that I'm seeing in some of my classmates, makes social gatherings seem like aomething to avoid.

The state is struggling with the pandemic more than my home state, with a lower population, more daily cases, and a higher positivity rate. 

My only big drawback that I can see is that I would be harming my roommates experience. I've talked to him about my concerns, and while he does want to have a double, he says that I should be comfort and safety first, and that he can get through the first few months in a single until I come up for winter trimester (if the school is open). 

All of this makes me very apprehensive about going up there in a couple weeks. Luckily, I can back out pretty easily since my classes are online anyways, just will forfeit my room payment.

I'm 20 years old (F) living in the PNW (US and in the hub of big NGOs), did college in high school, have about 3 years of volunteer experience (such as teaching kiddos, food bank, etc), remotely worked as an intern for a midwifery clinic + a gov public health clinic (3 m/o), and am currently doing research. 

Since graduating in June of this year, I've been applying to countless jobs be it government, clinics, etc. Out of all of my apps (about 15), I've recieved 1 email (a rejection letter after 3 months of waiting for a response lol) and 1 interview (went well but got ghosted 😬). This past week, I applied to 4 more jobs. Also, these jobs are primarily entry-level positions-ones that only require a Bachelors in a related health field or HS diploma. 

It's been a very stressful time and has been for the majority of my friends who are trying to enter the job force as well.

 I feel like a disappointment to my family especially as my parents are both asian immigrants and have worked so hard to provide for my family even without obtaining a college education. 

So what should I do? Keep applying for jobs or take a stab at grad school? 

But I also feel like I'm rushing too fast and never really got a chance to take a break since I was dual enrolled in college + high school. 🥴

I have always been eyeing graduate education not only for career advances but for networking and enriching my knowledge. I'm interested in a dual MSW and MPH program. However, I'm worried about the cost of education (I have about 6k in student loans) and my lack of experience in the PH and Social Work fields. 

So there's my dilemma lol can't get a good job without a graduate degree but can't get into grad school without 2,000 hours of experience 🥴😔

None of that is true. None of that ever happened. I never did such things. He admitted that he never saw me doing any of those things, but it's what he heard. He said the children are scared of being alone with me in the elevator. He said the people in the flat are angry with me and want to call the cops on me.   

Just now, another neighbor came to my door. I had seen him before, but we had never spoken. He keeps to himself as well. He has two little girls and a little boy. He also said he heard I was taking pictures of children. He didn't say ""of people"", like the other neighbor, he only talked about children. Again, this guy said he never saw me do it (because I didn't), but that he had heard about it. Both these men started out in an accusatory tone, but quickly calmed down once I denied everything.    

Still, I feel enormously unnerved. I'm shaken to my core. At first, I was just unsettled when the first neighbor told me about it. Now that one has come to my door, I'm starting to feel unsafe. I don't know what to do. What can I do? I have no way of knowing if they believe my denials. I don't know with whom the story originated (they wouldn't tell).

Very long story short, I (27F) need to react to harassment and libelous comments from a former friend (also F27.) We are in the USA.

We got into a fight that was years overdue. Honestly we grew apart and never acknowledged it and I think we got to be resentful of each other. 

Things blew up and now she is incessantly texting our mutual friends and my family (!!!) talking shit about me. Most of it fabricated, and some of the fabricated statements are very very bad. I just want her to leave me alone. I’m sick of getting messages from other people with screenshots of what she says to them. It’s over a dozen people at this point and it’s been a week. 

The attorney I spoke to regarding harassment said he can send a cease and desist letter, but warned it might make her behavior escalate. We live three hours apart (I moved away after college) so I don’t think she would show up in person. I can’t ask her to talk because she blocked me and my fiancée before starting this ridiculous amount of drama. 

Should I pursue the C&amp;D letter, or just ignore her until she goes away?",22Aug2020,1
773,"Sorry if this doesn't exactly fit in line with this sub. r/sexualassault doesn't appear to have been active in about a year when I look at the sub.

When I was younger (F - 7 years old) I had a neighbor that was a year or two older than me(M) and we would have play dates. He would constantly talk about how he would have 3 or 4 girlfriends in rotation (that he would rank) and his mom would drive them to places and they would make out in the back of her car and she wouldn't even notice.Yes, make out even at this young age. He would talk about how I could be in the rotation of girlfriends if I wanted and would repeatedly tell me that we should make out. I do vaguely remember being uncomfortable at first, but he brought it up so often that I finally caved and made out with him. We would have these heavy make out sessions that would last like an hour that involved tongue, at 7 years old, and there was major heavy petting going on above the waist. He never went below the waist and I don't remember him touching my chest, but he would touch my arms and stomach heavily. There was tongue involved too. 

I remember initially being resistant to all of this, but over time it happened so frequently that I began to like it and would want to hang out with him again. These long make out sessions lasted for about 2 years a few times a week and the thought of it makes my skin crawl now. After those 2 years, I moved to a different neighborhood and we lost contact, however I would see him around campus at my middle school and he would frequently try to say hi to me but I would walk past him and ignore him because I was ashamed and scared he was going to tell everyone what we did, but he never did. Part of me wonders if this was some form of sexual abuse but I question it because over time I did go along with it and liked it. Looking back now the thought of a 7 year old doing what I was doing makes me feel sick. Just typing this out actually makes me feel sick. I've never told family or friends about this. I told my ex boyfriend but that is the only other person that knows.

So, was this abuse or was this just a kid that was around my age that was more sexually mature? I really am not sure about this. And if it was abuse, does this necessarily mean that I'm affected from it to this day in ways I don't realize? Or can something like this occur and not affect you that deeply? What are my next steps if this was assault?",22Aug2020,1

775,"I’m typing this frantically. Okay so when I was 3 months my mom got a dog for my sister who was 8 at the time. The dog she got was a 6 months old male. Well call him T. As a toddle/ kid I was never allowed a relationship with T because my sister wouldn’t allow it. I ended up getting my own dog because of that and I never really cared about him till I was 11.

So fasts forward to me being 11 and my sister being 17 she got pregnant, and she drops him. By this point we have 3 dogs, T and 2 others. I was the primary care givers to the other two so I took picked up and took care of him. I feed him, bathed him and when I got a job I started paying for his vet bills. When I was 14 my sister got pregnant again and moved out.

Now I’m 15 and he got flees. He had all the flee protection and still got them. I called the vet and got the medicine for all 3 dogs, along with a flee shampoo and itch relief spray. And I washed him today. THE SAME DAY WE FOUND OUT HE HAD FLEES. I cancelled my plans with my friend to deal with it. 

My mom just told me that my sister is coming to pick him up. I think this is a terrible idea. She lives in a tiny trailer with no space. She’s already said that she doesn’t feel an emotional attachment with her first born. And hardly pays attention to him. My moms reason is that 1) it’s her dog 2)she doesn’t have the emotional bond or time to commit to him 3) he sick, they’re going to rip him away from the other dogs, one of which is his ‘girlfriend’. (He’s very attached and will cry if he’s alone without her)

A lot of my negative interactions with people has been because I’ve done something like this.

I’ve annoyed family members and friends with this, and turned off other people because of it. I’ve even been told that I do this before. I feel gross and unnecessary whenever i’m told to stop doing something or talking about something. My mouth always seems to get me in trouble.

778,"Hi guys, just wondering if I could get some advice on this. My gf (26F) left me (22M) mid July. Haven’t heard from her since. She always had male friends &amp; I was ok with that. I thought it was pretty cool. As long as it was platonic when you’re in a relationship. She told me that 3/4 of her male friends that she talks to have slept with her before &amp; I wasn’t sure how I felt about that. I always think that as soon as an outside friendship requires a measurement of whether or not it is acceptable, it has already ceased to be platonic. She used to message lots of guys &amp; messaged them calling them “cutie” &amp; sending cute emojis &amp; stuff. I did find it hard because I tend to leave all of my past in my past. I wouldn’t ever want stupid stuff from my past ruining something beautiful that I have currently. There was differences between us in that sense. The only females that I would message with any cute stuff or hearts &amp; stuff would be family members. From what I saw, there was indications of a strong emotional connection with her &amp; 1 guy in particular. It’s understandable that it can impose quite a strain on a new boyfriend who is trying to build a strong (&amp; exclusive) emotional connection with their S/O. Fighting about it wasn’t an option, because that’s just another way of getting to a breakup in a much slower &amp; painful way than just getting it over with. Neither of us were going to be happy living under “conditions” that the other would prefer. I had considered ending the relationship in May because I couldn’t handle it. Nobody could’ve defined the parameters &amp; boundaries in our relationship other than us. I felt that by keeping in frequent contact with these guys, the door to reconciliation will be kept slightly ajar. The pseudo friendships definitely make me feel weirded out &amp; gives me the feeling of “unfinished business”. Some people simply can’t face the inevitable grief that the correct complete separation of both parties would engender. I mean, I did message past flings or old relationship partners once a year or something like that, but we wouldn’t ever have any serious deep emotional connection &amp; maintain constant contact. Especially not with any type of intent or any cute messages or anything. We ended up having more &amp; more arguments for 2/3 weeks &amp; she left me. She went back to her own country &amp; just left me high &amp; dry. so basically I just feel as if there was always a door open for any unresolved emotions between her &amp; these guys. Sometimes old feelings may temporarily revive &amp; lead to fatal attractions, betrayal &amp; guilt. On a case by case basis, sometimes seeking &amp; maintaining friendship is the cover excuse for keeping him/her in your life. I’m wondering if this is me being insecure or is it normal for me to expect that in a relationship? Do I need to re-evaluate my views on “guy friends” even if there was sexual intimacy in the past &amp; if there’s still daily contact between them?",22Aug2020,1

781,"Hey Guys!

I'm in a weird position where I have gotten a job offer that is very much to my liking but I am not sure whether I should accept or not. Much of it is down to timing.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently I am working a Tier 1/2 IT Support job at what is probably one of the biggest company HQ in my current town. I have been here for 5 years and am very much appreciated and have a great professional relationship built up and work/life balance. I am however kind of limited in terms of career advancement and options.

In comes this great company that found me on Linkedin that is offering me a proper Support Engineer job at Tier 2 to start with, with the intent (not guarantee) to get me to a Tier 3 Support Engineer role within a year or two after starting.

&amp;#x200B;

While base pay would increase from 60k to 75k annually, the fact I have good bonuses and no state tax plus the commute going from 15min to 30-45 mins (one way) means that financially I would (initially) come out at +-0 change in net income. If we do get me to Tier 3 I would likely only really see a 10k increase annually (net).

What is making me draw out the decision are things I never thought would be important when I was younger (39 now). My wife is under pressure at her current job working 12h shifts more often than not, currently me being so close to home and hours that are closer to hers means I can be here for her.

I have thanks to my seniority and company culture a huge flexibility that is likely unheard of. I can literally say ""guys I need to take off 3h early today"" without even explaining myself because I need to be there for her or take care of some appointment. I don't have to stress about my work or life situation. If I take this job not only does it offset my schedule +1 hour but also more time lost thanks to the commute so anything between 90-120 mins offset a day that I lose with her.

&amp;#x200B;

At the same time while these are real issues: in writing they seem a lot more frequent and overblown in importance than they are, they are genuine considerations in what flexibility I have now but not critical in any way. It's just that I have a far easier life right now than having to change up my day and commit to an new life and career.

If I take this job I get the technical challenge and opportunity to become more of an expert in my field and other fields I did not even think about entering (IT security). This is literally what I was envisioning 15 years ago as the desired career when I graduated University.

However this will be an effort and this opportunity is coming at a time when I know some major personal things for my wife and my family are coming up where I know my current work/life flexibility will help in reducing potential stress and practical issues.

&amp;#x200B;

I am so conflicted in what is more important to me: an opportunity or the current ""easy"" life I have. I try and figure out what questions to ask myself to try and make sense of this, but I am also stressing myself out about it that I have a hard time doing so... so here I am!

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you.",22Aug2020,1

786,"So, my brother and sister in law ( I’m just going to call them Ben and Carol, not their real names) have a 29 year old daughter, a single mother of a 3 yr. old ( calling the mom Jen and the 3 yr. old Annie, not their real names). Jen has really never matured mentally much past the age of 18 in high school. Jen is not stupid, but average intelligence none the less. Much of the problem with Jen is she has been never disciplined by her mother or her dad entire life. But Carol was a stay at home parent all Jens life so therefore she was the main influencing parent as Ben worked a successful business and he was busy and away from home much of the time. Carol is not a person who can not handle confrontation, and this is according to Carols own mother who said Carol has been this way her entire life. Of course Jen has manipulated and controlled her mother since birth. As Jen got older in her teenage years she became cruel mean and as Carol told me one time scary because Jen began to verbally attack her mother if she did not get her way. Carol was attempting to use discipline but to late by then. By then Ben started to step in and put his foot down but only backfired by Jen moving out one evening, because Ben asked Jen to clean up the dinner dishes and load the dishwasher, and in with her boyfriend. A year later Ben gets a call in the middle of the night from Jen to get her because the boyfriend tried to strangle her and kill her. Of course he rushes to get her and Jen moves back in all still mean and ungrateful as ever. Never saw any marks on Jen and Carol and Ben did not get her to a hospital or doctor. Sorry this is so long but a backstory is important. Jen never saw the boyfriend again. Then in the years to follow Ben pays for beauty school for Jen and when that didn’t work out he put her through dental assisting school. By now Jen is using marijuana and can’t pass a drug test to go work in a dentists office. Boyfriends come and go. Jen still lives at home and is lazy her clothes literally all over the floor of her room and her bathroom is gross. She does nothing no chores no responsibility’s whatsoever. Carol has resigned herself to this fact and shuts the door to Jen’s room and stays out of that bathroom. But Ben and Carol have cut her off by now to money and only feed her and give her basic essentials. Finally Jen get a pretty good job at a online distributing warehouse but Carol pees in a bottle for Jen and attaches it with tape to keep it at body temp for a drug test of which Jen passes. Jen works this job for a year and a half but complains of back pain and is diagnoses with fibromyalgia. She takes medication along with smoking pot. And Jen is only 24 at this time. Truly this job is hard work and a long commute time both back and forth. I was surprised to see Jen stay at it as long as she has and I try to praise her when I see her. Then it gets worse. Jen gets a new boyfriend and Ben puts both Jen and boyfriend in a nice single wide on the back of his property where they and Ben and Carol have privacy. My first thought boyfriend is a loser. A few months later Jen announces she is pregnant. And using pot. I lose my temper with Ben and tell him it’s not to late for Jen to terminate the pregnancy. But Carol has delusions of being a grandmother maybe for the one and only time Jen is pregnant. And I was told to “be nice”. Then when Jen was about 5 months along she runs to Bens house in the middle of the night because boyfriend tried to kill her by shoving her face into the bed. By the time Ben gets to the trailer he’s gone but the trailer is destroyed inside. Both Carol or Ben never thought to check on it while Jen was living in it. Exit boyfriend. Jen is getting what she wants. Her parents to take care of her and abuse them again as well. I begin to distance myself from all of them it’s just too heartbreaking to watch. Annie is born a very pretty baby but I can’t bond because I am angry at the way Jen has twisted and used to get what she wants so I still remain distant. And I am angry at Carol for allowing all of this to happen with seemingly no regard to Ben or anyone else. Slowly all their friends have distanced themselves from Ben and Carol. None  of them call anymore. And Carol and Ben are technically raising their granddaughter as Jen can’t emotionally be responsible. Ben should retire soon but can’t because of the added responsibility of a grandchild. And Carol spends most of her time “helping Jen with Annie”. Carol is exhausted all the time, but won’t admit it because of pride. There it is Ben wants to go to a counselor but because of strict child abuse laws he has to be careful who he goes to. Or they could lose Annie forever. My gosh, I am always in prayer but what I’m afraid of is stress is going to put Ben in an early grave. I don’t have any ideas now on what to do next. If there is anything at all that can be done.",22Aug2020,1
787,"Just got back from a party, friend who I got a lift with told me he was going home. I asked if he was ok and he said yes but I could see he was upset. I was slightly drunk so I said ill come with you. While we were driving he didn't talk at all, which is not like him. When he dropped me off he coldly said goodbye. So I stopped him and said what's wrong. He eventually told me that another guy there (who always goes too far) said some personal shit to him, that only a few people know. Which was me or another guy. I feel really crap about this but I know I would not say anything to anyone else about him. Especially not this guy. I told him I did not say anything and never would but I don't think he completely believes me and I can't blame him. He won't tell me what the guy said. I messaged the guy and he said he doesn't know what I'm talking about. At the same time, I'm scared that I did say something even though I know I wouldn't. Don't know what to do in this situation.

But then I responded and I asked a question to try and get a conversation going, and I now have been waiting a few days again with nothing.

If they’re busy, I understand, but sometimes this friend will look at my text and want to respond to it when they’re less busy, but then they completely forget about it.  We used to see each other all the time, so we mainly talked in person, so this wouldn’t be a big deal, but because of COVID, we haven’t been together in person for a while. 

My question is, how long should I wait until I either resend the text I sent before or send a new one?  Is a week ok?  I don’t want to be pushy, because I know they’re busy, but I’m not expecting a long, time-intensive conversation.  I’m just wanting them to respond to me when they have a few minutes.  I use texting more like email, so I don’t expect immediate responses, or a lot of responses in one day.

I should also note that the first thing they were busy with should be over by now, so I’m assuming that the reason they haven’t texted me back is because they forgot",22Aug2020,1

Well the guy kept staring and smiling at me and at some point while we were drinking he came to talk to me. He made it obvious he liked me and even looked at her like meh I’m with her now. The girl didn’t feel jealous or freak out. If it was me I would’ve reacted. I’m really hot. Men usually don’t hit on me or treat me like crap. I did like this guy and he was pretty cute and it’s hard to find guys who like me despite me being really pretty. I wanted to get his number but forgot to ask and my phone was dead.

That it's maybe because of acne meds which can have some side effects. I just can't tell how I feel. I don't think it's depression because I don't have any problems doing anything or concentrating. I think it could be due to too much masturbating and porn watching since I was young. Maybe it affected me? 

I escalated to some fetishes which I was disgusted by and I don't want that anymore so I quit that in order to keep my mind sane and healthy from that. I'll quit watching porn so my mind can recover from it. I was reading a lot recently about those things and maybe I made myself feel like this because of overthinking? Maybe I'm formed like this because I went through a lot of parents fights when I was younger and quite feared a lot. What should I do? I don't fucking know.

I wasn’t sure if it was me just buying glue (or whatever it needs) to stick them on or if they should be thrown out after one use. 
Second, I wanna wear black liquid eyeliner but I’m not sure which brand is best. Is there a specific brand that you could recommend for me as a beginner? Also hopefully the brand isn’t too expensive or else my mom will shut down my idea.
Same question but for mascara ^^
Lastly I was curious about fake lashes as well. My question for acrylics and lashes are pretty much the same, can I reuse them or should I buy more after one use? 


Any help on makeup would be greatly appreciated even if it’s something I didn’t mention. If there brands for other makeups that you recommend, then please inform me. Once I turn 18 I’m gonna try to wear makeup frequently and hopefully I’ll be good with it lol.

So I’m 19M and spent the last few years(5 years) of my life in an all boys boarding school before moving to that school I went to a small private school in my home country were there weren’t many girls and now I’m going into university in the new country l live in

Problem is due to covid their won’t be many foreigners going to the university I don’t get along with people from the country I live in and along with that I hear and know about girls from this country from people in my class and I really woudnt wanna even be with them (plus I went on a joint school field trip with some girls from another school in this country and I hated them not cause personality just cause I found them wierd plus most of them bieng a bunch of sluтs )

I don’t really know any girls and my interaction with them has been practically zero apart from meeting some of my friends gfs 

So my prospects are gonna be pretty bad since the number of foreigners would be Minute does a girl automatically say no if a guy is inexperienced/a bit nervous and a bit awkward around them

802,"If this is the wrong place to talk about this, I deeply apologize. 

I've not been around many toxic people to realize what behaviors are toxic. But today, after an argument, I realized that it's possible my dad is harboring some toxic behaviors. **I just need a second opinion to confirm my feelings, and then I can figure out what to do next.** 

My dad is a wonderful person; he takes care of his family, he makes us laugh, he offers his help whenever we need it. But he's not perfect. 

When me or my mother talk with my dad about things around the house (clutter, dishes, laundry, trash, etc), it often feels like we are being shutdown and can't get through to him. This is only when we're talking about *his* behavior. I always come out of the conversation feeling like I'm not being listened to, or that I'm dumb for overreacting.

We've always had problems with dishes piling up. My mom has many bodily issues that are getting worse overtime, and she can't stand at the sink and do the dishes like she could when we were younger.  

My sibling and I get told a lot to wash out our dishes after use; my brother doesn't do it as much, but I have made it a routine to do so. 

My dad barely ever washes out his dishes. He sits in his room with many dishes lying around. If he brings it downstairs, he just sets it on the left side of the sink and doesn't wash them. They sit there for days, until my mom who's hates having a dirty house, has to wash them herself again. He does the same thing when he's cooking. My dad and I like to cook together. He's made a comment once that really ticked me off because he never says it to my brother. As he was washing out a pot, he said, ""Make sure you wash out your pans and utensils after using them so they don't pile up.""

I don't think he favors my brother, but he certainly lets him get away with many things. I do everything I'm asked. But when it's my brother, it goes ignored. My brother also never takes out the trash unless it's my dad who tells him to do so, but that's a whole 'nother story. 

My dad, telling us to wash out our dishes when he doesn't even follow the same rule. When my mom and I brought up my dad's behavior a couple years ago, he tried to play it off like we were overreacting. His favorites quotes are ""*So what?*"" ""What about when *you*..."" ""That's why...(proceeds to bring up something another family member did)"" He also laughs as if it isn't a big deal to him, while we're being serious.

And I made sure I pointed out ""We're not talking about *this*, we're talking about ***you***."" We weren't yelling at him, just having a conversation, pointing out his behavior. But it got swept under the rug because he doesn't want to admit when he is wrong. Since then, we've just stopped saying anything about it because 1. it will turn into an argument between my parents, or 2. no progress is ever made, nothing changes. 

**So is he really being toxic, and is there something I can do/say to him to make him step back and realize?**",22Aug2020,1
803,"Just as the title says. She’s a 2 year old shelter cat. I’ve had her for almost three months. She’s a nipper with a short temper, and nips and scratches even at innocuous stimuli. For example if I rest my hand too close to her for long enough, she would nip. Lately, we had been getting closer. She was biting less, scratching less, and being less aggressive and more playful.  
  
I have other cats in the house. She swipes at them too even if they’re walking too close to her. Lately, she had been becoming less aggressive towards them too. She even began playing with them.  
  
I didn’t want her to scratch the other cats with her long claws (I’m guessing nobody has clipped for a long time). In addition, I noticed they started snagging in the carpet. So I took a blanket and tried to clip her nails after a play session, so she was tuckered out.  
  
She didn’t like it, of course. She scratched at me and tried to bite me. I felt my own temper rising, that she wouldn’t let me do this for her. I pinned her down and tried to clip her nails forcefully. I did this several times, but I couldn’t clip them. She began to growl in a high pitched tone, and she did get my hand a little bit.  I cornered her, and i trapped her several times.  
  
Even throughout her growling, she would come close to me and sniff me, and let me pet her. I think she mostly associated the stress with the blanket that i covered her in. I feel so bad. I really pinned her down. With my hands and tried to trap her with my thighs. Afterwards, I gave her many treats and played with her a little, which she was receptive to. But she also panted, which I read online is due to stress.  
  
She is sleeping right now, belly up so I know she’s in a deep sleep. I think I tired her out. I haven’t tried to pet her yet, I feel just awful and the worst cat owner.  
  
I honestly don’t know if she’ll trust me again?. I’ll let her sort out her feelings until she can trust me again, which might take forever I don’t know. I think I’ll have to get her sedated for a professional nail clipping at the vet. I don’t think I will ever try to do it myself again, I just get so angry. I don’t want to hurt her physically.  
  
Did I cause trauma to my cat? I don’t know. Although she looks relaxed right now.. is there any advice for my situation?",22Aug2020,1
804,"For context I’m a 16 year old guy and the friends I’m talking about are two 16 year old girls. We go to school with this one guy that I’ve always hated and for a while one of the two also viscously hated him until it randomly flipped about a year ago. I hate him because to me he has major male manipulator vibes and used to talk smack about me even though we’d only talked like once. All petty stuff til bout a year ago when the friend I was talking about that viciously hated him for a year told me some shit about him that didn’t surprise me at all but still felt shit that it involved her. She basically said he had continuously tried to grope her sometimes in public which she said made her even more uncomfortable because she couldn’t push him off and tried to kiss her multiple times despite her directly saying no and trying to get him off and also the fact that he knew she had a boyfriend at the time ( not like it should make a difference if she’s saying no anyway ).

I was pissed obviously, she told our entire group and everyone seemed pissed thank god. It really didn’t seem out of character for the guy and she’d made jokes about him grabbing her before she seriously came to us to talk to us about it before so I can say I’m 99% sure she was telling the truth, plus there was just no reason she would lie.

So a year goes by from then and I find out that another girl in the group who is fully aware of what happened with our friend and this guy is now talking to the guy pretty much every day. She keeps telling me about how nice he is and how kind he is. Don’t know if other guys get this but I can always read when a guy is changing his personality to play girls, it’s so fucking obvious to me and other guys I know but somehow girls always fall for it and any time I try and say shit she pushes it off like it’s nothing.

Another piece of super relevant piece of information, three other close friends of mine have now told me about how this guy groped them and wouldn’t stop even after they tired to push him off and how he would physically block them so they couldn’t get him off. They told me stuff that wasn’t even bordering on the edge of this could be just someone talking shit too far but was clearly sexual assault and finally after years other people were starting to clock on to how weird this guys behaviour was.

So me and my friends have a small party with just our main friendship group, so only 15ish of us and it’s like 3am so a lot of people have left and those who haven’t are asleep around the house. It’s just me the girl who was assaulted by this guy that I first talked about and the girl who has been talking to this guy recently and I see the girl who’s been talking to him is snapping this guy, I think she notices I saw cause she starts super loudly gassing him up. She keeps talking bout how great a guy he is, like she is gassing him up so much it feels out of place and then the girl who was sexually assaulted by him starts gassing him up as well saying how great a guy he was.

I’m kinda in shock cause it was about two months ago that she had been talking about how creepy and weird he was and now she’s saying she talks to him every day and he’s the coolest. So I kinda start to say how I fully don’t get where there coming from and sorta end up bringing up the stuff about him groping her and she started acting like what he’d done was normal that it wasn’t actually assault. I get how she can invalidate her own assault I know that’s a super normal response to being assaulted, but the other girl is on her side saying that he was just being stupid and it wasn’t his fault. So I bring up the sexual assault of the three other girls I don’t tell them names, but I give a vague idea of what happened, so I’d understand if they didn’t trust that he’d actually assaulted the girls and that’s what I kinda assumed would happen but they completely believe it. Like I said before he seemed like the type they were agreeing with that and believed the stories because of that, but they didn’t find the stories to be at all negative on this guy. They were saying how sometimes he just takes things too far and wasn’t a bad guy because of it, in which they clearly meant they were still gonna talk to him and still thought he was super cool despite them  believing he had assaulted three girls and for one of the two girls believing he had assaulted essentially her best friend and defended that.

I was kinda pissed but when i mentioned the assaults they basically waved it away in a matter of seconds. I fully can not understand why they would act like that. Like I can not understand how the one girl would defend him despite knowing what he did to her best friend and I don’t really understand why the girl would defend him after he assaulted her. I don’t know want them to be friends with this guy who I’m sure is responsible for more assaults than I even know and is crazy manipulative, but I know I can’t try and control who they’re friends with. I just don’t know what to do and how to feel about all this shit.",22Aug2020,1

807,"Hello fellow redditors, using a throwaway for this one.
I (21) am in need of some advice. We had a company event where we went out drinking. We all had a few beers and the evening lasted a little bit longer into the night than we anticipated beforehand so I told my coworker (16m) with a position above mine that he could crash at my place since I have an extra mattress he could use. He knows that I have a five year old dog and I felt comfortable bringing my colleague to my place since he also has two dogs and is fairly comfortable with them. 
Still at the bar he said that he was ""so excited to sleep with my dog"" and we were all very irritated, and he brushed it off as a dumb drunk joke. We came back to my place and he and my dog got along pretty well. I told him that he shouldn't let my dog lick him and that he should not let him on his bed since he had his own, to which he said that he wouldn't mind. I responded that those were my rules and he is not allowed to do that. We went to sleep, and the next morning he still let my dog on his bed and lick his fingers even though I told him I didn't want that. We got up and ate some breakfast. My dog was chilling in the bathroom (it's cooler there) and suddenly my colleague stood up and said he had to go to the bathroom and locked himself in with my dog. I thought it was a bit weird but assumed he just really had to go and didn't mind the dog being there. Was on my phone for around 10 minutes when I heard the plaquettes on my dogs collar clirr and asked my coworker if he was okay in there. He just replied he was chilling with my dog, flushed the toilet, came out of the bathroom and jumped on the mattress on his back. That's when I saw he had half a hard on. I didn't think much of it because he's 16 and sometimes you get weird erections. Suddenly he was very eager to leave so he packed his things and left. Thinking back now to all of his jokes, the fact he had two dogs that ""would let him do anything"", him not respecting mine or my dogs boundaries, locking himself with him into a bathroom, only coming out after I asked if he was okay two times and him wanting to be a animal caregiver seems suspicious. Don't have evidence of anything happening, I really don't know what to do, please help me out (I live in Switzerland and our legal drinking age for beer is 16)",22Aug2020,0

812,"First time poster so I’m sorry if format is wrong or this isn’t really the right place- I just need some advice and this seems like a good place for unbiased opinions.
Growing up my parents never drank around us and when we were older never got too wild or had huge parties where things got out of hand. My siblings and I are all grown now and I have a son (2m) that they are very close with. However they now cannot seem to do anything without a drink and very often have a ton of people over where everyone is drinking and, now that it’s legal, smoking weed. This in itself is not an issue, they’re adults and can do what they wish. My husband and I also drink- but only when someone is babysitting. It bothers me that they invite us over for a pool day and don’t tell us it will actually be a get together with all their friends, or when we do things in the middle of the day, going on the lake etc, they seem to be fine getting drunk and having their other guests smoking/drinking and then get upset with us when we choose to leave as we don’t think it’s appropriate/safe for our son to be around- especially as swimming/boating is usually involved. 
The advice I guess I’m asking is how do I handle this? Do we stop seeing my parents aside from mornings at their house/inviting them over when we know it will be JUST them? Do I sit down next time they say I’m “being dramatic” and ask how they would feel when we were young if their friends were drinking and doing recreational drugs?

We will be hitting 2 years together in 2 months and have had a ""rough patch"" for the last 3ish months as his mental illness just got way worse. He needs more help than a few free college counselling sessions that I made him go to.  I've tried my best, but he isn't trying enough. It affects me a lot, he has said stuff that really really hurt my feelings. I've cried over it. He always tries to make up for it but it shouldn't happen in the first case. 

He doesn't mean to, but he has said stuff like ""growing up I always thought I'd have a really skinny tall girlfriend, guess I thought that was the ideal growing up, but I've always found women with your body type attractive too and I *adore* your body"" (curvy 5ft1 woman, 120lbs). He has overshared his past feelings for other girls, including one we know who he once masturbated to a picture of, before we got together (that one especially hurt). There are so many other examples I could give but irrelevant. I cried over something he said over the phone 4 nights ago, which he didn't mean but I just thought ""wtf, the right man shouldn't make you cry"". He was super apologetic and spoke to me for 30 mins to reassure me he loves me etc etc. I know it's his mental illness that makes him behave this way and that he does love me, but it is so hard. 

I never doubted him before but I'm just so tired. I guess I could happily date him for a few more months, maybe even a year, but I'm starting to think there is no way he is *""the one""* after saying those things.

However 3 girls around my age are who I would consider my “best” friends. 2 of them are friends from university. The other girl is someone I’ve known since childhood- she is not involved in this story.  The 2 university friends and I form a group of 3 close friends. We often hang out together and we have a group chat with just the 3 of us. We stay over at each other’s houses, have met each other’s families (etc). We’ve never had any kind of falling out, and I never thought I would be making a post like this. This afternoon we got dinner and drinks together and I noticed two things. 
1- It was hinted that they had attended a party at someone else’s place (another person I also know) w/o me. I didn’t think to much of it because ultimately it is up to that person to invite me, and we are not super close so it’s expected! Just that the way they brought it up was in a slightly secretive way- like they didn’t want me to know they had been there together?
2- the first thing would not have bothered me much, but when we were leaving the second friend started to talk with the first about how she was staying in a nearby country with her boyfriend’s family for a few weeks soon and that they should make plans for the first friend to come see her while she was there.
This is weird to me. Second friend was quite lit so maybe she brought it up in front of me when it was supposed to be semi-secret?

820,"So, long story short, my boyfriend of 8 months broke up with me to get back with the ex he cheated on with me which is the only reason we got together in the first place (I know, I'm a horrible person, I'm not proud of it).

His ex freaked out when she found us, understandably, she burned everything he owned and kicked him out. Looking back he probably only asked me to be with him because he had nowhere to go and just needed a placeholder until he could get back with her.

Anyway, I have never been so angry and hurt and betrayed in my entire life. I literally was so blind to how horrible he was the entire time (drinking problems, gas lit me, was going behind my back to talk and sex with other people...). I went off on him and her because she messaged me defending him after hearing I'd been telling the truth of what happened. 

What the fuck do I do? It was super recent, but I think about it a lot. I try to distract myself with drinking and sex and whatever I can find, but when I'm done with all of that and it's just me I think about it a lot and frankly want to just beat both of their asses.I'm genuinely scared I'll see them in public and do something embarrassing. 

I deleted everything of him from my phone and my apartment and whatnot, but dumb shit makes me think of him and I become insanely angry. I'm just proud I've managed not to have a meltdown and throw shit and scream and yell, but I really wish I could just to let it out.

Any help here?",22Aug2020,1
821,"I'm a 20yo female, just for reference. I have an idea of what I want to look like. But I'm afraid of 1) copying others, 2) being too much or offensive, and 3) my parents reacting the way I know they will and lowering my confidence further. 

I don't really have a style, currently. It's very confusing because I will delve into different styles, but hold myself back out of fear, so I end up with little bits of every style. I have black punk earrings with spikes and chains. I have a gigantic dragon tattoo on my back. But I also wear cuffed jeans with striped sweaters. I have done nothing to my hair. It basically just exists, mainly because I can't decide what I want to do with it.

What I want to look like right now is really specific, but I'm afraid of commiting to it and I don't even know how to start. I want a mix of punk and 80's future/neon. It sounds funny, but think of a member of the band Gorillaz.

Hair - A choppy style in bubblegum pink

Headgear - A beanie and large neon exclamation point/lightning bolt earrings as the main earrings, but in my other piercing spots the black earrings with spikes and chains. 

Necklace - Another clunky, neon or jelly piece

Top - White t-shirt crop top

Pants - Baggy cargo joggers in black, camo, or a neon color

Shoes - Boots or chunky tennis shoes with a neon stripe and laces

I feel like I'm copying others and that once I commit to it I'm going to change my mind and want a different style.

I also have no good sources for the latest fashion ideas and advice.

If anyone could give me some advice on raising my confidence and getting started embracing what I actually want to look like.",22Aug2020,1
822,"Just to add some context, I’m 17M, graduated highschool a year early because I hated it there. I didn’t have any friends and I hated all my classes and it was the worst 3 years of my life. I had no clue whatsoever what I wanted to do, and then my brother said college is really fun and I should go so here I am.

I moved in on the earliest day possible and there was pretty much no one else there. I decided to go home until my brother moved in (we go to the same college) since there would be way more people then. 

So then I moved back in and I really only know my brother and our mutual friend. My brother usually invites me to hang out with him and his friends since I don’t have any, which is nice. But I don’t really talk to anyone in that group, I just sorta hang out. I don’t know what to say so I don’t really say anything. So that’s not much fun.

The only time of really had fun was when I got drunk with my brother and our mutual friend. It was a lot of fun. Probably the most fun I’ve had in my life. But I don’t know if it’s worth going to college just to get drunk once a week. Classes haven’t even started yet and I know I’m gonna hate those.

But if I drop out I don’t know what I’ll do. I hate my life at home too. I just feel like I’m caught between 2 things I don’t like and I don’t know where to go",22Aug2020,1
823,"So, I have this friend, Rowan (not their real name), who's not in a good situation at home. I really want to do something to help, but I don't know much about them (we met online) other than that their dad is abusive, and he checks Rowan's text and call history, probably to stop them from getting help. I'm seriously worried, because my friend is being physically and psychologically abused, and as far as I know, anyone who is able to do something isn't helping. It seems like the only people who would be willing to help are unable to, or they don't know what to do. I want to be able to help Rowan somehow, though, because to be honest, I would feel guilty if I didn't.",22Aug2020,1

825,"I 21m) dated my ex girlfriend (21f) two years ago. We were both each others first loves and were young. We had a lot of fun, great times and the sex was the best ive had. There was a lot of mistrust because we constantly brokeup or fought and got back together but tried to make eachother jealous when we were separate. We broke up for the last time after a bad argument, she used to walk away during arguments, show up late on dates, and send me manipulative texts from her and her friends phone so i blocked her. In the end she wanted me back and I refused. I was heartbroken and tried to move on. It took me forever to get my piece of mind back. Recently we met at school at a mutual friends and were very friendly and flirtatious, nothing happened we had fun. Then our school shut due to corona.

During quarantine she has been sending me long paragraphs saying she loves me and wants closure and she misses me and wants to meetup. We even talked on the phone multiple times about life/ our breakup. She was very flirtatious and i liked talking to her. She asked to meetup and i was hesistant and said i need time to think but when i was drunk i said sure, later to say i need time the next day. She flipped out. Although she has been flirty and kind, she has also been pretty rude and sarcastic at times and even blocked/unblocked me because i told our mutual friend shes being mean. Shes like this i assume because shes hurt

The thing is i cant get her off my mind. She asked me 4 questions for closure and i answered them. She responded saying shell do anything for me and that i can always call her. I feel sad because im hesistant due to trust and past hurt. I saw her on hinge and it made me very sad and brought back all my old feelings of missing her. Any advice please. Am i wrong for not wanting to see her/ talk and maybe something physical, im going to school soon so will be 2hours away.

Tldr: ex from 2years ago wants to meetup, im hesitant due to trust but still have feelings and saw her on the hinge dating app, she looks beautiful. I still care for her but feel hesitant",22Aug2020,1

827,"I moved into my apartment complex back in May. Ever since, I've been receiving previous tenets mail. At first I was adamant to catch the mail lady to hand over what wasn't mine and to tell her these people don't live here anymore. After a month and a half I gave up and just placed anything that didn't belong to me in the RETURN TO SENDER box. Well a week ago my neighbor (whom I've never met) knocked on my door asking if I've received a package for him a week prior. I asked for his name. Turns out it wasn't one of my usuals and explained what I'd do if I got something that wasn't mine and I didn't recognize his name as one that I sent back recently. I even walked with him to our mailboxes to check again. He was very apologetic for disturbing me and left. After some thinking, I went to his apartment (maybe a half hour later) to see if the boxes were confused. See if my apartment is 103 my mailbox is 268. They don't correlate. So maybe the mail lady put his package in BOX 103 instead of the box FOR 103. He said nope, for sure box 268. I told him that I'd be on the look out just in case something shows up and left.

2 days ago he comes back and tells me straight up that he knew I had his mail and that he talked to the mail lady for an hour and she was 100% sure she put whatever it was of his in MY box. He told me that he needed it back regardless if I opened it or sold it, he was going back to his apartment and the package better be at his door step and on and on. I'm not the type of person to take from someone else. I work too damn hard for what I do have to take away from someone else's hard work. I am a heavy believe in karma if nothing else. I don’t want no bad juju coming my way. I explained tbe same thing that I did the last time he came but he wasnt having it. So I lost it. I told him to do what he had to do: take it to the police or to our building manager or who ever the fuck he had to because I legit did not have his shit. I was shaking I was so mad. To come to my door and threaten me about something like this when I tried my best to avoid this type of scenario. Eventually after some talking, things calmed down and he said he believed that I didn't have it and became very apologetic as he did the week before. He said he felt like an asshole for coming at me like that. I also apologize for not keeping my temper in check. Haha we even hugged it out and that was that. 

As I was leaving my apartment today I found a cravebox at my door with a note attached. The note said ""I'm really sorry about before, you deserved better."" I'm flabbergasted to be honest. I've never been in a situation like this before. This thing is worth up to $25 if it matters. Idk if he found his mail or not but I'm not sure where to go from here. He seems like a sweet guy typically. Maybe he was just having a bad day before? Any advise moving forward?",22Aug2020,1
828,"So, around a few days ago my long distance partner was flipping through their planner and saw that next year, around may they were taking a trip to study around where I live. For context, I’ve known this person for around 3-4 years and they’re really one of the people i’ve felt most connected with. But, we’ve never been able to meet. We’re both minors, and have no money to travel to different countries by ourselves- and our guardians don’t believe in our relationship and refuse to take us. So when we found this out we were both freaking out! The trip they’re taking is to London, which is a 3-4 hour drive away from where I live. I can’t drive, so I asked my brother (who will be a legal adult when we leave) if he would take me and he said yes. 

This is already a crazy situation, as I’d have to run away from my parents for a bit to go meet him, which I had fully prepared myself for anyway. But around the time he takes the trip I will most likely be in my exam week for my GCSE’s. On one hand, I want to take my exams and do good! On the other, If I don’t see him now I’ll be stuck waiting a few more years. And i’ll obviously be stressed and hate myself for not going. This feels like two one in a lifetime opportunities against each other. The trip is only for a few days and I’m wondering if I could take the exams a little later, but when I do get back I have a lot to answer to my parents. I don’t know what to do. I really, really want to meet them, and I know it’d be an amazing experience doing so. 

Any thoughts?",22Aug2020,1
829,"so, i have a pretty wide variety of interests and passions that i am almost equally invested in. something that is really tough for me is deciding on a career.

for as long as i can remember, i have been incredibly interested in science. my first hobby as a kid (if you could call it a hobby) was learning about dinosaurs, biology, and prehistoric earth; then as i entered middle school, i gained a huge interest in space and physics; then, starting in high school and continuing to now, i've had a persistent interest in biology, biochemistry, and neuroscience. i'm currently a nutrition science and public health major, am doing research in a lab that studies the intersection between nutrition and the onset of Alzheimer's, and am hoping to attend medical school after my undergraduate to hopefully become a neurophysiologist.

however, i am extremely interested and invested in politics. ever since middle school, i've been extremely passionate about politics, international affairs, and the state of the world. while i've had a persistent interest in science, i find the most enjoyment and am typically the best at classes in the humanities ( find that it's far easier for me to get an A in an english, sociology, or history class as opposed to a math or chemistry class). i never shy away from a debate, and my family, friends, and peers have always said that they saw me entering the political or law field as opposed to the STEM field. lately, because of the state of politics in the U.S., i've been reading more hardcore political and economic theory in my downtime from classes, and generally spending less time reading academic papers or working on my lab projects.

the medical path is one that is incredibly long, expensive, and daunting, but i'm drawn to it because i feel like it's the best use of my time and would be a career that would consistently challenge me and push me to my limits, plus i would get to help people in a very tangible sense and conduct more research on projects that i have a personal interest in. and i've already invested so much time into this path. but entering the field of law and politics, i know, would be easier for me simply because writing, debating, and communicating ideas has always been my strong suit, and i never find myself bored when i'm in a humanities class. politics just sparks a passion in me that nothing else really does, not even science; while i'm incredibly invested in the research i'm currently doing and hopefully will continue to do, i've even had other people tell me that they've never seen me light up as much as i do when i'm talking about politics and theory.

this is a very broad question, but does anyone have any advice on how to narrow down my passions or figure out what to do? because i'm about to be a third year at university, so time is running out for me to decide whether i want to continue down the medical path, or switch gears entirely and go towards law and politics.",22Aug2020,1

836,"So, I'm currently 20 and in the past year or two I've hit a depressed period in my life. Some of the feelings definitely come from a lack of solid plans for the future and family problems I've been going through for years. However, more recently (As in the past year) my friends have been excluding me constantly. As someone who holds social relationships closely and takes my friendships seriously, it has really been a big weight on my chest. To give some more detail, I've had the same friend group since elementary school, with only like 2 new additions here and there along the way. We used to do everything together. From the moment we got our licenses we'd hang out every day after school. Myself and two of my friends even rented a house together for a short time in 2018. I really considered these guys my ride or dies, but as of the past year I've noticed through snapchat stories or whatever that they've been hanging out without me. At each others houses, at parties, at restaurants. The first couple times this happened, I played it off as if they thought I was busy with my girlfriend or something. However, it kept happening and I eventually sent a message to one of my friends saying ""Why have you guys not been inviting me to stuff, even if you think I'm busy all you have to do is ask me"" or something along those lines. He replied with ""Oh it wasn't planned it kind of just happens like that."" This makes no sense. So all of my friends (except me) managed to end up hanging out at one of their houses together without everyone but me being invited?

It makes me feel so worthless. I try so hard to be there for my friends, respect them and help them in any way I can. It feels like all I'm given in return is the absolute minimum and basically being told to fuck off from the hangouts. I already have a negative personal image and being excluded from my life long friend group makes me feel even worse about myself. I'm not sure what to do anymore. I just want to feel like I'm a part of my own friend group. I want that companionship back.",22Aug2020,1
837,"So last week this 25 year old woman messaged me on a dating app - she messaged me because she related to my faith and creative hobbies...

And my goodness, her pictures were incredibly attractive... cute face, great voluptuous body with great legs and nice breasts... 

We also have more in common then with anyone I've met... she's an avid lover of art - she writes novels, screenplays, she loves music, the same movies i do, hiking and nature and so much more.

We exchanged numbers a day later,
texted a lot and talked on the phone twice, and she's super cool...

She told me her instagram and per my request, sent me many photos of her without a filter, photos that she says look exactly how she does in person and dang, she's very attractive.

Apparently she gets a lot of attention from guys, but they usually want to just hook up with her unlike me...

She likes me and we have plans to meet up in person soon, yet I find myself hesitant...

after scrolling through her instagram I found a few photos of her here and there, and they look incredibly different from some of her other photos...

like I would say downright very unattractive photos... these were from like 2015 and 2017...

she told me that growing up she didn't really know how to dress well, and just dressed in an overly modest way, but also she wore no makeup  and her hair was way different and she looked super unattractive...

her photos these past few years literally looks like a different person, which has me skeptical even though she sent me numerous pictures of her without filters...

she told me she's not hiding anything,
and that she looks exactly like the attractive pictures she sent me..

I mean those super unattractive photos were from like 3-5 years ago, but idk what's going on? 

I find myself hesitant now, but I do have trust issues. I just hope she looks how she does from her pictures.

So idk whether I’ve changed, or my friends have changed, or whether it’s just quarantine, or what, but all of a sudden, I’ve found myself with no one to talk to. I still have friends, though none of them seem to want to have a conversation with me. 

My guy friends definitely haven’t changed, it’s just that they’re not the type to have proper conversations over text, and I haven’t really found fun in Xbox in a while, so I haven’t been on for a few days. Come to think of it, I haven’t really found fun in many things for a while now, and the things I have found fun can get boring pretty quickly if you do them too much. 

Anyway, as for my girl friends, I can normally have some pretty good conversations with them, which I really enjoyed, but then their responses got pretty dry, pretty quickly, to the point where they now will hardly respond at all, most of the time just leaving me on seen. And we were really close too. I haven’t done anything to piss them off, and apparently they’re still the same people they were to other people, but it seems they’ve just dropped me, like they’re bored of me or something. Neither of them had feelings for me, and nor did I with them, so idk what’s happened. I’m hoping that it was just quarantine, so they haven’t really got much to talk about.

845,"I’ve only had one girlfriend, aside from that I really don’t have any dating experience, when in high school, I only ever tried to date girls that I knew were interested in me, when happened only once cause I’m like a 5’10 6/10. I never really got rejected because I never really put myself out there. I had tons of crushes, but I never wanted to talk to them so I just kept telling myself I didn’t have a chance with them so there was no point in talking to them. 

Since I’ve gotten back to college, I have found myself with an extremely intense crush on this girl I know. And that thought that “I have no chance with her so there’s no point is doing more harm than help”. I see her almost daily and we live in the same residence hall and are both in similar programs so I can’t avoid her all the time. I’m also very good friends with her roommate and spend a lot of time with both of them. I legitimately feel awful about myself every time I see her and she waves at me. I even try to pretend like I don’t see her so I don’t have to talk to her sometimes. Being alone with her makes me feel so shitty. 

I don’t really know if she is willing to go on a date because I can’t tell. Because of this I feel like I’ve been telling myself that there’s no way on earth she or anyone else could ever be interested in me. I’ve been hurting my own self esteem and I kinda just feel hopeless sometimes. I feel like I should just come clean to her about the way I feel, but all of my friends say I need to take it slow with her. I’m super intimidated by her so even if I could get to a point where get her one on one, I doubt I’d be able to say anything. 

I’m not sure if this is a fear of rejection thing, I don’t really feel afraid of her saying no, I’m afraid of everything that happens after that, like the embarrassment, risking making things awkward between us and our other friends.

I’m tired of being mistreated but I can’t change my circumstances nor can I change my mom. 

What are some good alternatives to channel my aggression? 

I workout so exercise will not be a good suggestion as I am very active. 
Recently, I started taking a mood stabilizer for my BP2 and it triggers insomnia and fatigue so I’ve been having a rough time sleeping- currently have stinging red eyes as my mom woke me at 9 by yelling and I slept 4 hours. 

I need something to get me out of bed. 
I need something that will help my stress and anger out. 
I’m in California so many things are closed. 
I was thinking self defense classes but I’m not sure I could afford them right now.",22Aug2020,1

850,"I'm not sure if this is the right place and I'm gonna try to keep things simple. I have bad teeth. Like really bad. 4 in the front Are broken in half, back molars are rotted to gumline. I grew up without running water and I've been homeless more of my life than sheltered. My parents never once bought me a tooth brush or explained the importance of dental hygiene, they certainly didn't tell me about insurance or credit or any of that adult stuff, I'm figuring it all out as I go. Well I'm almost 30 now and I've about broken my families poverty cycle. I have a good job and I'm somewhat financially stable. I'm wondering if anyone has any advice on the best way to go about getting my teeth fixed for the most reasonable price. What kind of insurance should I get? Should I go to an independent dentists? I've been told to try the colleges but I'm not sure they could help because my mouth is so far gone. Is there a way to make payments? How does one pay for an all on 4 procedure without great credit?

852,"I just moved to a new city due to starting my Master of Engineering degree and I’m about 7h with a car away from my family and friends in my hometown. I’ve been wanting this for myself for quite some time, just allowing myself to develop and grow as a person. A step closer to becoming an adult that manages to take care of myself and not depending on my mother anymore.

Either way  I moved two days ago and I feel quite lonely. Usually I manage to work with my mindset or some visualisation exercise which makes me feel better. Setting up some goals or seeing this as an amazing opportunity. But the two times I got to see some of my classmates most of them seemed awkward and not too sociable. I tried to hold conversation but with little to no success. Most of my friends back home are busy so I’ve just tried to explore the city and go on long walks. With this said I think I feel a little bit lost and would appreciate all sorts of guidance on how to make this process just slightly easier. With anything from how to manage my studies (uni advice) to best moving out/home advice. I live with myself in a tiny tiny little apartment and I feel a bit overwhelmed with this loneliness. I know everything will work out and sort it self through some patience and time but how do improve my life quality over the course of my 5 years here? What’s your best advice for a uni student? What something that is good to strive for when shit feels hopeless? I’m not expecting this period to be easy so how do I manage this as good as possible. Big or small, I just want input.

854,"Here’s a little backstory. I’m 18m, and for all my life my parents have been fighting. My father was physically abusive to my mother and I since I was like 6 or 7 but she never left him. I started working out at age 11 to protect my mom from him. She stayed with him even though they fought constantly and it honestly took a toll on me. I’m the oldest in my family, my brother is turning 10 in a couple weeks and my sister is 7. 

He hated my moms family and we were pretty much isolated from everyone else til she got a divorce. Everyone pushed her to do it for the past decade but she never did it, even though she knew it wasn’t good for the kids. What led her to divorcing him was that she found out he cheated on her several times. It ticks me off when she acts like she got divorced for the kids, because if she really did she would’ve done it a very fucking long time ago. She did it for herself. 

My brother is always on his iPad, he has no real life skills that a ten year old should have and he has absolutely no discipline, my mom lets him and my sister do whatever they want. The problem is that whenever I scold him (I never hit him) he gets sensitive and my mom gets upset about it. 

A couple days ago he was misbehaving and I yelled at him for it and then my mom said something that really hurt me. She said I’m just like my dad, the man who I spent most of my life hating. And it’s not the first time she’s said something like this either, she knows it upsets me but she says it whenever I do something wrong. It really ticked me off because she never fended for me when my dad was yelling at me or beating me. 

Ive been sacrificing my happiness for this fucking family. I barely even go out with my friends anymore. The money I make I spend it on toys for my siblings. I have no problem with this, I love my family. But when I do all this and get treated like shit it’s like what the hell am I even doing this for?

I told her I wouldn’t have to yell at him if she played her part as a parent if she wasn’t always on the phone with her boyfriend (not really her boyfriend). 

The thing is, since she got divorced she’s been on the phone with her childhood first love (who is very much married FYI) and she doesn’t spend any time with the kids. It’s not my job to be their fucking parent and it’s so frustrating. I have no issue with her being friends with men, or even getting a new man but cmon, being on the phone with a married man for hours a day? Wtf?

Since then, I’ve been refusing to talk to her and eat the food she makes because honestly I don’t want shit from her anymore. Don’t get me wrong, I love my mom more than anything in this world but some things really hurt you. 

I hate doing this but I don’t just want to let it go either. What should I do?",22Aug2020,1

My partner age 30 expressed he would never ruin a relationship with someone by having someone he flirted with or had sexual relations with on social media.

858,"I don't know where to start and I'm kinda not sure what to do but basically when quarantined(April) started my bf was on discord a lot playing DND w our friends and w people Idk. They would be in call 24/7 except when his sleeping or doing basic stuff. I notice that his been talking to this girl more often and sometimes it's just them in call. This girl use to be his crush when he was in college. I was pretty much okay with him doing his own thing and being on discord despite knowing this because I trusted him. But a day came where I just felt bother about something and something was wrong so I check his discord chats  (I don't  really read his chats because I understand he needs his privacy) that's when I found out he was flirting behind my back and the girl was reciprocating it despite knowing he has a gf(shes knows because I played w her before in the same DND campaign) . I felt hurt and betrayed it even came to a point where we broke it off but we manage to talk about it. And w my permission he talk to the girl about the issue. I thought, that was it but later on I found out that were still lowkey flirting (that type of flirting where you do pick up lines and all).  I was really angry after that and felt disrespected from both of them. Another round of talk and argument but we manage to work it out by setting boundaries. He was still allowed to talk to her because I understood that if he completely cut her off it would strain the whole DND group and it would be awkward and it's the only thing that's keeping him sane from this Pandemic, I didn't want to take that away from him. They're still talking but it's mostly DND related stuff like builds for the next gen characters or traits  and where they canonically ship their characters w each other and basically RP sexual stuff it's  not explicit but still sexual. Just to give context they were already doing this before the whole flirting thing happened I didn't mind because I separate Role-playing and irl but after what happened I just feel worried and uncomfortable about it.

861,"Now, this is probably pretty confusing to most people, but I identify openly as a gay man, however, I'm actually bisexual, homoromantic. Meaning, I'd have sex with either a man or a woman, but would only ever date a man.

I've felt pretty guilty about this. I do prefer to have sex with a man, but also find myself desiring to have intercourse with women once and a while. There's a couple reasons why I don't like calling myself bisexual openly. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Firstly**, I've been worried that it's disrespectful to people who are openly bisexual and biromantic. Not all bisexual people are poly like I am, or down with an open relationship. I'm worried that if I'm public about it, people will start assuming that all bisexual people are like me and DTF whoever, whenever. That's obviously not the case.

**Secondly**, I don't want to mislead anyone who meets me into thinking I'm biromantic as well. If I met a woman and was sexually attracted to her and she was to me, I don't want to disrespect her, and I surely don't want to accidentally lure her into thinking I want a romantic relationship. I'm fine being platonic and sexual. But I was never happy in heteroromantic relationships, and I also don't want her to be offended by that.

**Thirdly**, I don't want people to assume that I'm only interested in them for sex. That's not it. I can have a solid friendship with someone who I've had sex with, and I don't want anyone to think I'm just using them for sex. That's not always the case, and even if it were, the person still matters to me and I wouldn't want them thinking they can never have a healthy relationship with someone.

**And finally**, it's a huge part of my personality. Being gay: it's one of the first few things people think about when they think of me. I'm not really sure if I'll ever have a sexual relationship with a woman again, but I know that I won't ever have a romantic one. So being gay, calling myself gay, it's something that I've gotten used to. I don't want to go and change that up because it took a lot of courage to come out when I was in high school, and I endured bullying for that and I honestly don't want to go through that again, so I just stick with what I'm used to.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's where I'd like the advice. I'm worried I'm being deceptive by saying I'm gay, despite preferring men in sexual relationships. If my sexuality ever comes up again, I want to know what to do, and I want to be prepared. So, does anyone have any advice on how to go about this?

And is there also someone who's been through this who can share their experience?",22Aug2020,1
862,"  

While I was thinking of what to write my first blog about I decided that I would write about men and the things they do that drives us women crazy. 

I am going to start with the biggest one of course, their insecurities. I don't know about you, but I have been with plenty of men who showed how insecure they are. Whether, it's from the way they dress or the way they walk or even the way the talk. when a man feels that his woman is way out of his league he will try to control everything his woman does anything from thee way they dress to where they go and who they talk to. My ex-husband was so insecure that I wasn’t allowed to talk to my bosses that where guys (and yes you read that right my Bosses). Even if I needed to go to the bathroom I had to find a female to tell. I was even allowed to talk to his friend while I was at work. I wasn’t allowed to go to my moms by myself. long story short I couldn’t do anything. He was so insecure he would always make me feel bad about the way I looked.

My husband now is insecure a little and he gets jealous if he thinks me and another guy are being to friendly to each other. Which is understandable, but he also talks to me and tells me how he feels about it and we talk about it like adults. Another thing that drives us women crazy is when our men are sweet, it doesn’t matter if its something as small as getting our favorite drink or snack in the store without us asking or if you go pick flowers off the side of the road just to give to us. The more you make us feel special and loved the more we will make you feel the same.

Let me tell all of you ladies out there reading this, do not let a man degrade you just because he's insecure. If you notice that he’s acting a certain way because he is insecure ask him what is making him feel that way and try your best to make him feel secure with you. As always guy thank you for the support and much love to yall. If you have any topics or points you would like me to cover, please feel free to comment them. I will talk to everyone tomorrow.",22Aug2020,1

Last year in the spring was supposed to be when I would graduate, but instead I took GED classes over the fall and earned it by the end of the year.

This all cost me my relationship and what little friends I had in high school. Most everyone I knew moved last year, and now the last bit of people have already/are in the process of moving again now.

866,"So I’ve been doing sperm retention quite often for my spirituality to better myself and to have all the amazing benefits of doing it. I still have been baiting-master, but not reaching orgasm. I feel like the benefits have been there and working in my favor, but the thing is I saw a video today on testosterone. The video talked about how the testosterone increase has improvement in lifestyle, social life, exercising, etc. A part of the video talked about having “reproductive activity.” That part of the video about having “reproductive activity” 3 times a week or more can increase testosterone a lot. This “activity” has to be specifically with another partner. I’m unsure of weather to believe the study, and try to increase my own testosterone for a better life. Should I believe the study? I personally believe in my spiritual life that reaching orgasm can reset my clock for spiritual benefits and the longer I go the more the benefits I receive in life. I believe in a conspiracy that the government is trying to make us reach orgasm to lower ourselves.

867,"I (25F) live in a shared house with two women and we had a forth bedroom.
The woman who lived there before (31F) was a total Karen and a pain in the ass, so we agreed to rent it to a young as possible girl next time.
We found this teen (18F) who moved to go to university (like all of us had, since our house is close to campus), and she moved with us right away.
Now a bit of context on the girl: she's the youngest of eight half-siblings/step-sibilings, shy, upper class, and divorced parents. This pretty much sums up how ignored this girl was growing up, and how she craved affection.

We stared to get pretty close. The fact that she was new to the city, that one of our housemates was a dick to her at first, and that she was so young and such a sweetheart, made me be pretty protective of her. Soon she started to treat me like a older sister/authority figure.

Examples:
She calls her mother (who she still refers to as ""mama"") almost every day, and whenever her mother is too busy/disinterested to have a conversation longer than two minutes, she comes to my room looking pretty sad.
Once she was about to go on a date and I joked that I wanted to meet him before allowing her to go; she took it completely seriously and made every boy go inside to talk to me from there on.
Once she came home at 10pm (she normally came at 6pm) it made me very worried, and I asked her to let me know if she was gonna come home late next time. After that she'd text me twice a day to let me know where she was (it wasn't what I asked for, but I found it cute and still appreciated it).
She also likes my boyfriend very much. Whenever he comes here he already knows that she is gonna stay with us for a while, he'd even bring his video game to play with her a little. (She'd never intrude and is never sad or offended when I tell her it's time for her to go to bed).
I have more examples of me ""mothering"" her but that sums it up. It has been a year now.

Yesterday I casually told them about the possibility of me moving to my home town because of a job offer. It's only two hours away. The girl bursted out crying. She was full on sobbing and it took a lot of time to calm her down. (I'll probably not even accept it. I already have a good job on my field, I was just casually commenting.)

My housemates said that this was a proof that I was taking our relation too far, and that my need to ""play mom"" really made the girl get attached to me, and that I shouldn't have let her do it since we knew she has ""daddy/mommy issues"". I don't think she's too attached to me? She has friends her age and goes out with them, she has a good dating life and she doesn't try to be with me in a obsessive amount of time.
She did almost have a panic attack at the idea of me moving away... but I really don't know what to do. I like her and I like taking care of her, I don't think I'm doing anything wrong. Opinions please?",22Aug2020,1

Yesterday I pulled her aside at her house (yes her mom is there in the other room).

I am very much in love with the guy that I hook up with, I have been for a year and a half even though it's clear he doesn't want a relationship at this time in his life. We have amazing times together but every couple of months, he goes ghost without explanation and I don't hear from him for a few months. He does that to everyone, literally including his own family. I got used to it and I still love him. I've tried moving on but it doesn't work; I think about him all the time. It's when I hit him up and get ignored that my depression hits especially hard for a few weeks. I always wonder whether or not he will ignore me for months again. I worry. I'm wondering how to get used to this. I know it sounds bad, but obviously I am too dumb to just move on from this man, so I need to learn to handle my negative thoughts and emotions when I know I'm being ignored by the person I am helplessly in love with. I need help letting go of these emotions.

For everyone about to comment saying that I need to cut this situation off and move on; that isn't going to happen any time soon, even though I know it should. There is something about the connection between this man and I, I have quite a bit of experience with men and relationships but I have never felt anything like what I do with him. I've gone months without hearing from him and I sti feel the same; every time we meet again it's like nothing happened.",22Aug2020,1

875,So there’s this girl I met through a friend that I was going to go on a date with then we decided to hold off for a little because of covid. She then stopped talking to me and got a boy friend a couple weeks later then he broke up with her about two weeks ago. So then I’m hanging out with a friend and she wants to hangout with me so we hangout and there’s about four of us. She had been drinking then said she wanted to kiss me and was flirting with me for like the past hour. So we kissed a little and had a really fun night.

876,"I've noticed throughout the years that my mood has been all over the place- and it doesn't make sense to me. One moment I'll be talking to my friend and having a blast and then within seconds, I'll all the sudden feel extremely depressed, angry and frustrated. I don't notice any triggers about it, but it's gotten a lot worse as I keep it to myself- and now, I struggle to see any of my real life friends anymore. I want to hang out with them, talk with them and have a good time with them all, but every time I do, I feel stressed and irritated- I feel as if I hate them or I want to yell at them for no good reason to do so.   
It alarms me a lot, and so recently, I've worked up the courage to get a therapist to discuss some issues I've been having that aren't limited to this kind of behavior. Though, I worry that maybe I am overreacting and that I will embarrass myself inevitably with the therapist. (I also worry that I will grow irritated with them too.)  
A few other things that I've been dealing with that I just don't have the capacity to explain are listed below;  
\- Extremely low motivation to anything  
\- An undying anxiety that everyone in the world is out to get me or secretly plan against me  
\- Feeling as if everyone is lying to me, even if sometimes I know it's so stupid to think that  
\- Moments where I just don't feel any emotion at all  
\- This one can't be dotted but, my self esteem changes? I feel as if sometimes I believe I'm better, superior and much smarter than everyone else, but then moments later I feel as if I am below the world

Is everything I'm feeling normal? Is it even worth to go to a therapist to talk about these problems? What should I do?   
Any advice, inputs or discussions can help. Thanks.",22Aug2020,1
877,"Stressed about a summer course

Hey guys so just to let the next two years of high school be a little easier, and because this pandemic allows me to take them online, I chose to take two summer school courses where I could do them at home instead of going to a school that’s relatively far away. 

I took them from two different areas of learning, one being History from a newly introduced form of summer school online that took one month to complete from the start of July to the end; I aced this course with 100% probably due to the fact it was about the 20th century wars that I’m really interested in. The second form of the summer school is offered every year which is self-paced and you have the whole year to complete it; for this one I took a French course as for the University I want to go to you need a second language and even though I already have one, they don’t accept it if that makes sense. 

Anyways, my goal was to complete the French course starting from the beginning of August until the end as school is supposed to start in September. Now there are two problems here. First of all, I’m not that good at learning more languages other than the two I learned at a young age. Secondly, I’m an incredibly lazy person and procrastinate a lot; with this being a self-paced course. It’s hard to motivate myself to do any work. So I was supposed to grind the course out this whole month but things like videogames and friends put me in a situation where it’s one week until the end of the month, I have done only 15 out of 200 assignments, (each assignment is really short with 8 questions and 10 of the 15 I did were introduction assignments) and I am still procrastinating to this day. 

It’ll be hard to balance actual school with this course so that is a problem too. I’m pretty sure every 5 minutes I get that stress spike through my body because I’m scared of not doing the work and it prevents me from sleeping well. My sleep schedule is broken as I sleep at 6-8 am (I know it’s incredibly late) and I wake up from 3-6 depending on how my sleep goes. I tried getting my family to motivate me but it’s barely working. 

On top of this, I’m scared for how this will affect my future in Uni as I want to major in engineering and I know it’s known for tons of work but tbh I like Physics and Math a lot so that’s why I want to major in it. I don’t know what to do I keep saying I will do the work tomorrow and I never do and even if I do, it’s like 2 assignments until I panic because I don’t understand. I get good grades in my classes and am confident in my learning skills but I’m just so uncomfortable and unfamiliar with this language. Again I don’t know what to do.",22Aug2020,1
878,"My mother is vacationing in Mexico right now for a wedding that has been planned for months. She called me today 3 days into their 7 day vacation. She said she needed me to call AT&amp;T for her now to add an international plan to her account. At the moment, I was busy (hands full and needing to get ready for dinner with my in-laws). She asked me to three-way AT&amp;T into the call. I told her I couldn’t three-way from a Facebook phone call and told her it would be easy to add from the app on her phone. She doesn’t have the app...smh. She told me to just call them for her and pretend to be her and get it added to her account. I told her i couldn’t right this moment and I would need her SSN, pin, account number and likely some other data to confirm identity. She immediately got pissed and said “never mind I’ll figure it out myself. Thanks bye!” And hung up. I texted her the link to add it the international plan on the app and she said that she did not have login credentials to the app. I told her to do it now and it would be easiest and she said she couldn’t as she did not have her account number on her. She’s pissed and surely will let me know for at least a week or two how pissed she is. This is pretty typical of my mom. I personally think it is unreasonable to call your daughter (NEVER my brother) asking for an immediate favor on your terms because you decided not to take care of it before you left. I told her that I could help her around 8pm tonight—no answer. She acted like it would be a 5 minute phone call but we all know it would be like an hour at least. I ended the online texts letting her know that she could put her phone in airplane mode and connect to WiFi when calling out/using the internet and that would make sure that she didn’t get charged extra—I did this in Ireland and it worked. She did not respond. Who is being unreasonable in this situation?

I've even thought about just cutting ties with everyone in the friend group just to get rid of him from my life, but I really don't want to do that because I love my friends, and I don't want to confront him about it because again, that could make my place in the friend group a lot smaller.

881,"I just have a friend who has been really annoying and I'm so done with his shit. I've been minding his house for like, 3 weeks now and he's coming home tomorrow, so things are kinda awkward. Over the past year he has been trying again and again to get with any girl and he just keeps going for ones out of his league or across the country and gets depressed that two weeks of texting some bird on Instagram isn't getting his dick wet.

I'm aromatic and hearing people talk about their relationships kills me, so when it's literally all he has to say it makes it so I don't even want to look at my group chat anymore. He constantly goes on about he fucking hates ""females"" and how they just lie flirt with him and then don't reply to him in a hour or two, like grow up bro.

But the tricky but is how to pull out without my friendship circle collapsing? I have about 4 people in my main friend group (including him) and while 2 of my closest friends don't like his attitude either, the other friend (my cousin) does. They share the same mindset, but I can tolerate my cousin more, and I want to keep a relationship open with him- which I don't think is possible if I do this.

I'm currently staying at his house while he's away on a 3 week trip, and unfortunately there was so damage to the house (3 half Alice succulents, 2 chewed up plushies and some damaged floorboards) but I took care of their dog for 3 weeks man. I'm throwing him some weed so he will stfu but I honestly don't even need to, I've done more than enough for them.

I don't like when people are passive agressive and all I've been seeing every time I try to give advice to this oh-so-weary soul is ""that's cool but did I fucking ask?""

At the same time we contradict that by hanging out once a week and we even say now oh I don’t know how to get a person like you or find a person like you.

I'm struggling with the idea that some day my loved ones will be gone. The thought of my parents no longer being here freaks me out, a lot. It makes me want to die before they do. I do not want to go through this big amount of pain and heartbreak.

887,"

I've been bad at math since I can remember and I really want to change. I'm in my last year of middle school and it feels like I still can't do basic math. I suck at everything. It took me like 30 mins to figure out how to calculate 100 · 4,37, it's embarrassing, and it feels like I'm the only one in my class who is like this. 

too many numbers mess me up and my concentration is absolute shit, when I don't know how to figure something out I give up and stop doing everything. sometimes I'm afraid to ask teachers for help because I'm ashamed of how stupid I am. I've had classmates laugh at me for answering wrong, and I've had a teacher laugh in my face (several times) for taking too long to answer a simple question

but when I finally do get the courage to ask, they always need to explain it several times before I get it, but then I forget it as soon as the lesson ends

I told my teachers that I think I have some type of learning disability, but they always tell me that I'm ""smart"" and that I ""most likely"" dont have one. if I'm going to be honest, every single time a teacher has told me that I'm ""smart"", I've always felt offended because I know that they are straight up lying in my face..



I really want to get a D or C (or maybe even an A, but that's im-fucking-possible)in math, but I feel like I'll never be able to get my math grade up

We spent all our time together, he would come crash at my house and it's go to his. He moved away to Alberta for about a year but then moved back and lived with my and my girlfriend( now wife) eventually he moved out and a few years later my wife and I bought a house. He expressed to me that he wanted a change of career. So I got him a job at my work, drove him to and from work and let him live in our house. A year later we bought a new house and he came with us. After a year or two he moved out again because he was making enough money. A year after that went rented him our suite because the suite he was renting was someone's garage. He met a girl and now they're getting married. He came downstairs last night and told my wife he was getting married and asked her to witness it. After a bit he told me he was getting married and I said congratulations and hugged him. He said it was gonna be a small wedding. I asked u I m who he was inviting and he said my wife and his fiancé's friend. I wasn't bothered because he explained it was about the covid rules etc. Just two witnesses which was fine. I wasn't upset. I understood. But today she got a text from him saying they were going to do the ceremony and go for lunch after. Once again I'm not invited. I don't understand. My wife said she didn't want to go without me and I said to just go. This made me start to reevaluate. I wasn't upset originally but now I'm angry. Why can't I go to lunch with them?

895,"So the story starts off in February... My friend introduced me to reddit and a page called r/teenamiugly. It was a page where you get rated for your appearances. I made a post with my picture in it. A bunch of people who were obviously pedos texted me and I just ignored it. But this one person who seemed normal and had a bunch of posts texted me. Long story short I got their snap. I still wasn’t sure about this person as she, or should I say, they sent me nudes after the 3rd day I had them added. I still didn’t send them anything of the same regard back at this point.  They sent me another pic a couple days later, I still didn’t send anything back. Then a little time passes and I want proof that they’re real. I ask for a picture of them with them holding up a peace sign. They sent one. So now I had their trust. Since it was February, it was nearing Valentine’s Day, and of course the pedo sends me more nudes, and this time uses the excuse of Valentine’s Day and asks, “Do I not get something similar in return?” So that night I sent her a nude. With my face in it and everything. From this point on it became a trend they would send me videos and pictures of the person they were pretending to be, and they would ask me for more pictures and videos, I would send videos and pictures I had also asked for their Instagram but they said there was an incident before with a stalker so they didn’t give it to me. But I found the Instagram account that they set up so I thought it was real. They even had a Twitter account made up of the girl she was pretending to be, and it had been up since 2016, although the username didn’t match up with the @.So anyways I found out I was being trolled a month and a half ish of when I first met them. When I found a pornhub account made with the same girl in it, but the weird thing is the person had the same name as they did on Snapchat. I panic and see that there is a Kik account on the pornhub so I text the kik account and tell them that there is someone pretending to be them. Then they said they know and gave a bullshit story about how they know and that they were trying to track them down. They even knew the “persons” Snapchat username. I asked for proof, this time something way harder than a peace sign, and they didn’t send it. So at this point I knew the pornhub, the twitter, the Snapchat, the kik, the Instagram was all the same person. (P.S. The person literally said that they were travelling for the summer to my province and they wanted to meet me)

So after that I was thinking should I tell my parents or not. I did after three days of no sleep and agony. We told the police and gave them all of this information. After two weeks of stressing out they called back and said there was nothing that they could do about it because no crime had occurred, even though it had. I am under the age of 18. So that is child pornography right there. Even if there was no evidence of that, I looked into the twitter account and saw that they were following a page called “teen nudes”. So that is suspicious right there. So after the incident with the cops we reported it to this website that also got us in touch with the police. It was a different cop this time who said that, “you could’ve lied about your age, you could have looked older” I didn’t lie about my age and I don’t look older than I am....

Anyways this happened around 3 months ago and I am scared that when I go back to school that this pedophile will get my nudes leaked all over. I don’t know what I would do if they did that. Does anyone know what I could do regarding this to make it better?",22Aug2020,1
896,"I work on the most violent ward in a psychiatric hospital. I’m an Institutional Counselor 2. Started this position back in December. Before this, I was a Mental Health Technician and was a 1:1 monitor for an assaultive patient with pica, autism and schizophrenia. 
I work hard at my job. I run groups, interact with patients and work as a team player. 1:1 interaction is what I’m really good at. So my boss hired me as an institutional counselor 2 because I have the experience and associates degree. The position I applied for was institutional counselor 3. My boss said it would be a training position and that I’d get promoted to institutional counselor 3. This entire time, my boss made me train with the worst institutional counselor 3. He never showed up for groups on time, would come to work late and never showed initiative. He always seemed clueless. I’m not sure if he was acting clueless to get out of doing stuff or if he truly was. It was always me doing everything. I told my boss this and nothing happened. She gave him a “talk” but he didn’t change. I told her that I can’t work with him and she said we “can’t pick and choose partners” even though I don’t see why we can’t? So I’ve just been doing my best with him. 

Fast forward 8 months and still no promotion and instead, a mental health tech who doesn’t communicate with patients, is lazy and doesn’t speak English that well (which would make the patients angry) got promoted to institutional counselor 3. This guy claims he has a “masters degree in education” which I highly doubt. I’m so angry right now and feel insulted. He should be the last person on the ward to get promoted. He doesn’t care about the patients! Multiple people told our boss that she shouldn’t promote him and she did anyway.

My friend however has also unfortunately been very manipulative. He would constantly guilt trip, lie to me, frame me , and get angry over small things. He would make me run home crying more than any of the bullies i dealt with in elementary school. 

As we grew older and he continued being my friend he would try to push me away from all my other friends. He would complain about them, tell me they weren't worth it and push me away from them. He would isolate me and got mad if we hadn't spent more than a day together durinh thw week (even if i hadn't seen anyone else the last month) i felt isolated 

More time passed and he grew more aggressive. In elementary school he had been violent,  hitting me ,kicking me , punching me and biting me. But he wasn't violent anymore,  just angry.

He would yell at me every time i did something wrong. If i talked about my family. If i was being too loud, if i forgot to close the cupboard , if i met up too late , if i accidentally interrupted someone, if i bumped into a stranger on the bus. A bunch of really small things that most people wouldn't even notice. But he did , and he got really mad.

Today he was angry again, for cancelling our plans. We didn't really have any plans. He was staying the weekend so that he could go to work, and he had previously told me i could make plans.

I had made plans, but when he came he didn't have work anymore. He talked shit about me to my friends.  He guilt tripped me as usual. And used all his regular manipulation tactics. But it just snapped for me.

I told him if he didn't get his act together, i would gladly stop having him as a friend.

902,"Little bit of back story. Between 2015 and 2017 I attended two different private universities and ended up flunking out of both. My first year of college was rougher than the usual ""oh, everyone has a rough first year"" (first semester&gt;! one of my closest friends had killed herself!&lt; and second semester &gt;!I was raped!&lt;), and the emotional baggage from that bled into my second year. I'll be the first to admit though that a decent chunk of my failure can be attributed to me not applying myself enough. I studied German and Criminal Justice at the first school, followed by Social Work and Criminal Justice at the second school. While I did manage to pass a few classes here and there, all I mainly accomplished was racking up debt.

I've since been looking at community college, as there's a nice &amp; affordable close to an area I plan on moving to once things calm down a bit. Plus, they offer online courses (regardless of the world's pandemic status), so I've been looking into that. My hang up right now is that for the application they're, understandably, asking previous schools attended and transcripts for the accompanying schools. 

I mostly want to know if I'm under obligation to disclose my previous schools and transcripts, but I guess the real worry here is what happens if I get put into classes I'm not prepared for as a result of my transcripts? At the two previous schools I did manage to knock off some math classes that have me worried about being placed into an advanced math class if I do go to CC.

I have around 3.2k after almost 6 years and my friends almost with the same talent level or below already have 5k- 8k within a year or two of joining. I know at the end of the day its never about followers, I know it doesn't validate my art in anyway but it definitely drives me to keep drawing.

904,"A little backstory: When I first entered college, I didn’t really know anyone. But on the way to my first class, I noticed this girl that I thought was crazy pretty, and just mentally noted as you do. Turns out that she was also a freshman in the same major and same class I was going to. I ended up talking to her and within a couple weeks, we were dating. 

However, things kinda went really fast during that first period when, in retrospect, probably should have gone slower. I ended up meeting her parents really early on and we would talk constantly, meeting up on campus and staying over at each other’s place when we could.

We are both engineers and had our midterms for this tough class where everyone did terribly. This freaked us both out since we’ve never had exams like this. After a week, I could feel she was getting more distant (it was pretty noticeable since she was pretty outward in her emotions). I tried to talk to her but she said everything was fine. Then one day, she asked to meet up and there she told me that we should end things for now because her grades were dropping and it wasn’t a good time. She said that maybe if this happened later on, it could have worked out.

We drifted apart after that and I haven’t really talked to her much since then. On a unrelated note, I’ve gone through depression in college after my freshman year and only recently have gotten into a more stable routine now going into my senior year. Thus, I never got myself to talk to her much again.

Now, during quarantine and being at home alone for 5 months, I started thinking about her a lot. Started from having her pop up in my dreams to just thinking about her. I was always kind of skeptical with her reasoning for breaking up back then and always wanted closure I guess. 

Being back in college for my senior year, should I contact her? I have no idea whether she’s dating someone or what her situation has been for the last 3 years. If the answer is yes, how should I go about it. Or if the answer is no, what can I do to stop thinking about her again?

905,"Im 16F and when i was 5 i became mute. I’m mostly better now but i couldn’t at all talk when i was little. Parents didn’t do anything except told me to stop being shy.

I easily would’ve believed i was just shy but thing is everyone tells me stories of how extroverted i was before that. They said i would wave to everyone we passed outside and i told complete strangers off when they littered and i could make decisions so easily. I remember there was another shy girl in kindergarten and i tried to become her friend so i can help her get less shy. It worked and she went on to become a popular girl later on. 

But from the year after that i don’t remember anything. I literally have zero memory and all i know is i didn’t talk to anyone except my parents and brother. I tried to speak but i couldn’t and i didn’t really want to. To some people it got so bad i fully refused to show my face and would hold a pillow over my face whenever we were in the same room.

I have this specific memory when i was younger of when i went to my swimming lessons. It was the first time i ever had a male teacher because the female teacher i usually would have had was absent that day. The second he touched me i went into a tantrum and i remember just feeling terrified. I refused to go back and i stopped the lessons altogether.

There are a few other ‘signs’ i guess i won’t get into. I also have a lot mental health problems now and lately i’ve just been feeling more and more off about that time of my life. I feel like something big happened, i remember my mother’s attitude towards me completely changing one day 100% out of nowhere and she hasn’t been the same way since. I don’t know what to do or even if it happened. 

If something did happen, why hasn’t someone told me since it seems they probably know? Well i wasn’t even told my grandparents overseas died for 5 yrs so i wouldn’t put it past them.

Just, idk what to do in general... if something happened i want to know so i can give an explanation to everything",22Aug2020,1
907,"So I met this friend online a few months ago and he seemed fine until he told me about all his problems, he has depression, anxiety and a type of autism (i think its called fret disorder) so he struggles and can get overwhelmed at random times for no exact reason. I've never known anyone with these issues and I wasnt the most educated on these things. I understand better now about depression and his situation and it would be nice for some tips because I need to make sure I'm not doing something wrong. He struggles a lot with thinking people don't like him, thinking its his fault and has suicidal thoughts sometimes, so far i've supported him emotionally, i constantly tell him i love him and things like your not alone. I try and help him as much as possible and im willing to help him, no matter how hard it is or how long it takes which im making sure he knows. I help him if he ever feels stressed and im going to do multiple things so he knows how much people care about him. I check up on him to see if hes eaten and try and encourage him to do things like eat and stuff without being too pushy. Is there anything im doing wrong and is there anything else i should be doing? I also want him to see a professional but he said hes been to 2 and they didnt help. The only confusing thing to me which i dont know about yet is, his parents dont know about it and think hes perfectly fine; he also doesn't want family to know because hes scared they'll misunderstand and overreact and treat him like a precious snow flake. I feel really bad for him because his situation is so unlucky, i think his parents are divorced so he moves from house to house every week or so. I've done a few other things and i plan to do a lot more, i made a song for him which ill send him soon, just things to make sure he knows i love him. I'm also gonna meet him soon which will be great. Thanks so much in advance for anyone who replies",22Aug2020,1

Friend 2 it's a good boy,  it's difficult to have a serious conversation with him but if you want to have fun, he's the right person. So, in July, Friend 1 started to talk with me after almost 4 months of knowing nothing about each other, he started to be a little bit rude and disrespectful, specially with people from other countries and religions, he's racist and  friend 2 and me hate it, because we know that everybody is nice, doesn't mind the color of your skin or your country, so we tried to avoid him because we weren't comfortable with him. Then, we tried to help him, telling them what is ok and what's not, but he thinks he is the king of the world and everything he does is ok and the rest of the world is doing badly (if someone is wondering, no, he wasn't a racist and disrespectful person when we used to met before the pandemic, but he thinks that being disrespectful is a great way to be popular and cool in our town). After trying to help him and getting no results, he started to talk with us a lot (maybe 30 messages in one hour about videogames and his life in a summer camp he went weeks ago), we are very tired of him, but we don't want to make him sad or be rude with him, the only thing we want is to be the good friends we used to be.

Then she wasn’t a heart beat away. She was weeks, and then months without seeing me. I was told eventually it was because she had an alcohol problem, so I wasn’t allowed to see her. I recently learned it’s because she drove with me for an hour while completely plastered.

918,"I love him, he loves me. Our relationship was so solid,  only took us 2 weeks to become exclusive, a lot of the same interests, similar goals, no fights, our families love us together.. We have had a ""rough patch"" for the last 3ish months as his mental illness just got way worse. He needs more help than a few free college counselling sessions that I made him go to.  I've tried my best, but he isn't trying enough. It affects me a lot, he has said stuff that really really hurt my feelings. I've cried over some of  it. He always tries to make up for it but it shouldn't happen in the first case. 

He doesn't mean to, but he has said stuff like ""growing up I always thought I'd have a really skinny tall girlfriend, guess I thought that was the ideal growing up, but I've always found women with your body type attractive too and I *adore* your body"" (curvy 5ft1 woman, 120lbs). He has overshared his past feelings for other girls, including one we know who he once masturbated to a picture of, before we got together (that one especially hurt) and admitting to occasionally imaging people we know in real life in a sexual manner for a few seconds? Including this girl. There are so many other examples I could give. I cried over something he said over the phone 4 nights ago, which he didn't mean but I just thought ""wtf, the right man shouldn't make you cry"". He was super apologetic and spoke to me for 30 mins to reassure me he loves me etc etc. I know it's his mental illness that makes him behave this way and that he does love me, but it is so hard. 

I never doubted him before but I'm just so tired. I guess I could happily date him for a few more months, maybe even a year, but I'm starting to think there is no way he is *""the one""* after saying those things. I started thinking ""what if eventually I meet someone with his humour and kindness who *gets* me, but doesn't have these same issues?"". But Reddit, I love him, I'm just not ready to let go. I litreally meet him the first day of college at 19, he has basically been with me my entire adult life. He has made me so happy and really loves me, I can be 100% me in front of him. I'm plagued with guilt in case I stay another while because I'm content but unhappy like 40% of the time, because what if deep down I know it won't result in marriage anymore? Is this a phase?

921,"So, I’ve been working at a fast food joint for a month now. And I feel like the management does not behave in a professional manner. 

One of my managers has been working here for a few years and recently had a friend of hers hired as a manager, as well. This friend of hers has since been demoted and essentially fired from working at another store nearby for failing a health inspection (by lying about the temperature of a food item as being much, much higher than the temperature that it actually). 

With that being said, I feel like this is a textbook case of cronyism. 

Both of my managers will unnecessarily berate associates. And, even if they are in the wrong - they NEVER apologize for it.

Today, for example, my shift was going to end in ten minutes. And I still had to do a temperature check - so I tried to finish that off as well as count my register. 

My one manager (the one that has been here for years) asked me why I didn’t help my coworker that was doing drive thru to pack the one bowl that somebody ordered.

I explained, “Oh, I apologize - I was doing the temperature checks and I was getting ready to  count my register.” 

She then proceeded to ask me, “Are you ... okay? Like ... are you just not in a good mood or something?”

I felt like this was an inappropriate thing for a manager to say, like it wasn’t necessary to ask. If I had spoken to her in a tone that was sassy, then maybe I would understand. But, again, I just felt this wasn’t a professional response.

Shortly after, I counted my register before clocking out (at this point - it’s about half an hour after my shift was SUPPOSED to end). 

The other manager (the one that’s fairly new) came over and counted the money from my register again. Then, she slams a wad of cash against the desk and tells me that I counted the money wrong. The count was eight dollars under the true value that the register had. 

So, she re-counts it and says, “Oh, no the number that you counted was right.” 

At this point, I just wanted to know if I did count the money wrongly. I want to know if I could improve at my job so I can be yelled at less. 

I ask her (in a tone that sounded more curious than harsh), “Oh, what happened?”.

Then she slowly told me, “I counted the coins wrong.”

Then, I feel like I could have misheard her because of the mask and everything, but I think she told me, “Don’t be mad.” 

There was no apology whatsoever after her harshly accusing me of counting the money incorrectly.  

I seriously don’t know how to feel. I feel like I’m not 100% in the right in this situation, but I also feel like I’m not 100% in the wrong, either. 

I guess I would just like to hear some advice from others that have been in similar situations. 

TL;DR - One of my managers hired one of her friends to be a manager that got demoted for incompetency. One of my managers asked me if I was in a bad mood when I explained to her that I could not do three things at once and my other manager didn’t apologize to me after she harshly accused me of counting the money in my register incorrectly.",22Aug2020,1

One morning around 3 or 4 months ago he came back to the house very drunk.. I’ve had past.. issues.. with a grown man some years ago that has kind of left me fucked up so I tend to feel very uncomfortable when I’m alone with him sober let alone drunk. He gets touchy when he drinks as most people do, I didn’t think much of it since it was normal touching, until he said something very odd that morning. He was talking to me, then suddenly began mentioning how much I reminded him of my mother (who is not in our lives), complimenting my hair, and then did something.. disgusting.. He looked me up and down slowly and trailed off mumbling about me being “sexy” ..I was wearing jeans and a hoodie. It took a moment for him to realize what he’d done and he immediately began panicking, I could see the pure fear in his eyes, fumbling with his words trying to explain himself and then offered me money as well. I didn’t know what to do being in shock so I just said I understood what he meant and what his intention was and immediately went to bed. 
I haven’t felt the same since then, and feel myself struggling to even look at him the same way on top of my already existing struggles to build a normal parent relationship.

I keep resenting her because I didn't knew the fact that she was talking with a lot of guys and she even dated one while I tought that we were getting to know each other better.

We discussed and she told me that she is genuinely sorry and she did that because wasn't sure about me caring for her and she didn't though that I would care what she is doing,she acknowledged that we talked more often,but she wished to date her,to show her that I'm serious.

After we started to date,she dated 1 more time that guy and then she was just with me.I must say that this girl really loves me and I can see it in her eyes.She confessed me that even when she was with that guy,her mind was on me.She showed me her discussions with her friends and I know she didn't lied.

I keep asking her different questions about those who she talked with and in the heat of the moment I say that she didn't cared for me and she preferred those because I wasn't enough and It's not fair because she hasn't told me about those guys and the one who she was dating.Then we both feel miserable and I feel remorse.

Okay, this is going to seem stupid, but hear me out. I have a YouTube channel where I put up covers and stuff. I also have a facebook page and twitter for it. This person writes me and asks if I take requests and I say yes. He told me what he wanted to hear and I was okay with that. Now, however he says ""I hope we can talk."" My problem is, If I talk to this person constantly like he is expecting then I will have to talk to everyone the same way. I have chronic migraines, I can not physically keep up with talking to a bunch of people like that. I am torn, because I don't want to be rude/stuck up, but like I said, if I talk to this person like he is expecting I'll have to talk to everyone and that is just not practical. How can I word this to this person with out sounding mean or stuck up? I am not famous yet, and who knows, I may never become famous, but 93 subscribers on my channel, and 80 or so likes on the facebook page is a little daunting. My number one fear is I'll come across rude or stuck up. I just need to make my point with out sounding like that. Again this may seem like a small thing, but to me it isn't. Maybe later I can explain why I have this fear, but for now, my head feels as if it's going to explode, so I just need to rest and listen to nature sounds. That always calms me.

This was in February (obviously before corona) and things just spiraled out of control from there. I have also had to reject her multiple times over the years, yet she won't get the hint. 

The Dilemma: I want to cut her off because the past few months have opened my eyes about how toxic Sam is. She's really no good for me and I see that now. Plus it would be a big self confidence booster because I'm kind of a pushover when it comes to social situations. However, I only have to deal with her for one more year, and even then I probably won't have to see her because of online schooling (I'm a senior this year... yey). Do I even bother cutting this person off if we'll just go our separate ways at the end of the year?",22Aug2020,1
