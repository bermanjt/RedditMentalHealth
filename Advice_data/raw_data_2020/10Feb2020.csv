2,"I’ve been stressed out at my job right now worrying about this because our boss from my second job (my sister’s only job) fires her for not calling off in time when I knew she was going to urgent care to get a paper saying she was ok to call off.. now she’s out of a job which is bad in itself but also stressful on me because I’m now the only person in the house atm with any form of income. Her boyfriend is unemployed as well until he gets a job at this lumber place a friend said he’d get him a job at today. But my sister still needs one because she has a son to take care of.

So... what can I do to help her? She has a GED but has knowledge regarding baking and is good with math. But she also has a very weak immune system and gets sick easily. Nothing diagnosed with a name, but she practically is sick every other week.

Please let me know if you have any ideas. Worried older sister here and I have enough stress in my own life. Thank you.",10Feb2020,1

5,"This is both a rant and a plea for help. Not sure it it belongs here but I'm posting it anyways.

Started playing bass as a sophmore in high school. My HS had a poorly funded music program and no jazz bands/string ensembles/concert bands, only a guitar class and marching band. Dispite thay, my teacher very graciously gave me a bass guitar to use and let me play all of the lower lines in the guitar music books. Did this for three years, got decent at reading treble clef, playing ,and performing, then went to CC after I graduated to do GEs and get some music classes out of the way.

College was hard because I was very inexperienced compared to my peers, who all have been doing music since middle school or earlier. Also had to relearn how to read since I now had to read bass clef. Auditioned for top level jazz band 3 times, never got in. Never went to a compitition. I did do 2 years of music theory and related music major classes, and I loved every second of it. Solidified the fact that I want to major in music education and become a music teacher. Networked, made friends, got gigs. Everyone on campus knew me as the bass guy. Everyone in my family was excited for me. Also got a lot better at bass, specifically for jazz. Worked and saved up to buy my own double bass. Played in classical string orchestra, jazz combos, and the jazz B band. Skills increase by a lot and I'm feeling very confident. Get my AA in music.

Time comes to transfer, go to audition for the school of music at my uni of choice. I get really nervous and it ruins my audition. Don't get in to school of music, but get into university. Choose a temp major and start practicing for the next audition opportunity. My sight reading improves. Rythym improves. Can't wait for next audition opportunity, gonna be great.

That audition was today, and I failed again. I did my scales, etude, and jazz tune/soloing nearly perfectly but was given a sight reading peice that I straight up couldn't read. Most, if not all the notes were 4 ledger lines or higher (highest one was 7 lines up). Took me my suprise and made me realise I couldn't read thumb position. Was told it immediately disqualified me and I was asked to leave. Now I'm sitting in my car typing this just reeling and not knowing what to do.

 I'm 21, 3 years of community college and 2 years of music theory under my belt, a semester and a half done at uni, and I have to pretty much reevaluate my major, my career choice, and my life. I feel so defeated. Put my family $6000 in debt from just these 2 semesters in uni I've done. Parents said they wouldn't help me with school costs anymore if I didn't get in the 2nd time. I work a part time minimum wage job and can't pay for school on my own. If I restart and pick a new major, 4 years of school will be for nothing and I'l have 4+ ahead of me. Plus my life has been so focused on music I don't even know what I could major in. All my friends are graduating with their degrees this year and I'm over here at square one. I want to give up but I'm afraid if I do I'll end up a loser working a dead end job just to survive. I want to teach, I want to pass on the gift of music, but I guess I'm just not good enough. What the fuck do I do reddit.",10Feb2020,1

8,"I’ve had the same job for a year and a half, and for some reason this wasn’t an issue last year. I am in North Carolina.

Upon receiving my w2, I found out that I owe almost 1,600 to the IRS. I did not claim exempt on my w4. My 2 allowances are that I’m married and we both work. That has not caused me to not pay federal income tax before. When I confronted my employer, they stated that their accountant said that because of my allowances I was only paying $13.50 per year in federal income tax. Which is ridiculous.

Obviously, that is a lot of money. My husband lost his entire tax refund to cover what I owe, and we still have to pay $300.

I’m seeking advice on how to proceed. My husband wants to sue them, I feel like maybe I wasn’t supposed to put any allowances, I don’t know what to do.",10Feb2020,1

10,"Ok so this all happened a couple of days ago and I honestly don't know what I should be feeling or doing at the moment.
I also don't care if this doesn't get comments or anything like that - it's always good to rant!
Me(20M), my ex (20F) and my neighbor (20M) are all in the same friendship group as well.

So me and my ex broke up 3 months ago mainly because I wasn't happy (but that's another story in itself), and we agreed to remain friends since we're in the same friendship group. Since then, I found out a week before the main story that she immediately started sending sex jokes and flirty pick up lines to my neighbor (we share a wall at university). I could kind of tell something was going on: at house parties they got uncomfortably close etc, but I just thought I was being paranoid.

After three months of paranoia about the situation, it was my birthday,and this is where the story starts. I had friends from other universities visiting and we along with our friendship group were going out on the town.
What I remember was this: I was leaving the house very drunk, saw some of my friends down the hill and started running down the hill toward them.
What my neighbor said was this: there was a guy and his girlfriend arguing and she said ""fuck off"", me hearing this shouted ""oooh beef"" and then ran off and then the fight started.
What my neighbor is annoyed about though is not the fact that I shouted what I did, but the fact that I denied it the next day because I couldn't remember it.
My best friend (19M), who I trust with my life, said that when he was pulling them apart, the other guy said that he said some shit about his girlfriend ""I'd shag her"" etc. 

The next day, I was preparing to apologise to my neighbor after the lecture we share as he leaves super early. However, he stopped me halfway through saying that we'll talk about it at home.

After that, my ex reached out to me saying we need to talk and said a meeting point for us. I went and she had prepared a list of ten points. They were about how she and my neighbor had feelings for one another and had kissed the NIGHT BEFORE MY BIRTHDAY (she was also telling me the day AFTER my birthday as well). After those first two points I didn't hear the rest due to shock, but I got the gist: I remember hearing ""I don't know where it's going but I'm excited to find out"". 
After that list, I was speechless and just left. I booked the next train to my best friends university, because I just couldn't bear to be at mine at that point. And that was the best decision I could have made at that point.

What is probably also useful to know is that when we were in a relationship, she 100% said she would never get with my neighbor because of the way he acts. That just makes me think that she's doing it to spite me, which is even more messed up.

I've just returned back to my university, and I  don't know what to do about the situation. Any help would be great, thank you.

TLDR: before my birthday, my ex kissed my neighbor at a party which I found out about the day after my birthday; my neighbor or me may/may not have started a fight on my birthday, which I don't remember and he's annoyed about me for not remembering it",10Feb2020,1

15,"So financially I’m in a very good spot right now and for the first time in my life I’m on a track I’m extremely proud of. On the outside looking in I really appear to have my shit together. The problem is I think I’m on too many tracks. 

So sorry for the long post but 6 years ago I left college to pursue a career in fashion. It took me a long time but eventually I was able to build a brand, showcase in NYFW and really get things going. Then came my overwhelming lack of money, consistent income and sketchy future. I mean I was broke and I hated it. And then I started to beat down on myself like what if this career has an expiration date. What if I don’t secure my future and I started looking into my plan B. So I enrolled back in school to pursue Math and physics. Two subjects I love and could see myself having a future in. 

So school was going well. My business was going well. Then came rock bottom amount of money in my bank and I knew I needed to make stable money and quick if I was going to move forward. It takes money to make money right?! So I decided I needed to find a way to fund my business, school and my life. I ended up getting into car sales. I got really good at it and made more money than I ever have in my whole life. I even make more money than my parents! But now I’m trapped. I love the money I make but I hate my job. Sales can be sooo draining. Yet, I’m too afraid to leave the money. 

So now I work 50 hours per week in Sales. I go to school full time. And then I try my best to make my designs and get all of my business done during the weekend. I’ve tried hiring someone to assist with the business but where do I have the time to train them?? And I have become a shell of a person. I’m so burnt out some days I just want to quit work it’s the only thing that I don’t like the most but takes up the majority of my time and keeps me afloat. But I’m an adult. I have big girl bills and no degree yet. 

Idk where I’ll make this much money again. And it’s like I know I’m doing a lot but my business is my dream and I’ve always wanted to have my degree. But then I have this major feeling of being a failure if I leave something. I’m way too conflicted but if I don’t figure out something soon I think I’m going to push myself into a deep feeling of unhappiness where I may drop the wrong thing. 

I feel guilty for taking time for myself. Like it was getting to the point where I was counting the minutes of a long shower because I could be studying or sewing. I’m not seeing my family and friends as much as I like, and when I do see them all I can think about is what I should be doing. So I’m looking for any amount of advice or words of encouragement because I could really use it!",10Feb2020,1
16,"I'm 28 and I feel like I'm at a bit of a crossroads in life. On one hand, I'm married and my husband and I both have stable jobs. We'd both like to have kids soon. 


But on the other hand, I never finished my college degree. I started working full time while I was in college and got married soon after when I was meant to graduate. So the timing was never right to go back. 


I have about two semesters left and while this could be very manageable part time with children. I'm not sure if it's smart to put something off that I can do now. 


I keep hearing that having kids before 30 and particularly 35 is best. My mom and most of the women in my family had kids before 25. I'm trying not to compare myself to them. But I feel behind since I do want kids and I don't want to keep putting it off.

My husband also turned 30 recently and I know that he's been thinking about it more. We've already been looking at houses for a family etc. 

We do live near our family and they can certainly help with taking care of the kids when they're old enough. 

I'm not really sure what to do. Having a college degree is important to me and it would help me progress in my field quite a bit. It's just that I haven't been able to hammer out the last few credits.


I feel lost and most of my friends have either finished college and had kids after. Or they're single and don't plan on having children in the near future.

I guess what I'm asking is - does it make more sense to wait on the degree? or wait on having kids? or is it possible to do both at the same time?",10Feb2020,1

18,"There's honestly nothing that ""gets me excited"". I don't have any hobbies, not really any interests, and certainly nothing I would say I have any sort of ""passion"" for.

I plunk around on my guitars, but I don't have any genuine interest in playing music. I'm not very good, but I have no desire to get any better. I play video games, but more out of habit than it being a real source of enjoyment.

The closest thing I could say ever made me ""happy"" was when I used to have friends to hang out with and play games (card games, board games, etc), or even just sit around and hang out with. I haven't had that in *years*, though, and it's kinda taken its toll.

I know the advice is usually ""just think of ideas, and if something sounds fun, try it"". But that's sort of it; *nothing* I've thought about ""sounds fun"". There's nothing I want to ""learn to do"".

What sucks is that, I know that I'm a fairly boring person because of it. I thought about it last week, that my friend always asks people ""what do you do for fun?"", and to be honest, I can't say I have an answer. And there's nothing I even *want* to say.

If I'm not at work, I just want to be comfortable and hang out with friends. I don't really want to ""go anywhere"" or ""do anything"". And that's apparently a huge turn-off, but it's the honest truth.

I dunno. Is there a way to *FORCE* yourself to get interested in a thing? Or some thing that's particularly interested, like ""if you're really not interested in anything at all, you should try and get into *this thing*, because it's automatically super interesting to most people""?",10Feb2020,1
19,"I am in my second year of a technology course and recently I have not been enjoying attending any of my lectures/practicals. I attended close to every class in my first year but around the start of this college year, I got a job (evening shift) for some extra money. This, of course, takes up so much of my free time and the idea of somedays leaving the house for college early in the morning (8am) until late at night (10.30pm) is something that is severely draining.

I have other aspects of life which I spend so much of my free time on. Most of these, I actually enjoy doing like hanging out with friends, spending time with my SO and creating YouTube videos etc. 

I don’t know what to do really as deep down, I believe I should follow through with the course as to potentially get a good job. I also don’t want to disappoint anyone who wants me to stay in the course and are happy/proud that I’m in college. At the same time, I really am not enjoying going in and doing the current work, as there have been topics introduced in modules that have led to me losing interest.

40,"Okay so to start off me and this dude have been friends for over 7 years and we’ve been through almost traumatizing teenager experience together so it’s safe to say we’re close. Recently he’s been acting pretty distant and today I asked him if he wanted to hangout and match, but he said he had just woken up and said he would hmu later. I didn’t think anything of it, but I lost my AirPods, so I went to the tracking app for them and there is a tab for people, and he’s shared his location to me in the past, and the tracking app opened to people and I saw that he was on the complete other side of the city as his house in another neighborhood. So I just wanted advice on if I should confront him, or just let it go and go on minding my business???",10Feb2020,1
41,"So last week I was at lunch with a couple of my friends and we were talking about how Valentines Day was coming up. Me and one of my friends were joking around about being single and that stuff. But my other friend was like if you want me to be your wing-woman I can help you out. I didn’t think much about it until last night I was out with my friend group and again we were joking around about Valentines and were making plans for all the single guys to just hang. But the same girl that said she’d help me out said “he won’t be apart of the single group for long.” Obviously I greatly appreciate what’s she doing, but like I don’t know who she’s talking too or if it’s going to work out for me before Valentines comes around. Should I even bother talking about it to her or should I just be patient and wait and see what happens and who she’s trying to set me up with or if anything is happening at all and she was just joking about the comments she made last night?",10Feb2020,1
42,"My dad is moving out of the country for a job. It will pay well, so it's important that he goes and I don't blame him for it. I (26) have lived independently with my girlfriend for 8 years now and we enjoy a quiet, peaceful home life. We have a husky who is very sweet, but doesn't get along well with male dogs--especially intact male dogs. This isn't an issue, as we walk him on a leash and let him hang out with girl dogs only. The problem is, my dad expects us to take in his dog when he leaves. Indefinitely--probably for years. We don't have any family here with room for a dog.  It's a big dog, half pitbull, and unneutered and aggressive. Every time our dogs have been around each other it's very clear that they are extremely on edge and uncomfortable. They've had violent encounters before. Last year my dad brought his dog over unannounced and off leash and his dog without warning jumped on my dog. Fortunately no real injuries occurred, but it was very alarming. Anyway, my dad expects my girlfriend and I to deal with this 24/7: two dogs trying to kill each other. I tried to be open-minded about training them to get used to each other, but it's always failed and it's clear that it won't work out. Two days ago they got in a really bad fight--blood everywhere, gums torn up. We were able to separate them safely. My dad's dog, after our husky was long out of sight, turned on me and bit my hand.  
Now, I am being guilt-tripped for being the bad guy because I put my foot down and said this isn't going to happen. It's a ridiculous, unsafe situation for everyone involved in my opinion and I don't think it's fair that my girlfriend and I's (and our dog's) lives be turned into a constant stressful situation of dogs trying to kill each other.

I'm lonely in my university, with a select 5 friends that I've managed to make. Some anxiety prevents me from ""just joining a club"" or seeking help from campus counselors.  I don't really know what to do from here. Ideally, I just want to switch out into a diff program, or a diff school but it's obviously easier said than done. I have nowhere I truly want to go. It sucks but I'm quite indecisive and passive about most things, I do have a love for art and writing but it's risky, to begin with, and I'm afraid of wasting more money on programs that'll get me nowhere. Taking a gap year isn't the best option as my parents would rather me do something productive and find a program that'll get me into a job fast after graduating. At this point, I don't know what to do. I have no significant passion that drives me and I'm honestly just coasting.

49,"I'm currently 21, male, and a third year in uni.  I've been wanting to reconnect with this girl from the K-12 (kindergarten to 12th grade) school I used to go to, but my situation is a little complicated.

Basically, around 9th-10th grade, I started being absent from school a lot because of social anxiety/losing motivation.  For as long as I knew, everyone around me had really high expectations of me and I was known as that one quiet kid in class who never said anything but was really smart (which was never true in my mind).  I pretty much shut myself out from the world for 6+ years and immersed myself into this one online game.  I wasn't active on social media at all, and I eventually left the K-12 school I was at and graduated at another high school in my area.  When I look back on it now, everyone was really nice to me and I feel horrible for just running away.

As for the girl, the reason I care so much to reconnect is because she was just a genuinely nice person to me.  I was extremely shy and quiet back then, but I believe she liked me because she would always try to reach out to me.  I remember she asked for my number and then she would always initiate text convos.  Over the summer in 8th grade, we texted each other back and forth for probably a month straight, and it never got boring.  I never had the guts to ask her out, though, and I think she moved on to other people.  We talked in person occasionally, but not nearly as much as through text.  Eventually we stopped texting when my absences from school became more frequent and I started shutting myself away. 

In conclusion, the situation I'm in right now is this: I left my school in a really strange way, and I have no idea what people think of me.  I want to reach out to this one girl but I feel like it would be very weird considering the way I left in the past.  However, I believe I'm finally at a place in life where I'm ready to stop running away.  I want to move forward and just focus on the present/future, but at the same time there are things in my past that I can't let go of.  What should I do?  Thanks for reading.",10Feb2020,1

While looking at therapists in my area, its clear that they all offer very different approaches. I am unclear how to go about choosing someone to help me and I'm even more unsure of who I would feel more comfortable opening up to.

On one hand women make me feel more comfortable and i feel like they better empathize with me. On the other I feel like maybe what I need is less empathy and someone of the same sex who might understand me.

Maybe this doesn't matter at all? Has anyone had experience with both sexes? Was one more helpful than the other due to it? Is there something more specifically I should be looking for?

at this point im tired of trying to get them to change anything because they've made it clear that they pretty much dont care.

I cant close the door to my room which is a big problem for me because I cant have any privacy and its extremely annoying when im trying to sleep because the TV in the next room is too loud or my dad will be snoring too loud for me to sleep

they way that they behave towards me has driven me to self harm several times and I think my mom even told my dad not to let me talk to Suicide Prevention anymore and if i have a problem then I need to call someone to pick me up which I'm assuming due to another incident that happened she wants to be an asylum or mental facility 

I'm sick of having to stay with them because they only seem to be concerned with their own reputation and dont care how anyone else feels as long as it doesn't affect how people see them and at this point I either need to be separated from them or i'll eventually commit suicide because  I don't care as long as I never have to deal with them again.",10Feb2020,1

About 3 months into my recovery things got really bad. I was hit and miss some days i would use, some days i wouldnt and my dad was so stressed about it that it probably caused his stroke, this isnt forsure but he was already high strung in general and i know finding out, out of nowhere that his only son was hooked on heroin was alot for him to handle. So he has his stroke and since the day he had his stroke almost 3 years ago i have been clean, good for me. Unfortunately the stroke seems to have either permanently damaged him or triggered something. Hes my boss at work. And this highly intelligent man that had an answer and solution for everything has become a shell of his former self. He cant remember anything and his personality changes literally by the day.

72,"I'm 17 and a junior in high school, and I'm a historically neutral person when it comes to drama in my school. We have a perverted super-senior at my school who's caused a lot of problems - and he'll be a super-super-senior next year here too. 

He runs a quite disturbing politically extremist blog, has a child possibly conceived by rape, is in a relationship with a junior where abuse is suspected, is accused of grooming/abusing a handful of freshmen &amp; 8th graders from other schools, and possibly sexually abusing younger children via the internet. 

It's caused a lot of issues really in the whole school district. People aggressively defend / support him, people aggressively are against him, etc. On Facebook, the afterschool app, Twitter - people are constantly fighting over it and it's almost more drama every day. 

Local police agencies, the state police, child services, the FBI, the school districts, and others have &amp; continue to be investigating him. 

I made a Facebook post recently addressing the situation since many of my friends are involved in the drama, and I have regular (limited) access to information others don't. 

In that post I discussed how the only thing that is a 100% known undisputed fact is the existence of his blog - and while it shares horrible, extremist politics (involving neo-nazisim, wishes for racial / religious genocides, incel shit, etc) it's not an excuse for ""self defense"" violence because hurtful words aren't something you need to physically defend yourself against. I talked about how it's ridiculous that people believe violence against politically bad people is ok just because they're politically bad people.

I also talked about how the investigations are surely still ongoing (I directly know for a fact they 100% are), how even horrible allegations deserve presumption of innocence until guilt is established in court. I also talked about what the civil punishments [defamation] could be for people who have no firsthand knowledge of anything making accusations that turn out to be false after investigations are complete. 

My post was shared a lot in numerous circles, with almost only very ugly criticism from all sides - I also know for fact that my post has been saved &amp; repeated elsewhere.  I feel like I've got myself involved in a situation I can't back out of.

What messages you deleting?” And he said “No I mean I deleted the whole convo” and I said “Ohhh. Ummm why’s that?” And he said “Yea cause” he didn’t say why. Like he’s been saying cause a lot when I ask him questions.  “Can you just tell me? Please (his name). What’s going on.”

And he said “Nothing” and i said “Is everything okay? I don’t believe that. I’m sorry” 
And he said “Remember when we stopped talking. No I’m serious. That’s why I deleted the messages. Cause we stopped talking and I removed you from my contacts.” 
So I said “we stopped talking on the 4th where you were like I guess this is where the journey ends. So that’s why you deleted everything? But then you hit me up in snap 4 days later🤣”  and he said “Ye lol” 

so I was thinking of something to say. I asked “So we good? I’m just thinking you have something against me right now. Like your pissed” and I said “Phew as long as we good👌” but tbh... he never really responded to me asking if we good..he just said that he’s good to me saying he seems pissed. I sent him a snap friend request and he accepted it...that confused me. Then I changed the topic saying “🍓how’s your indoor music coming along?” And he said “Good hbu” and I said “Lol yeah likewise.” I cringed knowing he dint care about me. 
So we talking...well mostly me just trying to chat talking something funny that happened yesterday and he’s like “oh yea” and asking what I mean and stuff Then he said something back and he said “gtg” this is literally the 2nd time he did this. The first time I didmy judge. But if it’s gonna become a habit in our convos just saying gtg randomly like that then. I’m done.
I don’t know why he felt the need to delete our convos. Idk if he’s talking about that he deleted our argument convo or the entire chat log. 

But he said he deleted the whole convo...He sent that accidental strawberry yesterday..and he asked if I remember when we stopped talking and I asked for clarification that it was on the 4th of January and he said yeah. That happened 35 days ago. So idk why he’s deleting the chat now that it happened a month ago. 
So I’m thinking that he deleted the whole convo...yesterday. But why?

But here’s where it gets confusing he said that’s why he deleted the messages. Yes.... we had that argument convo 28 days ago. But he texted after it 4 days later. So idk why he would delete the chats now. 
Then he states “Cause we stopped talking I removed you from my contacts”. He didn’t remove me..he blocked me. I remember it. So what tf

Option 1 is go to a four year university that will require me to take a student loan for about $70k. In order to pay this off, I have considered joining the military after I finish school and serve for 3 years. 

Option 2 is go to a community college, and then transfer to a university. I really don’t want to stay at home for another 2 years, as I am ready to leave and experience something new (I’ve lived in the same boring city my whole life and I really can’t stand being here for much longer).",10Feb2020,1
79,"Historical story. Only patient people here please if you like to waste your time advising confused people this one is for you!

I met a girl 2 years ago with and old ""friend"" and we were going out some weekends for about a year (like 30 times in total). At that time she clearly liked my friend more because he was older than me and she was young so she couldn't really undrestand that he is an idiot inside (I no longer meet him but I know what he does and he is an idiot). She had a crush on him which I knew about and she told him also but he in her words ""friendzoned her hard"" which yeah he did. After about 1 year we stopped meeting her since I stopped meeting my friend because we had an argument over sea temparature because he was flexing with his vacation on everyone and I told him that the sea is actually pretty cold and that everyone goes on vacation but usually on holidays and he just ragequited the conversation and blocked me everywhere (yeah how stupid of a argument).

I wanted to go out with someone because summer is comming. I scrolled through my contacts list and since she's like the last person that doesn't play computer games these days and actually goes out I decided to come to her house and ask her out (I felt like an idiot after roughly a year of silence but yeah who cares).

It turned out that I actually had to wait for her bus to arrive ten minutes so I waited and asked if she wanted to go out. She agreed and we had a talk. She legit told me that they had such a stupid argument with my old ""friend"" and that she also no longer talks with him.

When we were out she mentioned how he friendzoned her a couple of times and she started talking about school and stuff about how she wishes for a new phone (not like in a bad way like in a close friend talk \[I'm like the closest she ever got to a boy in her life so yeah\]) and she also mentioned how she likes that I understand computers well and stuff. We went for a walk and she started talking about her recent bad experiences with boys and how she would like to find someone who isn't like that (a bunch of virgins from a local town sent her some dick picks so I kinda feel bad for her). She also started pointing out funny things about my old ""friend"" and we laughed good (he is an idiot really so that is okay). She also mentioned that she is happy for a friendship with some guy from her school so I asked her ""And do you want to date him? Do you feel good about him?"" like in a way that I support her in that. She responded that she isn't interested in any relationship with him and that she would just like him as a friend because he is a good friend (confusion 100 like why did she even talked about this this just fucked my mind XD). She also talked about me and how she has never seen me do those weird things ever (sending biceps after 2 messages, disk pics on instant and stuff). When we accidentally got to the bus part and she asked how did I appear out of nowhere I told her that I waited for her at the station and she smiled and said ""Ohhhh that is so sweet I've never had someone wait for me like that"" (not in a arogant way). It all went pretty well, she promised me to download Telegram so we can text and she gave me a hug at the end of the meetup.

Now since woman are such a strange creatures I'm extremely confused what to think of this. You know girls talk and behave like this normally in public together in groups with other girls so I don't know what to think of this. Do you think that she has a crush on me now or something? The last thing I want to happen is to be another idiot that fucks up her mentality by being a virgin that send dickpicks (after what she experienced). I like her, she is a good girl but if she wants to be just friends I won't bring it up. What do you think guys? I'm gonna see her again like next weekend so I need an advice from other people. I also don't want to push her into anything tho.",10Feb2020,1
80,"So I am a freshman in college and I live in a suite with a roommate. Overall she’s a pretty good roommate. She’s clean, doesn’t ever have people over, and we just don’t interact very much. However I am a theatre major and last semester and recently I’ve had to come back to the room at 11:00 or midnight because I have to be at rehearsals. She goes to bed at 9:30 so I try to be as quiet as I can when I come back to our room but I still have to brush my teeth and stuff.  

However, although normally I go home on the weekends this weekend because of rehearsals I didn’t. She got up at 7:00 and started talking on the phone about me. I’m not sure if she thought I was asleep or what but I heard everything. She talked about how I was coming home in the middle of the night and how she just wants to get sleep. I think after this she realized I was listening to her and started texting instead. This makes me even more upset because she wakes me up everyday at 7:00 even if she’s trying to be quiet (I get up at nine). Although she’s been a pretty good roommate, she has done some things to upset me in the past. I’ve heard her talking about me to her friends before and have had her friends ask me about things only my roommate knew. I have social anxiety so this has been really upsetting for me and I’m not sure how I should respond to this if at all. 

 In addition, although I might just be being too sensitive but I think she has recently been trying to annoy me and make me feel uncomfortable. We have a Brita water filter and she has been leaving it empty instead of refilling it. She also didn’t refill our soap dispenser which doesn’t seem like a big deal but she has always refilled it in the past. Out of nowhere she has been talking on the phone a lot in our bedroom which started only a few days ago. She also put herself in charge of who cleans the bathroom this month, making me clean it two months in a row while she put herself ‘on break’ which means she doesn’t have to do anything. 

 I have been doing a lot of things to accommodate her and I don’t understand what is going on. I don’t eat takeout in our room because she has said she has a sensitive nose and is allergic to nuts. I basically got a giant tent to go over my bed so she doesn’t have to be disturbed by my computer’s light at night. I like to listen to podcasts at night so I wear headphones. She has a noise machine she listens to at night and although we have talked about it before she just plays it without any headphones so I turn on two fans so I don’t have to listen to it. 
 I’m so fed up with her and with myself. She never asked me to not eat in the room or wear headphones but I do anyway because I hate conflict and I never want to rock the boat. I’m so afraid to make her upset but it seems that she doesn’t care very much about what I’m feeling. I want to switch rooms but it’s so late in the school year and it’s not like I’ve tried to sort this out. I could also just end up with someone worse. I don’t know what to do. I feel so uncomfortable in my own room and I never want to be in there anymore. Any Advice?",10Feb2020,1

82,"I caught my boyfriend this morning erotic roleplaying with somebody (and there could be more) on Discord.

For some context, a little before this happened, I noticed that whenever my boyfriend was on Discord, he would close it before I could look at his screen or would switch to another app. I was mildly suspicious, but then brushed it aside as just me overthinking things. Then it came to a point where when he'd receive messages he'd quickly swipe them away or raise his arms up out of view and respond. 

This morning, as we were watching a video on his phone together, he received a message. I was able to read the first word, which contained ""moaned."" I brought this up to him, in to which he admitted to me that he recently started doing this, and that his old group of friends that he used to roleplay with stopped talking to one another. He turned to other discord servers to roleplay and that all he could find were the erotic roleplaying servers. His reasoning was because he was bored at work during break and had nothing better to do.

In all honesty, I dont know how to feel about this. I really want to think that his answer was genuine and honest, but as a person who's been cheated on 3 times by an ex (unknowingly at the time) in the past, it's really hard to take this all in.

90,"Basically ever since my parents separated (almost a year ago) she has slowly become abusive. 

My dad was very emotionally abusive to me and my mom, and he was sometimes physically and sexually abusive to her. Right before my parents separated he was beginning to get physical with me. (I am a minor, female, nearly age of majority though.) The abuse between my parents had been going on for probably 13 years or so, my dad started targeting me about 9 years ago. 

Both of my parents are addicts. My dad to alcohol, my mom to prescriptions and street drugs. Often they would make sure they had their fix before they would tend to me and my brother (he’s 2 years older than me). We always got what we needed though- shelter, water, clothes, food. 

DHR/CPS has been involved many times. I have really bad mental health issues and I was hospitalized for 6 months when I was 14 for multiple suicide attempts. However my parents just lied to the case workers, put on a nice front for home visits, and they threatened me into getting the case closed every time. 

My mom has been really depressed for a long time. She rarely leaves her room, doesn’t have a job, is on a lot of drugs. She lets sketchy people come around and stay in our house. And slowly she has become hateful and abusive just like my dad. 

At first she was just sad and I would try to lift her spirits, but then she got angry and started taking all her anger out on me. She blames me for everything. If I don’t do all of the housework she refuses to buy groceries for me and she screams at me and tells me all the stuff I do wrong/how I ruined her life. She won’t let me have a job and won’t let me learn how to drive. She doesn’t let me go out often, and since I graduated high school early I’m always at home now. She has a tantrum when I won’t give her money my dad gave me for emergencies so she can get drugs. 

I don’t know what to do. My dad doesn’t have a place where I can live with him currently, otherwise I would go live with him. He’s been a lot better. He’s getting help and really trying to improve his life and the relationship we have. 

My brother doesn’t get abused by either of them but he won’t help me (which I understand). My mom won’t listen as much as I try to tell her she’s hurting me and making things so much harder than they have to be.

92,"I'm a college sophomore, and I share a room with someone I went to high school with. We are friends, but not super close. I have no issues living with him, other than the fact that he non stop (literally every single moment of every day) whistles and sings along to the music he is listening to.

He also almost exclusively listens to songs from musicals and plays, which is kind of irrelevant, but for some reason bothers me and I have no idea why. It drives me absolutely mad. I can't focus, get work done, or have one second of peace and quiet. It has genuinely lowered my quality of life.

118,"I'm 29 and I have a 12-month old daughter but I only have 2 or 3 friends. They are more like drinking buddies than actual friends so you could really say I have no friends. My partner mentioned this to me tonight and it really hit me hard. Maybe my life has been a complete waste.

I'm the type of person who is so unpopular that I don't post on social media because I know my posts would either get zero likes or maybe a small handful. I also don't particularly like posting on Facebook. My partner is the opposite: she loves Facebook and posts a lot. It is a huge divergence in our value systems but it's not a relationship-breaker.

My personality is highly introverted almost to the point of misanthropy. I don't think I give the impression that I dislike people but I spend so little time interacting with others that I might aswell be a misanthrope. I tend to feel drained very quickly in social situations and also I severely lack self-confidence.

My life path has been slightly unconventional. I graduated from university in 2013, went alone to Southeast Asia on a 5-week solo trip, and then worked in an office for 12 months. I hated office work.

After my office contract finished, I went to Australia on a working holiday visa for six months, failed at that due to the aforementioned introversion, and I then became a freelance writer/editor without any qualifications in writing/editing.

The move to freelance work was 4 years ago. Since then, I've spent my life split between both my home country and Thailand. I developed a love for Thai food and Thailand in general during my solo trip and I wanted to go back there. My partner is Thai so that gave me a good excuse to keep going back!

Socially though, I have been very isolated. In Thailand, I never really integrated into the local expat scene. My social life consisted of going to bars sporadically and having drinks with randomers who I'd never see again. I mostly worked alone on my laptop in cafes. 

During the times I spent living at home over the last four years, I haven't met anyone new. I have relied upon my 2 or 3 drinking buddies with whom I'd go out for beers every few weeks to every couple of months. I played soccer with some Meetup groups from time to time but no social connections ever materialized.

I'm now in the position where my youth is over and I have a baby daughter, both of which severely limit my potential to meet new people. I don't see my child as a burden but I am just calling a spade a spade here in that taking care of her drastically limits my potential to form new friendships and make up for this wasted 20s.

The whole conversation about my social failures stemmed from a discussion with my partner about where we would buy property after we save up enough money. She is Thai so she suggested a part of the country with few foreigners close to her family. I rejected that notion because I said I'd like to live near to where I could make friends. 

She then mentioned how I've been coming to Thailand for the last 4 years and haven't made friends there. That stung pretty bad and the reason it stung is that it is true.

So, my situation now is that I am looking back on five years of my prime in life as a complete social waste and a failure. Looking ahead, I have my 30s ahead of me, a small child to take care of, so my opportunities to make up for this and improve my social life are going to be severely limited.

I guess I am just asking for some advice on whether it's possible to make more of an impact on people and make new friends as I get older. Thanks.",10Feb2020,1
119,"Had a test this Sunday in math class. Now I knew the material well enough I could have got a 90+ without even studying for it, but after getting really low grades in basically every other class I kinda related my self worth (?) Over the grade I would have got on this test, and stated multiple times I could not deal with getting less than a perfect score on it.

Because of this, i spent 21 hours this past week (14 the last 2 days) preparing for it and did all the relevant questions from the SAT equivalent In my country from the last ten years, in total 40 questions, which was way more than enough, but I did it anyway because I was afraid to disappoint myself and my teacher.

Now I did the test, and all the 4 questions were directly taken from past 'SATs' so I had already solved them at home and knew the answers. Even then, I messed up on a part of a question and didn't think about it until after I turned it in, 20 min early, then I realized what I did wrong but couldn't go back to fix it.

All day I've been stressing out over this to an extreme degree (almost had an anxiety attack, cried, and just couldn't get it off my mind - it's 4 am) and apperantly the part I messed up on is only worth 2 points but I still can't get over it because I feel like I should've known better.

Now I know it's not justified, I know I'll get a 98 which is a good score, but my anxiety makes it seem like I failed.

How do I stop thinking about this?

TLDR- messed up on a tiny portion of a test after studying a ridiculous amount, I know I will get a 98 but it still feel like I failed because it's not perfect and I ""should've known better"", super anxious over it all day

(I am seeing a psychologist, but the next session was cancelled, so I'll only see her on 18.2, and I can't get good advice from people near me because it sounds like I'm bragging, and should be more than happy with a 98)",10Feb2020,1

I texted my mother to ask if I should tip and how much because she’s done this before, and I remarked that the bags were plastic (I was concerned about the frozen items). My mom usually replies pretty fast so I was confused on why it took a little while, but I get a reply saying:

“Walmart deliveries are done through the Walmart pick up department. We are having problems making sure special requests go through to them. A tip is entirely up to you.”

124,"Hi people of reddit! This is my first post here so.. here goes : 

I have a schoolmate who is younger than me and he can become a little weird. ( Let's call him Rick )  Honestly, I get annoyed at him sometimes because he can get a little cocky ( sometimes disrespectful ) but says sorry right after. He is also very confident about the things that he love. And when I say very, his confidence can become a little too much. I don't know if that's a bad thing or a good thing. So anyway --

Just last night, we were having a discussion in our online class portal and our professor sent a link regarding on how to apply for a scholarship. So basically, everyone saw it and had opinions about it. So, Rick sent a message saying "" Oh, I want to but I'm a mixed national so no thanks. "" I didn't find any harm with he said. It seemed perfectly fine to me. But suddenly, he was getting tons of replies for what he said like --

"" So what? You're still a citizen of this country ""
"" I pity you ""
"" So you literally just want to become a dual citizen? Lol "" 
"" What are you even doing with your life? "" 

And so much more. I found it really disrespectful or am I just overthinking? Anyway, he did reply to some of the messages clearly stating that when he reaches a certain age, he would have to pick a citizenship. But I'm not really sure why people would criticize him just for saying that meant no harm. And also, he was the onr who said sorry to those people who disrespected him.  I'm confused. 

I talked to him privately and asked if he was okay. He told me that he has no one to talk to and that it's very hard for him to open to someone because a lot of people make fun of him. He then sent me a video of him crying because I was consoling him. I really felt bad. I was so angry that I sent a message saying "" Stop adding fuel to the fire. Just stop disrespecting one another and just let it be. "" Then one persone decided to laugh at what I said and messaged me privately to say that she wasn't adding fuel to the fire. Lol. I'm so pissed. And my friend even told me that Rick should be the one who stay away so that he won't get bullied or made fun of. Like, wtf? 

Am I just overthinking? It's kind of my first time to feel like this. Like.. to stand up for someone. I'm getting confused.",10Feb2020,1

Additionally I’m short at only five foot seven and a half inches. I am about five foot eight with shoes and slightly taller than that with boots. I’m a social train wreck so I can’t make friends or have a girlfriend. I try to avoid women and say that I don’t want a girlfriend. Actually I wish very badly that I could find a woman to love.

134,"I met this Danish guy while backpacking in Europe this summer and we really bonded. I ended up staying at place for the rest of my stay in Copenhagen and we ended up having lovely talks but also sexual chemistry. Before I left he said he was really going to miss me and that wished that things were different because we'd probably start dating. Well we stayed in contact throughout the months after I came back but it naturally faded out. However, with my current luck in the dating pool,l I decided to give it another try and contact him again - because I felt that we had a great connection and I told him that I kept having him pop up in my head (since I'm spiritual, that signified that he was thinking about me in which he later verified.)
So we catch up and I tell him that he should visit me here in the US and he gets really excited about that. He said he'd definitely love to visit me sometime soon and we made plans when that would be a good time. He then confessed that - since we're both friends on fb - he goes on my fb sometimes and looks at my pictures. He continued to compliment me on how beautiful I was and how he thinks back of the first memory we shared together which was getting a milkshake and smoking some weed in Christiania. Later in the convo he also confessed to me about how much he missed the sex and what his favorite parts of my body were.
I then decided that was the time for me to confess that I'd like to get to know him on a deeper level and consider something more serious. He said he would like that too but he's very sexual so he needs that physical contact with someone. He added ""spoil me with sex talk and the relationship will progress and I'll show you that I care even though I already do."" I told him that's fine and since this would be a LDR that'd be kind of hard to cope with. I told him that in order for me to get more sexual though I need to establish an emotional connection first. He noted that and texted me this morning and asked me how I was, what I was doing etc, but also sometimes hinted at sexual things too.
For example after sending him a voice message he said "" I'm at work right now so can't listen to that but are those seductive messages for me to listen to?"" I said ""no silly, I was just telling you about my day.""  He still hasn't responded but I think he went to sleep since there's a 7 hr difference between east coast US and Copenhagen.

I (F23) always saw my older brother (M35) as my rock, someone I knew loved me and who I could depend on if things got tough or scary, as they often did in my family. When I got injured while abroad he was there to sort through my insurance to get me treated and brought home. If there were problems at home (my other brother would often be violent, and my mum could be volatile at times), he would be down on the next train to help sort out any situation. 

2 years ago (June 2018) I started dating my current boyfriend. This is my first serious relationship, and the first I’ve ever wanted to bring home to introduce to my family. My boyfriend was born in a Middle Eastern, muslim country, and moved here when he was around 4. He does not see himself as muslim however, he is not religious at all, having the same, quite jaded views on religion that I do. He leads a completely secular life, he drinks, smokes and eats what he likes (non halal), which is important to me. As someone with my views on religion, I don’t think I could enter into a serious relationship with a follower of any religion, as I don’t believe we could be compatible with such conflicting world views. His entire family are similar in their faiths, all of his cousins are secular, and the elders very lax about it (they believe in god but drink, no one wears a head scarf). Even still, I was apprehensive to introduce him to my family because they are at times close minded and bigoted. 

He met my mum in December 2018, and she gave me seal of approval. She said he was lovely and kind, and clearly adored me. He then met my other brother (25) when we visited my mums house for my birthday in April (my mum and both brothers live in the same town, I live around 3 hours away). I was actually the most nervous about introducing him to this brother, as I thought that he was perhaps the most prejudiced. Thankfully he really liked him too, they got on well and bonded over music, and more than anything my brother was just really happy that I was happy. My other brother and my SIL were out of town, and so we couldn’t meet to see them, and I didn’t think anything of it. 

I moved in with my boyfriend last summer, moving to a big city which was both scary and exciting. My mum was excited for me, checking in with me often to see how I was settling in, but my brother basically didn’t acknowledge I’d moved anywhere (whenever he moved with my SIL I always made sure to check in, to congratulate them, get them a ‘new home’ card). Similarly, whenever we’d all meet with my SILs family, who would usually be interested and ask how I was doing in my studies, in work etc. No one would even mention or bring up that I now had a partner and was living in another part of the country. They would however, ask my other brother how his new house and girlfriend was (they had been dating less than a month). The final realisation for me that there may be an issue was when I was talking about job applications with my brother (he recently got his BA which was a big deal as he struggled in school with a learning disability. He struggles with spelling and grammar and sentence structure so I helped by proofreading and editing every one of his university essays, and was so proud to see him graduate). He is in a similar field to my partner, so I told him if he ever needed to, he was more than welcome to send his stuff over for him to look at, as he’s been in that industry for years and knows what employers are looking for. He didn’t even reply, just kind of grunted in response. 

In December I visited my mum and she finally came out and just said that my brother is not happy that I’m dating my partner because of his ethnicity and perceived religion. He claimed to her that it was out of concern for me, because he thinks my partner will treat me poorly and force me into wearing hijab etc. But I know this is really not true at all, just a way to justify his ignorance. My mum has told him he’s not religious, how well he treats me, and so has my brother. They have both told him he’s wrong. What angers me a lot by his claims of concern is that, if he was actually concerned, why not bring this up with me? I am not an angry or ignorant person, and would have happily and gladly eased his worries. 

Not only that but I am noticeably happier than I have ever been since meeting my partner. I have struggled with depression for almost 10 years now, which he knows about, and that we have discussed at length. I lost my dad quite suddenly when I was 17 and it really destroyed me. He was my best friend. My brothers are very like my mum, loud and brash and extroverted. I took after my dad however, very quiet and reserved. Following his death, I found it increasingly hard to navigate my family as there was no longer that person who understood me and who I could look to for reassurance and comfort. My family love me, but they don’t understand me sometimes, not like my dad did. After his death I fell into a very bad depression that I’m still not really out of. There were periods where I couldn’t leave the house and I lost a lot of friends. I was miserable and it showed. There were also problems in my family in the years after; my younger brother was in and out of jail and my mum took up drinking. I felt so unstable and honestly unsafe for quite a few years. I was a mess, dropping out of studies and then having to resit years multiple times once I returned. Since meeting my partner and moving in with him, my mood and outlook have improved dramatically. I feel safe, calm, and have someone I can depend on and who will push me to be my best. He is the most kind hearted, patient person I’ve ever met, and he has shown me through his actions how normal love should be, and honestly made me realise just how dysfunctional my family can be at times. I am the best version of myself and so happy with him, yet my brother is actively ignoring this. 

He has been in bad relationships in the past with women who have ended up abusing him mentally and physically, but when introduced I have been nothing but kind and civil and supportive, because I respect that he is a grown man who can make decisions about his own personal life, and even if I am unsure of them, what is it to me? I’m not dating her, so if she makes him happy then let him be happy. What else can you want for your loved ones but to be happy? 
My mum has tried to reason with him, asking ‘What if we had been unwelcoming to SIL’s NAME?’ To which he replied ‘Yeah but at least she’s normal’. 

The comment he made to my mum which really hits me in the heart and makes me want to just cut him off completely is that my Dad wouldn’t be happy that I was dating him. It broke my heart and enraged me that he could try and force his disgusting prejudices on my sweet, kind and caring father, who was ten times the man my brother is clearly, and who would have been overwhelmingly happy for me (we spoke about stuff like that when he was alive, he was always adamant that he was the one who had to meet my boyfriend first, how he’d be happy with anyone I brought home as long as they were good to me). It infuriated me that not only did he clearly never take the time to get to know my Dad, but also that he was willing to stoop that low justify his feelings. Just because he is a racist bigot, how dare he try to make my father into one so that he feels better about his decision. 

I told my mum that I just don’t want to speak to my brother anymore. His behaviour, the fact he avoids the topic and is unwilling to talk to me about it, and unwilling to hear both my mum and my brother’s opinions on the matter, and also how stubborn and pigheaded he is, all demonstrate to me that he’s made his mind up and is not willing to change it. As far as I’m concerned, he is the one who has destroyed our relationship and is unwilling to fix it. However, my mum is now angry at me for cutting contact with him. She thinks that I should just continue to see him when I visit because he’s my brother and family is everything. She keeps saying ‘he still loves you, you’re his sister’, but as far as I’m concerned he doesn’t. I just don’t believe you can truly love someone if you are willing to make their lives miserable just for finding someone they love and being happy. My partner will never be welcome with him, and so neither will I. My mum knows that I am serious about this relationship, this is the person I know I will marry and have children with. Yet she can’t seem to grasp how upsetting this is for me, and keeps trying to act like everything is normal, bringing him up in conversation like there is not an issue. 

Now I’m feeling bad for potentially putting my mum in the middle of all this, as she hates when her children aren’t speaking (this has happened before when my brothers were not speaking when my younger brother went to jail - imo a reasonable thing to have a problem with, un like being in a normal, loving relationship). But at the same time, the fact that she hasn’t put her foot down or really scolded my brother for his actions is giving me great anxiety that perhaps she has some of her own prejudices that she doesn’t want to tell me. I remember her getting angry at my brother and actually hanging up mid phone call on him when he was disapproving of my brother’s new partner, yet I have not seen this defensiveness on my behalf. 

Am I in the wrong to cut contact? And where do I go from here? This will obviously change everything, from birthdays and Christmas celebrations, but I no longer see an alternative. I just don’t see why I should have to reach out and try to convince my brother to like my boyfriend when he has had a problem for over a year now and decided he doesn’t respect me enough to bring it up. I am just in disbelief that someone I have looked up to and idolised for years is that kind of person, and have no idea what to do about it.",10Feb2020,1

Hi! My gf(24) and I(24) for 2 years broke up last week. She gave up on us because we couldn’t understand each other, all we did was fight for the past few months. Even though we fight I never though of giving up on us I still think we will be together for the rest of our lives. That whatever problem we have now is just a phase/challenge. But then, my gf gave up last week, I was trying to talk her not to decide quickly and thag we still have plans to do for our future. I was pleading and crying for her not to leave me but she said there’s no point in talking anymore and hanged up on me. I was devasted on day but as days go by I felt that maybe it was the right decision. I stopped crying and never text her again. The next day, she sent me a message saying sorry that I need to rest and she’s hoping it’s still us in the end. I didn’t respond cause I think she was right it’s pointless to talk anymore. After that, I was carrying on with my life just fine I was not thinking getting back with her. I felt relieved to be honest. I never thought about getting back with her, I was just being busy with myself. But then she sent me a message today, asking if we can talk properly make a decision for both of us so we can have peace of mind. I’m so confused, she already made a decision last week she treated coldly when I asked her not to leave me. I don’t know if I need to respond to her or what. Cause I do think it’s pointless to talk she already made the decision last week and also I do have my peace of mind. Please help me",10Feb2020,1

147,"I come from a history of immense childhood trauma. I also don’t have a support system when it comes to my family of origin. Something I long for so so much is a sense of place and community. 

I recently decided I want to have kids. It scares me beyond belief because up until about a year ago I was certain kids weren’t for me. I had a very long list of reasons why I didn’t want kiddos, despite how much I actually like kids (and I have five younger half sisters whom I love dearly). 

Has any other woman out there experienced this? I don’t know if it’s partially my biology signaling “hey girl you’re time is ticking” or if I simply want kids purely out of selfishness, i.e. don’t have no fam so hopefully this unborn child will take care of me or provide me with the insatiable and sudden urge I have to create the family I never got as a little one.

148,"I’ve been dancing professionally for over a decade. I’ve never had a problem with disordered eating. I’ve always been health-forward. I started doing my own research at a young age when I felt a passion for dance. Most importantly, I have a degree in dance in which I took nutrition and anatomy/kinesiology. 

Does anyone have advice for what to say in social situations when offered foods I don’t want to eat? I am 28 years old as I’ve had this problem since I was a child. Most recently, it happened three times in a row on my own birthday. 

In the past when I’m offered cinnamon rolls, cookies, three tacos instead of two, etc. I’ve tried a subtle manner - saying, “Oh no thanks, I’m good.” Other times I tell the truth, “No thanks, I have a music video shoot in a few weeks.” 

With the body positivity movement, my denial for a Girl Scout cookie can be pushed back with: “But what about being proud of your body and just eating what you want?” The thing is... I don’t want it. It makes parties awkward. I’ve had eyes rolled at me. I truly take a lot of care to speak calmly and not defensively or rudely. 

Have people forgotten that athletes actually need nutritional food that’s strategic to perform? It’s not about aesthetics. It’s about fuel. Advice? I’m tired of being uncomfortable for being disciplined in my career - and having it confused for not being “body positive.”",10Feb2020,1

I used to make 11:50 hourly and got my 40 with three consecutive days off back in the city. It’s personal, why we decided to leave the city. I don’t want to get into it.

We have three friends her we occasionally visit. My girlfriend and I barely see each other anymore because we don’t share the same days off, but we stay up late to make up for it. Communication is good. Sex life is still good. We’re good partners. However, we tend to do our own thing a lot just in the same room when together. I mean, it’s fine considering we’re both homebodies typically...just that I want to get us out of this town. She knows all of this. We both feel it. I don’t know what else to do. We don’t have kids.

A couple days ago I was walking in the mall with my girlfriend and in my peripheral I saw a guy friend we know and some other person. Wasnt sure who it was at first, but I had an idea and so I didnt say anything to her. That is until he followed us before eventually walking up to say hi. I felt my whole body go cold and he started talking, it was so surreal, he shook my hand and introduced himself as my girlfriend’s ex, except they dated for 2 weeks over a year ago, in which he emotionally abused her and sexually assaulted her. I wanted to kill him. I wanted to punch him, beat him, spit in his face, hit him with the heavy water bottle I had in my hand. But that would have just made her more anxious and their were lots of people around and my sensibilities took over. I just looked him dead in the eye while he was being all smug and cocky and saying “I’m sure she’s told you great things about me” (which made me want to squeeze his eye sockets) and said “fuck you” and then I said it again and he walked away (like a little bitch).

(This will make sense, I think, later). I am a bit of an adventurer though. I like to go out and do unusual stuff, my only issue is, my mom doesn't like it. She talks about wanting me to seize the moment, try new things, etc etc, but Everytime I ask or bring it up, she ignores me, tells me I'm irresponsible and she can't trust me. For example, I went to spend the day at my girlfriends and when I wasn't home before 7, she started frantically calling me and texting me demanding me home. Then when I arrived home with a pizza box (we ordered pizza) she questioned if I was even where I said I was. 

She gets super defensive and resistant when I go out or do anything, saying I'm neglecting school (which isn't true, its self paced and I'm more than ahead, with a possible internship in mind). She hates it when I'm more than 2 hours away from home, which poses a bit of a problem because my girlfriend and I have a roadtrip planned very soon. I feel like I'm old enough to travel and do things on my own, but I'm supposed to text her where I am anytime I move locations if I'm out, who I'm with, what I'm doing, and I have to be home before dark.

My family doesn’t really talk or communicate with one another. It’s silent and constantly lonely. I’ve been applying to jobs non-stop, only to get nothing but rejection letters back. I just feel stuck. I have no resources to tap into, and everything I want to do to try and be a teenager and help myself or enjoy myself, simply costs money. I have no motivation to do homework or catch up in school. I feel as if I have no family, and I’m suicidal. I’m trying to tell myself that things will get better, but they haven’t.

172," I met this girl over instagram last february. We talked for a couple months and became close online friends. One day, she got her phone taken away. We didn't talk for a couple months. Her friend got me back in contact with her and we talked for about a month. She got her phone taken again and deleted all social media. I was really attached to her bc I didn't have that great of friends where I lived. I had to email her to talk to her. One day, she stopped responding. Today, I texted her number (which I have had this whole story, we rarely texted each other) and she responded. However, she doesn't seem excited or enthusiastic that I'm texting her. Trying to get into contact with her,  
then talking to her and worrying if she'll respond doesn't seem healthy for me. I'm wondering if I should just stop trying to contact her altogether and move on with my life or keep texting her, or should i do something different. Advice? Thoughts?",10Feb2020,1

174,"Hi

I'm confused as to why I can't stop eating. I'm very concerned for my health and weight at this point. To add on to this, I also lack motivation to exercise and stuff. I'm on my school's wrestling team, which means I need to watch my weight so that in meets and tournaments my weight is on point. I have team practices every weekday, but I only lose about one pound of water weight each practice, and I gain it again after drinking my loads of water.

The other girls talk about taking laxatives and legitimately starving themselves..yeah, no.

176,"Hello, so in a few days time I would be getting a Dyson's Air Purifier, did quite a lot of research on this purifier and read most reviews about it. But I want some real feedback from people who have actually used it before, and/or still using until now. I'm from Malaysia, so this purifier fan would cost me actually 2.5k in my currency, it's not ALOT of money, but it does costs quite a bomb. The reason why I am considering to get this fan is because of 2 main things

\- My nose is very sensitive to dust, etc, I almost get runny nose everyday in the past when I wake up in the morning, somehow it's less now but it still does happens. the one that I'm getting is the TP04 Model, which is the latest one in Dyson's range.

\- I want my room to have clean air to breath in and dust-free, which includes capturing / trapping all the dusts in my room.

Those 2 mentioned above is my main requirement of a air purifier. Hence I went on to see Dyson's, I did look at other fan but as little as I know about Dyson, I do know their quality and technology of the product they make is of the top tier level. I'm going to just put 50 cents and say that Dyson's Air Purifier ACTUALLY works, but still I want to hear from people who have actually use it, in this case I'll put down in point form so it would be easier for those who just wants to answer my questions.

\- Does it REALLY captures / traps 99.95 of particles / dusts and so on ?

\- How often does the filter needs to be change assuming I turn it on 24/7 ? ( Dyson says 6 months if it's 24/7 )

\- How's the quality of the overall product ?",10Feb2020,1

I never mean to judge people’s sexuality by how they act but sometimes it’s clear. And although he has not come out to me I’m pretty sure he is a member of the lgbtq+ community.

However, Jon comes from a southern very conservative and traditional Christian family and I know his parents would not be supporting if he came out to them. They also continuously try to  set him up with girls from there church. I am worried that he is or will try and suppress his true self. 

I just want to let him know that I support and love him no matter how he identifies. I also want to let him know that whatever he feels is valid and that he need not be ashamed. How can I do this while being sensitive to his emotional well being and possibly conflict feeling?  I do t want to come off as judge mental but just as supportive and encouraging.

186,"TLDR; where should I shop as an upper-middle class mom who wants a promotion? Please don't suggest stitch fix. 


My parents both grew up very poor and raised 4 kids together,  so we never had a ton of money. My mom would take me school shopping maybe once a year,  but it was always terribly stressful.  She would spend the whole time telling me my dad was ""gonna kill her"" and I better not tell him how much we spent.  Often times my dad indeed would be angry about how much my mom spent and it would cause a fight. So I always appreciated shopping with fear and guilt. 

Fast forward to adulthood, I now can't find any joy in shopping at all.  It's absolutely paralyzing for me. I always think clothes are too expensive but I also don't want cheap quality because it won't last. I also hate the way clothes fit on me and my post-partum body. So I spend hours trying to find middle of the road clothes that fit well and won't require dry cleaning etc. And I won't buy anything unless I'm obsessed with it and even then I feel terribly guilty. Never have purchased designer anything. 

Unfortunately this means I mostly wear the same few things. High waisted jeans from khols that don't fit great and some kind of casual shirt or sweater. Usually I'll just wear a hoodie over my shirt. 

At this point in my life, there's no reason I should be dressing this way. I'm a  32 year old mom with career ambitions. People respect me and my husband and we're both ""leadership potential."" However, I can't help but think the way I dress is probably holding me back a bit as it's giving me a perception of being frumpy or childish,  or even worse, ""low class."" 

The problem is,  I don't even know where to shop to buy clothes that fit my pear-shaped mom bod. I don't know what to look for. I hate shopping for myself and always just end up buying something cute for my kid instead. 

I tried stitch fix for a few months, but was pretty disappointed. The lowest tier price plan was all cheap clothes that were ""dry clean only"" and fell  apart or pilled quickly. I felt like I could have found similar clothes at forever 21 or even Wal -Mart for a fraction of the price. Ugh.

187,"Background: I (F25) have been working at a bar for about 8 months. My best friend at work is a guy we’ll call Matt. We are around the same age and get along really well.

Anyways, I recently got a job in another state and will be leaving and moving soon. I don’t think I’ll ever go back to the city where I’m currently working. It’s definitely possible I’ll never see Matt again. 

I want to say goodbye to him in a meaningful way, but I also don’t want to be weird and overdramatic about it.

I’m just really saddened by the fact I may never see him again and I want him to know I have really appreciated his friendship.

188,"Growing up, I’ve always hated my name. It never suited me, I found, and every day longer I get called by it, it hurts. I get constant compliments at work, at college, about how nice my name is and how lucky I am to have it, but all I can do is bite my tongue, smile and nod. 

&amp;#x200B;

Back in grade school, I played around with my gender identity a lot trying to figure out who I was. Then, I went by a new name every other week, constantly sorting through and picking what fit me. My family is highly transphobic, so I can never be myself in terms of identity until I’ve moved out… but if I can have the name I want, then I’d be more than happy. Now that I’m in college, I’ve settled down to one, simple identity, but the fact of the matter still stands; I want to change my name. It’s been two years since I picked the name of my choice, so I’m confident that this choice is the one I’d like to keep.

&amp;#x200B;

My original name is awfully girly. It’s not a bad name, but it was never *my* name; not my first name, anyways. The name I’ve picked for myself is also on the girlier side, but it’s less extreme and simpler than the name I was born with. In fact, if I were to change my name, I wouldn’t even get rid of my original name; my plan is to make it my middle name anyways. All of my friends online call me by this new name consistently (it feels pretty good), and my coworkers have stated that it fits me more than the name given by my parents anyways.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is… how do I bring this up to my mother without upsetting her? I’m an adult (20NB, I only plan to change the name not the gender marker), so I am legally allowed to do whatever I want with my name. But I’d feel awful if I didn’t talk about it with her first, as she was the person who gave this name to me in the first place. I feel as if my father will be against me changing my name entirely, so I don't plan to even bring it up to him until I've talked it out with my mom first. I don’t want to upset her, but I also don’t want to live with this name forever. I’ve been debating how to go about this for months now, and I’ve yet to figure out a solution.

SO my ex and I broke up around a month ago. Essentially what happened was that I was way too insecure and I wasn't being the man that she needed for the relationship. We tried to be friends after that and I couldn't handle that either. I imposed a self-exile from the friendship and ended up contacting once I was ready to talk.

This time around I had fixed my insecurities and had accepted the breakup. MAN has she been all over me since I did this, she hasn't stopped texting me and calling me the past three days. She texted me asking me if I could meet for pizza tonight. Let me repeat, a woman I begged and pleaded with to get back together, now wanted to get pizza...alone...together. Obviously I thought I had it in the bag.

On this ""date"" I was trying to keep it fun and light and enjoy her company, but I could tell something was wrong. She then proceeded to tell me (unsolicited) that she had thought about texting me that ""you are the only one I can truly be myself around"" and that ""I don't know if you are seeing anybody else right now"" but ""there's nobody I can really talk to"". I was completely shocked to hear any sort of talk like this.

At the end of the date, I dropped her off at her car, where I proceeded to give her a firm hug. And then I went in for the kiss. She turned her head away from my attempt but allowed me to plant a firm kiss on her cheek. Honestly, I know it doesn't sound like much, but guys this woman wanted nothing to do with me for weeks. She wouldn't even give me a side hug when we were ending our breakup. I laughed off the cheek kiss and had her get out of the car. I need advice on what this cheek kiss/date meant! What do I do next?

207,"I'm not really looking for any specific advice, just general advice from those with anxiety or with an SO with anxiety.

My girlfriend and I have known each other for years now, and we briefly dated earlier in our friendship, but we only recently got back together. The first time we dated, she broke up with me, partly because (as I only later found out) her anxiety with dating was really bad and she didn't think she could handle a relationship at all.

This time around, things are going much better. She started off by immediately opening up about her anxiety (which is how I found out it was a factor in the original break-up) and how it can be pretty terrible for her at times, and ""relationship stuff"" can be something of a trigger for it. She does take medication for it, though I don't know what - she mentioned possibly changing her medication since she doesn't think its very effective.

Things have been going well for the most part. She's told me multiple times when we've hung out that she is getting less nervous around me, though talking about our relationship and feelings and such still sometimes makes her (understandably) nervous. Still, we've only gotten closer over time - for instance, on one of our last dates, we talked about our feelings at length and she ended up asking me to kiss her for the first time, even though she was really nervous about it.

This weekend though, she and I traveled with some friends to go to an event. Her anxiety was *very* bad during the whole trip. While we usually do a lot of cuddling and talking, she was very standoffish the whole weekend, only getting worse as it went on. She was very open about it once again, saying that traveling in general caused her anxiety, and that her feelings toward me also compounded this, and she acknowledged that this caused her to be a bit distant. The event itself was even worse for her, with all the people, loud music, etc. Overall, it was quite a terrible weekend for her, and by the end she just wanted to rest at home. I did my best to be there for her but give her some space as well - I let her know she could ask me if she needed anything, but I tried not to suffocate her with attention or anything.

I think I did about everything I could, but I still wish I could have done more. I felt really sad for her all weekend but she basically said it was all her and while she was thankful I was willing to help she said there wasn't much I could do. I'm sure she and I will talk about this more in-depth when we meet up next, but I'm still curious if anyone has any general advice on how to handle these situations.",10Feb2020,1

She helped a former employee named K recently start their own business that will compete with part of our business (not cool). This really pissed me off and my ""friend"" didn't see why this was a problem. To make this worse, K (the former employee who my ""friend"" helped) then used her new business to work with another former employee of mine who has been stealing money from us, and then K participated in a sale that stole \*more\* money from us (yes, we are working through this via the legal system and will likely get funds back and if not there will be some sort of consequence as this was clearly traceable). 

I told my friend that I felt the trust was broken and I was really hurt. That I needed some time to think about this.

223,"I (M19) have recently struggled with having an opinion on anything. After reading a few books this year that delve into creating meaning in a meaningless universe (Flow being a huge one) I literally analyze everything and everyone down to the point where I see it as a necessary pattern or physical existence in a neutrally chaotic universe. Because of this I struggle to say “this thing is good or bad”. Because of this I can feel passion on certain aspects of life fading. Wondering if anyone ever found themselves facing this type of existential crisis. 

I am by no means struggling mentally. I find enjoyment in working out and staying healthy, spending time with my girlfriend and family, and the idea of living life to the end excites me. When I was more religious (coming from my highly religious parents) I found bliss in feeding my ego by feeling I was leading a “proper” life or that there are inherently bad and good people instead of my current belief that everyone being and doing everything they ever do is inevitable and a negative or positive connotation only comes from our ego and need for survival.",10Feb2020,1
224,"I run my own startup, inspired many of my juniors and friends, even my closest, to work for me. For them to willing to sacrifice a well-paying job to help our dream come true, I was truly excited. My family is in a terrible situation. Large amount of debts, family fighting, sick parents - I worked and paid for everything for myself and my sister since I was 14. I spent much effort on my sister and gave her whatever she needed, but my sister hates me and does not respect me. I look like I have an extremely exciting life (I do), but that's it. 

I believe I was a great friend: I would cut important events and travel over to help them when they are in a crisis, even though sometimes I thought to myself, honestly their problems are so trivial. I know that to them, it is not trivial, I too get upset over small things, but it is a thought I can't help but have (Obviously, I didn't voice it out). I love my friends and my family, and I work tirelessly and relentlessly every day for them: but to me, no one seems to care enough. Am I expecting too much?

Recently I went on a date with a girl I really, really liked. It's been a while since this happened. She is a very honest and cute person, and she understands me very well. But in the end, she was kind enough to tell me she is not physically attracted to me and doesn't want to lead me on. She told me she is torn because I have the perfect personality she wanted, but she can't feel attracted to me. We only met once, and we spent the whole day talking about everything. I smiled and told her ""it's alright, we can stay as friends, and I'm so happy you were so honest about it with me"", but deep inside, everything was collapsing. I have no idea why such a small issue is so big to me. I don't ever cry. Even as a kid, when burnt my legs with fire by accident at the age of four ( which leaves a large scar on my feet right now) I didn't cry at all. I didn't even cry when one of my closest friends died, because it'll be rude to his family and I should really be comforting them than crying. 

But that day when I went home, I cried so much. I really really wanted her. I didn't know what to do. I tried exercising, watching hilarious videos, reading my favourite books, eating my favourite food but I had no interest in anything. Anything at all. I feel so bad, that the company I spent my blood and tears building: I couldn't care less even if collapsing right now. I'm so tired, but I can't sleep at all. I don't even eat a meal a day now, it feels like I'm wasting money because I can't seem to eat more than a mouth: I feel so full. I look through my contacts and call people to confide in, they tried to listen but after a few minutes, they just want to leave the call. I know I am needy and I said at the start of the call that I'm in a bad shape and I will be super needy, but I really need someone to be beside me right now. I'm so lonely, so stressed and so so sad right now. I don't have suicidal thoughts but I think I'm going insane. Each day that I'm not doing work, it's piling up and weighing upon me. What about my company? What about my family that is waiting for me to succeed and bring them out of poverty? Nothing in life seems interesting anymore, and I feel like no one cares about me, even though I did so, so much for them. I called a few different suicide hotline to see what I can do, but their advice is so terrible. When they asked what I tried to do to cope, I told them I am trying my best to exercise and relax, but none of it is helping. All they said was go out, or I seem like I'm coping fine, BUT I'm NOT. Then after a few minutes, they abruptly say are you feeling suicidal, which I answered no to, then they will end the call after some pleasantries.

No matter what I do, I longer find any joy. The situation seems so despairing. But I know, it will eventually be over. I really just need a friend to stay beside me right now, and give me a hug. But I have no one. I called all my close friends and none of them wants to meet up with me, perhaps they thought it was a small issue, and all of them are extremely busy, trying to fight for our company. My family is already too stressed and I can't tell them. What can I do to get over this?

225,"EDIT: had to repost since no one answered last time i posted QAQ

so i’ve a crush on a close family friend of mine for around two years now (but he’s been cute ever since we were little ngl, lets call him joseph) we only see each other a few times a year and hardly talked, but he’s the type of guy whose smile can light up the room and i’ve always wanted to impress him by being the coolest in the room- that type of guy, basically. the problem is that he’s kind of a douche. 

to preface, we had told each other that we liked each other on new years. we decided to stay friends because, one, if we broke up it would be awkward for everyone and two, we live at least a 40 minutes drive from each other.

we were talking yesterday (one time out of the year where my mom threw a party and of course, everyone is invited) with a few other guy friends and somehow exes came up. joseph brings up that the other two guys in the room have never dated anyone, and then one brings up they should all be virgins because we’re only, like, sophomores. joseph goes on to say he isn’t and that he lost it to his fifth grade girlfriend. he also says that ‘yeah, isabelle was cool in 5th grade, but now? she’s fine. girls get cool when you leave them.’ it’s kind of shitty to hear when you’re pining after a guy. 

prior to this me and a girlfriend of mine were talking about how i should just make a move even though we decided to be friends because i keep talking about how i wish we could be more, but it isn’t really fair to him. i was gonna kiss him on the cheek before he left. let me preface that im a kissless virgin and am an abysmally unsociable pussy most of the time. 

i don’t know if he was just fronting to seem cooler or if he genuinely meant it, but my girl bff keeps saying that the way joseph looks at me when im not looking is a telltale sign he likes me. 

also to preface; im a trans guy. he knew me before transitioning, back in kindergarten. we are just two bros chilling in a hot tub five feet apart because homophobia the culture we live in is real, probably, and the threat of our families making a big deal out of it is genuinely scary.

TLDR- crush says some real shit that makes me jealous as fuck, even though he knows i have a crush on him. and he has a crush on me.",10Feb2020,1

The psychiatrist prescribed me 50mg of Zoloft and a trazodone for my insomnia. I took the trazodone and it worked once but after that It failed to but me to sleep. She then me to Switched me to mirtazapine which also failed to work to which she advised me to try taking two. I took her advice and followed it up with zzzquill which made me stop breathing in my sleep. So she took my off both sleeping medicines completely and prescribed me quetiapine for both the worsening hallucinations and the insomnia.

Drinking until I’m drunk) and bouts of the euphoria and excitement where I just felt on top of the world. But then when these episodes are over I feel extremely depressed and can’t find the motivation to make it through the day , I’ll also have intrusive suicidal thoughts. When she gave me the quetiapine the euphoric episodes went away but now I just feel extremely depressed and anxious. It’s like nothings working. My ptsd and ocd are back full force and I’m terrified to go to sleep at night as I’m extremely afraid of the dark and the Zoloft was helping taking the edge off of the anxiety

They curse and are sometimes rude, but I always thought that was just them being teens, but after last night, I realize they're actually pieces of shit. We were all in my aunt's garage and talking when they began to make racist, transphobic and homophobic comments and jokes. One of my cousins (A), who I actually knew was horrible previously for other reasons I'll talk about later told us about a kindness lecture they had at his school. He went on to say how this one trans kid was talking about how they were being bullied for being trans, and my other two cousins (J1 and J2) said he DESERVED IT. I began to realize something was very wrong. J1 went on to talk about how he and his friends said the n-word in front of an african girl on a daily basis, which quickly led them into doing a multitude of racist impressions. I left soon after as they continued to talk about how a teacher looked like a rapist because he was mexican and something about how all spanish girls were whores.

237,"Hello,

I will try to make this as short but informational as possible. Basically, I live in Ohio right now and also go to college here. I have 2 semesters left (not including the one I’m in right now) until I graduate. I currently have my associates degree and will have my bachelors after my next 2 semesters. I really, really want to move to Dallas, TX. This has been a plan of mine for years now. However, I am starting to get very antsy and am tired of working my shitty part time job while going to school. I have been looking at jobs in the Marketing field (what my degree is for) and want to utilize the associates degree I have now. My thought is: secure a job down in Texas (there seems to be a lot of places that will hire you in with an associates, especially if you are pursuing a higher education). I would then move to Texas and start to work at said job while also finising my last two semesters online through the university I attend now.

My main question is, is it that easy? Can this be done, or am I too big of a dreamer and too impatient? Am i missing anything? Have you done this before or known someone that has? Balancing work and school wouldn’t be a problem at all, I’m a go-getter and a hustler and know that I could handle that part of it. I just don’t know if this is a thing people typically do. Obviously I would need the job first so that I could find a place to live before moving down there.

I guess I just need some advice on how to go about this process. Any other questions just ask!",10Feb2020,1
238,"Hello all so I’m 26 and recently moved to the state capital after months of hell (long story)

It was perfect how I ended up here but in the end I ended up a full time phlebotomist at the plasma center, traded in my 2002 Buick  for a 2017 Hyundai, and have my first apartment in the state capital.

When I say I feel blessed it’s an understatement. I could have taken a very dark path in life, especially with all the hurt and betrayal I went through, losing everything I owned behind people and their ignorance. 

The only thing leading me when everyone else was picking the easier choice, complaining and acting like the world owed them something was my personal value that doing things the right way, taking my ass to work and doing my part while living in others households, was the way to a better situation.

My question however is this; I’ve met many people in my life who chose not to do things the right way, and a few people that do lead their lives the right way. Neither seems to be truly happy in life.

People doing others wrong tend to have nothing to show for it in the end (watched it with my own eyes as people who took advantage of me when I was down now are at the bottom while I’m succeeding) 

People living their lives by the book; doing everything right, tend to be bland and come off as shallow as a kiddie pool, though ‘saved’ and in the Holy Spirit they seem lonely and a bit bitter.

But doing things the right way is how your supposed to live right? So why aren’t they happy?",10Feb2020,1
239,"I always knew my father had cheated. When I was around eight or nine years old, I had snooped on his camera and found pictures of his privates and of other women. I always knew it had happened and that my mother does not know a thing. I was able to put it past me and ignore it because as a child I didn’t know better and didn’t want to start anything. Fast forward to now, my father has issues with balance, walking, showering, things of that nature among other things. Other than my mother, I am his main caretaker in our family home and have always said until he dies, I will be home taking care of him. Despite his affairs, he had always been a Superman of sorts to me. He always brought his friends around the home and many of them appeared to be great people— all except his friend Mark. Last night (2/8/2020), I went to visit him in the rehabilitation center he was placed in following an emergency room trip. He was telling me stories of when he was younger, when he suddenly felt it was appropriate to delve into the details of one of his many affairs. His friend, Mark, had supplied my dad with cocaine and two females and told him it was a “birthday gift”. He was extremely graphic and I’m sure he didn’t leave out anything. I kept my composure as I didn’t want him to see me upset, because that wasn’t his intentions and also we were in a public setting. That was a few hours ago, and I am now sitting in my car, outside of my home, unable to describe what I’m feeling. I feel almost pure hatred for him, not necessarily due to the affairs (because it’s easy to forget parents are still human and do make mistakes) but because he decided it was something he thought I should know about and he was laughing while explaining it to me. But also, he’s my father and I want to continue thinking he was great. I am rambling at this point, but I’m feeling very distressed. How am I supposed to look at him the same or take care of him now that I know this information? I honestly would rather never see him again, but I can’t leave my mother to deal with this all in her own. Please, all opinions are welcome.

Side note on this Mark character: He was always around when I was a young child through my middle school years and gave me an uneasy feeling. I have a very distinct memory from four years old of him looking at me from the doorway of the stairs that led from the main living room to my room at night. This is all I can recall from this memory but thinking back on it now makes me question what he was doing upstairs, as he never would be seen in the living room area of the home, let alone in my room. 
Also my father had told me that he would consistently do coke with Mark and even when they weren't together, which has now tainted my childhood memories as it would make a lot of sense now. How do I get past the feelings of a tainted childhood memory as well?",10Feb2020,1

243,"I recently had a falling out with a group of friends and I am tearing myself apart over it. They are a bunch of online gaming friends, but have been my only real social interaction outside of work. Every time we spoke or messaged each other, it would eventually devolve into an argument, often with myself being very defensive and dickish. After a particularly bad argument, I decided to remove myself from the group, with the reasoning that I was making the environment toxic for everyone involved and sucked the fun out of everything. 

I truly care about these people, but it feels like I cant help but be antagonizing. Im not sure what I can do at this point and i regret leaving. I normally struggle quite hard making friends so I cant help but feel like a useless idiot throwing away relationships I care about.",10Feb2020,1
244,"I don’t know exactly how to tell the story, so I’ll just say it in chronological order.

1) At a young age, I was classified as one of those “Gifted and Talented” kids. I got to skip a grade in math, etc. This gave me an abundance of confidence at a young age. Also, at this time I had pure joy playing with Legos, games, and toys with my siblings, parents, and neighbors.

2) At a young age, I enjoyed video games. I played Clash of Clans. It’s a mobile game where you build your base. You can recruit others to join your clan, and you can be the leader. At a young age (I don’t know...7 y.o. or so) I grew a Clan up to the maximum size (30 or so) with some good players, thus giving the Clan a higher ranking. This completely boosted my confidence regarding entrepreneurship (before I even knew what that was). Also at about the same time I read the book “Flat Broke”, which did the same.

3) After this, I constantly rotated through hobbies (Nerf, Lego, RC cars, etc). I was so addictive. If I was in a particular hobby, I was IN IT. I thought about it 24/7. So, during one of my LEGO phases, I decided I’d start a stop motion YouTube channel. So I went on a bulk Lego buying site, bought the Legos, and.....lost interest in the project. Similarly, during an RC car phase, I wanted to make cool RC car videos on a YouTube channel with my neighbor. We made a couple and then lost interest.

4) At this point I realized that I was constantly living in the future. The only things that gave me joy were fantasizing about the new Lego project, Nerf gun, or RC car mod. I believe this realization is part of what drove me away from these hobbies.

5) Around this time I became very motivated to start a gaming YouTube channel. I subconsciously remembered my Clash of Clans experience and that motivated me without even knowing it. I edited and uploaded a significant number of relatively high quality videos, but it didn’t really take off and I lost interest.

6) After quitting hockey, I had a lot of extra time,  and was very career driven (probably due to point (1)), so I picked up programming. I made some pretty cool personal projects. It was around this time that I became debilitatingly nostalgic. I’d cry myself to sleep nearly every night thinking about my time in steps (1) or (3).

7) Later, my parents told me they signed me up for depression therapy. I realized when they told me but hadn’t really recognized my own depression until then. The therapy helped. I came out of it very different though. Insecure, not confident. I lost my whole pizzazz.

8) I constantly fantasize about entrepreneurship. Everything I do is viewed in the lenses of benefitting me in my career and entrepeneuring. I would fantasize about an idea for a few weeks; go to execute it; realize it was already done by many, it was challenging, read many stories about it not working for people; would still follow through and get right up to the point of releasing it; and then quit. This occurred with: my dropshipping site, my software services site, a variety of product ideas, my Twitter bots, and more.

9) This brings us up to today—I found the idea on Reddit to revamp local business’s websites (my brother even wants to partner with me to do it!). But, I have started reading about it more on Reddit and am reading tons of stories about it being so hard. This discouraged me so much.

I feel like I’m never going to be able to succeed entrepeneurally. I questioned whether, since my depression, I’ve ever felt happy without it relating to my entrepreneurship ideas. I always have them in the back of my mind and it pisses me off. I can’t ever just be happy and play a video game or watch YouTube videos. I’m always thinking about college or entrepreneurship. I see this as a mirror image of my step (3).

Ok so, I moved to the inner city about six years ago. I was moving from the middle of nowhere country so I wasn’t used to having neighbors, and neither were my parents. This road is predominantly old people so I didn’t expect to make a friend group from the neighbor hood. Fast forward five years and this girl that is on my  quiz bowl team that I was aware of but never really talked to lives across my street. I knew she did I just never talked to her. After talking to her during practices and tournaments I’ve realized...She is really sweet and I love her personality and she is attractive to me . Here is the thing. She has a bunch of stories of ghosts and seeing people’s death. Also she has an eating disorder where she basically just doesn’t eat. Which I could see causing problems. Should I take the risk of dating her since we do live so close and I’m starting to crush on her, and not worry about her flaws. Or do I leave it alone since I don’t want things to become awkward too early and ruin the chance of having a life long friend.",10Feb2020,1

251,"okay guys. so i’ve been talking to this girl from tinder for a few weeks now on snapchat and video calling. she’s seemed cool! last thursday she hit me up at about 10pm and asked if i wanted to meet at this nature preserve near me in the woods (which she had earlier explained she looooved going there night and day to explore). so of course i said yeah, why wouldn’t i meet a random stranger in the woods at 10pm? so i did. i went there and it was actually her, and we were walking down this driveway to a little cemetery and she kept making murder jokes, as you would in that situation. well obviously she didn’t murder me, but we had a great time and decided to hang out again. fast forward to tonight and she is talking about exploring this abandoned school nearby us and she wants to explore the basement. some quotes that came from her mouth were “if we go into the basement i have you right where i want you” and “i have far too many games i want to play with you before i murder you. you’ll have to wait and see”. NEVER has she stated that she was kidding. what do you guys think????",10Feb2020,1
252,"I’ll try to make this as informative as possible (but I’ll put a TLDR at the end also). I got married super young (18), had 2 kids with him. We definitely got married too fast and too young. It was infatuation, I don’t believe it really was love. We’ve been together for 5 years now and in the last 2 years I have really contemplated my marriage. I don’t feel in love anymore and I constantly contemplate leaving / the possibility of being on my own or with somebody else.  I keep trying to pretend I don’t feel this way, to make my marriage work but it just doesn’t work. 

My husband is a nice guy, and a good father.. but he just hasn’t grown up at all since we met. We are struggling financially, and he is not willing to put in any extra effort to help keep us afloat. He won’t work any overtime even when it is offered. He is kind hearted but he has no common sense. I feel horrible saying that but he was coddled his entire life by his mother so he has no idea how to be an adult. He has been working for my uncle at an entry level manufacturing job for the last 3 years, and has not moved up in position at all. I have seen guys come into that entry level job and pass him up time and time again. He just has no desire / motivation to try to move up. I work full time, I cook dinner every night and I do 95% of the cleaning. It seems like lately I have to beg him to help me do anything. If I cook, I will ask him to clean the kitchen and it’s like pulling teeth.. tonight he just took all of the dishes and piled them in the sink (leaving them for me to finish later). 

I hate to sound like a complainer, and it’s not all my husbands fault, I have my flaws too.. I’m just so tired. I want to be a good mom to my kids, but I’m working full time and trying to keep myself from slipping into a major depression and it’s so hard. 

My father lives with us and watches our children while we work, but it’s been a real struggle having him here also because he’s another mouth to feed.. and on top of that he is a former drug addict and he struggles a lot. 

We also recently took in my half sister (my fathers daughter). I am having to parent her because my dad just has no idea how to parent on his own, and he has no sense of real responsibility. I have wanted to leave my husband for a long time, I just feel like I need to move out and work on myself (go to college) so that I can be a better mother and provide a better situation financially for my children. (I should mention I WILL take my children with me, they are my life and I could never leave them). 

The biggest problem is that I am responsible for all of these people and I don’t know how I can possibly leave without screwing everyone over ? But I am miserable and it is making me a grumpy and miserable wife and mother. Another conflict is that I can’t afford to live in the State we are living in all on my own with my kids, and I have nobody to watch them if I move away from my dad.. but if I keep my dad living with me, I basically am in the same situation I am currently in, minus my husbands income.. 

My grandmother lives in the next State over from us and she is retired. She is willing to let me and my kids stay with her until I can get on my feet. Last week husband told me he would allow me to take the kids and stay with her. Kind of like a temporary separation situation.. that was the plan, and I was prepared to leave, but earlier this week my husband started saying he wants to stay together and that he is willing to move out of state with me if it will better our financial situation. I agreed, but today he is acting hesitant about selling our home and moving. 

My dad has zero source of income currently, but I am working to get him approved for disability because he has a recently diagnosed heart condition. 

My sister is 14, was failing school and getting into trouble so her mom asked me to take her in. Her mother lost her job shortly after letting her move in with me. When discussing the possibility of moving out of state, her mother expressed that she won’t allow me to take her with me. (Understandably so, but I feel guilty to send her back to her moms house in fear that her grades will fall again and she will get into trouble again).

I guess I just don’t know where to go from here? I’m not happy. I want out of this situation before my depression overcomes me, but I feel guilty because I feel responsible for everyone. (Also, we have tried couples therapy so please don’t suggest that).

TLDR: Married too young. 2 kids (ages 1 and 3). Supporting my father and younger sister on top of supporting my own kids. Unhappy in my marriage. House poor in the state we live in, but renting is even more expensive. Want to move out of state with my children to live with my grandmother temporarily but feel guilty to leave my husband, dad, and sister.",10Feb2020,1

So I can’t figure out what the situation is- 
I have this guy in my friend group and we have always been flirty towards; whenever our friend group goes to concerts we always end up standing next to each/dance on each other/ kissing, he asked me to hookup a few times and I always said no. A few months go by and he’ll randomly Snapchat me out of the blue, and vise versa, but will never really hit on me, but will stare and want to be around me kinda vibes,  then one night he came over and we had sex and the next morning was chill, nothing big. A few weeks later I ended up messaging him after a few drinks, asking if he wanted to come over and he said he couldn’t that night but would be definitely be down another night- so months pass and he never makes the next move so I messaged him again, drinking involved again, and he didn’t open it til next morning but we never addressed it, then or ever (thank god lol), anyways a few more weeks later he messaged me when he was in my town and I messaged back and he didn’t reply, and then a few more weeks later he invited me to his NYE party but I couldn’t go. Fast forward a new more weeks, the other night, and I was leaving the bar and I saw him with another girl and he was fine but I could tell me was trying to act like he wasn’t with her, like she tried to grab his hand and he pulled away, and he was saying how he was going to our friends’ making it seems like he wasn’t taking her home but obviously he was, almost like he was not playing into the girl, but now I’m just confused on how he feels, if he likes me, or if I look like a pathetic, obesssed girl

Planning with him has felt a little weird, almost like scheduling with a fuck buddy, but he says he really likes me and wants a relationship. I actually trust him on that, not sure why but I think he's genuine on that part. Now I'm cool with being too busy sometimes to see each other but this weekend hes gone back and forth like 4 times. I knew this upcoming weekend he may not be free as he was apartment hunting but we kinda left it in the air. Friday I asked if he'd want to hang out and he said he really needed to do some work from home and that he was busy, later he asked why I didn't come over as he would have loved my company I told him he didn't ask me to and it seemed like he had wanted to be alone. Saturday it had snowed by his place (we are in Atlanta so cue shut down of unnecessary things by him) I asked if he'd want to hang out and offered being from the north I was comfortable driving in what are very mild conditions to me. He said he'd like to and I planned to come over after running some errands. While I was doing that he canceled (which low key hurt) and later that night said he really wanted to see me, I poked a little fun and said he had his chance but then also invited him over which he declined because he has a dog he'd need to wake up extra early to care for. Today we were just talking as Sundays are my day to work from home and make lesson materials (I'm a teacher). I told him I was fairly behind so today wouldn't work and we continued to talk, he also asked if I'd want to take things a little further in terms of how serious we are and I said I felt I still needed to share a few important things about myself with him before I think he should decide if that's what he wants. We talked about some of those things and he told me a while later that he was out in the area if I changed my mind. I told him I was finishing up and that he could come over, since he was visiting his parents I told him to just let me know when he's on his way. 4 hours later he canceled and only when I messaged him did he tell me he had to cancel.

I’ve been having sex with a 30 year old man for almost a year and he is in a committed relationship. He told me he was unhappy and wanted to break it off at the beginning of our sexual relationship, however, he changed his mind and has been keeping me on the side to fulfill his sexual needs and keeping her around to fulfill his emotional needs. I was fine with this, until I found out he had been cheating on her with other people besides me. 

He keeps her separate from his friends, so no one else has had the opportunity to come forward about this. She does not have social media so I haven’t had a way to contact her. His friends that do know her don’t want to ruin their friendship with him by coming forward. I have since been given the information to find her. I think I’m the only person that can let her know what’s happening given the situation. Would it be wrong of me to do so? 

She’s a school teacher and a great person and he’s been cheating on her for the entirety of the relationship. I’ve given him ample time to break it off with her but he doesn’t seem to have any sort of desire to do so, and I know once he figures out I’m no longer available he will move on to another girl.

We also told each other that we should not share our face till the day we meet up, which is pretty soon. I felt so excited because I've never met anyone online before. So a few days ago, I was talking to one of my friends about him and how he is such an amazing person. She told me what's his name and I gave it to her. Big mistake. She looks him up on social media and dumb me wanted to play along. I told her about his school and she went looking for him. We both imagine we would never find him online, but we did. We found the guy in the same state and school with the same interest. So there he was, I knew his face and even what jobs he has had before. At first, it was a joke, I didn't expect to find him at all nor did my friend. The next day, I was talking to my online friend (same one) and he was telling me randomly how weird and creepy it is to look up someone online. I laughed but in the inside was panicking as I broke our promise and I knew how he looked like. However, I doubt my thoughts as I told myself ""its probably not him, It could be someone else."" Then my online friend told me a huge hint on call that led me to believe that I found his real identity. He told me how many letters his last name was. I was panicking. I found his real identity online and I feel horrible.

First, I was panicking at how much he trusts me. I broke this trust so hard and I wish I can tell him that I broke the promise. Even if I did, he would leave me and never talk to me again because of the mistake I made.

264,"  Greetings. I (21F) am moving for the first time since I’ve been by myself. It’s a pretty big move: from east TN to the Kenosha area in Wisconsin. I’m moving for a few reasons. 

   First being that I have lived in a small town since I was a child and there’s nothing here for me. Not many local friends, definitely none that would be heartbroken if I left. Meanwhile, in WI, I have several friends all in the Kenosha area that I think would be really healthy for me to be around. They are my main D&amp;D group and video game friends.  

Second, I absolutely despise my job. I’ve worked in a locally owned business for over three years. Toxic work environment and in rundown building. I see no future in working there happily while also only making 9$ an hour for a position that could easily be 12 or 13$. 

  Third, I want to experience life to the fullest. I don’t want to be stuck here for the rest of my life. The thought of growing old here, doing the same thing, working for the same job with zero local friends and family is honestly terrifying and has really taken a toll on my mental health struggling with depression. 

  With those points in mind, I have no idea what I’m doing. 

  I have a bit of money saved up, and with tax returns coming in shortly I see this as my perfect opportunity to run while I can. However, with little to no help from friends and family, I’m overwhelmed trying to plan this out by myself. 

  First concern, Job: Should I apply and get one before I move? I’ve only ever had two jobs, one was a volunteer job for a local food bank I did for over a year. The other being this office job as data entry. I do some art commissions on the side when I’m desperate and need the money for food or gas to get me through the week.

  Second, How to move? I have some new furniture I bought myself to celebrate working at my job for over a year, and I honestly would like to keep when I move. It’s not a lot: bed, nightstand, tv stand, and a table. How should I move it? Hire a moving company? Pods? Uhaul? It’s just me, and knowing my car, it can’t pull a uhaul. 

  Third, Apartments: I’ve been looking at some and I really like them, but with them being in a different state I honestly don’t know how I feel about picking one out before I move. Also, should I pick out my apartment or job first? 

  These concerns have been keeping me awake for nights with anxiety and panic attacks. I’m doing the best I can with what I have. I don’t want to be stuck in a small town with no friends or family to be with. I’m at a loss with what I should do. Any advise would be great. 


  Sorry for the long read. Will give further information if asked as long as it follows the rules. 

Thank you in advance.",10Feb2020,1

266,"This is a burner account. I just need to get his off my chest. 

My father has a history of meth , pain pills, anti depressants pills and alcohol abuse. I’m 27 and it has been ongoing my entire life. I live with my parents/ sisters/ grandparents. His drug use has cost me a lot. I have a a great job. I can afford to move out and live a comfortable life but I’m stuck at home. He is manipulative liar and uses the people around him and I’m convinced he is slowly losing his mind. I’m convinced he is crazy idk what he will do in my absence. He is scared of me so I think my presence keeps him in check. I have been so afraid to leave him alone for too long with my family I have alienated all my friends. I stopped responding to messages because I can only decline invites for so long. My friends legit think I hate them.  I should tell them the truth but I’m embarrassed and have been gone for so long now I don’t know if they even care anymore. 

Recently I have attempted to curb his drug use I have called him out of his bullshit and his response to us is to threaten suicide. On numerous occasions I have saved his life. 

Approximately one year ago one of my sister got so fed up with it she left home for several months. He was so drunk the night she left he tried to hang himself. I cut him down and called 911. I convinced my slef he only did for attention so she would come back. Since that day it has gotten nothing but worse. Since that day he hardly works and just lays in bed all claiming he is sick. I got fed up I told him how I felt. I told him he has been nothing but a drain on my entire life and has Ruined all my relationship and my life. I gave him an ultimatum either works and stops using drugs and liquor or he leaves for good and just leaves us alone. 

His response is he tried to drink himself to death. At the time I just thought he was normal drunk now I’m convinced he drank and used meth to stay up. My sister tried to take him to rehab that day and he pushed her in the driveway and fell limp flopping to the ground to make it seem like she actually pushed him instead of the other way around. This  caused him to hit his head on the ground. Right then it hit me and I knew from looking at him that all I had to do was let him come back into the house and go sleep and he wouldn’t wake up. I called 911 and had an ambulance show up.  By the time he got to hospital he was unresponsive. He had a bac of 5.7  well over the lethal dose and meth in his system as well as a brain bleed from the fall. The doctor told me it was the highest he has ever personally seen they told me he wasn’t breathing on his own and had him hooked on a machine and they didn’t know forsure if he would wake up and breath on his own. He woke up that day. 

They had him in the hospital for a couple days and when they released him they sent him to my uncles to stay because I wouldn’t let him stay with us. He was supposed to stay there  until we could get him into rehab. He stayed there maybe a week and starting threatening my aunt to the point she was terrified to be alone with him. He kept delaying his rehab. A couple days later he shows up at my house is banging on the door demanding to be let into the house. He busted my garage screen door and the screen on my bedroom window. He then proceed to take the hose and on full blast spray every window in the house. I called 911 and explained the entire story. The cops showed up to his still using the hose to spray the windows. They talked to him and just made him leave. They asked to call back if he shows back up. That night he shows back up and began banging on the doors again. I called 911 again and this time when they showed up he had disappeared. I have a first cousin who lives a couple houses away from. He parked his car in front of their house threw away all his clothes in the trash tossed his shoes into the street. And threw away his keys then walked back to my house when the cops were there. Soon as he sees me he begins threatening me. I just point at him and the cops who were there with me arrest him for being under the influence. Again meth and drunk. 

Based on the cops advice I take my mother with me to get a restraining order. I’m so stressed out that I get lost to court house 3 times despite living in this city my whole life and knowing where it is. I finally get there and attempt to park into the parking garage and it is full I drive around for a full 10 mins before I concede leave the garage and park on the other side of the court house. I get out of the car and walk towards the court house and guess who I see this dude standing directly in my path just walking down the street. Had I parked where I wanted or not got lost I wouldn’t have seen him at all. He didn’t see me and I could have just kept going. But I wrote it off as fate. I’m convinced he was meant to cross my path that day. I pulled him aside and he thanked me for putting him jail. He has never been to jail before so is explaining to me how it was sobering experience. He begged me not send him back and to put him in rehab.  I take him to the rehab through kaiser and I spent all day there until we could explain this situation to psych and she pulled so many string and got him into a live in facility. Again fate. She explained that this is not how the process typically goes and they don’t do live in facility’s right off the bat like this. I told them I would pay the copay and drove him 2 hours away in traffic to the live in facility. I fucking believed him man. I thought the night in jail with the rehab would change him. From the deepest part of being I hate him. I have suffered a lot because of him. But I thought if he changed he could be a father to my sisters. 

So he is in the program and I tell my family the whole time it’s him or me and that I can’t live with him. He commits to program and and really tries to give it up. My sister in getting married this year and I relent thinking he would help pay for her wedding and allow him to come home. I knew it wouldn’t work but I agreed under the stipulations he wouldn’t use drugs or drink. He agrees and completes the full 30 day program and he came back yesterday. This morning I go work and he in the living room and thanks me for saving his life. I explain to him this is it if he drink or does drugs he is done and he understands. 

Today when I get off I am sitting in the living room and I watch him sneak into my grandfather room. Because of my job I am extremely aware of my surrounds always and I pay attention to details.  I can’t see Into the room but I can hear him distinctly open a bottle of liquor my Gramps keeps next to his dresser pour it into a cup and drink it. I drink I know what it sounds like to pour the bottle and open it. So I stop the convo my family is having and I tell them what happened and they don’t believe me. so he walks out my Gramps room a second later I make him stop and let me smell his breath. He opens his mouth as to breath but won’t breath out but I can smell it anyway I smell the liquor. So I tell them I smell it. I walk into my grandfathers room to confirm what I already know and on his nightstand is glass with some some drops of brown liquor still in it. The bottle next to the nightstand cap isn’t even screwed on all the way because he heard me and panicked. By the time I walk back into the living room my father is locked in his bedroom upstairs. I go confront him and absolute loose it. I explain In detail how he has ruined my life and how is such a drain and how I have given him chance after chance and tell him to choose right now. Either I stay or he does and he doesn’t move. He still denies he drank anything even though I can smell it on his breath.  I wanted so bad just to hit him and I was so angry I was scared I might really flip out and do it so I did the smart thing and just took my shit and left. I have been driving around Since to cool my head and pulled over to type this. 

I can’t live like this man. So when my family called I told them I it’s me or him. They chose me told him to leave. He refused to take any of his stuff with him and I’m sure he told them he would kill himself if they kicked him out but they kicked him out regardless. I can’t confirm that he told them this just knowing how he is I’m guessing and am prob right. I haven’t went back yet. 

This is an ongoing cycle to no end. I feel trapped in my life and I hate myself for it. I can’t leave my family and live my own life because the rest of my family won’t be able to provide. They don’t make enough to pay the bills. If I stay regardless of if he leaves or not I know he will never truly leave us alone. I feel trapped in 2 impossible situations. I shouldn’t think like this but all the times I saved his life had I not I would be in a better place today. Then I hate myself for thinking that way. I truly hate him but for some reason thought he might turn it around for my sisters since he was much closer to them. I don’t know what to do.

So what do I do know. If I leave him be he might really kill him self and I know my family will blame me for not turning the blind eye like they have all these years. If I leave I abandon them to a fate of him and if he ever goes crazy and do something to them it’s my fault. If I stay I’m trapped in this cycle. I’m honestly trapped. 

What would you do? And I a bad person for thinking my life would be easier if I would have just let him die? I’m sorry if I’m rambling and it doesn’t make sense. I’m sure there are typos I just needed to get this off my chest.",10Feb2020,1

268,"I’ll try and keep it short (TL;DR at the bottom regardless), but here’s the skinny: 

To start, let’s call my friend, Thomas. Thomas and I have been friends for about 3 years, and super close for about 2 of those. 

Last year around this time, we both got out of relationships (mine was long term, his was short term). We’d always had this chemistry and *I* had been absolutely taken by him since day one. Long story short, a mutual friend got involved and tried to make “us” happen. Things were moving in that direction, then very suddenly, he told me out of the blue that he wants to be just friends because “there isn’t anything there” and he “doesn’t have time for a relationship”, effectively breaking my heart in tiny shards of confusion. He admitted he 100% led me on and apologized for his lack of balls. We both wanted the friendship to continue, so we worked at it and got back to where we once were, and are even closer today.

He definitely lied about the “not having time”, since he’s about a month into a new relationship whose roots began about 7 months ago. She’s a friend of mine, but has her... issues... that i won’t go into. 

But regardless, I want to be rid of these feelings. I 100% believed this was the guy I was supposed to marry someday, and now I just want to only want to be his friend. Not seeing him any less isn’t an option, and he lives literally next to me at our University. 

How on earth do I get rid of feelings?

269,"my best friend is telling me about how he wants to run away with a couple of other friends. this isnt the first time. he tried to run away about a month ago, but he got found that same day.  hes saying that this time hes going with about two other people and that “together nobody will find them”. apparently he knows people that have trap houses where they could stay, which sounds hella sus to me.. he says hes running away because his life sucks, which i mildly agree with. his dad died of diabetes when he was only around 5, his parents and siblings sort of ignore him, and people at school dont really like him. but even then, i feel like he shouldnt run away since well, obviously, its a horrible idea. i just dont know how to convince him not to! i desperately need help and dont know where else to go.

271,"So I have an online friend that I've known for two months. We share so much in common and enjoy each other's company online. We also told each other that we should not share a face reveal till the day we meet up, which is pretty soon. I felt so excited because I've never met anyone online before. So a few days ago, I was talking to one of my friends about him and how he is such an amazing person. She told me what's his name and I gave it to her. Big mistake. She looks him up on social media and dumb me wanted to play along. I told her about his school and she went looking for him. We both imagine we would never find him online, but we did. We found the guy in the same state and school with the same interest. So there he was, I knew his face and even what jobs he has had before. At first, it was a joke, I didn't expect to find him at all nor did my friend. The next day, I was talking to my online friend (same one) and he was telling me randomly how weird and creepy it is to look up someone online. I laughed but in the inside was panicking as I broke our promise and I knew how he looked like. However, I doubted my thoughts as I told myself ""its probably not him, It could be someone else."" Then my online friend told me a huge hint on call that led me to believe that I found his real identity. He told me how many letters his last name was. I was panicking. I found his real identity online and I feel horrible.

First, I was panicking at how much he trusts me. I broke this trust so hard and I wish I can tell him that I broke the promise. Even if I did, he could leave me and never talk to me again because of the mistake I made. 

I need advice

I know I'm a horrible person and possibly creepy as well.

275,"So I’m not going to go into huge detail but long story short, this guy completely ruined my life with rape threats and knives.

I normally tell close friends about it (and I’m incredibly vague) so they can understand why I suffer from PTSD attacks and have issues with certain things/songs.

The first thing that comes out of there mouth is “I really want to beat the shit outa him” or things like that. I’m great full for the sentiment but hate that it takes me a solid 2 minutes+ for me to explain that I don’t actually want them to hurt him.

I then have to explain why I don’t want them to hurt him and then it makes me incredibly uncomfortable and has caused ptsd attacks because I am then forced to deal with someone who wants to cause harm to someone (one of my triggers) 

I don’t want them to go to prison or get in trouble because they wanted to be the hero I didn’t ask for.

I also have not seen/spoken to my abuser in years and have nothing to do with him so I don’t see the point.

How can I talk people out of this and make them realise that I DO NOT want them to be a hero and do something they can regret.

I actually had to talk someone out of planning to get a group of people to beat the shit outa him, they where planning on finding out where he lived and tried to ask me for his name.",10Feb2020,1

283,"Let me start this off by saying, I am in high school, so take it as you will with how serious you think I am with my relationship, but I consider it to be in my eyes. I’ve been dating S for 8 months now and in that time her parents haven’t found out about us. Surprisingly we’ve managed to pull off homecoming too. We don’t do anything risky, and its often rare that I get to see her outside of school. But, I am happy.

I’ve never seen her exhibit any issues or anything until school rolled around again and a couple months after she started getting really upset. She has a couple signs and I don’t know what to make of it. 

- she’s been profusely apologizing for everything. Minor inconveniences too. The smallest things. 
- she says that everything is her fault
- she’s very reserved all the time (I think that’s her personality anyway)
-  she will try to convince me that she’s a horrible person. She’ll just get very frustrated with herself and ask questions like why haven’t I gotten annoyed or left her yet. 
- she’s really jumpy in person. She NEVER was like this before. I used to be able to walk up to her and hug her from behind... but I can’t do that anymore cause she just gets really scarred.
- generally more frightened about everything. 

She does say her parents are quite controlling and they often favor her little brother on everything. I was heart broken from a story she told me and brushed off as “not that big of a deal.” When S was about eight years old, she fell off her bike, chipped her teeth and bent them forward. She’s never gotten them fixed, and just a couple months ago she asked her parents if she can possibly get her teeth fixed. Her mother had told her that they’re waiting to fix her brothers teeth, that she could live with it for now. This made me unreasonably upset, I just wish I could do something. Her parents aren’t even poor, they can afford to do simple things like take care of their kid. 

There’s more stories I am sure. But it’s 12:30 at night and I really couldn’t list all that I think is wrong with her parents. 

My question though is. What can I do? How can I help her? I’ve been trying to convince her she’s not what she thinks she is, that she isn’t heartless or something. I just want to do something effective cause it seems like it’s getting worse and worse. I’ve never seen these problems until maybe she trusted me enough to say.

has anyone been in a similar situation and has any advice? am i still too young to be on dating apps? are there some apps that are more lgbtq friendly than others? just any general advice would be really appreciated thankyou!!",10Feb2020,1

I like to be kind with them, but they then try to use me for my money them knowing I’m broke as f*ck. I still live with my parents, and I’m crazy to find a job to leave the house. I’m always judge for my mistakes. I understand my error, however taking the judgement to a new level by saying “ this is why you are worthless, or ugly” &amp; “you’re not good enough”. I seriously am trying to understand what am I doing wrong. This is actually starting to make me question my existence. I kind of grew up in a environment of never being the fav or average kid, if not the troublemaker. How troublemaker if I follow the rules? But seriously, why do they keep judging my appearance? I see myself as a nice figure girls, I don’t get it...my face is almost without any acne... I’m only trying to figure things out alone because I developed this fear to talking to my family members. Is like if I’m not existing, my dad always pulls my sister in front to show her off (don’t get me wrong, I love her, even if she’s mean to me ) and I’m always can see how my dad feels uncomfortable around me.

295,"Okay so I know the basics, pregnant women have cramps, stomach pains, cravings, random mood swings, will go from happy and snuggling to seeing red in a matter of seconds, etc. I just forget sometimes she’s pregnant and just see her as my girl again and will say something such as, “stop complaining, or chill outttt jesus.”

It’s not like I’d say that if I was thinking, because obviously I wasn’t. I would never intentionally try to cause more stress on her. I just forget sometimes and say shit, and sometimes can be inconsiderate I guess. I feel awful about it when it happens and I’m trying my best. It’s just going from sex every night and being all cuddly and happy to, her thinking I wanna fucking murder you in your sleep because you’re looking at me every time I see her.

Yesterday, while going out with some friends to eat lunch, one of my friends asked me to hold his drink cuz he needed to use his second hand. I did, but the palm of my left hand, which was sweaty, touched the top end of the straw. It probably sounds stupid, but i didnt know how to tell him about this since i am extremely socially awkward even in normal situations, so i didnt know how to approach him and didnt say anything and he drank the drink. What should i have done, and what do i do about it now?

Having to spend this very day &amp; every day by myself being alone has sort of turned me a little bitter towards people in relationships. All these people get to spend this week &amp; this day with someone &amp; the only thing that I do is watch them all with jealousy &amp; regret of my time passing. 27 will soon turn to 30 &amp; 30 onwards, a day will come soon when I'd be no longer be able to feel anything.

303,"me and my mom have always been very close, as she and my dad split up when i was very little. i'm in my early twenties, have been living alone for 2 years, with my mom living in a different country than me. there is a history of alcohol problems in our family - her father was an actual alcoholic and my dad has substance abuse issues as well, but more on the casual side of repressing feelings and such. as for me, i know i've picked up on his tendency, especially because i lived with him for a few years and when i turned 18, which is the official legal age for alcohol here. aside from parties and such, i do drink alcohol on my own, for the fun of it when i'm home alone or lately, to 'get the creative juices flowing'. i realize this isn't ideal, but also it does help me out for now with me trying to figure out who i am (it hasn't been clear because i have a 'patchwork family' - so i've always had experiences in being split up in different roles for different family/extended family members). i still have issues with self-confidence and having a life on my own, just to myself. and, toxic or not, alcohol has been helpful. since i do realize that i'm at risk of having an actual problem and since i see how my father is also dealing with this, i feel in control of this. (i know that it's what all pre-alcoholics say, i don't want to say i'm different, but actually, for the moment, i'm enjoying this and it does give me the rebelious-teenager-feeling, which i've lacked so far). 

so now to the main point - i'm at my mom's for a week, and since i have an essay to finish, i sat down at 3am and poured myself some vodka into my coca-cola. and i haven't been careful enough because she smelled the alcohol and is now making a big deal out of it - which i hate, because i seriously long for something being my own and away from her, even if it's stupid, toxic and inherited from the family history either way. she's also very emotionally intelligent and knows me very well. i explained that i made the drink to stay awake, since it was in the middle of the night, and said it as casually as i could and cringed at how she stared at me for like half a minute. 

i would like to clarify - please don't say that i should talk to her and tell her why and what issues i'm having - talking about stuff like that has been kind of difficult and annoying since i'd moved away. however harsh and unjust that sounds, i want her to leave me alone with this, at least for now, so i should speak with her honestly, it would be in such a way to achieve this, to calm her down on that.

304,"So I am 18 years old and fresh into the real world and I got a short term gig while I finish high school living with my girlfriend's neighbor. I didn't really know him all that well as the only time we really talked was during a block party a year prior. We had a simple deal because I couldn't afford any rent at the time. 1) get a job 2) take care of the house and his dog when he was gone 3) pass high school 4) leave after graduation 5) no friends in the house when he isn't there. Those where the terms I agreed to but as a month has come to pass he keeps trying to force his way into my life. Like he keeps asking me to do strange tasks like create a 4 month plan then go over the 4 month plan with him. He gets really nosy at times for instance I have a online therapist and I was in a call with her when he walked in and asked what I was doing. I told him I was in a personal call and he asked what it was about. I told him it was private and he flipped out on me cursing and yelling at me telling me I don't show him any respect. Now as someone who had an abusive step dad. (one of the reasons I left home as soon as I could) I have heard that speech before but to hear it from some random dude was really weird. Tonight I was out hanging out with friends watching a few movies. I was on my way home when I get a message asking if I was gonna be home because it was 10 and a school night. to which I said ""I am almost home"". when I get home I get a ""10 is curfew you know that and its your responsibility to be here by then"". Now this was super weird because first of all 10 was not a set curfew ever second of all i'm an adult who can make my own choices. This recent event plus the therapist thing is getting a little out of hand but I don't know how to get him to stop because anytime I say anything he just does the dad thing saying I don't know whats good for me and that I need to show him respect. I am sorry if this just sounds like a bunch of rambling but this like just happened its 11 o'clock at night and I am super sick of all this but cant leave because I have no where else to go.

308,"Hey,

I'm a M23 living with my girlfriend and our 2yo daughter in an apartment. For money purposes we decided to share the apartment with a close friend of ours (I'll call him Joe, but it's not his real name). His boyfriend (lets call him Kaleb) also sleeps over most nights. They're overall really nice guys, but very shitty roommates. There's a lot of really annoying/inconsiderate things they do but I need advice with one specific one.

Joe has been driving this really old car for years. Every few weeks some part of it would break and he would fix it. One morning the car just didn't start. Joe got a mechanic to come take a look at it and he told him that this time they couldn't fix it. Joe decided to sell it for parts and move on. However, he never did and the car just stayed there, parked right in front of our door. To this day it's been around 4 months. 

Now, let me tell you why this bothers me so much. There are 10 parking spaces in front of our building. Out of those, 1 is taken up by Joe's old car, 1 by Joe's new car (that he got about a week after the old one stopped working) and 1 by Kaleb's car (which he started parking there about 2 months ago since he basically lives with us and rarely moves because they go everywhere in Joe's car). This is inconvenient to us because the remaining 7 spaces fill up very quickly, which results in us consistently parking in the farthest spot from our apartment or having to look for parking in another building in the complex. This is not a terrible issue most of the time, resulting in us walking a few more feet every morning and afternoon, but when we have to walk 50-60 feet while carrying our baby and several other things (possibly for more than one trip) it makes me really mad. This happens at least once a week because of groceries, shopping or us visiting my in-laws for the weekend.

Every time I bring this issue up to Joe (its been a handful), he gets really defensive and angry. He always brings up the same excuse: the car technically doesn't belong to him, it belongs to his parents who live 4 hours away, and he needs their signature in order to sell it. I bought that story for the first few months. However, since the car has been stuck there he has been to visit his parents and they have come to visit him too, and neither party has made an effort to get rid of it. At this point I'm seriously considering reporting the car to the authorities or to our building manager. The tires are starting to deflate a little which I'm pretty sure is cause enough for them to take it (I could also secretly deflate his tires completely to make it obvious). However, I know if I do this it will result in an expensive fine for Joe (\~$200). Also, I'm not sure I can do either of these things anonymously. 

Any advice on how to handle this issue? Am I overreacting? Should I report the car? Should I deflate the tires? Is there any way to get rid of the thing without affecting our relationship? (There's still 7 months in our lease)

Thanks and I'm sorry about the long post.",10Feb2020,1

312,"So I’m in my second semester of uni, I’m 19 and I feel like I don’t belong here. I’m double majoring in math and math ed, but I only chose math because that’s what I was good at in high school. Now that I’ve been here for about six months and I’m taking second year math courses, I’m starting to realize that I’m not really passionate about math. I know everyone says that there’s no shame in changing your major, but even if I were to change it, I have no idea what I would even change it to. I feel like I’m not passionate about anything and any time I picture my future as a math teacher I don’t get as excited as I feel like I’m supposed to get. I’m also starting to realize that I get really overwhelmed by big math problems, and it only gets harder from here. 
Unfortunately I didn’t do so great in my first semester classes and my gpa took a huge hit. The way my school works is that you take courses to fit your major and after two years you apply to get in to the faculty of education. Depending on which major you are, you have to have a certain gpa to get accepted, and if you don’t get accepted the first time you have to wait another year to apply again and boost your gpa. My family isn’t exactly financially fortunate and couldn’t afford to pay for an extra year of classes I could have avoided if I had just done better in my classes, even with loans.

316,"Hello people of reddit! I am fairly new to this website and I'm not the... best at expressing my feelings. Let me describe myself first. Despite my username, I am an older teen with bad mental issues. I have **horrible** anger issues, crippling anxiety, unbearable depression, and the lowest self-confidence a person could have. I know I'm attractive, my brain just tells me I'm the worst. I have horrible, disturbing thoughts (which I don't wish do go into detail). 

This is the first divorce I went through, but not the one I may potentially cause. When I was younger, my mother got a divorce with my biological father, lets call him Tim. Tim was essentially a deadbeat dad, staying out late, drinking and cheating I believe. For some reason, he wanted visitation rights. Since I was young, I didn't understand what divorces were, so it didn't bother me.

2-3 years later, my mom met my step-father at a local pub. In England, pubs are more low-key, rather how american bars are rather rowdy (we moved to America in 2015).  Sorry, I'm getting off-topic. Back to my step-father. I'll refer to him as Thomas. Thomas was the father I never had, he loved me and raised me as if I were his own. When I was 4(?), I had a violent outburst/temper tantrum. No one could calm me down except for Thomas. 

However, things between us have always been a little rocky. Our personalities clash. We are so alike, it's crazy. We would often have arguments over small things. Obviously, I would lose, since I was the child and he was the adult. Lately though, he changed. Something in him snapped, and he started emotionally abusing me. In October, he called me a ""fucking prick"" over a very small argument. It was *very* unexpected and inappropriate, and after that, things took a turn for the worst. We had constant arguments, and he would break me down day after day. I've been so damn stressed, my hair has been falling out. 

He made empty promises to me, saying he'll stop. He did stop for a couple of months, but recently started up. Hell, I can't remember the last time he said he loved me. Thomas started to call me names again and told me he doesn't care about my feelings. About a week ago, I fantasized about my own death. I haven't been suicidal since year 7 (sixth grade? seventh?) but after he broke me down, once more, I couldn't take it. If it wasn't for the suicide hotline specialist, i would be sitting in a morgue. 

I thought I was trapped, helpless, lost. I couldn't report him to CPS because of my other siblings. They don't deserve to have their dad taken away, especially since he didn't do anything to them. One sleepless night, I snooped through my mother's email. Yes, I know it was wrong, i wasn't in my usual mindset. I discovered an unnamed folder and found recordings of Thomas mistreating me. At the bottom, I saw an email from a divorce lawyer. 

I'm 99% sure they're gonna get a divorce because of me. I feel like I start most of these arguments (although I'm probably brainwashed into thinking that). I don't feel sorry, but I do feel... sympathy for my mom. She doesn't deserve this. Is it bad I don't feel sorry for a very possible divorce? Is it my fault? Am I in the wrong? Also, sorry for any grammatical errors, it is rather late at night and I suffer from insomnia. Any advice would help, and would perhaps put me in a better state-of-mind. Thanks!",10Feb2020,1

318,"So I've been talking to a girl I met online for about 5 months now. We talked almost every day, enough to the point where my day would feel weird if we didnt exchange at least a message or two. A few days ago I let her know that I had a thing for her and needed to detach for a bit. She understood and every thing was fine. 

My friends have been trying to get me to ghost her for awhile because they think it's in my best interest. Maybe it is, but I dont want to burn any bridges since we've been a good friends. 

Last night we were drinking and they got access to my phone. They deleted her from my snapchat and a few other platforms we use for chatting. 

Idk what to do now because I didnt want that to happen. Considering what I just told her she probably thinks I intentionally did it. The issue I'm having is that if I readd her and say ""oh my friends did it"" then that smells like total bs and she probably will just see me as needy, desperate, and clingy/crazy.

Any advice on how I can reconnect with her? Should I just give it some time? Do I just move on? We recently were talking about meeting up IRL too so the timing feels terrible. It's been about 24 hours since she was removed and she hasnt said anything yet.. not sure if she will or if she'll even notice.",10Feb2020,1
319,"TL;DR: A guy at my church has crossed boundaries that make me feel very uncomfortable and unsafe. I have told him that I do not want to have any interaction with him. I have since brought up my concerns to the police just as a 'cover my ass in case anything happens' thing. A year after telling him I do not want any interaction with him, it seems as though he's forgotten that I don't want to have anything to do with him. I'm scared of what could happen.

So, I knew this guy, ""Jim."" He went to the same Sunday evening house church I go to. I got to be decent friends with him, which was my own young, dumb, naive blunder.

Well, by late summer/early fall 2018 (I was 24, he was 56), I would go to his house each week to watch the new episode of a TV show. Well, whenever I would interact with this guy, one topic he'd *LOVE* to bring up without any provocation from me whatsoever was the fact that he had a porn filter on his computer and phone, and he'd talk about it for a few minutes. I would never bring up anything that would trigger him to bring this up, and I would never respond, because it made me so uncomfortable that I just didn't know what to do. It almost seemed like he was talking about it as if he was wanting me to be an accountability partner of some sort, and I view that as highly inappropriate. This happened about 6 times in 4 months.

He told me that his daughter (he's divorced) had resentment towards him because of the divorce, and because of that resentment towards him and she only knew who I was because of him, she didn't like me. He also told her that I thought she was rude because she never talked to me. 100% false. Jim also let a stranger he had never met before stay in his house for a night or two without checking if his children were ok with it, and his daughter locked her door because there was a strange man staying in the same house she was in. But that's his issues with his daughter.

So, August of 2018, I had stopped going to his house and stopped all interaction with him. In September, I was walking into a gas station and I see this white Camry driving straight towards me, honking at me. I didn't know who it was an though ""Fuck... Some psycho is going to try to hurt me."" Well, it's nasty old Jim. He puts his car in park and gets out. As soon as I had recognized it was him, I turn around and walk into the gas station, ready to run to the bathroom and call the police if he followed me. He didn't. Between September and December of 2018, he tried texting me twice. I deleted both texts without a response. Mid December 2018, he tries to add me on Facebook. The only interaction I had with Jim since mid August was the gas station incident, and the 2 texts he sent that I deleted without responding to. I immediately blocked him on Facebook and sent him a text asking ""Can you please leave me alone?"" He responded with a weirdly worded message saying something along the lines of ""can I trust that since you won't speak to me about what I may have done, that you won't speak to anyone else?"" I told him why I didn't want to interact with him, and specifically said ""I'd prefer to not interact with you."" He sent a text saying ""I went to check on Facebook to try to make you the first person I ever tried to unfriend or block, but it looks like you beat me to it. As soon as I send this text, I will delete your contact info from my phone and computer."" ***At this time, he did not have a phone that backed up to his computer, so the only way any of my information would be on his computer was if he put it there.***

So, nothing from December 2018 until 2 weeks ago. I was driving, and I turn onto a road where of all things, Jim was in his car with his daughter. He tried waving me down, but I just kept driving.

From what I've seen and from other people I've talked to that know him, he seems to not understand or respect boundaries very well, and has to have them extremely clearly defined. For God's sake, I'm the autistic one, yet I have a better grasp on respecting and understanding boundaries. I have kept a hunting knife on me 24/7 for the past 14 months because I fear for my safety. Small town, we go to the same church, he knows my van. Today after church, he had parked in the north parking lot about 30 yards from where I parked, and was sitting in his car waiting when I went to my van. There were maybe a dozen other vehicles in the north parking lot, and he was facing my van with nothing in between our vehicles. He was just sitting in his car, messing with his phone or I don't know what. I waited in my locked van and tried to figure out why he could possibly be waiting. I eventually left, and he was still there. I know there could be a million and one reasons he was sitting there, and most likely completely unrelated to me, but I ALWAYS park in the north parking lot, and this is the first time I've ever known him to park anywhere but the south parking lot. I pay attention to vehicles, and my brain is a Roladex of vehicles and license plates. I pick up on cars and notice the people who normally park in the north lot.

A friend suggested sending an email clearly stating something along the lines if *""I do not want to have any interaction with you whatsoever. Please leave me alone.

It is, however, in stock in Australia.

I am willing to pay the extra cost of shipping but ASOS AU doesn't ship to the US.

328,"To make a long story as short as possible, I'm 19 and living with my parents. About 4 months ago I had a SERIOUS heartbreak. She was living with me because I thought I could help her and she ended up cheating on me, then later moved out while I was gone over the weekend. I still can't get over her because we both were planning to get engaged.

I got more and more depressed, eventually I talked to a counselor and my doctor. I was diagnosed with clinical depression and ADD. I kept this from my parents but my mom found my antidepressants. We talked things out and she accepted the fact that I was depressed but she doesn't think I have ADD despite her working with someone who does have ADD and my mom openly tells me how similarly we act.

Shortly after that, I had another girl I talked to call me drunk at 1am once every other week telling me she loved me for an hour, and then another hour telling me she couldn't be with me because of how much she hated herself. Then the next day she apologized and recently we've started to lose touch.

I want to get out and meet people but due to work and classes I just don't have time.

My meds have lost their effect and I'm getting extremely depressed. I want to cry but I'm just too tired.

TL;DR: Can't get over a serious relationship, diagnosed with clinical depression and ADD but my mom doesn't think I have ADD even though she says that I act exactly like her coworker with ADD. A girl I liked calls me drunk every other week telling me she loves me but can't be with me because she hates herself. I want to socialize but don't know how.

336,"I (25F) was crazy about sex from 16 to 22. I wanted to have sex all the time to the point where my boyfriends couldn't keep up. I was single for a year from 21 to 22. Then, at 22, when I started a new relationship I noticed that I was not that horny anymore and I was okay with only having sex 2-3 times a week. Wasn't too worried, I just thought it was because I was not as sexually attracted to my then-boyfriend as I was to my previous partners (during the sex craze phase).

Anyway, that ended when I was 23 and after that, I remained single for a year and a half. No sex for most of that time which wasn't a big deal honestly. After a year of being solo, I started sleeping with random guys I met in clubs and bars, I was just that desperate for attention. Sex - unsatisfactory. Self-confidence - rock bottom. I finally decided to end the slutty period just because it was taking a toll on my wellbeing. A few months later, I met my now-boyfriend. Everything has been amazing since then and he's a loving, sweet I guy I enjoy spending my time with. I also enjoy our physical intimacy - kissing, holding hands, making out...but not actual **sex.**

Now, our sexual chemistry was not amazing in the beginning of the relationship, which was mainly due to the fact my boyfriend was not very experienced and was kind of clumsy. However, he's been very open to suggestions and things have improved a lot. I have orgasms, everything is great...I just don't feel like having sex. Sometimes he'd try to initiate and thinking about how I have to get naked and sweat, I just prefer to cuddle in bed, so I turn him down. Honestly, at this point I feel I can be totally happy in this relationship and have sex only once a month. This is worrisome because I'm starting to feel his sexual frustration is growing (he's never pressured me or said anything about it) and I'm also not really feeling like myself.

And alot of things I've witnessed over the the last year has proven to me this company doesn't actually stick to the values it's trying to promote, I tryed to speak up about something once that I didn't understand what was an issue, I then had to be coached on how to sit down and just shut up pretty much, so exact opposite of what they lead us to believe and my issue was still never resolved. But I just smiled and nodded and pretended like I valued the ""advice"", because I need to stay in this job for a little bit as I am hoping to switch departments as there is still alot of learning and skills I can develop from this company, and maybe going to a new building they actually follow the values.

Ok, so. I have experienced anxiety a few times through out my life. When my dad passed I didn’t really feel anxiety I felt more of sadness/anger the first year. The second year I was pretty angry for the most part and sad and now on the 3rd I’m both of those and my anxiety???? It is hard to breathe almost EVERY day. No exaggeration. Every single day I am worrying that someone close to me will die. I worry so much it’s sickening. I worry about myself too. Just seeing so many people die out of nowhere, it makes me so sad.

343,"I know this probably isn't r/Advice worthy and I would think this post is pretty pointless on any other day. However I have decided to give it a shot and narrate my problem hoping for a solution.

I am going through a breakup after a long term relationship. I'm a 24M from India and I am pretty much lonely at the moment since all my friends have migrated to different countries for education. On top of that I am also on a self improvement therapy where I have decided to read books instead of browsing social media, I quit all my social media accounts, I am on a NoFap journey and will on pleasure myself to sex.
One of the exciting parts about being single is to have the freedom to hook up with anyone.

Along with that I have decided to be career focused and spend more time enhancing my career. Now this is where my problem lies. I have found myself to be too distracted from this due to my craving for human company (remember I'm lonely). Now before I proceed I need to mention that I'm good looking, like tall, muscular and a sharp jawline, not to brag but for context.
I have always gone out of way to get some attention because I know I get checked out a lot in public. I equally hate it and love it. I have often dressed up looking really fancy along with some shades and walk down streets and observe girls checking me out. I sometimes try to enter meet ups just so I can meet people rather than what the meet up is all about (and knowing this I end up not doing it). 

While I spend most of my weekdays at work, I spend most of my weekends planning on how to get friends and hookups and try different methods of doing it only to back out in the last moment. The only time where I am completely focused on myself is at a gym but even then I find myself trying to come up with a decent way to approach women there after significant eye contact.

I have found myself searching on the internet for meaning behind everything that has happened with me in order to be sure. I searched for meaning behind ""eye contact"", or ""was she checking me out?"" or even ""Does she want me to come to her?"" and many more. Looking at this I am deeply embarrassed and I want to put a stop to that. 

Along with good looking I am also a confident dude looking for an opportunity to make my move. But living in India, the opportunities are very rare. Firstly society isn't friendly for strangers to approach women, especially loners, so that's frowned upon. Secondly, most women move in groups and therefore the wall of socialize cannot be breached. Thirdly, most of the eye contact and checking out takes place at places where it's impossible to make a move, eg: Gym, Train or Cafe. It's crazy that I also end up regretting not making a move as I always wonder whether that was them giving me signals to make a move or not (seriously girls are confusing, why can't you approach for once?).

Notice how this is posted on a Monday? Yep it's right after another failed weekend. Not that I am trying to make it sound like it was a bad weekend. I often enjoy weekends, alone or with family. I do enjoy going to places enjoying my meal or a drink and read a book while I'm at it. After most failed weekends, I chin up and move on telling myself ""Oh well let's wait for next weekend"" and move on trying not to feel disappointed. But deep down it's also painful that I have become sad, lonely and desperate, and that it's difficult to come out of it since this is adult life. Often when I narrate this to my friends over a video call, they feel like I'm trying too hard an overly fancy look due to which people assume that 'I must be having lot of friends and get lot of girls so therefore I don't look like a typical lonely guy'. Well this could make sense but I don't believe lonely guys have any sort of a typical 'look'. I don't want to sound like a narcissist or have a massive ego. I don't, I am open to being friends with anyone. I think I need a friend circle more than I need girls.

I am unable to give 100% attention to what I have planned on doing because of my crave for attention and I really don't know how to get out of it. My main problem is the lack of focus on myself because I am lonely, so I am trying to get rid of that feeling by just doing what my kind cravings and then get back to being focused on myself. So open to advice that does not involve me getting friends as well.",10Feb2020,1

He told me he wasn’t and screen records himself opening snap to “prove” he wasn’t in the chat. I said whatever and just went on with life. Another note: Me and Joe are both on robotics, Talia is too. I had since also dropped her for similar reasons relating to the groupchat. Anyways lets continue. So I have seen joe a few times over the last 2 weeks and the whole thing drifted out of my mind. Then today I see on his snap a bunch of pictures of him hanging with that group of kids. It really hurt me but idk what to do. Do i ask him about it? Do i just say fuck and block him and ignore him? If i drop him i also have a ton of his shit at my place. Idk what to do. I need some fucking help. Reddit yall always seem to offer advice so please help me out! Thanks guys. Amazing how yall can be better friends then the people around me.",10Feb2020,1
353,"I work with this one person who is really rude especially when I first started this job, 3 years ago.
He made personal comments and called me gay, that was the first thing he said after not talking with me at all(not even greeting each other). He expressed his hate for gay people.
Even though I’m not gay or in my point of view don’t give off any gay vibes.
Anyways I ignored this as I was really at a depressed state of mind at that time and wanted to end my life so this comment hurt me but I ignored it and never confronted this stupid coworker, others also have a problem with him but I’m stuck working with him.

It’s an easy security job so I like it for the time being but can’t stand the sight of this person who insulted me when I was down and out, physically and  mentally.

HR won’t do anything, so I’m stuck with him.

356,"(I hope this is the right place to ask this, if not, can anyone direct me to where I can ask this) I have had sex with my boyfriend before, and i have bled in small amounts, and i’m aware this is normal. I am on Cerazette, so we recently decided to not use condoms and that was fine, and he would pull out. But the other night he asked if he could finish inside me and i agreed, and during sex he was being rough-ish, which i’m fine with. But afterwards, it really hurt and it burnt and I felt a lot of pain once he finished inside me. I think this because he must have torn something (correct me if i’m wrong) when putting it in, as that usually happens and is the explanation for bleeding, and i guess the sperm was almost like salt to the wound. But it was burning and hurting for hours. Fast forward two days later, it no longer hurts but I’m still lightly bleeding occasionally, and some little clumps of dark blood are coming out when I go to the bathroom, but it isn’t often, just sporadic. Not only am I paranoid that i’m pregnant since he finished inside of me but i’m also wondering if I should check this out and go to the doctor and see if everything is okay?

In my early teens I really enjoyed food and video games. My dad would cook the most awesome meals and I would empty my plate and ask for more, these days almost all the food I eat tastes the same and nothing really excites me anymore.


 It's the same with video games, I could play them all day back when I was younger, enjoy them to death. I even played some games for more then 500 hours in 3 months. These days I play one or maybe 2 matches in my most liked game and I quit for that day and just watch YouTube or read meaningless things on reddit.

So I badly need life advice because I've fucked it up so far. My parents are/have always been emotionally abusive(extensive physical violence when I was younger, threatening to take away housing/money as I got older) but appear as 'normal' upper middle class community members.  Thing is, they raised me to depend on them and I don't know how not to (my fault) so I don't have a drivers license, never had a job, don't even have trusted friends/mentors etc. I was suicidal (multiple attempts) when I lived with them, in college housing now(living on fed loans) and the thought of going back sends me into a downward [spiral](https://spiral.Im) (my parents will let me back in, but I don't know for how long; theres usually a big fight about something in the middle of the night and someone gets kicked out etc.). Some professors have tried to talk to me about ""concerning behavior"" but my parents have threatened to use any treatment I seek as proof that  I'm ""crazy"" and not credible. I have also had friends who have had issues with gov. jobs for seeking professional help.

My college plans fell through because my family wasn’t able to pay for it, and a series of unfortunate events led to me not getting any scholarships and financial aid. I was planning to reapply for fall 2020 but around October I had decided to instead focus on improving my art talent and do art commissions, a decision I’m second guessing but alas it is too late. I want to be an animator but I have no idea how I’m going to accomplish this goal. I don’t know how to drive and I’m 19, I can’t get a job because of my status as an illegal immigrant and my parents haven’t really done anything in trying to change any of it.

369,"New to the sub, so apologies for any mistakes in laying out my story.

4 years ago my dad was put on hospice for alzheimers/dementia. I moved back home and worked remotely to spend more time with him and try to help the family in taking care of him while he was on hospice, and at the time, my mom, sister (23 years old at the time), aunt, cousin, and dad were all living in the house, with my dad immobile and bed-ridden. My 26th birthday was coming up, and I asked everyone if for my birthday, we could do a family dinner, as I knew it would be the last birthday I'd have with my dad. Everyone said they would be home for dinner at 5.

Around 4pm, my mom and I run out to grab takeout, and I hadn't heard from my sister, so I texted her to double-check that she'd be home by 5, and she texted back yes. Around 430, I was getting a little nervous, so I texted again, and she again said she'd be home, but maybe a little late. By 5pm, I checked with her again, and she said she'd be home soon. I insisted to everyone else that we not start eating until she was home. 530 rolls around, then 6, and my sister stopped answering my texts and wasn't picking up on my calls. So we ate. I fed my dad, we had cake, 7pm rolls on, and still no word from her. 

I went out later that night with friends, and didn't see my sister until she came home after midnight. I found out later that she was playing golf with friends in a city about 20 minutes from our house, and had started at 430. 

I was and still am furious, hurt, upset, disappointed, and reluctant to trust her. It's been 4 years, I still get livid about it when I think about it, and every birthday I've had since feels like a reminder of the day my sister lied to me. If I'm being honest, if it were any other birthday, I think I would've forgiven her a while back, but this was my last birthday with my dad, and the only thing I asked was for her to come home for dinner. And she didn't. 

I know she's sorry and genuinely feels terrible. And I'll wholly admit that I've never been the best sibling to her, but this is something I've held onto for a long time and just can't get past. It feels like she took away something from my last birthday with my dad that I can never get back. 

How can I move past this and begin to trust her again? I want to, but every time I think about this, I just become angry and frustrated and hurt. I've been seeing a therapist, and I do want to talk to her about this thoroughly, but I'm not sure either have been or will push me to the point where I can forgive and move past this.",10Feb2020,1
371,"My friend (Fem. Virgo) and I (Fem. Aries) had an argument 3-4 weeks ago and she still hasn’t gotten over it. We’ve been friends for over 10+ years. It all started when I made a joke and she got offended. I started being dramatic about it but saying things like “it was just a joke, chill”. And I should’ve handled things differently. This broke out into a fight. At the end it went like this:

Me: I’m not sure I want to be friends anymore
Her: I don’t care. Do what you want

After I got over the fight (like, 30 min. later), I said that I changed my mind and the I wasn’t going to end our friendship because of one fight. Just a heads up, we’ve had fights like this in the past and it ended in us breaking it off, but apologizing shortly after, and everything going back to normal. The next day I texted her a few times asking if she was okay, because she wasn’t responding. I got a message from her saying 

“Stop talking to me”

We had another argument after that because she talked a bit about some of her personal problems, with me pushing her, trying to help her but sending her some videos.

About a week later we had another argument about the fight, about how I acted, and about me being all like “I’m not sure I want to be friends anymore, to I hope you get better soon”. I ended it with an entire string of text messages apologizing for everything, the fight, how I acted, what I said, and that I hurt her. 

She hasn’t replied but she hasn’t said anything about it. She is still trying to distance herself from me. We have so many great memories and cherished moments and I don’t want that to go down the drain. I started making a song about how sorry I was and how I hope she can forgive me, but I haven’t recorded it or written all of the sheet music.

I’m not going to send the lyrics for the song, because I only want her to hear it or know anything about it. And I’m not going to shed the exact words from the argument, because I don’t want to share anything from personal messages between me and her, to respect her privacy and her rights.

i work for the state as a probation officer, for a little over a year. I have an offender of mine who has been under me since I started. I’m 25 and he’s 40.  We have had a professional relationship the entire time. However a few meetings ago we got to talking and he was someone flirting with me.  He was kind of testing the waters. I didn’t stop it and just moved on. I’ve seen him twice since and he has been flirting with me even more. It’s “innocent” and not inappropriate,  it’s just how he says things. It’s normal conversation with a layer of flirtation if that makes sense. I haven’t stopped it and I know I should. He’s married. At our last appointment we were talking and I told him I was going to be quitting soon.  he wanted to know if He could have my real phone number, I told him no.  I told him the only way he could have my real number was if his wife knew. This is all BAD I know. Stay with me. So I told him I wouldn’t mind him adding me on Facebook after I had quit the job. He told me that he didn’t have one because his wife didn’t allow him to, and wondered if he could add me under an alias. I said no.  I told him he was pushing the line of our Probation/ client relationship and he just laughed.  I didn’t say it entirely seriously but I he knew that I was not trying to go there. He also knows that I’m not entirely bothered by him flirting. Which I should be and it’s all very bad I’m aware.  He told me it was unfair that I knew everything about him, and he knew nothing about me. So I told him he could ask me 2 APPROPRIATE questions. He then goes “ do you have a boyfriend” I said no. He then goes “do you want one?” As if he was implying himself. I laughed and said alright were done here and ended the appointment. He knew exactly what he was doing and that he got me flustered.  

Well tonight i was looking on my work phone and I going through my contacts and I ACCIDENTALLY CALLED HIM. I ended the call within a second or less and I’m freaking out for multiple reasons 1. He’s going to wonder why I called him at 1am.  2. I’m worried that my job is going to see that. And ask me to explain. 

What am I supposed to do. How do I explain that to him, when he asks. And if my job asks how do I explain that???  Please help me.  Please refrain from leaving judgmental comments. I’m aware that this is not okay that I’ve allowed flirting and potentially have flirted back. I just need advice on how to get things back to a professional level with this offender.",10Feb2020,1

378,"I feel like I just need to write my thoughts somewhere. Hopefully somebody sees this and can offer me the right words. 


I've not done a good job of staying on track of things in my life, I definitely should have graduated high school but didn't. 

I definitely should have had a job by now that I am 22 and I definitely should not have let my weight get out of control (right now around 400 pounds). 


I can't change the past though, only the present. I am trying to right my path and trying to find the direction to go in. 


Lately I've taken up ""intermittent fasting"", I am confident in it and have made it work for me over the last month. I might have even already lost some weight (recently tried on a couple of shirts that were a bit tighter a few months ago).


This brings me to the rest of my life's problems, no job experience and no education. How can I write this into a resume to move forward? 

It's not like I've been completely idle. Starting at the age of 17 I've been running somewhat of my own online business, selling things online. Sadly this experience is not something I can write onto a resume and most would consider how I've been making money a side income (up to around a thousand a month).


I can read and write very well, I spend hours on Reddit every week reading and writing, participating in discussions. I feel like it is time for me to go back to school and get the equivalent to a Grade 12 diploma. I have recently discovered how to do that but I do have some obstacles in my way. 


I am making this on a throwaway so I don't mind mentioning that I'm in Canada, it's winter, with my weight issue I've let the crappy weather get the best of me and I regularly go weeks on end without leaving my house. Lately as I've once again been trying to lose weight and eat better I've also been doing exercises of sorts in my house since I can not go on walks the weather is too bad. My main reason for not going on walks is if I slip on the ice and hit the pavement, I'm likely going to be in severe physical pain for a number of weeks. 


Anyways back to my point, I'm trying to figure out a direction to go in, I have been looking at entry level jobs in a city I plan to move to, something basic like stocking shelves at a grocery store to get some work experience. I feel like I would thrive in this environment however I do have Aspergers and this is no excuse - plenty of people with Aspergers have jobs- but I can't imagine the anxiety I would have prior to an interview, something as simple as eye contact would be a struggle for me. Again this is something I can work on, once I start losing more weight I'm quite certain my confidence will go up and I wont be worried about these things, I don't usually have too difficult of a time speaking with strangers as of now anyways.  


I don't want to ramble on here too much I don't even know if I want to post this here but I am hoping somebody can read this and offer me some direction. I realize the mistakes I've made in my life and I'm getting to a point where I see so many others my life that are thriving and it honestly makes me jealous, jealousy will do nothing though, action will. Losing weight has been the first step, I know that much. Upon discussing this with my only friend, I think what's clear is at my size I can't get a job at this point, I am not fit for even something like stocking shelves, however as I said before the confidence from losing weight should boost me into a entry level position.  

My plan as of now is to stay strongly focused and disciplined on intermittent fasting, when the weather gets back I'm going to be walking 1-3km a day (I was doing this starting back in August every day until the weather got too bad ~ late November, the last few months have honestly been a blur, very depressing time for me). At some point I will need to pull the trigger and get started with the program in mind where I can get my Grade 12 equivalent. 


Oh there's another part I should mention here, my end goal is a job in web development, I've been self learning it for a while now and I honestly have a hard time staying on task, I've unfortunately also developed a severe pornography addiction and the lack of discipline has made it difficult for me to get things done. 

I've gotten to the point that I realize I need to get things done though in order to get to where I want to be. I've been learning Javascript starting late January and I'm going to keep learning it. 


Funny how I write about my excellent reading and writing skills but keep rambling and going off topic one paragraph after another, any ways back to my plan, I'd like to focus on web development while I'm losing weight, but I need some direction, how will I know when it's time to start working on my Grade 12 equivalent? It will require me to physically go to a place several times a week, I actually look forward to this because upon reading on their website they have staff in place to help guide students one on one. This is exactly what I need. 

Is my plan of focusing on losing weight / web development for a bit then getting my Grade 12 equivalent then moving to a new city (moving away from my parents too that is) and getting an entry level job a good idea? 

Is this realistic? I'm trying to be realistic, but the issue in my plan is I don't see a set in stone mark for when to make this transition to start working on my schooling. 


Also I have ninth grade education (I'm definitely more literate than a ninth grader though) as of now and I'm thinking of improving my math skills through Khan Academy. Ideally I can set out a schedule each day for working on khan academy, working on web development, and leave time for other things. 


I know this is long and a lot of rambling but I'm desperate for someone who knows something to give me a sense of direction. I'm really not happy with my current situation but instead of feeling depressed over it I'm ready to do something about it.


 Also the reason I want to wait until I've lost some weight before starting on schooling again is I need to make sure I'm ready to be dedicated to it.",10Feb2020,1
379,"   Last night I had a dream of seeing a roughed up black kitten that looked similar to the kitten I have today but smaller. In the dream I saw the cat outside my window eating cat food that I sometimes put out for strays. When I spotted it I cautiously tried to pet it. The cat allowed me to touch it while it was eating then when it was done I picked it up, held it in my arms and it purred as I continued to pet it. After that I put it on the ground in my room then it scurried under my bed. I didn't mind that. Later I watched YT in my dream and woke up. Now I see the same black kitten like a ghost at the corner of my vision. Just prior to typing this up I saw it run across my room back under my bed from wherever it was out of my sight. 

   I'm a little worried because I remember watching a paranormal video of a story of a man in a coma in which he woke up from describing that a girl gave him a stuffed doll and said that if he took it he'd wake up and get to see his family. Then the doll was mysteriously manifested in his room. But it was haunted by a violent poltergeist.

He was jittering, shaking and sweating like crazy. He comes to me as a last resort and almost crying, asks for just a small amount. I want to say no, and I need to say no but he looked like he was almost dying so I gave him 1 shot and said NO MORE.

I don’t plan on giving any more, is there any tips on how to say no or if I should give him in that condition or bear it. It’s so hard for me to say no",10Feb2020,1
383,"I'm only looking for dental because medical insurance is part of my benefits package at work. I get a $200 stipend per year for dental stuff, but that's it. So, I desperately need to find a new dental provider.

I'm looking at Delta Dental because my family had it in the past and it seemed alright, although I was just along for the ride and didn't know much about the inner workings. Does anyone have Delta and like it? Do any people have dental insurance providers that they really like?

Note: I'm a teacher in the Bay Area and thus do not have a lot of extra funds for stuff like this, but I don't feel good about not having insurance when I know I have things that I need to take care of (wisdom teeth, some fillings, and hopefully straightening in the future). So affordable options that still cover a good amount of stuff are what I'm aiming for.

Thank you in advance for any advice you can give me!

384,"Hi everyone!! So I gave my number to this guy I was talking to about 4 years ago and I ended up blocking him (he did not accept rejection that well). He has been making fake accounts on snapchat and Instagram and kind of harrassing me from those accounts. I’m fine with it because I can just block the account and that’s that. But the problem is that the last account he made to message me on snapchat said “do you want to sleep with the fishes dexter style?” and again it was really creepy but nothing I couldn’t handle. But after I got that message I’ve been receiving calls from an unknown number once a month (around the same times/ days) along with voicemails. I just find it really creepy and weird and sketch that he’s doing this NOW after almost 4 years? I know that he’s probably just being a troll but I’m scared he might start to escalate since he already did once (the phonecalls/voicemails). And I know that this is probably just a complete coincidence but a couple days ago someone snuck into the side of my house and did something with electrical tape that did not trip our sensors for our camera that we have there. I know it’s probably just a coincidence and bad timing but I’ve gotten paranoid to the point where I feel very scared. Especially since I know that he lives only about half an hour away. I know this problem is nothing compared to what others have to go through but I would appreciate any advice on how I can deal with this emotionally and also what I can physically do to somehow block the unknown caller or anything to kind of help? Ah sorry I know this is so long, thank you everyone!",10Feb2020,1
385,"Whenever I go to family gatherings I swear my family i.e cousins, uncles, aunties, and etc treat me like a five year old. They talk to me like a child because they sound different when talking to others besides me and it pisses me off so much. I know being 17 is not old but I'm not a young child anymore. They treat me like I'm helpless and useless and whenever I say whatever I'm doing in school or extracurriculars I always get a sarcastic amazing or wow. They never discuss anything serious with me or anything and I feel like they think I have a mental disability or something. And whenever I ever bring up that they're treating me like a child most would just say that I'm angry but it's so irritating when I'm actually trying to talk to someone and the only response I get would be like a sarcastic response that one would actually give to a child. It so irritating because I feel like I'm not being treated as a normal person but like a child or someone with a mental disability. They literally treat my younger sister who is 12 more like an older person than I am.  I'd literally get a question like ""Want a high five?"" and I would just awkwardly respond saying yes.

My father once tore his bicep muscle and described the pain similarly and that worries me because he didn’t get it checked out in time and now he’s permanently disformed and he regrets it a lot.

394,"A bit of context for the situation. I met the guy I like (Jack) through my best friend (Danny) as they moved in together. Jack and I hit it off and started seeing each other and sleeping together - side-note: Jack is into group stuff and the first time we were together he invited some else in (Shaffy - important later on). 

Jack and I quickly set boundaries which were that he doesn’t want anything emotional as he has come out of a long term relationship fairly recently and I am leaving the country in a few weeks so I was fine with that. There was no commitment involved - his exact words were ‘sleep with who you want and maybe I will too’. My living situation was temporary and not the best so he was happy to have me stay with him. He was inviting me to stay at his and being very affectionate every time I saw him but sleeping together was not super frequent - I was certainly up for it every time and ready. He still invited me to stay round though. He said he enjoyed kissing and cuddling with me etc.

Then a week ago, we were going to a street party. This was at a time where I was arguing with my parents about my financial situation and returning (I don’t want to leave the country I am living in right now to return home but it’s the smart move. So it’s causing a conflict). I also realised at this point that I have feelings for him but it’s not ever going to happen as I am moving back to my home country. This resulted in me getting very drunk and not remember a thing. I wake up in his bed the next day not remembering what I’ve said or admitted to him. I could have said I liked him. Although, even drunk I am fairly good at keeping my cards close to my chest. I stayed the day and ask if he wanted me to do anything before I leave as he let’s me stay sometimes and I’m grateful. He said a few things. I did some chores for him and left later. Once he returned, he said he was grateful I did it but he found it odd that I did. 

So a few days ago, we had a trivia night and I had been day drinking before and was a bit high. When I arrived, he was cold towards me. No affection. A cold greeting. Throughout the night, others made jokes and comments on me staying and about us sleeping together. He didn’t take it with the usual jest. I thought maybe he’s having a bad day. I thought maybe he’s stressed as there is another person staying in his home (Danny had someone he was seeing staying there for two weeks) as he said he likes his alone time. Maybe I was acting weird because I was a bit drunk and high?

So that’s the background leading up the recent night out we had. It was our friend’s birthday (Ari). I don’t know him that well and I was invited through them anyway. I asked Jack if he could tell me when they were heading over so  I could join them. He said of course. Our conversation was normal. It’s well over the time they said they were going to be there. So I texted and asked and got no response. Danny ended up texting me saying they are already at Ari’s birthday. This was followed by Jack texting me saying that Danny has messaged me and to talk to him instead. Eventually, I arrived. I greeted everyone. Jack was sitting down so I was touching his shoulders and chest a bit to say hello which was met with a cold rigid response. I turned to see Shaffy sitting next to him. I went and sat with Patty and was talking with them as I was one of the only people they know. The night goes on and I can see that Jack has brought Shaffy as a date to this event. They are having major PDA. It’s obvious. Patty let me know that they went to Shaffy’s house before going to Ari’s birthday. So I think Jack didn’t say anything about meeting before due to this reason.

As I’m talking to Patty, they inform me that they had a fight with Danny before I arrived (they both admit it was stupid plus when alcohol is flying so do verbal fists). I let Patty rant as they obviously needed it and try to inform them to resolve it. It’s not worth fighting. Their fight escalates to the point where they go home. Jack later informs me that it looked like I tried to stir things up as Patty spoke to me and then things blew up. Part of me thinks Jack dripped that into Danny as he didn’t want me their due to it being awkward with Shaffy and that might have got me to leave.

Anyway, the night continues and Jack is continuing to be awkward. He is getting with a lot of people but only when Shaffy isn’t there. Multiple people are asking me if I’m okay (I usually have major RBF and a brilliant poker face, apparently I can’t control looking sad though). I don’t want to ruin Ari’s birthday so I continue to be fine and don’t speak with Jack. Shaffy confronts me asking if I hate them (I don’t as I don’t know them - I was just jealous). But we end up having a nice conversation and go looking for alcohol. Jack gives me an awkward hug goodbye and doesn’t look me in the eye.

Now it’s been radio silence with everyone and me. The group chat is completely silent. I’ve messaged Danny a few times to see if he’s okay. He’s replying but it’s blunt. They’re already making plans without me on days I was trying to make plans with them prior to this happening.

I know it sounds like Highschool level issues. However, we are in our 20s, some 30s and I thought it would have matured by now. But I guess I’m asking how other people would approach this. I’ve suddenly got a reputation of being a snake for talking with Patty and playing the victim for being sad about Shaffy. All I would have liked was for Jack to be honest and direct about it. There was never any commitment. I just feel a bit used to fill a the absence of his ex when he was lonely and as a way to avoid dealing with his breakup. I don’t want to leave this country on negative terms, I really like these people that have become my family.

So what’s people’s advice on why it may have happened? Could you give me an outsiders perspective so I can gain a little more insight into the situation? Any advice that can help resolve it? Or similar experiences?

Anything will be appreciated and thank you for reading!",10Feb2020,1
395,"I’m 19 and set to graduate in 4 years ,I  started school at 18 but due to some bad choices itll take  5 to actually complete 


I feel like graduating at 23 is too old 

And moving out at 24-25 ( thinking of staying another year with parents to pay off any debt I’d have ) is kinda sad to me. I always wanted to move out at 19 and be on my own ( tho if I live on campus in my last 2 years this is still possible hopefully ) 



I think 23+ is when life starts to feel “ dead “ and youth starts draining away 



Like I never hear of 23,24+ year olds doing cool stuff , they’re all focused mostly on work and stuff, which I get, but I don’t wanna get like that. Where most of my convos revolve around work, I’m scared to try new things, etc 


And it’s so close to 30, which isn’t old but 30s closer to 40 , which is where I see people I know that are sad with life 


Thinking about all this makes me wanna just take drugs and disappear off the earth. 



It also makes me want to drop out 



Also idk y , I haven’t self harmed since high school ( not cutting ,other ways ) but every time I think about it I get a strong urge to cut myself. I probably will do it eventually cuz of the urge but haven’t simply because of the cleanup and people in house. If my house was empty, I’d have been done it, but that’s probably a discussion for another time :(

He has always been extremely supportive, patient and kind with me and I really do love him and don’t want to lose him.

We both said that we wanted to stay together but he said that he wanted to start staying with his parents again and only stay at my place once or twice a week. I agreed as I think its fair for him to want some space and I was hoping that some space may make us cherish the moments we are together. Besides, we both have every intention of him eventually moving back in within the next few months and trying again. However, I’m starting to feel as though the space isn’t working for me. Instead of missing him, I’m adjusting to life without him. Instead of cherishing the time we are together for, I’m just sad because I know he will just be leaving soon. We’ve been together for almost 3 years and I really don’t want to lose him. I know we are both young but we both really do love each other. I also know it would be unfair for me to just tell him he needs to move back when he has said he needs space. I just don’t know if I should keep trying at this, even though to me it just seems like we are drifting apart. I briefly raised my concerns about this to him and he said that he didn’t feel the same at all and that whenever he is with me all he feels is love, but a lot of the time I am just sad that he will be leaving soon.

We’ve spoken to him that we’d like to help and given as much self help feedback if we can but we don’t really get the vibe he’s going to take this seriously. 

What do we do next - is this a really hard thing to get on top of? I don’t feel too comfortable living with him now however don’t want him to end up in a horrible state.

411,"So there's this really good friend of mine who I'm also in love with. She knows that very well and values me a lot as we've been there for each other always. We love being close to each other, holding hands, hugging and kissing sometimes, but not really on the lips. Although, I've already had my first ever kiss with her. We travel together daily, hang out a few times, share jokes, gossips and support each other in little ways every now and then. She rests her head on my shoulder and holds my hand when we're traveling. I'm totally in love with her.

This is where it gets complicated. She already has a boyfriend who was there before I actually had these feelings and ever told her about it. I guess they both are in love with each other, while I feel like my feelings in this case are worthless and shouldn't exist. She still says that she values me incredibly and cannot imagine being without me and I trust her on that. I feel the same way too.

I still cuddle with her everyday, hold her for very long, kiss her on the cheek and all. Her boyfriend doesn't know about this, although he knows about my feelings for her. I have also asked her if she even likes it when I get so close as this feels more than just a friendship. She says that she likes it and doesn't want to leave when I hold her close to my chest, that I am an ideal boyfriend for anyone who would fall for me.

At that moment I feel like asking her why she is with someone else, but can't because it would be very selfish of me to do so. I want to tell her that it hurts like a knife going through me, when she goes with him. I don't want to feel this emotion of attachment but I just can't let it go. My heart melts when she smiles and when I see those pretty eyes. That's when I hold her close to me again, yet knowing that she'll never love me romantically.

What should I do? I can't leave her at any cost, not only because she's one of my best friends, but also that I adore her beyond anything. But being with her and seeing her love someone else breaks my heart. I've cried alone for weeks over this. I've cried on the phone with her. I've even cried at public spots where strangers have noticed. I've tried hanging out with her and holding my emotions inside, but they spill out every now and then. She says she wants me to show these emotions and not hide them, but I feel that it's also about my own dignity and self-respect to not express these feelings because she cannot reciprocate this ever. 

Help me Reddit!! How do I handle this situation?? Should I keep showing these emotions and forget about everything else? or should I hold it inside me forever?? I cannot leave her as that would break both of us emotionally. I feel lonely, empty and disappointed in my situation and my life. She knows how I feel and tries to cheer me up in little ways, which I love. This still doesn't change the truth. I'm still just a good friend and a depressed loser.",10Feb2020,1

414,"My ex left me 6 years ago. We were high school sweethearts and were together a little over 5 years so they were a large part of my life. They began dating the person I suspected them of cheating on me with about a month or 2 after our breakup and ended up marrying them about a year or 2 ago. I haven’t had any contact with them or their family since the breakup but from what I hear, they are happily married. To be honest, I don’t know if I still have feelings for them or not to throw that out there. I haven’t been on as much as a single date since they left. I did sincerely try moving on and finding someone else, but I lost interest pretty quickly. I no longer find people sexually attractive and the thought of beginning a relationship scares me. Maybe getting closure is what I need to truly move on, but again I don’t know. I believe I didn’t get full closure with my ex because I was too busy being selfish by trying to win them back while they were getting their closure.

415,"I don’t want to go into specifics, I’m not in danger, but I need to get out of a very shitty situation ASAP.

Here’s the story: about 8 months ago I moved about 4 hours away from my hometown to a big city, but before that I got in a fight with my then best friend. I kinda let some stuff off my chest over text to her, said I felt like I was being used and that I felt like she was only friends with me if and when it was convenient for her (she would go from coming over every day for a month to not talking to me for weeks, it was kinda irritating and confusing- y’know?). Plus we smoked a lot and she stopped throwing in towards the end. She seemed offended by that statement and I haven’t heard from her since- not even when I came home. I feel like I’m owed an apology honestly- maybe she feels the same, and I don’t know what she expects or if we’re just done being friends and I’m the one being mad for nothing.

I have noticed that he has never gotten hard seeing me naked or wearing anything suggestive. This has been since the very beginning. He is only ever hard if we specifically initiate sex. He sees me naked quite often, as we always shower together. But even the first time showering together, he didn’t seem interested in that way (which is fair because we are in a shower setting, not a sexual setting). I haven’t had this problem in the past, but I also don’t have a lot to go off of at all because my first and only time before this was a FWB situation. 

I wasn’t really concerned about it until I saw other people talking about it somewhere and how they were offended that their bf didn’t get hard seeing them naked, and I guess it kind of hit. I definitely don’t want to bring it up if it isn’t an issue (because I mean, it isn’t his fault regardless) but now that I think about it, the lights are always off when we are having sex and my shirt is usually on. I am very small. 5 feet even, under 100 pounds, and only have B cups to offer. I really wonder if he doesn’t actually find me attractive considering all of the things adding up.

Current situation: 

So we have barely been talking for the last 2 months haven’t seen each other in 3-4 , and probably barely talked for the last 3 weeks if at all , then he messages me last week. I reply back, normal stuff. Then he texts me and I text him back , he doesn’t open it for 2-3 days . Which really pisses me off considering I know he could open it, and we hadn’t been talking , so I feel like this makes me look pathetic and like I’m dying for this friendship , I’m not, at all 


Anyways I delete my texts ( it’s snap ) and he messages me 2 days later saying hey. I message him back he does the same, then he messages me , and I back and he hasn’t opened it AGAIN, it’s been 2 days. 



——- 

The not answering texts upsets me more than us not talking at all ( which doesn’t affect me at all for some reason, I was fine w it ) because I feel like it makes me look pathetic  


I genuinely want to block him and be done with this, however being that he was my best friend for a year I still have empathy and am like, I don’t want it to make him sad you know?

The doctor advised that I take a week off school, but If i were to do this my grades will suffer &amp; I will fall behind.

I have two options.

1 - I can mask the fever, attend school &amp; let The fever wear off.  


2 - I can take 7 days off. My brother can collect all the work, assignments &amp; homework I’ve missed. I can complete it at home &amp; my brother will hand it in the next day for me also collecting the next days work.

This solves the problem of me “falling behind” but what about my grades?  Will it have a big impact or am I overthinking?   


I should mention that I am in grade 9. If myself or my mother were to write a note to my teachers explaining my situation would they understand?   


Even if I were to submit the assignments, homework &amp; do the tests I missed once I begin attending school again?

429,"Hi. I just recently left a really, really toxic job that I took out of desperation last year. The place was a nightmare and I only lasted as long as I did because I had 2 good coworkers and really needed the money at the time.

Because of that experience, and because I'm already 24 with almost nothing to show for my hard work, I really want my next job to be one that's in the industry I love and can give me experience relevant to what I actually want to do.

Unfortunately, since I'm not from the US or some other first world country, that means my options are all small studios that can't give me as many benefits as, say, a big, multinational corporation - and I'm fine with that! I understand that I have to work my way up and that I need to actually have experience doing these things before I can start demanding huge bonuses. I get it, really.

But my mom doesn't. She's been guilt-tripping me since I left my last job to try and get work in a big corporation because I'm her ""last hope at getting medical care"", and those places are the only ones that will offer employees medical benefits for their dependents.

She slipped a disc from years of overwork and I understand that it's causing her a lot of pain. She's the only one supporting my 3 still studying younger siblings, and I know my deadbeat dad isn't going to be helpful anytime in the next century. I get why she would look to me, the only working child, for help, but I don't get why she's trying to control my career choices over it. If it was just for a while, long enough to get her spine fixed up, I'd gladly do it, but she wants me to make a lifelong career choice because it ""has to be a company you can grow old in"" despite explicitly knowing that that's not what I want to do.

It's not like I don't want to help her, I've repeatedly offered to just finance her treatment, but she turns me down every time. To be honest, I'm not even sure this is about her health anymore, because she's been trying to convince me to look up jobs abroad and ""take her away from here"".

I've been doing my best to ignore the guilt-tripping but it's really hard since I still live with her (I've been trying to move out since college but she guilt-trips me about that, too) and it's really starting to affect my mental health. How do I tell her that I'm going to help her but that I need her to stop trying to control my life?

I'm sorry if I just sound petulant or ungrateful, but I'm starting to feel really resentful because she keeps hanging this ""last hope"" thing over me even though it's my dad that needs to pull his own damn weight and be responsible for his wife and children. Thanks for reading to the end.",10Feb2020,1
430,"Yes, I actually counted. The past 3 days I had moments where I thought about her 96+, 83+ and 86+ times per day. 

**Background**

First year 20 year old male college student, became friends with a girl some months ago, we're classmates. Last period despite being in the same project group I had so many problems that I tried to secretly completely avoid her, but now this period we're once again in a project group... In terms of closeness, I guess we're closer than just friendly classmates. She sometimes sends me memes or songs.

Whenever my mind is not occupied with something it automatically starts thinking about her again. And it's really annoying and making me depressed. It makes me overthink everything as pessimistic as possible. But most of all, I want my brain to just shut up for a day and be mine again. 

""Thinking about her"" includes things like (but is not limited to): 

* Imaginary conversations / scenarios about random stuff (a LOT of these)

* Associations (I see something anime-related, which makes me remember they like anime too, which may spark an imaginary conversation about it)

* Thinking back about past conversations and/or actions (happens a lot)

* Thinking about the next time I'll see her, topics to talk about, how to act, what to keep in mind

* Think about her behavior / things she did and how it made me feel, or my own behavior around her

* Randomly wonder how she is or what she's doing at that moment or if she's online, who she's talking with

* Planning my behavior around her / planning how to avoid her 

I might have had a tiny crush on her when we first started talking together, but that crush disappeared months ago. I don't have butterflies in my stomach when I see her. I don't sense any romantic interest in her. I'm not interested in a relationship. 

I think it's because apart from her, I'm pretty much alone. I have only a single friend on the internet who I talk to like once every 3 days. When I hear something interesting that I want to share, I think of her. When I want to chat with someone, the only person I can think of is her. When she gave me attention, I first felt amazing. She randomly sends a meme? ""Wow, she's giving me attention, someone cares about me, someone out there is thinking of me, I'm not alone, this feels nice"". When you're lonely it's easy to get addicted to that feeling. My phone vibrates? I immediately rushed to see if it was her and would be happy if it was. And that got so annoying that ever since then my phone has always been on silent now.

It's the opposite now. She's very social with lots of friends. When she sends a meme I'm not happy anymore but angry. It doesn't feel like she sent a message to **ME**, but to ""random person number 8 on her list of friends"". I feel like some side character, while for me it's like my entire life has started to be just about her, it makes me think ""why should I even bother giving her any attention at all, she has enough other people, I'm not special"" and it makes me feel angry / depressed / sad / jealous / hurt / like an obsessive piece of shit who should NEVER become friends with anyone again. 

I thought that I should probably try cognitive behavior therapy for this since this is related to so many problems that it won't really fit into small Reddit comments, but turns out therapy is actually really expensive and I don't want my parents to find out either. So I'm hoping someone has/had a similar experience and managed to solve it. 

**I did not come here to get judged**. I don't need to hear ""that sounds very obsessive / weird / psychopathic / stalkerish / abnormal"". **I KNOW this is not normal**. This makes me hate myself, I think things like ""you should just disappear, she shouldn't be friends with a crazy person like you"" every single day. In fact I already asked her once to stop being friends with me. I gave her self esteem issues as reason  (saying I'm too boring / stupid / ugly to be friends with her) though there were more hidden reasons, but after talking about it and her saying she didn't think that at all we became friends again. I promised not to pull that stunt again even though I really REALLY want to right now...

I'm not here to have my behavior judged, I'm here for a solution to stop this behavior because it's really annoying and painful to live with.

434,"**TLDR: Friend of Friend attached to me, got same job as me, ignored advice and is now impacting my group of new hires, my time getting home as a new mom, and my overall sanity.**

&amp;#x200B;

I work as an Instructor/Facilitator, and have been doing so for a while. At this point I am the most tenured person, and have been working very hard to make a name for myself within the organization. I was tapped on the shoulder for this job because of my performance and personal brand within my previous role, and have been tagged for additional projects and to apply to a role that would be a big challenge for me (in a good way). 

&amp;#x200B;

I have an acquaintance at work (friend of a friend, that now thinks of me as a good friend), that applied for the role I'm in, and was turned down after their first attempt. They were told to work on their facilitation skills and to reapply when they felt ready and a new position opened. They asked me to assist in their interview prep, and from what I heard they did not take much of that advice when they went in. I figured this was good. It gave them time to work on their skills and to figure out if this role was right for them. 

&amp;#x200B;

After they were turned down for the role, I found out that they were basically trying to get out of their current role ASAP, but weren't confident that they would do well in my role. They have pretty consistently been at my desk, asking questions from myself and the rest of the team to prepare them for the next round, but also to sit and chat with us. I have been working on a lot of projects and let them know that at the moment I didn't have a ton of time. I would chat for a few minutes, then excuse myself to work on what I needed to get done. They would come over, while I had a headset on and was in the zone, and would have half of a conversation with me before I was aware they were there. And no matter how many hints, or even direct statements that I dropped that I was busy and on deadlines, they would hover around my desk and try to chat about everything.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast Forward a few weeks, my now manager is being promoted from the Senior in our role to the team manager and a new position opens up. Instead of doing another round of interviews with this person, they immediately offered them the role. Still not a huge problem, because I think they could be good (not great) at the role, but I'm not the manager and I'm not hiring so maybe they saw even more potential.

&amp;#x200B;

They are now in the role and on boarding under me, due to a scheduling change. I'm assuming they thought I was lying ab out how much administrative work there was, as they were complaining about that and asking how I managed to get it all done. I told them, that all of those times that I dismissed myself from conversations I was trying to knock out everything I needed to do. When we work we have to facilitate all day, and do 4-5 other tasks, basically during breaks. Any other time I've on boarded someone, this hasn't been an issue. I can sit down with this person during breaks, we make some small talk while I walk through the steps and they take that information and run with it, essentially taking the task off my plate.

&amp;#x200B;

With this coworker, I have had to stop them from trying to have a conversation with me about food, dates, restaurants, etc, and redirect back to the task at hand. After that task is completed for the day, I think we are good, but the next day/week, they seem to have no idea what I'm talking about. Also, I am constantly talking them down from being extremely nervous about facilitating. Before our last round started, they spent hours in the classroom, practicing presenting the content, asking me questions, and then ignoring the advice I gave.

&amp;#x200B;

They presented their first round of content this past week, and I was a nervous wreck. They give answers to questions that are very wrong, and then come to me to vouch. I have to then tell our new hires that the information was incorrect and then lead them down the right path. Not only do I feel that this is giving the new hires a bad taste in their mouth about the facilitation they are receiving, but they have a review that determines if they continue employment and this whole training revolves around that. My advice to stick to the script and not freestyle was completely ignored and they went over time that we needed to work on other things. Our schedule is planned out to the minute with really no spare time to catch-up.

&amp;#x200B;

They asked me for feedback that I tried to give earlier in the day, while I was trying to show them how finish up some tasks, so we could leave for the day. When I tried to give that feedback, they were only interested in telling me about a new restaurant that they wanted to go to during lunch (we have a hour and are in a metro area) and then proceeded to be gone the entire lunch time and afternoon break.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure if this person is unaware that they waste a lot of time in chatting with me and others, even though I've said it quite a few times, and very directly. One of the days, they pulled me away from leaving and catching a train to ask me about what needed to be done for the day. They kept saying, I know you need to leave and then proceeding with questions. Because I'm on boarding and learning the job, I gave them some extra time, but I can't keep doing this every single day. I'm a new mom, with an hour and a half plus commute, and if I miss a train it's 30 minutes to an hour until the next.

&amp;#x200B;

Going into today, I'm behind on some things that were required for us to get done Friday, behind on content because their presentations went over and we ran into some technical hiccups that made us fall behind as well. I feel like a horrible person because I really just want to tell them to shut up and leave me alone to get things done, but I can't because they are going to be doing the role alone with their own group in May and I am on boarding them. 

&amp;#x200B;

**How can I get them to understand that this job does actually have a lot of admin tasks along with facilitating full days for multiple weeks, when they ignored that fact before applying? And how can I say it in a way that doesn't literally crush their confidence, because I already know how to say that?**

&amp;#x200B;

**I am planning on having this conversation first thing this morning, if they arrive on time.**",10Feb2020,1
436,"Hi guys, 
I’m feeling really confused. Im male (19) I have the choice of going to uni or doing a gap year. I’m currently in a new country with not many friends, and even then they are quite a distance away. The original plan would be working 6 months in my new country (New Zealand) but I  don’t know how long I can keep going feeling lonely here. Going to uni would mean having friends and making new ones, but it would be away in a different country and away from my family. A gap year would mean travelling europe and staying with my best friend (cousin in Sweden) for 6 months. I can still travel at the end of the year during my 3 month uni break. How important are gap years ? I feel like my choice to go to uni is out of loneliness, and I would be continuing on the gap year plan if I didn’t feel this way. What would you do In my situation ? I know this is kind of trivial, but I really don’t know what to do, and would appreciate other people’s opinions on gap years (or gap six months for me).

441,I find it really hard to cope with someone not replying to my texts. It's like did I do something wrong? Or are you just busy? Am I so pathetic that I dont even deserve a text back? And it really affects my self-esteem and I get really sad when it happens. It's hard for me to not overthink and or not think about it. Even if I have things to do it would still sit in the back of my mind waiting for the second I am unoccupied to attack me. How do I rid myself from these thoughts?,10Feb2020,1
442,"I am 19M, 20 this year I finished secondary school (High School) last year and decided not to continue school further meaning I did not go to a University and I am currently unsure on what to do in the future.

I am still living with my parents and started working on getting a driving license to help me in the future but I still have a lot of free time so I wanted to use it wisely to help me find an appropriate job when I do move out.

443,"I was kicked out of my home at a very young age and I've lead a lonely and rocky life. 
The thing is that after years of struggling I've managed to make a life for myself. I graduated from high school as an adult and I've gotten to a university  and last year I got married. 

My life's not perfect but it's more than I ever thought I'd have and now I feel like it's slipping put of my hands. I'm under a lot of stress and I'm having a lot of doubts about every decision I've made lately. On top of that I'm trying to get a degree this spring and I feel like it's all too much, I don't have it in me to make it. 

So this is going to sound really pathetic but I saw this POV video in tiktok about a proud dad and it kinda hit me in the feels. I realized that I've never had someone in my life praising me or rooting for me saying ""good job, you can do it, I'm so proud of you"" an now I kinda want to hear it even if it's not real. I went in youtube looking for motivational speeches but they were all kinda.. not that great. Like some rich dude just telling how he got rich by not giving up or some angry guy yelling. 

Please help me find some video or podcast thats actually just a friendly voice saying nice and uplifting things so that I can look and listen to it from time to time to keep my head in the game. I'm not picky but it would be great if it would be more than 12 seconds of a teenager lipsyncing on tiktok.",10Feb2020,1

445,"
So I posted this on another page and someone said that I was raped during my first time. Obviously I consented at the time but was intoxicated and it just happened very fast. 
Now I’m wondering if this is why subconsciously I can’t get over it nearly 3 years later.


I have been with my other half for 2 years now. We have a good relationship but for some reason I live in the past. We are in the process of getting a property but the cold feet are sure hitting me.  
I grew up in a very fundamentalist household to extreme levels although I left the religion I have internalised mysogynystic  views from my upbringing. I vowed that I would wait till marriage that if I didn’t lose my virginity to the one guy I’d end up with I’d be doomed for life. 
At 24 however I got into a relationship and because it was my first relationship I was a damn fool, giving way too much of myself and time. I ended up losing my virginity to him drunk totally unplanned. We broke up soon after and I began sleeping with someone at work because I had already ‘ cheapened’ my self. 

When I met my now current he was uncomfortable with my past and didn’t like that other men had ‘ had ‘ me especially as one without commitment. He soon apologised, recognised he was hypocritical, worked on this quietly and has never ever brought it up since - it’s as though it never bothered him. 
But still in my mind I find myself wondering every single day if he thinks less of me, if our relationship would be even better if I had waited for him like I had planned. 
It’s making me wonder if I can marry/ own a home with someone I’ve waited so long to find. 
I know it may sound stupid but it eats me up it’s almost mental torture to the point I feel like I’d be broke up witn me I’d be free but at the same time I’d be lost without him. On Saturday we had a little tiff and I wanted him to just shout it’s over so that I can lay my sadness to some kind of rest.
I just look at my fiancé and think, if only I had waited a tiny bit longer you’d have been my one and only. The more I fall for him the worse I feel. I honestly can’t win. 

Sometimes I think I’m ok then suddenly this huge wave of sadness comes over me and I think about how much I let my morals and values slip and beat myself up mentally. It’s torture.",10Feb2020,1

448,"Okay listen, I’m a pretty friendly person and even though I’m shy I really get along with almost everyone I ever meet. But today, I let me insecurities get the best of me. I was training taking orders at a register. I’ve had two other jobs but they are what I would call independent working jobs. So I would work alone. But today I simply couldn’t grasp how to use the register while engaging the guests. This was my second day on training so it was all knew since we had just down this part the same day this happened. So my manager pulled me aside (into another room) and let me know to try and relax and that I was too tense and just overall tried to calm me down. But it that moment tears flooded down. Not sobbing but more of like I was just so frustrated with myself and frustrated with the idea that I was the only one who couldn’t use the register and take orders at the same time. Granted when I took a minute to gather myself I did come back out and took orders and really did relax more this time than I did earlier. I guess my question is how do I get over this annoying anxiety feeling when taking orders. Am I just that dramatic? Sorry for the long post just couldn’t go sleep without writing it all out. Did you ever get nervous when first doing register? How long until you felt comfortable with the whole thing? Also, did anyone else cry their first day of work? Lol okay thanks everyone!",10Feb2020,1
449,"A few months ago I bought an airline ticket through a third party app that rhymes with Bopper. It was a ticket from Chicago to Rome for my boyfriend to visit while I was abroad. However, our relationship wasn’t the best at the time and so I spent an extra 40 or so bucks for protected travel insurance, which meant I could cancel and get an 80% refund at any time. Predictably, we broke up within the first 2 weeks of me being here, and so I reached out to the app to request a cancellation and refund. But it has been nearly 2 weeks and I have still not heard from them whatsoever. The only way to get in contact with them is through the app, and all my messages still say “Not seen yet.” The flight is supposed to happen in another 2 weeks and I’m worried that once the date passes I won’t even be able to get a refund and I spent way too much money on this ticket to begin with. Is there anything I can do or any action that can be taken if the app continues to completely ignore me? I am so frustrated",10Feb2020,1

Anyways, i don’t really do anything jackshit horrible like drinking,smoking, etc... just hanging out with my friends. That still set her off anyways. My grades are actually really well, more than average, so grades wise there’s no reason for her to change my schools. Long story short, my mother got mad at me and want to change back to my old school because of me going home at 6:30, i don’t want to leave my friends behind because it’s actually the first time i ever had fun with my friends. Now that i realize that it’s going to be taken away from me, idk there’s just really no point anymore? Like i could just kill myself and problem solved. For me atm the only reason i do well in school is because of my friends. Besides, i’d fuck up my grades on purpose because i disliked my old school. That was around the month of december... as of now idk if she still wants me to change schools. I don’t think i’ll ever talk to her the same way again after that. I’m just wondering if there’s something i can do to change her mind. She’s not someone that you can talk seriously because she prioritizes her own beliefs instead of mine. What can i do in this situation? I could reach out to my dad since he’s the one who pays for my tuition, but my mother is the one who enrolls me and chooses my school... i genuinely dislike my mother, i wish i could reach out to my dad about this, but i can’t since they’re seperated.",10Feb2020,1
453,"Ok so this is gonna be a long post I think! It's totally OK if nobody replies (it is late at night right now so it could be a bit before I get a chance to get back if there are any replies, and I'm kinda in the situation where this is partly just venting to get all of my feelings out in the open. Any advice is appreciated though!).

TL;DR: One of my closest friends since kindergarten has been ghosting me and puts little effort into our relationship, but I can't let it go and it's not entirely on her because she has some pretty bad anxiety and depression. I believe I do too though (never gotten diagnosed or really told anyone) and rejection especially really hurts me, and I don't know if I should stop reaching out. 

To preface, me and my best friend, who I'll call Lucy, have been friends since kindergarten and now are seniors in high school. We went to elementary school together, but different middle and high schools.

Especially these past few years (as Lucy is VERY bad at keeping up with phone communication) we have become the type of friends where we don't talk or hang out super often, but when we do it's amazing and we just go straight back to old times, no matter how long it's been.

(These next two paragraphs are kinda filler and are probably ok to skim/skip). 

It's always been that she is very bad at replying to things, but she always eventually gets back (especially if you double text),saying shes sorry but she forgot about it or something. I first knew that she was having issues with her mental health when we got coffee one day almost exactly a year ago--it had been a few months since we caught up, and she dropped the bomb that she had missed the past few months of school because of her mental illness and that her parents (who my family had happily had a dinner with not too long before, and nothing seemed too off) were suddenly getting a divorce, which her mom had been contemplating for years. But she was getting better and was going back to school soon.

She didn't end up going back to school, and it was another month before she met up with me and told me some more in-depth stuff she had found out about her parents marriage that was difficult for her. But overall she seemed to be doing a lot better that the last time I had seen her--along with the next few times we hung out, including a few-day trip with her and my mom. That fall she decided to do online school and was busy catching up, so again, we only talked a few times besides DM'ing each other the odd meme on Instagram.

This is kind of a tangent, but I promise it'll make sense. I play a sport that's pretty obscure where I live (most people have heard of it but have never seen a game played) that I started my freshman year and fell in love with. My first three years I barely got any playing time which definitley hurt but not enough for me to stop.
Last year, a different friend, Anne, (who I am/was really close to) and I agreed to go to each other's fall sport games (I had never seen her play and she had never seen me). I watched her- but she never came to watch any of my games and made a last minute excuse to not come see her last possible chance to watch it (going to the pumpkin patch with her bf, easily moved plans compared to her last possible chance to see my game. it's still a sore point with me but I've mostly let it go- this year she actually played the sport with me, but she never came to watch me before).

Lucy never came to watch me play, even though I asked and suggested it multiple times to her. My senior year not only did I get more playing time, I was playing whole games straight and even got MVP- a drastic 180 from the previous years, where I wouldn't even get to play JV. There was even one set date, the last time for her to see me play EVER and senior night where people's friends and families traditionally come watch them play. She said she would love to come, and was excited, and less than an hour later she said she was too sick to. I understand if she was sick but still, especially with the quick turnaround... This really hurt me because I had never had any friends or family other than my parents come to support me, and it was an especially sore point after the events with Anne. I even had mutual friends of me and Anne's come watch a game-- they stayed for the (JV) game Anne was playing in but didn't bother to stick around to watch me play.

In December, we were both taking the SAT at the same time and had an agreement to meet before/afterwards and hang out. I texted her before I went in and when I got out, and waited around for another half hour in my car after all of the tests got out without a reply to any of them before leaving. I texted her an hour later asking if everything was alright and she just texted me ""sorry yeah i was just a bit nervous"",then that she was at a chocolate shop she thought I'd love to go to. I said I'd love to go with her and she never replied. 

The last time I saw Lucy was Christmas, and everything seemed pretty good, I went out to breakfast with her and our moms. We got each other gifts that the other loved.

I DM'd her a few times since then just with memes but she never replied or even opened them. I also texted her saying I was wondering if she wanted to hang out soon three weeks ago and she's never replied. What hurts the most is that on Instagram you can see if someone is online, and she is a LOT. at least once a day, if not more.

The thing is that I know she's still struggling a lot with anxiety and depression because my mom just told me Lucy got admitted into an intensive anxiety program (like an all day program) for a few weeks. So I know that she is struggling a lot and probably needs people to reach out to her, and I love her so so much, but every time she ignores me it hurts more.

I know that my friend matter way way more to me than I do to them, and I am very anxious that all of my friends secretly hate me, reinforced by past experiences. One time Anne and our friend Eva and I got into an argument. Anne ended up posting about it on an Instagram account all of my friends from school followed, saying every issue in our friendship she apologized for and I never did (not true, she even told me it wasn't true after it was all resolved) and the argument was all my fault and she was nowhere to blame and only one of our friends ever told me about it. We resolved things, but a few months ago I was gonna join a sports team I had quit a few years ago that Anne and Eva were playing on a few weeks into the season. Anne told me she didn't want me to join because she didn't want to spend any more time with me because of some of my faults (which were true, like I was being overly judgemental, and she was getting much closer to Eva than me, and when we hung out the three of us they argued but when it was the two of them was fine and fun) and I brought her down. But just a month or two later she told me she was transferring into all of the same classes I took for the next semester (now the current one). Things are good between us again and I love her so much and we for the most part get along well but it still hurts to think about these things.

Back to the more-present, every time Lucy ignores me it just reinforces my feelings that nobody cares about me, even my friends, and they wouldn't mind if I was gone. It reminds me that I'm a bad friend and I can't help her, and she clearly doesn't want to talk to me. I want to keep reaching out to her but every time I get rejected it hurts my mental health. I can't really talk to anyone about my feelings-- I'm a really closed off person for things like this and have only ever told people part of the story. I've never told anyone I used to (VERY minorly but recently, I'm trying to stop and i know it's a very childish thing to do) self harm occasionally, or how bad things get. Most of my friends at work think I'm a pretty peppy person. Most of my friends at school think I'm self-deprecating and make depression jokes just because they're that, jokes. (I know I can't talk to them because I was being super self-deprecating one day and they told me I was just being annoying. I know I shouldn't say those kinds of things but it's the closest I've ever actually gotten to telling someone my true feelings). I would never do anything permanent because I could never do that to my parents, I know that for sure, but suicidal thoughts and a deep-rooted self hatred still kinda suck.

So, I don't know if I should reach out to Lucy more. If I don't I know I'm being self-centered, and I'm not caring about her as much as I should which would be wrong for me to do because I love her so much. She's been so important to me for so long, I want to support her in any way she can in her battle. But if I do reach out, she probably won't reply and I'll feel rejected, and I'll just know more how she matters more to me than I do to her, or anyone else for that matter, likely sending me down a bad mental health spiral. What should I do? I think about her a lot, and we have some set plans in the future (going on a week long vacation with our moms in less than two months).",10Feb2020,1

460,"Hello everyone. Not sure if this is even the right place to post this kind of thing, but seeing as it wasn’t about a specific relationship, I figured a general advice sub would be best. I’ve never actually approached this topic myself, so it may be choppy, but bear with me.

I habitually destroy relationships. All the time, with almost everyone I meet. I destroy friendships, romantic relationships, even some family relationships. Whenever I seem to get close to someone, my issues always seem to kick in, whether it’s my issues with abandonment, trust, or just self image. 

This has been a big problem for me recently, because I work in a field where you can’t really get any professional help. Doing so could cost you your career (actually using my NSFW account to avoid personal details). But it’s gotten to the level where even being in a relationship with someone causes me mental stress. I find myself alienating myself more, not talking to people, etc. obviously I still care about these people in my life, but I just keep pushing them away constantly. And I’m not sure how to stop.

461,"In front of my husband's family, his sister got all upset that my husband and I aren't sharing every aspect of our lives with them or hanging out with her as much as we use too.

I can tell my husband is getting frustrated and it's time for us to go. So I say ""Please respect our decisions and trust that we are doing what we think is best for us"" 

And then I got killed. Or at least that's why my body tells me. 

We went to gather our things to leave and she corners me alone and tells me ""You don't have to be a bitch about everything. You're not the focus. I was talking to my brother. Respect that."" 

My sad and scared response ""I'm standing up for my husband."" 

How could I have reacting better in these situations? 

After we left the property  I told.my husband what happen because I dont keep secrets from him. He is used to her acting this way and dismisses most of her behavior but he is livid why her calling me a bitch. 

They got into a texting argument. He tried to show me parts of it but I didnt want to engage anymore than I did. I kept telling  him to set a boundary with her. If she can't respect us than we aren't going to hang out with her or something.  But to my knowledge he didn't. She also said she was being crabby because her period was late. As someone who also deals with this I wanted to rip her a new one for using this as an excuse insteading of owning up to her mistakes, but I didn't. 

I am planning out a text to send to her in a few days after everyone is cooled down that states ""I'm sorry about the other day, but I don't appreciate how you spoke to me. I want to have a good friendship with you but if you keep treating me like that, I'm noy going to come you for a while."" My intentions are to clearly state my boundaries but I also feel like it's too late. Should I send it or would staying silent be better? I know talking face to face would be better but I don't want to be around her. I almost dont feel safe around her. She intimates me. She manipulates, steals from her family, and is plain rude to her mother. My mother would kill me if I spoke to her like she does to hers. I also want to say something when I witness this but idk if it's my place too. I'm just not ok with being around someone like that. But she is my husband's sister, he doesn't want to completely her off. I want to respect his decision even though lately I'm not liking being around her, so how do we find the balance?  He doesn't want us the be separate. If I don't want to be around her then he isnt going to leave me to hang out with her.

472,"So, I'm a guy (19 years old kissless virgin). And for the past 8 years of my life, I've have had oneitis for this girl I met at middle school. We were close at one time but she would always choose other guys over me and fair enough, I used to be a total tool. She had been in a relationship for about 3.5 years, and up until a few months ago I had not seen her since high school finished. So after I saw her that time she would hang out with my group once in a while. So the other week we went away as a group to go camping. She came, her bf didn't. On the way she told me that she had just broken up with him. On the trip she got drunk and very flirty with my friends (who know of my feelings for her) so I was feeling pretty bad. So I got drunk and confessed that I have loved her for a long time and can't get over her. She just said awwhh that's sweet and I left. Next day was awkward and we all got drunk again, One of my friends then said that she told him that she would never date me. When we got back from the camp I apologized for making it awkward and told her my feelings in a much less drunk way, She never replied. We have been hanging out in the group on weekends and such, And one of my good friends has been flirting with her a lot. I know everyone is an adult and can do what they want, but I feel betrayed and just so upset. I don't think I can deal with them 2 being a thing. So what do I do? 

I have tried for a long time to get over her, But nothing works.

I don't want to lose my whole friend group.

Please help me.",10Feb2020,1

We don't have anything incommon, we don't like same things, exept games.
I've made mistakes and I regret every single one, but I can't stop thinking about other people or what it would be if I'd be single and living alone.
We doesn't have.. lot of going on in bedroom, but mostly I guess it's my fault, since I have medication that lowers libido.
He's an extrovert and I'm introvert, I do customer service as work and it drains my mental bateries almost to 0%. That means all I want to do is to be alone after work and he gets really upset about it.
It hurts when he says he loves me, because I'm not sure if I do love him.. I do care for him, he's the most important person in my life, but I'm not sure if I love him.

483,"I've used a local PC repair man on multiple occasions. He makes very little small talk and gets the job done in a couple weeks.

He lives in the garden shed of a friend of his and I know this because the son of said friend attends my college course. 

During a lunch break, said son let it slip that this PC repair man mocks my lack of understanding for computers while at home. (I'm friends with the son, but don't know if he also mocks me; suppose it's not really relevant).

I wasn't too bothered at first: annoyed that someone would do that, but I couldn't care less about someone else's opinion of me especially some keep to himself old guy who lives in a shed.

My family PC broke down and my mother was set on me taking it down to the local PC repair man. I then in passing mentioned how I was a little annoyed with PC man due to the reasoning above.

This sent my mother into an outrage.

She was furious that they would say such things about me behind my back and believes the son is no angel in this situation either. She said to boycott PC repair man and use someone else.

While I think her reaction is a little extreme, she did make a good point: this guy is ridiculing me and im still giving him money.

Problem is: theres not much competition in the PC repair business where I live; especially locally. My mum wants to ask a retired IT guy instead; but hes not very reliable; not good at updating you.

Other alternatives include taking it to somewhere more out the way or sending it via mail. The latter feels like we're the ones losing out as it would cost more than just using the local PC repair man.

He says things like ‘you constantly show me disrespect’ and ‘this behaviour is not okay’. (Just to show that it really is escalating from nothing, the most recent one was that I didn’t watch a film he rented for £3). I’d immediately apologise because I’ve learnt if I don’t, then he won’t shut up for 30 minutes, but he won’t take the apology. It’s as if he wants to take his anger out on me. 

But I want him to see that I’m not going to let myself be treated like that (and so he won’t call me stubborn and disrespectful when I do so).

2. We have that history and that also means out parents are friends

#### 1.Motivation:

If you are not getting the desired grades don’t get upset. Motivation is the key point to get good grades.

If you are fully motivated related to what you have to do, then there is no one who will compete with you. Increase your motivation to be a self-motivated person so that you can show your interest in every section.

#### 2. Arrange a time table:

To get good grades you have to arrange the time table according to your daily work.

If you have a pre-planned schedule, then you can do work easily and you will get to know on which time what to do, and it will save you precious time and makes your daily work well planned.

#### Example:

If you have to study for an exam, make the time table related to the exam study add some interesting activities before studying it will make your mind fresh.

And you will learn the matter easily or you can do some brainstorming exercise. This point will help you to get good grades.

#### 3. Good community:

The good community also helps you to get good grades. Because if you have a good friend company they will help you with every problem and if you have any doubt you can share with them they will help you. You can study together, which is an easy method to learn something. Group study is the best part of the exam.

#### 4. Attend every class &amp; grab the best knowledge:

Some students think that this was an obvious one, but believe me, it will help you to get good grades in your academic section.

Some students skip classes for enjoyment or some other reason, but they forget something, that they also skip the important matter which was done in that session.

So attend each session so you get every possible knowledge about the subject. and try to be the first bencher, So you can understand each and everything which the professor wants to deliver.

#### 5. Notes making skills:

When the professor delivers the lecture mark some outline and makes some notes which help you to get good grades. You can make rough notes in the classroom and correct them at home.

It can make proper knowledgeable notes related to the topic at home. You also make a search on the topic of which you have to grab the deep knowledge, you can copy some good points from there and mention it in your notes.

#### 6. Improve topic writing:

For getting good grades you may have good writing skills, so keep the focus on writing skills you can take help from our essay help. 

Good writing technique covers all aspects of writing, you can write subject-related topic once a week so you can improve your writing skills.

#### 7. Test fever:

Mostly every student has the test fever which reflects your grading, so extract this fever totally from your soul if you want to get good grades.

Tell the professor to take a test in a week so you can improve your learning skills and if your learning skills increase you can get good grades.

508,"Warning, this is a long post. My first time leaving the shadows of anonymous Reddit and making a post. I’m torn on what to do when it comes to school vs. work-life balance and want to hear from people who may have/be in my situation.

I’m 19, about to be 20 and live in America. I go to school full-time (4 classes, two in-person and two online) and already have my associates degree. I am pursing a bachelors in Business Administration/Accounting. I have no idea what I want to do with my life, leaning towards a CPA. I attend a community college and have scholarships to cover my tuition and books, still live at home with my parents. 

I work 40 hours a week (Mon-Fri) plus a 1 hour commute each way. Currently in the Real Estate field for a large corporation and make consistent income, about double the hourly rate than people my age. The work is monotonous and stressful. I got the job by knowing someone. I also have my Real Estate sales license, which I practiced for about a year before accepting I was not a salesman and thus moving onto my current role.

With all of this said, I love school and have come to hate my job. It’s nice to have the money to save/invest and to gain some experience on my resume, however I can’t see myself doing this all my life. I’m afraid that I’m giving up my college experience and the time needed to focus on my studies just to work at some place that sucks. I often rush through my coursework at the last minute because I don’t have time during the week to get it done and don’t feel like I am getting much value out of school. 

My family and friends think I’m a rockstar, it’s a hard facade to keep up and I’m truly exhausted. I’m actually miserable at this point. They seem to think I can do both but I really don’t think I can give my all to both. I don’t want to give up a job that makes great money but I also know that I need my education to become sustainable in the future. 

So far my idea has been to look at part time opportunities and internships at a different organization that would be more flexible for school and allow more study time. It all comes down to not knowing. I really don’t know what I should be doing right now.

Should I tell the girl that I’m a virgin who hasn’t even had a first kiss yet? Should I be worried about it?  I know this stupid but I really don’t have anybody else to ask.",10Feb2020,1
510,My friend/roommate has been getting bullied in college recently by some kids who were her only friends. So she’s getting isolated too.

511,"So I am having a breast reduction, and thanks to the public school system not allowing kids who are obviously sick to go home. I caught a small head cold.

512,"
My sister planned a trip to Malaysia with her boyfriend but they kind of broke up ( I don't even know anymore, feels like on/off) and she was so sad and I had some free time so I said 'fuck it, why not' and took the flight with her. 

Important side note, four days piror to departure I had a long awaited nose surgery so I could potentially, finally breathe through my nose (wasn't able to my entire life). I've told my BF as soon as I knew I would probably be flying with my sister (wich was like 1 week prior). But the decision was said to be ok from the doctor. As long as I take it slow during the beginning.

So my BF of almost four years(!) was suuuuper sad when we left and even cried when kissing to say godbye.. He's normaly sad when I go on vacation without him, but not 'tearing up-sad' I think..? And a thing to notice here is, that my BF really just doesn't like to travel so I kinda have to leave him behind about once a year, since travelling is kind of an important part of my life.

So anyway we decided to stay in contact and call each other every other day if possible and if not we just keep us updated on what we were doing today and if possible say goodnight to each other (7h time difference) . 

In the beginning all was good and I enjoyed the trip very much but then it started to fall apart.. He didn't write anything himself, but maybe one sentence a day and I started to wonder.. Either it was just a bad day for him, or something has to be wrong.. I continued as usual and wrote a little about what happend that day and asked how he felt etc. but he ignored the questions and just kept saying he was ""busy"" everyday (not even making full sentences anymore :/ ).

I asked what wrong and he always just said he was busy doing this and that .. I asked why it's so hard to just use 5 minutes of his time a day to write a few sentences about what's wrong or how I can comfort him but nothing.. 

He said he's a little angry at me for just leaving him behind (he wasn't able to come with us and even if he was he never would've). 

I began to get pissed, because two years ago when I was abroad for like 3 weeks (same as now) I accidentally saw that he was writing with a slutty person we both knew and they even talked about meeting up for sex. They didn't but I guess you can feel me about what kind of heart break that was. It's so hard to reimburst trust again.. I usually trust him, but in moments like this I begin to worry again... 

I tried to do the same as him and not write much, just enough so he knows I'm still alive but I couldn't bear (?) it for more than one day because I (thought I) knew that he was always very happy to hear from me..

Yesterday I wrote him about how I felt about it all and that it breaks my heart that he didn't tell me what he was doing for basically the last week at all and he just anwsered ""what's your problem?!"" and said I should go get sober again even though I didn't drink anything (we were partying a little before since my sister had Birthday on the 7th.) that day or the day before..

My heart is broken so much and I couldn't take it anymore so I wrote 'fuck off' and something along the lines of 'enjoy your time with your toxic friends'.

Then he said ""I don't think it's necessary to write you everyday because I've got stuff to do aswell"". That was the first time he told me he didn't like to be told what we were up to on any specific day.. He could've just told me earlier!! right?

So now here I am, heart broken, not knowing what my beloved BF is up to and not able to sleep for two days.. luckily our flight back is just another two days ahead of us.. I am so scared though :( :( :( 

What do you guys think?


I think his toxic mother and sisters (they have a very troubled family relationship history that I tried to repair but it's super hard) were telling him ""go be angry at SO, ignore SO, let SO feel what a shitty move it was"" They are the kind of people that do shady shit like this and my BF is easily manipulated by them since it's his family.. 

What made me think about that is that none of them asked me about how the trip was going and what we were up to etc. etc. I even chatted with both sisters and BF's stepdad and they all felt super cold towards me.. not the same at all when I am home.. 


I just don't know what to do anymore.. we have a somewhat toxic relationship aswell (me and BF) but since almost four years are trying to improve ourselves everyday because we love us that much and it has gotten so much better..

I am in tears.. I love him and he loves me but why would he be so mean to me :'(.",10Feb2020,1
514,"I tried the college route twice in the past. Fist time was about a year after high school, back in 1999. The second was around 10 years ago and I tried doing the online thing at a local community college. Both times I got overwhelmed and ended up stopping after just a few classes. 

I turned 40 last year and I realized that A) I don't want to stay where I live for the rest of my life  (wife and I plan on ending up whereever our daughter settles) and B) I have a feeling my current job won't be here forever (meat department manager at a local grocery store).

I have always been interested in computers, despite not knowing a lot about them. I have done extremely basic fixes before (replacing RAM, etc) but other than that I'm not that knowledgeable. However, there is a local tech school that offers an information systems technology program. I have been looking at it because they offer a 2 year night pathway, and with my job that's the only way I'd be able to do it. 

The main thing that's holding me back is not knowing how well this will transfer over to me being able to get into computers as a career without actually having a degree in computer science. Here is an excerpt from their site:

""The first two semesters of this half-day program provide hands-on introduction to the inner-workings of computers. Instruction covers computer hardware, Microsoft and Linux network operating systems, directory services, cyber security, Web service, LAN/WAN technologies and messaging services. The final two semesters provide the opportunity to set-up and maintain networking devices such as routers, switches and WAN connections to share data and resources on the network. Upon successful completion, you will earn a 48-credit-hour technical certificate and be eligible to complete an associate degree or more advanced degrees at W******* University. Evening classes also are available.""

Maybe my fears are unwarranted since it says right there that you can pursue an associates degree? I don't know. I'm just torn because as much as I want to get out of this rut that I'm in (I REALLY don't want to be a manager anywhere; I'm more of a doer), I don't want to waste a bunch of time and money on this if I can't actually use it to get a job.",10Feb2020,1

536,"LTP - how to deal with a “friend” at work.

Some background. I had a friend who I was very close to when I started my job like 7 years ago. We were inseparable to the point people thought we were dating. We bonded over our similar experiences and what not. I even came out to this person. This person then  moved to another position and  totally changed. ( imagine going from sweet and joking to an icicle and just rude). When I eventually moved into a different department this person had to train me on stuff and was just so rude about it and just treated me like I was a bother. When I addressed this, this person said sorry but nothing really changed during my interactions thereafter. Anyway , later on this person moved to Europe and I really didn’t hear from her unless  I made the effort. About a year later I am also moving to Europe thru our company. At the time this persons father was diagnosed with an serious medical condition. Every time I ask questions about about their father, they would get so irate and defensive about it. Like why are you bothering to ask it’s non of your business you don’t care and you don’t understand what I’m going thru. And fair point, luckily I don’t, but I am just trying to be a friend. But what really hurt is every time I asked for help with my move, an overseas move where were wasn’t a lot of guidance from my own hr, they acted like it was such an ordeal. That for me was the last straw. If a friend needed help I would try my best. Literally -you worry too much it will work out- don’t stress- were answers I received to questions. There were so many things I later learnt out about but wasn’t told which could have saved me money and stress. I tried to be understanding but I think I’m just being taken for granted and I’m kinda done as I get older. My aunt told me recently (she is older than me but I trust her completely) that Have people in your life who treat you well and are there for you as my aunt told me. Anyway I might have to see this person at a conference. I find this out because they messaged me thru my ig and this is the first contact we’ve had in months. I tell them a bit about my new job and how I don’t like it and all they say is they are sorry. No follow up questions no offer to chat etc. I don’t want to tell them to fuck off because our office environment is super small and I don’t know if I might need a favor from them later on and it’s just better to be pleasant in the office and to minimize drama. But I just don’t want to be like nothing happened and move on. And no I’m not interested in telling them how I feel because I doubt they would understand, I would be written off as just being overly sensitive. The few times I have asked this person to think about things outside of their comfort zone I just get answers like well that’s who I am. Am I being as asshole, selfish? If so please give me your opinion as to why. Anyway Thoughts anyone?",10Feb2020,1
537,"Two years ago I moved to a new school. I didn't have any friends so I thought I'd befriend some of my new classmates. However something happened to me that made me really sad so during the first few weeks of school I was a lot quieter than usual. 

So naturally I became the ""quiet kid"" and I didn't succeed in making friends. For months I tried really hard to talk to as many people as possible and I made a few friends. 

The problem is that I don't know if they are really my friends. Sometimes I think they like me, sometimes I think I annoy them, sometimes I'm sure they like me and sometimes they just completely ignore me. I often feel like I'm their last resort like they'll only talk to me if there's nothing that's more entertaining. 

The thing that bothers me the most is that I never get invited to anything. They often hang out together but they never bother to ask if I want to join. They also have a private group on messenger that I'm not part of.  I have a huge fear of rejection so I couldn't muster up the courage in a thousand years to just straight up ask.

My partner who lives with me does night shifts occasionally, and when he is gone its absolutely terrifying for me. Every creak, every sound, immediately makes me think someone's walking up the stairs, someones opening the front door etc.


I keep my doors locked of course but once this fear comes over me I can't move, even to go and check that everything is locked. I'm frozen where I sit and can't do anything about it.

543,"I live in an apartment attached to my dad's house. He has two cats and a dog, I have three cats, a chinchilla, and a turtle. I just graduated college by paying for school out of pocket. My father had a stroke last year that impacted him physically. He's also been an at-least-a-pack-a-day smoker and a 30 rack every other day drink let for years. I know he is an alcoholic. He's been to rehab at least twice that I know of. He's gotten several DUIs in my lifetime but drinks and drives daily. I had a falling out with all of my family last year for various reasons, but they all came down to they did not support my choice to have a relationship with my father.

The past few months have taken a toll on my relationship with my father. I've had to physically pull him off of his dog when he's drunk and threatening to kill her. The dog was not hurt and my father apologized to my guest who heard it, but never to me even though I asked for an apology. Lately, he's been leaving his dog outside in the snow because she didn't do what he wanted her to do. The dog is terrified of him and listens to me just fine. While he's been drunk, he's also said some choice things to me. Including calling me a c*nt, telling me to f*ck off too many times to count, and making comments about not making any money off of me.

Yesterday, I went to talk to him about flipping ou the night prior and leaving his dog in the snow. He grabbed car keys and attempted to leave the house rather than have a conversation. He had just made food so he was not planning on leaving. I told him I would call the cops if he drove off. He has open containers in the truck he drives and does not have a valid license. He left so I called the cops. He came back and locked me out of the house, away from my animals. He baracaded himself in his living room by screwing doors shut. He slammed my foot into a doorway, crushing my foot. I was lucky enough to be wearing my duck boots so my foot is just really swollen and bruised, not broken. He then grabbed me and pushed me into the banister. 

Cops came. I couldn't press charges for him hurting me. They told me that I could get ticketed/sued for his driving because the truck is all in my name. They told me to surrender the truck back to the dealer. I have my own car and payments to deal with. 

So here is my predicament. I was offered a once in a lifetime internship I am supposed to start at the end of this month about 2000 miles away from home. It's a very competitive program and should guarentee me a job in my field at the end. It's three months long and my dad was going to watch my animals. I've given my job my notice and I had everything worked out. Ans now I don't. I know I need to get away from my father so I need to move my stuff out. I did have someone offer to take my animals and I'm looking into rehoming the dog, which breaks my heart. I just don't know of I should even still do the internship. I would come back with no place to live, not a lot or money, but I do have several part time jobs lined up to start working immediately. My friend reminded me that I wouldn't get my animals back until I could save up enough for my own place. So I'd be without them for about 5-6 months. 

TL;DR
my father is an abusive drunk I need to get away from. Should I take an internship thousands of miles away and come back to nothing or find a secure place for me and my animals and forfeit the internship?

Should I still do the internship? Or just focus on getting me and my animals somewhere safe and on our own?

544,"Throw away because reasons. Please excuse my horrible formatting and wording as I don't really post, so I am not familiar with how I am supposed to format it. I just want to get this off my chest and see if there is anything I can do to help her. If it gets too confusing then I will try to edit it and/or include more details. Also, sorry for the long post but there's a lot to be said. 

My girlfriend (24) works in a drug and alcohol rehab facility, working the overnight shift from 7pm to 7am. It is absolutely terrible there. Staff members are quitting left and right, there is rarely ever security there at night, there are overdoses happening at the facility which tells you that somehow the patients are all getting drugs there and using drugs there. Upper management is a joke, and it seems like they are purposefully not doing anything, which makes me feel like they are being unethical and super shady since the problem hasn't stopped nor has it even been dented. 

She has been working at this facility for about a year now. When she first started working there, it wasn't this bad. There were plenty of staff members, a full security team, and patients there were getting help like they were supposed to. But, as time went on, things changed for the worse. The facility is operated by a corporation, which I probably shouldn't name for legal reasons but I really do want to put them on blast, and they assign a CEO to the facility to run the place. Patients go there to get help with their drug and alcohol problems, obviously. Here's where it gets bad.

She has told me many times that there isn't enough staff members there for all the patients they have. Her facility holds hundreds and hundreds of patients, all drug addicts and alcoholics, and her night shift only has 5 staff members if they're lucky enough that no one calls out that night. This is including the techs and nurses. They have no intake people (people who do in processing for new or returning patients) at night because, for whatever reason, they just don't. But, the facility still takes in new patients and forces the nurses to do the in processing even though it isn't their job. To keep it short and to the point, she ends up doing the work of 5 or 6 people because they don't have enough staff members to delegate the jobs out. 

She has also told me that a majority of the patients go there to get treatment so that way they can leave the facility and go get a better high because their tolerance was too high. Her nurse manager doesn't even allow the nurses to call the cops on the patients, which is something they used to do when she first started there if the patients became violent or if there was a suspicion of drugs. It would set the patients straight and keep them from doing anything like that, but since the nurse manager has banned the nurses from calling the police, the patients have pretty much taken control of the facility. Overall its a really shitty situation and the place needs to be shut down to get cleaned up and there needs to be new management. 

I feel like there's a lot of shady business going on, particularly because the nurse manager seems to be letting this stuff slide way too easily. I feel like the patients are paying her off to keep her mouth shut about what's going on and to look the other way, because I can't fathom why she is letting all of this happen when she knows it's happening. It sounds ridiculous, but I just can't see why this stuff would keep happening. 

I don't know what I should do or if there's anything that I can do, but if there is I want to do it. I have thought about getting a burner phone and calling the police on the facility pretending to be a patient and telling them all about how there's people selling drugs there and using drugs there and how there's no security to control the place. I also wanted my girlfriend to take pictures of how dirty and dysfunctional the place is as hard evidence, but she is against it because she says she will get in a lot of trouble for it. So, I told her to just write down on a notebook the dates and times of anything that happens that is wrong and isn't corrected. I want to contact the state department and the corporation that operates the facility but she tells me that she and other nurses and patients have already done that and it doesn't seem like anyone cares enough to do anything about it. I want to expose the unethical shady nature of this place, and force the corporation to get new better management to turn the place around because it pisses me off that this place is meant to help people's lives become better, and yet it isn't. 

The reason I say she feels like she is stuck there is because she is actively trying to find a different job somewhere else, but no one is getting back to her. We have a 5 month old son together, and she has him under her work's insurance policy, and she is currently our primary source of income while I go to school and watch our son at home. 

I think this is everything I needed to say, though I feel like I am forgetting a few things. I will add more into it as it comes back to me. Thanks for reading.",10Feb2020,1

547,"Okay, so let me explain the story. A friend of mine and I collaborated on a homework assignment, now, we knew this particular professor was a stickler when it comes to working on assignments together, but we thought that his policy only referred to labs, these homework assignments are negligible, as they are only 5% of the grade and the lowest 2 are dropped. So, our professor grills after class one day, saying how he could refer us to the dean, because our homework were basically the same. Now, we were honest with him, we admitted to our wrongdoing, and explained how we misunderstood his policies, as the emphasis seemed to be on labs. I know that we were stupid to begin with, we really should have at least acknowledged that we worked with each other, and save some trouble. But anyway, we were in luck, because this happened within the first two weeks of the semester, so my friend and I decided to drop the class (it was add/drop week) and take the class with a different professor in the fall, we assumed that hopefully enough time will pass that most of this will be forgotten for the most part. We both got an email the other night, stated that this professor has referred us to the Director of Undergraduate Studies and has issued the grade reduction. Now, we are not concerned about the grade reduction, because we don't take the class anymore, there is going to be no record of us taking his class on our transcripts, because we left during the add/drop period. What we are concerned about is that the academic integrity case itself will still be forwarded to the Dean. Now the professor and Director of Undergraduate Studies can only issue academic penalties (grade reductions), but they cannot incur any disciplinary action, this is the Dean's job. Now we are unsure about what will happen because this is an odd case, we dropped the class, so the grade reduction isn't a concern, our concern comes from the fact that our case may still be forwarded to the dean, just because we dropped the class, doesn't mean there is no record of the case. Either way, the worst case is that we get an official warning from the Dean. Also, I assume the professor is yet to still find out that we dropped his class, because he sent the email after we dropped the class, he can't really do anything other than reduce are grade, I know he's gonna be pissed when he finds out we dropped his class before it was official, he should have waited until the two week grace period was over to so that we would have to face the grade penalty. Any tips on what to do? We are both really lost, and don't know how this is going to play out...

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Friend and I collaborated on a homework assignment. Professor found out, issued a grade penalty and referred us to the Director of Undergraduate Studies. We dropped the class, as this occurred during the two week add/drop period in the beginning of the semester.",10Feb2020,1
548,"Hey guys,

So I just transferred to a new high school and they require us to shower after gym class, at my last school we weren't required to so literally nobody saw each other naked ever. My new school has communal showers in the locker room with no curtains or dividers. I've never been naked in front of people really nor seen others naked. I'm not excited to be naked in front of everyone but I will get over it. My problem is that my period starts next week. I use tampons so showering won't be an issue. My only fear is the other girls seeing the string hanging out of me. Is that a normal thing to see in locker rooms? It seems really embarrassing, but if it's just a normal accepted seen all the time thing then I'll be okay. Also is pubic hair normal or do most girls shave it off?

Thanks!",10Feb2020,1
550,"Hey guys, here is some background information:

I am a recent college grad who moved away from home. I'm currently searching for my first job in my field, and I am a first gen college student from a house of 8 kids (I have 6 younger siblings and an older sister).

My mother is unfortunately a sworn anti-vaxer and in the state of NY the law has changed recently that bans children who aren't vaccinated from attending school. My younger sister (17) had to graduate a year early by taking summer classes, so she could avoid being affected by the new change. She is now graduated with no experience, and she missed out on getting her cosmetology license through the school. 

I want to help as much as I can, but I'm not sure what advice to give her. The area she lives in is very rural, and there aren't a ton of job opportunities available. My mother is against her going to college, and I don't think she would be able to attend without being up to date on her vaccinations. 

Unless something drastic changes with my mother, I will probably go through this process with my other younger siblings as they get older and run into the same problems.

Sorry if this was a lot, but does anyone have any advice with this?",10Feb2020,1
551,"So my friend is in a really tough class right now. He’s taking accelerated algebra two and the teacher makes the class hard as balls because she also teaches calculus. Thankfully I dropped the class near the beginning of the year but my friend wasn’t so lucky. He’s been trying to get out of the class for a while or at least schedule a lower level math next year. Well today he texted the group chat saying he was really pissed off, and i asked him what’s wrong. He said that the teacher has said that with scheduling coming up, the teacher basically threatened that if anyone tries taking a lower level math, she’ll lower their grade in the current class. Now that already sounds bad but to make things worse at least half of that class is pretty much failing it, so that’s a really fucked thing to do. And she said that she can do it because she controls scheduling. Now I’m no expert on what the boundaries are on what teachers can do, but this doesn’t sound like something that would be allowed if a principal got word of it. So Reddit, should i go up with my friends and help them speak up? Tell me your thoughts.

557,"Okay, so basically what happened is my employer directed me to solicit proposals for a project. I've done that and we engaged deeper with one organization that put in significant time and effort to come up with a proposal that met our needs.

Well, my employer just informed me we actually don't have the funding for this right now. I feel like they were essentially playing games with me and this organization to get a strong cost estimate and outline of activities before seeking funding and not being honest about these intentions.

My issue is that now I must communicate this lack of funding to this organization. This organization is a major player in my field and one of the people I was engaging with is a highly highly reputable person in the field. As a result, I do not want my reputation to be damaged because of this.

So my question is - how do I ensure this? I need to inform them of the lack of funding through the typical channel - email. Would it be poor practice to also reach out to their project lead personally to explain the situation and make it clear that I was also not aware of the funding issue? I am genuinely frustrated by this situation and upset that this project has been put on hold and do believe my company was aware of the issues before.

560,"So, 6 years ago I (28F) was taking classes to become a surgical tech and had plans to move up into a surgical assistant job with more schooling. Well... I got pregnant and guess what? Dumb ass baby daddy didn't want to help much which led me into dropping out. Fast forward to now, I am working a decent desk job, full time, great benefits and pay, weekends off, paid vacation, the whole package! Except I am so unfulfilled in this job and I really want to go back to school to do something more satisfying.

I am currently taking classes to be a medical coder and I only have 2 months left before I get my certificate. I started this course last year because I wanted better pay but since then I have received a nice raise in my current job that is at the same pay rate a coder would start out at. Today I had the realization that this is kind of pointless now because I'll just be moving from one desk job to another with the same pay, will lose all of my vacation time that I've racked up, and will be just as unsatisfied.

I am currently single and managing my household own my own with no help from baby daddy and really wanting to start classes again for surgical tech, however, there are no online classes available for this career and I cannot miss work because of... well... bills. I almost feel like I am too old to be starting something like this (crazy I know) and it's starting to frustrate me. I do have help from my family in regards to my daughter, but I can't expect them to always be there when I have classes to take.

561,"
I used to be the type that wasn’t really scared to have sex on the first date or do hookups. I got to a point recently where I realized I wanted to find something real. I started talking to my coworker. I’ve actually dated someone from my old job so it wasn’t anything that was new or wild. Anyway we’ve been going slow. No sex, just going out to get food, coffee, etc. 

This week he had me over and we were hanging out downstairs. His whole family lives at home and they kept walking by, in and out, just to get to the kitchen or another room. He was being pretty touchy, and would not stop trying to kiss. I’m pretty affectionate but even this was too much for me. It was literally like every minute he was kissing my face, my head, or trying to full on make out. I’d give in here and there but it really got to be too much. He even would lean his head on me awkwardly and just stare..like a look of him getting me to kiss him more. I started getting annoyed because I’m honestly not into all the constant making out. It was fun in high school but now I just wanted to spend time with someone. Anyway, fast forward, he gets touchy.. and I’m fine with it but his family is still up. 

He proceeds to put his hand down my pants and I kept scooting away and mentioning his family. He’s never been pushy ever and always says he wants to get to know a girl first which is why I decided to give this whole dating thing a chance. He still kept doing it and I was making it very obvious that o wasn’t comfortable. I kept crossing my legs, pushing away, stopping. He still said it was okay. Then he said it would be better to go to his room. We go up and it’s extremely awkward. The room is shared so I was scared about that too. I was still making it obvious that I was worried and not into it. 

Well we ended up having sex and it just... wasn’t right.. I felt nothing. I felt like he was just excited to get to that point and I wasn’t like I thought I was. But we did it. And I know I should have straight up stopped it but I didn’t.. it’s not his fault. But now I feel like SHIT because I told him last week I wasn’t leading him on.

I have anxiety and for some reason it's really bad right now but I'm trying to be as coherent as possible. If I leave out anything or if I'm unclear, let me know.

Background info: My dad molested me starting when I was little. I ended it, my family disowned me, I eventually moved in with a friend, she left to move in with relatives, I had a job but kept getting sick and going to the hospital,and was homeless.

I had actually found another job but someone offered me a job as an office assistant in another city. A lady at the shelter has an older uncle who owns a lot of properties and she talked to him and he said they would hire me and not charge me rent or utilities to clean up and organize and help take information and maybe payments from tenants.

They said cleaning and organizing the office would be a lot of work and would take a while but that I could live in one of his apartments rent free until I become stable. Electricity and water are included for the time being but they told me it's completely empty. No oven or refrigerator or furniture and it might need to be treated for infestation.

I said yes and they paid for me to come here. I'm so grateful. I can't believe it. But yesterday I felt kind of numb I guess just processing everything. And I'm sorry if this is tmi but last night I peed on myself while I was sleeping. This happened a few weeks ago too. I haven't done that since I was little so I don't know why it's happening now. I think it's anxiety.

I just made this move and a few stressful things happened recently.

I talked to my boss and he said he will pay me something as well but maybe not for another few weeks.

I'm happy and grateful more than I can say but I'm anxious and I don't know where to start. Where can I find furniture? Are there places that might give some away? And blankets. And a microwave. And something to cover windows with.

I was talking to mental health professionals before I left so I'll have to find some here too.

So last week Thursday I decided to ask him to be my valentine, seeing as it's leap year and everything, by giving him a pizza with a note on the inside that said, ""I know this is cheesy... but will you be my valentine?"" He gladly excepted and we continued our day. Every thing seemed fine and normal.


Then Friday I found out by a girl in his class that some of his female friends were rude, because of the fact that I asked him. This really bothered me, but I didn't see him the entire day and he didn't even text once, red flag #1. So I decided to text him Saturday and ask him about it, his only response was that nothing like that happened.


After that things just weren't the same. The chats started becoming dull and he would take up to 14 hours to respond to my texts. And today when I text him if he wanted to meet up at lunch period he said maybe, and we only ended up seeing each other for about 5 min.

Basically i have gym class with this girl and we have been friends since the start of august of last year and it has been going okay, nothing has really happened, a couple times i have been iffy about her attitude, whenever i would say something i think or whatever she would look at me in disgust and then smile and say she was joking, but deep down for some reason i think that she wasnt joking. Today in gym class i explained to her about research that i did over the weekend and ofc i told her everything i learned ( i was learning about hair i.e hair porosity, bad hair products etc..)  so i told her that the kind of shampoo is making her hair oily and she should probably switch since she has to wash her hair alot because it gets oily quickly. Her hair is straight and mine is not so ofc we are going to have different hair routines. When i was telling her about it she said “you dont know that its true, not everything that is said online is true, people have different air types..) She completely dismisses what i say, how could she possibly know what she was talking about if she hasnt done research on the topic then telling me im wrong even though thousands of people has said some things have worked for them. Another time i was kinda iffy about something is when we went to homecoming together, i got ready at her house with her sister since my other friends weren’t going. So we get there and stand around and her other group of friends come over to her and start talking. soon after, her sister finds her friends and leaves and then my friend leave with her group and im by myself. The whole time im there im sitting because she left me for her friends and her boyfriend knowing that i had no one except her. I told one of my other friends about both of these instances and she told me that years ago really big drama happened between her and my other friend.

I am a freshman in college and when I just got here I made a lot of friends. Unlike in school where I was a bit of a lone wolf since I didn't quite like anybody that much I decided to change my attitude by talking to everyone in college. I went to several parties, had dinner out every night, went to so many places and whatnot. 

The thing is I am naturally not a very trusting person. I have a bit of a checklist I have when it comes to people to see if I can trust them. The qualities I value most is honesty, loyalty, sincerity, trustworthiness and intelligence but I realise that 99% of people don't have all these traits. Hell, even I don't fully.

Now, with people I don't trust I am naturally a bit reserved and we'll spoken. Sort of like an emotionless robot. What surprised me is that many people actually liked that version of me and found it sexy or whatever. But the truth is, even I don't like that version of me. When I trust people a bit more, I let go of my guard a bit and show who I truly am a little more. And the truth is, I am pretty quirky at heart. 

When my 'friends' started noticing that they slowly but surely started to drift away from me and some even outright told me to fuck off. Really at this point I am left with only one friend. I don't even know if I can call her a friend since I am in love with her, the first person who I have ever truly falled for. While she does care for me, I don't think even she likes me that much anyway. She doesn't laugh at my jokes, finds my stories boring and me sometimes annoying. I wish we could spend more time together but at the end of the day she has 6 or 7 other friends and is quite popular.

I am somewhat popular in college but popular in the sense that I have many acquaintances who generally have a positive opinion of me but not many I would consider a friend. 

I pretend to be fine with this, I say that they don't deserve me anyway because I know I would die for the people I care about and am fiercely loyal. I say that most people are beneath me anyway but the truth is I am just incredibly lonely.

The loneliness has gotten so bad that I have started talking to myself pretending like there are people in the room. I just talk about random things that interest me. Just today I was talking about the fucking French revolution pretending like I was talking to one of my real world friends and an imaginary friend I made up a whole back story for and everything even though there was noone in the room.

It has gotten so bad that I started having 'parties' in my dorm room where I just put songs on the speaker and pretend as if my real world friend and my imaginary friend were in the room, dancing with me.

Please don't tell me to join clubs and whatnot. I am in 4 clubs, I just can't seem to get along with most people and I feel like I should just be happy with who I am and embrace that. But at the same time I just feel really sad not having atleast one person I can be fiercely loyal to and confide in and that person reciprocates that. I really don't know what to do.",10Feb2020,1

So I have lived in this apartment going on 7 months now. When I moved in, it was generally good, a few roaches here and there but what can you really expect from student living? My complex treats the house once a month for roaches. I figured my three roommates and I could try to keep things as clean as possible to deter or lessen the problem. I thought. 

Fast forward to now, I walk into my kitchen on any given day and there are food scraps on the floor. Velveeta cheese wrappers just strewn around. Ridiculous things for grown men to not clean up. 

Anyways, I have had the flu for the past few days and finally had the energy to make food for myself yesterday only to walk into a kitchen with a sink full of dishes. Also had the pleasure of stepping on someone’s jalapeño and tomato they so kindly left on the floor. 

Let me also mention that one of my roommates is generally good. He does leave a mess occasionally but it’s not so awful. Usually just a scrap on the counter or something. But he texted the main slob in the house and was met with a berating of “don’t text me unless there’s an emergency” “just put my dishes in the dishwasher” “we’ve had roaches forever they’re not going away”. 

So last night, finally being fed up, I sent my roommates a text saying I didn’t like how we were keeping things tidy and if we could have a house meeting. I said it was really weak that they can’t leave the kitchen how they’d like to find it and I was fed up. Nobody replied. 

My other roommate continues to put a bowl of raw chicken in brine inside the dish cabinets overnight. It’s disgusting and I don’t know if it’s how he was raised but I’m pretty sure that’s a risk for getting sick. I genuinely don’t know how to approach the problem. If nobody is willing to cooperate and set some house rules, what can I do? My one cleaner roommate leaves passive aggressive notes which I don’t think is very constructive. I’d really like to fix this without any conflict but I do feel like I’m in the right.",10Feb2020,1

I only know this, due to my moms drunken rants she did when I as a child.  She drank a lot, and always said “Kelly this and Kelly that. You would have loved him”.

Option 1:  Doing something I don't enjoy studying and working in, will likely be unhappy for the next 4+ years  BUT it is relatively temporary (i'll be working in the field for max 2 years), provides stability and income and allows me to permanently reside in a good country (important as I am from an unstable place). 

Option 2: No guaranteed job prospects after graduation which MIGHT make me financially and general unstable (unless my parents are able to pay for further studies), BUT allows me to explore my academic interests which is important to me as I am trying to find some direction in life. If all goes well I will also go for further study in the country of my dreams and have some valuable experiences (such as studying abroad). Although I also might have to pursue a masters in a field different from my undergrad (therefore wasting it...)

I attended close to every class in my first year but around the start of this college year, I got a job (evening shift) for some extra money.

I also don’t want to disappoint anyone who wants me to stay in the course and are happy/proud that I’m in college.

-
I once had this friend who always put me down for who I am and what I do, she always got jealous over tiny things and made me feel like I’m unworthy of being happy. These were all in my primary school years.
-
Whenever she felt down or got bullied by some people I always was there even when she did not ask for it, it came from the goodness of my heart and not just for her to like me.
-
Years passed and it was time for high school, I promised myself I would leave all my problems here and start fresh in high school and so I did...for now
The start of my first year making friends took a while but soon got the hang of it, these friends I made were so nice to me and appreciated me for who I am. As my usual self I always had the urge to get them gifts and help them whenever they needed it, I was happy in my time with them until I got a text message, it was from the primary school girl.
-
“Hey, how was your day?” She messaged to me. It was really unexpected, she did this for about a month. She ranted to me about how her day was so bad and how she missed the old days, she always said she got teased by some ex-friends of mine.
I got fed up with it so I answered with something differently “How about you transfer to my school?” Little did I know I would regret that up until now.
-
A new came around and she transferred, it was quiet at first, I made her feel welcomed and comfortable, I introduced her to my friends and made them click instantly they became close...maybe a little too close
My friends actions changed around me and I started getting avoided, I figured they were having some personal problems so I did not want to invade.
-
But what I assumed to what seemed like a temporary thing it soon later started to affect me.
These problems were about me, and the key holder to the ones who created them was her, (the primary school girl) she was making up false rumours about me influencing them to change their perspective around me, I felt lost.
-
I ignored it and just kept it to myself, I acted like nothing happened and still checked up on them. Things started to happen, someone in our group had a problem she told everyone besides me...here I am thinking that I can also be the person to talk to. 
This is when things escalated, I confronted the group about them being so secretive they acted like it was nothing.
-
This continued to be like this and I was sick of being excluded and treated as if I was not there, until they finally took matters into their own hands.
A little group meeting was held and this is when my heart shattered “I think we should split up” and this was directly thrown at me.
-
I asked why and she goes “it’s part of growing up” I was lost for words and all I could do in that moment was cry.
-
They said we will all talk still but the main thing she told me was to go make new friends. I felt betrayed and I just walked away.
-
The next day they were all laughing together in their group with the same people I was in complete shock and broke down.
-
It was the end of the school day and I was on my way to my locker until I saw my locker open, I was confused. 
-
Turns out one of the girls in their group used it to go somewhere I put my phone on top of what I thought was my books until she suddenly came and dragged her books out my phone slipped and cracked into pieces on the concrete. 
-
I was on the urge of crying and fearing the consequences from my parents but all I heard was laughter and a voice from her saying it was my fault.
-
I told my mum about it and she was furious and demanded for their number to call them I hesitated and declined she could not take no for an answer. When they answered the phone my mum went off about how they broke it and all they did was laugh, primary school girl says that it was my fault once again and explained that I should get over it.
-
The last few days of school I skipped and faked myself being sick just not to face them.
-
Coming back from break I figured that this would all be over and done with but it only got worse, the backlash and the interference with my life escalated and broke me down even more, I wanted nothing to do with them and cried for this to be over.
They continued to make fun of me and rub it in my face that I have no friends and I still cry, yet they have the nerve to tell me to go make new friends.
- 
My mum was fed up with me crying everyday and not me eating so she wanted to talk with the primary school girls mother.
-
Her mum went off at my mum for not leaving her daughter alone and told me to get over it.
-
I skipped school even more and got humiliated by them day by day. The friends who I trusted, thought they would treat me better, the friends who I provided everything for them, the friends who I thought would be with me betrayed me.
-
I am forced to go to the school therapy sessions while my mum is looking for new schools I can go to, I don’t know what to do and I just feel so alone, this probably seems so childish as for people have much worse situations then this. I just want to feel happy again I don’t want to cry anymore...

Basically, J's mom told him that KC and JC's mom has terminal cancer and is dying of terminal cancer. J, KC, JC and I are all best friends.

"" BAD IDEA ( turns out he's an asshole I ended it quick). This made the 1stguy who I actually wanted, give up on me and start talking to some girl, a week or so later they're dating... yay. 

Fast foward 2months later, 1st guy and me are at a party, his girlfriend isn't there we're a little tipsy and he pulls me away and tells me he had a big crush on me at the start of the school year. WHY WOULD U TELL ME THAT?!?! WHAT'S THE POINT?!? THAT'S JUST SELFISH. But anyway, that night we talked about the whole thing until we fell asleep... in each others arms, we basically cuddled and then something happened but, we didn't kiss or make out we just kind of touched eachother, he was incredibly cute about it he was asking me if I was okay or comfortable etc. After that we didn't even mention it, well just casually said  we remembered everything between 3am and 7am which is when all that happened. 

A month or so later there's another party, and again we cuddled and we danced and he pulled me in by the waist etc. Next day all he does is talk about his ""ex-girlfriend"" (they broke up but they still talk and they're pretty much still together) TO ME AND IN FRONT OF ME.

When she's there he completely ignores me, but ofc at a party without anyone that knows her it's all good WTF. IM SO CONFUSED AND I HATE SEEING THEM TOGETHER.

607,"  

My friend broke up with this girl in February of last year, they had a very long relationship of 5 years, we’ll call her A. He’s now been dating another girl for around 7 months, let’s call her B. I didn’t talk much to his ex until I met her at a bar some time ago, we talked a lot and I noticed we had a lot of interests in common, but since not that much time had passed since their break up I didn’t make a move.

A couple of months ago I uploaded a story to which A replied and since that moment we haven’t stopped talking on IG, we talked so much that I asked her if she wanted to get some food and she accepted. At the end of the day, she very nervously asked me about my friend, to sump it up: My friend is a bit unstable and still talks to A, telling her that he is confused, not happy with B and lot more drama. A told me that she just wanted to know the truth, but she had no intention of getting back with my friend because it makes her feel really bad, they’ve even seen each other a couple of times but she still doesn’t want to be together with him again. I asked her if she planned asking me about my friend since the very beginning to which she said no. I got home and actually didn’t expect to keep talking to her but after a while she sent me a message asking me if had arrived home safely.

We kept talking and in two separate occasions I’ve tried ghosting her, not because I’m a douche but because the situation feels really complicated, to my surprise both times she talked to me again the following day despite reading her message and not replying. I even casually suggested doing something but forgot, both of these times she subtly reminded me. I’m not gonna lie, every time I’ve met her felt better than the last one and I’ve really started liking her. A couple of friends have even told me there are clear signs that she likes me back.

I wanted to tell her how I feel a couple of days ago, this would have been the 4th time we went out. This might feel soonish, but I really don’t want to get friendzoned. The problem is I made a final test before saying anything, basically wanted to know if she felt ready to date someone again. She said she doesn’t feel ready because last week she talked with my friend, he’s still confused and says he misses, she doesn’t care about B, but she doesn’t want to get back with him no matter what, this still makes her sad her eyes got teary but she tried hiding it.

Needless to say that the courage I had built up in the week instantly vanished and I told her nothing about how I felt about her, I was expecting to feel sad, but it’s worse than I thought it’d be. One of my best friends (girl) is baffled because she is still sure she likes me back, but is now also sure she’s not ready to date anyone, so timing has really screwed me over.

The past couple of days I’ve had this idea of still confessing my feelings to her…what do you guys think I should do? I know my friend and this is all very weird, I’ve known him for 10 years and he DOES care about B so I’m not sure why she goes to A and tells her all that stuff.

I walked out of my High School for the last time In June, and whispered to myself under my breath ""well thats, that"" ever since then I have been working hard, working throughout the summer as a landscaper, prison guard, cashier, taking any job I can to save up money, only problem is... I **Do Not** know what to spend it on. I don't plan on going to college, (I have many reasons why I feel it's just not for me) since I don't plan to be a doctor,lawyer,police officer,trades. Regardless that is besides the point 

I will have $5,500 dollars come the end of this month, and I have gotten into modelling and acting which is a pretty rough industry to get into, so I signed with an agency based out of Toronto, and I felt like I should travel on my own out there to meet with them for the first time, so I'am on the fence about travelling just due to nervousness, but im sure it is something I can easily overcome once i'm on the plane and in the hotel room. (Don't worry about Legitimacy,  I have taken every precaution and searched as much as I could about them, and they have met every expectation. they are extremely professional and are willing to introduce me to a variety of people who could be of help when it comes to finding jobs regarding modelling/acting)  . Plus my family is driving me mad as of recent so they are actually sort of making it an easy choice. 

But I would only be in toronto for a week or so, and then I fly back home with 4,000 still just sitting there, I was thinking maybe travel to Japan see what the other side of the world is like, or maybe go to some Polynesian island the only conflicting thing is that, none of that is beneficial to me, sure ill be seeing the world but. They aren't going anywhere in my lifetime so I feel like I want to invest my money into myself somehow but I just don't know how and I really want to move out of my house mainly to prove to my parents that Iam independent and not a failure, as my step dad is not exactly the nicest person, because of his harsh words it has been motivating to prove him wrong such as ""You're useless, You need to be a man"" ""Put it into second gear kid, strive to do something with your life, You're disappointing, why can't you be like my sons? "" (unimportant but his son is 22 and still has yet to move out of his mom's basement and has been in University for general studies for the last 3 years) and I have big plans for my future I just don't share them with him so he thinks I just go to work and come home and he assumes im content with that, 

Thanks in advance for reading that",10Feb2020,1
614,"I need help. My dad lost his job and I am currently paying for the house by myself. I am planning to, very soon, move into an apartment with my partner and there is no room for my dad there. The problem is, there is somebody on the tenancy that shouldn't be there, they no longer live there anymore, but due to me working and this person being on benefits this could cause some issues. If my dad tried to claim any kind of help or benefits they will request to see the tenancy and they will see this person there that shouldn't be and this could stop them from receiving their own money and may also cause some kind of benefit fraud investigation. This was never planned to be the case, this person was living with me for a very short period of time. But my worry is, if I move out, my dad has nowhere to go and he cannot claim any benefits without causing humungous repercussions for someone else. What should I do? I need and want to leave and move out. But if I do I am making my dad homeless?",10Feb2020,1
615,"I'm 37 and I finally realized what my dreams are. It may sound silly but I want to be a personal trainer and eventually make my own small gym. It's the only thing I've ever felt a passion for. I feel like it would be better from a fresh start by moving to a different city/state just to clear my mind and get away from the negative things attached to being here my whole life. I'm living check to check right now with a good amount (30k, about half credit card from being unemployed for 7 months last year) of debt. 

So I'm starting from a hole, what should I focus on first and what is the most practical (I'm not naive enough to think ""quick"" or ""easy"" are options so I'm not looking for that) way to start?",10Feb2020,1

618,"I’m lost at the moment, I’m having to decide a lot of things within a very small amount of time. I’m scared, and conflicted, and just constantly anxious. 

I have A-Levels coming up. 9 academic weeks left, and I have not given my full and complete attention. And why? I have an extremely needy boyfriend. This is the part that’s tricky. 

Is it completely horrific, and terrible is I broke up with my boyfriend to study? Perhaps it will be a momentary thing, and come the June it’ll all be okay like nothing changed. Or perhaps it will finish up completely. I just don’t know. And I don’t know if I have provided enough evidence to justify this.

My boyfriend is very controlling. He likes to dictate things I can wear, he likes to point out clothes that he wouldn’t be entirely happy with me wearing. And be constantly has to talk to me. He texts me when he knows I’m studying, and this is partially my fault as I’m the one who texts back almost instantly. But I have told him on multiple occasions, pleaded with him that I need certain hours to myself but he won’t respect that. He hates all my male friends. He doesn’t trust them, he gets angry and upset if I talk to them when he’s around. He doesn’t like my friend Joe, a friend who was ironically best friends with my ex and now has a girlfriend. He has some itch about Joe, saying that he keeps doing boyfriend things for me, which is ridiculous.
And my friend Zak, he got angry at the fact that Zak was my best friend on Snapchat. Said that I blanked him the entire time whilst we watched Ice Hockey. Which wasn’t true. And he got angry when Zak and I went Mini-Golfing. 
And my friend Michael, who I invited round on Saturday night for a not so active study session. He got annoyed, and said that he didn’t understand why Michael could stay past 12 and he couldn’t. Which is once again a lie because my boyfriend has left my house at 3 am before, but is normally brought to the train station for 10:55 to make the 11:03 train. 

I dedicate all my time to my boyfriend. I enjoy seeing my other friends, but when I bring him there’s a different vibe. I haven’t been out solely with my friends for the purpose of being out with friends in months and I am getting so stir crazy about it.

My boyfriend took me from my ex, I was 15 maybe 16 at the time. He would take me to bars, and buy me drinks. Then he, and his mates would talk shit about my current boyfriend at the time, and make him look like trash. They would say that I’d be treated better by my current boyfriend.

My current boyfriend lied about getting off cigarettes 7 times. This was a personal issue, another time. He promised he’d get a job, and start losing weight, or at least go back into education to get qualifications to help him get a decent job. None of which he has achieved. 

I just feel held back. Does anyone have any advice?",10Feb2020,1
619,"My anxiety is going absolutely crazy and I can’t seem to focus on work or get anything done. 
I really can’t handle this semester of school. I need a break but it has passed the add/drop period so I’m kind of locked in at this point. Is there any way I could get the school to allow me to finish the semester from home or take it easy on me somehow?

620,"I don’t even know if we’re at the point in history where mental health is recognize as a legitimate reason someone can not perform certain tasks, but my mental health is in the toilet.

621,"I really don't want to kill myself but I think about this quite often and quite serious. I even promised to one of my few (3) friends that we will live past 21 but I did that just because I was affraid that she'll leave me behind and that I'll just blindly kill myself if that would happen, without any hesitation. I told her that I wont do anything stupid and I really don't want to die but my brain just thinks about how I will never be loved and I feel like that friend started to avoid me. It's just my brain that overthink everything and I know that she'd not push me away but I cannot focus on the good things. I sometimes think very seriously about ending my life and this just makes me more depressive. I hope that she will not read this post and if she does that I hope she'll forgive me. How to stop the suicidal thoughts? Most of the people find it hard to end their lives but I find it hard to keep going. I still have a family that loves me and some friends that would be very sorry if I'd leave. I googled some anti suicide advices but none of the suggestios seem to help.

623,"About 7-8 months ago, my bfs had broken up with me, said some hurtful things along the lines of me holding him back, not being good enough for him etc. I ended up begging for him back, and after a few relentless hours he gave in and said okay. Well even tho we were back together I still felt as though he was gone, he didn't want me, he was dating me out of pity, and agreed to only another month. Well, a week after this, I felt so alone and seeked validation by flirting and flashing a stranger online. I stopped what I was doing when I realized this wasn't me. I kept this with myself for months, without my bfs knowing. We broke up and got back together once more, back in November, that one was even worse where he Stated he didn't love me anymore and his father said he could get 100 better girls then me. Still, after a few days of radio silence I ran back and asked to try again, to which he agreed but again reluctantly. We finally have been in a good spot, but the guilt if being a cheater was on me, so I told him in order to be honest, and because things were getting more serious as he brought up marriage etc. Well he was really upset, he said he saw me as a cheater but would get over it and understands why he did it. This was almost two months ago. Things are still great still the same, but I still feel awful. So much guilt and pain for being a crappy person. I also know that I broke trust but I'm proud that I was an honest person because lying wouldn't have been it for me. I'm so upset over thinking about what I did tho, to the point where I honestly want to die. He may not have been the best bf but I should have never done that. How do I get over this guilt? He seems to have forgiven me but deep down idk?",10Feb2020,1

626,"I'm in my junior year of high school, and I really messed up here. I was going to be majoring in Computer Science, but I guess that's never gonna happen without me throwing away hundreds of thousands of dollars in tuition fees for retaking Geometry, Algebra II, Pre Calc, and Calculus. 

I was placed in a ""Geo Apps"" course in my sophomore year, which is Geometry without a regents, and watered down heavily. Well, I need to take a ""legitimate"" Geometry course before I can take Algebra II, and I was placed in Discrete Math unwittingly, and the problem is that Discrete Math takes up two years.

To sum it up, I'm screwed, and I pretty much have the status of a sophomore dropout, and considering that, I probably shouldn't even think a single college would accept me during admissions, even though I have straight As, but whatever.

 I guess I'll just work 12 hours a day, flipping burgers for $9 an hour, and getting $3 taken out of my hourly pay due to tax. I  did the calculations, it would cost $120,000 just to get my math courses done, plus an additional $200,000 to actually study CS. This is the ultimate way to be in fucking debt for 50 years, I might as well just quit while I'm ahead, and go to a coding bootcamp, and just hope that I'll get a job in IT or software.",10Feb2020,1

So the time for me to present the thesis work is over, And I have to take one more year of classes in order to get my degree.
But I’ve told everyone (parents and bf) that this month I’m going to get my degrees because they think I’ve been working on my thesis,but non is not true. 
And now I don’t know what to do. I thought of running away, or even committing suicide, because I can’t keep lying
I can’t tell them the truth because it would kill my parents and it would really hurt my boyfriend and I know he would leave if he knows I’ve been lying

632,"Odd title, and I’m sorry but I need some major advice. 

I recently closed the distance with my boyfriend and moved in with him. 
Let me tell you it is amazing finally getting to be with him, the only hiccup is his mentally disabled cousin lives with him. 
&amp; that’s not the issue before it seems like it, I guess my issue is he makes me feel uncomfortable. 
The reasoning behind this is, the week I moved in ( literally last week ) my boyfriend told him that I would be using his (my boyfriend’s) gaming monitor since we both play FPS, and that he would buy him one in a week (literally this Thursday).
Well last week on a day my boyfriend was working a little bit late, his cousin proceeds to tell me how the monitor was given to him by my boyfriend and that he would like it back because the tv he’s using to game hurts his eyes and how he was just used to playing on the monitor, and I’m just in the kitchen making dinner so I feel horrible for putting him in this situation and I tell him I’ll tell his cousin because I honestly don’t care what I play on. 
Then he continues and tells me he has no friends to play video games with, and that he wished my boyfriend and I would play more games that he enjoyed, then he went on to tell me that his cousin is a cheater in the games he plays. 
I ended up telling my boyfriend everything except for the fact I feel uncomfortable because I don’t want to seem dramatic. 
But it’s really bugging me because when I got here my boyfriend wanted me to go grocery shopping to buy myself snacks and I ended up buying his cousin things because he wanted them and then he makes me feel like I’m a nuisance for using a monitor my boyfriend told me to use. 

And I know maybe I’m being over dramatic but it really makes me uncomfortable because I didn’t make any decisions regarding this stuff.",10Feb2020,1

639,"tl;dr: my boss is saying sexual harassing things at work. I called him out on it. Now I may be being punished by not giving opportunities to grow within the company like all my other (new) coworkers are. 

I’m a very blunt female and when at work I don’t like to beat around the bush about topics. I’m very direct and to the point, no reason to fluff anything, though I am sensitive to certain topics and how to approach them I’m not shy about talking about what needs to be addressed. This sometimes makes me seem insensitive, asshole-ish, and uncaring. I’m viewed as the class clown, because I joke around a lot. Call me Big Personality. 

I have 2 new managers who have never been at this manager level and have certainly never managed people like me before. I’ve been butting heads a lot with my managers, but my male manager specifically. 

It started when he first arrived and I was training him on some safety protocols. Someone told him in order to get along with me he should joke around, because I’m a pretty light hearted let’s have some fun while we work type of person. He started to make some jokes about serious topics that could result in death if not followed correctly. I had to ask him to stop several times and take this training seriously before he actually stopped and took me seriously. This happened several times before I had to go to our manager and say it made me uncomfortable and that i thought he didn’t respect me. That type of joking stopped, until one day he started joking about giving me the Heimlich as i coughed while eating a cracker. I immediately said “do not touch me. Stop.” I hate people touching me, I don’t even hug people. Ever. But he kept going on and saying things like “it’s not very feminist of you to say I can’t save your life. That’s not equality. If you were such a good feminist you’d let me save your life.” Even though I asked him to stop he wouldn’t, until I said “you sound like a rapist. It’s not about what you the giver want, it’s what I the receiver don’t want, and I don’t want you to touch me.” 

See. Very blunt. Especially when made uncomfortable. Which made him VERY uncomfortable. 

That shut him up, for a while. And honestly my boss kept him in place. Until she left and he got promoted to her position. 

Then he started making REALLY inappropriate comments about men. He’s married and has kids and by all accounts is straight. But almost every day he would comment on the men we work with saying things like 
“I saw someone check you out today. He’s new and hot, you should talk to him.” (Because I’m single)
“Oh, you mean Hot Stan?”
“Ooooh! A new guy. He looks hot! He’s totally my type!”
“You’re gonna have a lot of hot guys around work today!”
Every time he said these things I would immediately show disgust and ask ask him to stop, other people would laugh. But because I joke around a lot and he and i have a strained relationship, it wasn’t taken seriously. I started to ask his assistant manager (female) about why he’s so obsessed with men lately and she snapped “STOP BEING SO MEAN TO HIM!” I was flabbergasted and shut up. I’m not being mean, I’m trying to process his shitty behavior. 

 I finally sat both of my managers down in the office and told them that these comments made me uncomfortable and for him to stop. His replies were very defensive:
“In my 20 years in this industry you’re the only person to ever say this.”
“I have a wife, a daughter, and a sister, I’m not this person you’re making me out to be.”
“You say really gross and inappropriate things all the time.” (When asked what those were he said periods and bras, i don’t talk about those things, but others around me do, it’s a heavy female populated job)
“Do you even respect me?! I feel like you don’t even respect me.”
“People look up to you too, even if you’re not a manager, so you need to watch what you’re saying.”
Again I had to say “I feel like you’re deflecting.”
He said “I’m not deflecting, I’m trying to relate to you.”
So I had to be more blunt “I feel like I’m constantly asking you to stop saying things that are inappropriate and you never do, you keep going. This is me asking you to stop. It’s not appropriate. You’re a manager. I’m uncomfortable. Stop.”

And they did. He stopped. I didn’t go to HR because I’m known as the “social justice warrior” when it comes to certain issues and topics. Mostly asking people around the office to stop saying rape jokes, or to stop making fun of people with disabilities, or that our office/city/state lacks A LOT of diversity from what I’m used to. 
I worried that reporting would get him fired, not my intention (and honestly we can’t go through more people leaving) it was just to get the behavior to stop (it did). And i was worried people around the office would view me as some social justice warrior bitch ready to take down anyone who isn’t PC.

Now my other boss has NEVER been a manager before (I have 6 years accumulated manager experience at various companies under my belt) and she doesn’t understand yet how to balance professional and friend relationships. I was eating a holiday cookie and some crumbs fell onto my shirt while talking to her, I didn’t notice and she pointed it out, I was very in the middle of my story and eating my cookie, so I half heartedly started brushing it off my stomach, she reached out and started brushing the crumbs off my breasts, without hesitation or asking. I had to be like “woah, stop.” And she seriously had a deer in the headlights “oh yeah I shouldn’t do that” moment, but people around the office joke about this stuff all the time. So, no biggie. Again, I don’t like to be touched by people. She “jokingly” did it again to another girl and nobody seems to care but me. She’s been known, before her promotion, to rub her breasts on people “jokingly” and she’s kissed me at a party while drunk, because i was kissing another girl and she wanted to join (she wasn’t supposed to be at the party because she was a manager at that point and fraternization is against the rules). Again, worried if I say anything people will get fired, our team will be doomed, I will be labeled the office snitch/bitch, and I’ll ruin lives. 

I am seeing my co-workers (who are less experienced than me) get multiple opportunities to grow, obtain extra responsibilities, and are being groomed for promotion. These things are not being offered to me, even though I’ve been asking about it for months. My managers don’t even approach about me things, they immediately go to the less experienced people trying to groom them over me, I assume because I’m “challenging” them. I am worried that my conflict with my managers is causing some retaliation, but I have no way to prove it or know if that’s actually happening or if I’m being paranoid. I have a review coming up and I’m having trouble figuring out how to not sound like an asshole as I ask them why they’re overlooking me. 

I talked to our GM about all of this and told him I’m worried about retaliation. He said he would have a conversation about our 0 tolerance for retaliation policy, and to keep him in the loop. 

So, I am at a loss and honestly ready to leave the job, but it’s not easy for me to find new work in this field and I’d like to stay at the job I love, just fix my managers. 

And advice would be helpful!",10Feb2020,1

641,"I finally had my last day out

As you can see through my history, I’m sixteen years girl and i was given a month a few weeks ago because of cancer. 

Today was my last day out.
I was in the hospital for a long time, so I didn't know what was out there to lose my sense of the weather. So I wanted to spend my day as an ordinary person today.

So, i wore a wig, got up from a wheelchair (relied on a cane) and used public transportation.

It was hard to bear the pain for up to two hours. But the smell of fresh air made me feel good. (In fact, the chemical smell of the mask was mixed, so it was not completely refreshing air. lol)  
When I arrived, my boyfriend who met me after nearly 50 days welcomed me. An indescribable feeling was overwhelming. Hehe

&amp;#x200B;

1. 

First of all, we went to his home. We decided to watch a movie yesterday, but we went to his house first because we had a lot of time to go to the movie. And spent time with his cat. How cute! I literally wanted to upload the pictures but i realised that there’s no function to upload pictures in this subreddit. kk I'll upload 'em r/cats i guess and you guys should see this 

.

2.

Thanks to his mother, the way to the cinema was smooth.

And e finally watched a movie. But the problem started here. There was a tremendous pain because the tube injected with painkillers was slightly pressed... the fk. The pain prevented me from focusing on the movie at all. There was more terrible pain than the pain I felt when I pulled out my nail without anesthesia. I vomit enough blood to soak several tissues, but the pain did not stop. My boyfriend patted me by the side and helped me well, and later on, I could concentrate on the movie. Nevertheless, I'm still not sure what the movie is about. lol

.

3.

After the movie, we strolled around the park to reach his house. We talked about stories: such as the lack of future together, the fear of death, the pain of illness, the longing of everyday life. And we did what ordinary couples could do, such as holding each other's hands or folding their arms or hug...(it's pretty shy to say myself lol) Like an ""ordinary"" person. It was a pity that I lacked one hand because of the cane. 

.

4.

Back to his house, we played with the cat and left a video to last out memories with an expectation that someone would watch this video and miss me. And we exchanged letters with each other's symbols and just cried. a lot. I still don't want to die, but an uplifting feeling-the fear of dying soon, the need to leave my loved ones, and the sadness of the person in front of me etc-overlapped with tears. And we promised to see each other next life.

.

5.

We left his house because of the time limit back to the hospital. And i also said goodbye his cat. i'll miss her so much. And my boyfriend kindly guided me close to the hospital! how kind of him &lt;3 It's too sad to leave such a good person. Where we broke up, we cried a lot again. It's really the last now. It's really over. Such thoughts.

.

6.

So, I'm a hospital again. As always, I am now in a hospital uniform with the hospital meal. But it still feels like his cat's hair is on my clothes and he's hugging me. The futon seems to smell his. I will miss today so much. maybe i'll be happy thinking about this day until I die. hehe

And sadly, because of the age or health conditions or etc, there’s so lottttssssss of advice I couldn’t make it real. I’m so sorry about that. Even just walking was hard things for me! But thank you xoxo have a lovely day!",10Feb2020,1
642,"I have a friend and they are amazing. I love them but often when I tell them about any issues we are having they turn it onto me and I end up feeling like shit. Sometimes it makes sense but there are times when they end up convincing me it was my mistake. I don't think they do it intentionally, they actually listen a lot of times too but I'm really torn about this. I don't wanna lose them but I am worried too.",10Feb2020,1
643,"It has been a very hard year for me and my wife. In April, our son was born almost three months early. He was in the NICU for almost two months. That, by itself, would have made everything tough. Unfortunately, the following has also taken place. I’m having difficulty reconciling the person that my mother has been compared to who I thought she was. 

In August, Wife and I went to the beach with my mother, stepfather, and stepsister. I had work so I left with plans to come back and Wife stayed for an additional day/night. 

The night that I left, wife told me that my mother fell asleep holding son. In addition, we had strict rules about showering (after applying sun screen) before holding the baby because his skin was so sensitive. My mother was holding the baby and when asked if showered, said she washed really well instead. I talked to my stepsister and she confirmed that my mother did fall asleep holding him. Wife came home that night and we decided we needed to address some stuff lol. 

The night before we planned to return (together), Wife called my mom to explain that we just wanted her to be more careful with falling asleep and if she’s tired to pass him off. She also brought up that wanted people to shower before holding the baby. She also brought up that if she needed any help, she would ask (because my mother would continually ask to help). My mother at first denied falling asleep, which is when my wife brought up that my stepsister mentioned that one of her friend’s baby got hurt from someone falling asleep while holding the baby. 

My stepsister called me and explained my mother freaked out, was crying in her room, and kicked her out of the room. I explained we didn’t say anything about her (huge mistake obviously since we did) but I wasn’t thinking straight due to the last four months we went through. 

Due to the reaction of my mother, my wife was upset and texted her saying we would not be coming back down the shore. My mother tried to call to talk but my wife said she didn’t want to talk and hung up. 

Looking back, we could have handled everything better, but we had gone through hell and back and were crazy new parents. 

This led to my mother calling me the next day, explaining that my stepsister told her that my wife had told my step sister that she (my wife) thinks my mom makes things about herself and that she felt like my mother was critical of her as a parent. I guess this was said during the day when I was away. 

My mother then gave me a verbal list of five years of issues she has had with my wife, attacked her as being mean, attacked her as saying she was turning me against my family, and saying I had a rough road ahead with her. She also brought up that my dad would fall asleep with me (I guess to make it less of a big deal). She brought up instances of my wife “being mean to her” such as not liking her posts on Facebook and not talking to her at all (supposedly) on our wedding day. 

Due to the fact that my new-mother wife was attacked, the next two months involved arguing conversations with my mother, and not seeing her. Due to everything that had happened, I didn’t want to see her. 

After that time, the two apologized to each other. We saw each other several times with no issues. I thought all was well. 

While all this happened, it became clear that my mother was telling many members of our family members what happened, but obviously only her side. We saw everyone on thanksgiving. The next day, my mother called me to tell me that she felt like kelly was avoiding her and keeping her away from our son. I spoke to a family member and they admitted it seemed like that, but also understood that it’s natural for my wife not to want to be right next to my mother after everything that occurred. To be honest, I don’t blame my wife for not wanting to spend much time with my mother. 

After this conversation, my mother and I did not speak for about 3 weeks. I texted her and her husband on their anniversary at the beginning of December, reached out later in the month, went to a large family party hosted by her around the holidays, took her out for her birthday (When we went out for her birthday, our son put her necklace in his mouth while she held him. When my wife said something my mom explained “I washed t before we came.”  It was another instance where I felt like responsibility for something we requested wasn’t taken.) and reached out on NYE and Christmas Day. 

When I have spoken to her since everything in AuGust, there have been constant guilt-tripping, manipulative statements made, ranging from “you used you son as a pawn against me” to “you were my beat friend and I’ve lost that” to “I almost drank again (she doesn’t drink) because of all this, to “I wanted to slit my throat during this time.”

Since NYE, I haven’t heard from her until today, when we received four books for our son for Valentines Day. Two were “regular” Valentines Day books, one was “I love my Grandma” and one was “I’ll love you where ever you are.”

Based upon the inability to take responsibility when my wife or I have a concern, I don’t feel comfortable with her being with our child in a one-on-one setting. More so, I don’t feel comfortable knowing the emotionally manipulative things she’s said. 

More than that, however, is the difficulty in understanding that someone I thought I knew so well could act as she has. I don’t see things ever being “normal” (in the sense of not being strained) again, and I don’t know if I even want them to after everything. 

Any advice is welcome.",10Feb2020,1
644,"I live in apartment complex and my upstairs neighbor boyfriend goes outside to smoke and cigarette. every time, he walks outside to smoke he urinates on a bush near my apartment. I caught him about 7x on my ring doorbell. How do I address the situation and not have it be awkward ?",10Feb2020,1
645,"I was always the smart guy as a kid, the one with the good grades, the best one out of the group, and that helped tame my anxiety. But it also helped to fuel it at the same time. Always having to keep up with expectations was brutal for me, made everything too stress and anxiety inducing. I always felt like I was tricking everyone into believing I was someone that is not me, and I felt like I was in a cage.

Funny thing is, I didn't even have to try.... got the max grades from elementary all the way to middle school, always the teacher's favorite, had tons of friends... all of that with no effort. I kinda felt bad... some people worked their ass off and couldn't even reach half of what I could do with a lot less work.

That's not to brag tho... In fact, it's the opposite. Enter high school: I soon learned that hard work beats natural talent. By a long shot. It actually didn't start off too bad, I was still one of he class top students for the first 2 years with no effort. Sure, I had a very average score compared to the school's best, but it was far from bad. But it could have been better. Still, one of the class' best with no effort, so I couldn't complain

The third year is where shit started to hit the fan. I don't think I ever had as many hormonal storms in my body. I became full of hatred, towards my shitty small town that I can't wait to get out of, towards all my friends that seemed to have moved on from me \[I can't blame them, I often treated them like nuisances\], and at the fact that I couldn't find anyone with my same interests. I felt so restricted in this stupid town, where everyone knows everyone, I still had to live up to what people expected of me, and couldn't afford to make any mistake otherwise the whole town would spread rumors. Not to mention, this is where I started to have a lot of crush-problems: I liked girls to the point of obsession, and that wasn't healthy at all. It didn't let me concentrate on anything, and has led to a lot of tears \[due to the fact that I either ended up hating the girl for not being who I thought she was, or because I was too scared to even talk to one of them\]

I became quite rebellious during this time. Started listening to really heavy music, wearing all black, torn off jeans, grew my hair long, started being more scruffy in general, anarchistic ideals started to seep in, I became so pessimistic to the point where I thought I failed in life, and nothing would ever go well for me. My grades started to drop even more than my morale, I was quite depressed. Eventually got to a decent score at the end of the year, so I didnt have to do any summer studies thank god. That would have been the end of me. My intellect didnt get me the whole way anymore, now I actually had to put effort into studying... which was hard since 1. I've never done it, and 2. I was even considering taking my life on some days unfortunately. I felt like a total outcast loser

The forth year started off quite nicely. I was happier in general, but still retained a lot of things that I developed in my depression phase, even positive ones like my passion for guitar. I even learned how to play it during this year. I still had crush problems that didn't let me concentrate on many things, and I was super self conscious about my social life, and my seasonal depression still came back in winter during my birthday, but all in all, pretty good year compared to the previous one. School grades were a bit better but not by much

This year though... It started off pretty badly. Its my graduation year, so I'll have to do a super hard exam, and thats already pretty bad. But nevermind that, my parents got into a huge near divorce fight that lasted for months, and those were long months of psychological terror and that destroyed me for a while. But my mom woke the desire to do better in me once again, so now my objective is to finish school and move out of this crappy town and go to uni in another country and finally be free. But the whole divorce situation made my grades drop once again. I started to skip school a lot, and I mean a lot. And the worst thing is, I dont even care. With so much shit I had to endure, teachers yelling at me just isn't doing it anymore. And I can't help but not caring about my dad being mad at me for school when he did so much shit that its hard to take him seriously anymore when he tried to be morally just with me \[I dont blame him tho, he was also severely depressed, and it comes from very similar feelings.. of not being good enough. I still had to live through terror when he was trying to use me to get back at my mom who was away in the meantime, but I kinda understand, as much as I hated him back then\] 

So yeah, now the parents situation is fine but... Im not. and I havent been for a while, and I don't know how to do anything besides watching shows on netflix, watching yt videos, skipping class, not doing homework, feeling bad then ranting on the internet. Even tho my confidence is higher than ever, Im not as shy or anxious when it comes to a lot of things... I'm still not able to fight back... I really need an evaluation on this whole thing, it'd be much appreciated. And sorry for the huge rant, props to you if you read it all the way through",10Feb2020,1
646,"so here's what happens.

this started more than a year ago

I have this idea for a manga (anime comic) that I'm trying to create. have everything planned out

hire a Filipino artist. (he's legit) to do a chapter for $300

pay $150 down

sends me wips (shows progress)

has a family emergency. manga gets delayed

has to pay hospital bills. asks for another $100 to help out. (250/300)

earthquake hits (can verify) computer gets damaged (tablet survives). still has to pay hospital bill so no money to fix computer

don't hear from him for 8 months

volcano erupts (can verify) evacuated and in a shelter

\*\*\*

so I found a different Filipino artist that will work for cheap.

here's the problems:

1. I like the original guy's art style much better and it suites my story better
2. the art style has to stay consistent. so if I choose the new guy id be losing $250. and if the old one comes back, and is ready to work I would have wasted money on the new one
3. the old guy will eventually have to follow through as he most likely can't come up with $250

so what should I do? this seems like a 1 in the hand is worth 2 in the bush dilemma except I can't access the 1 in the hand for an unspecified amount of time and I can get burned if I go for the ones in the bush.

I really want to get this manga out. I need to hire artists from 3rd world countries cause I can't afford artists in 1st world countries. (artists in 1st wold charge at least $150 a page meanwhile the Filipino artists charge $15 a page). I work at a minimum wage job and am starting college next year so I won't be able to get a 1st world one for a while.

so what do I do?",10Feb2020,1

653,"My mom is constantly coming home talking about the people of her job. That’s normal, she’s a nurse and she takes care of a lot of rude ass people in icu who are morbidly obese. (I’m not fat shaming. That’s why they are there. Besides. I’m pretty chunky. But I’m only 180 which is important to know for later.) the annoying thing my mom has been doing lately is coming home and comparing me to them. Telling me that she doesn’t want me to be like them and she doesn’t want me to end up morbidly obese because I never do anything. (She’s fairly right. I don’t do a lot. I’ve been confined to my home because I’m doing online school after I lost my friends irl and since we moved to a new state. So I’ve been pretty lonely and I have no reason to leave my house. That’s why I’m trying to get a job yet since it’s a small town I never usually hear back. Even if they are hiring.) but it’s frustrating because she them makes comments about my weight. Saying that I’m already pretty chunky and she’s “worried about me” and she wants me to start going on walks. So I did. I went on a walk. It was great! And then she got mad at me because I “walked to far from home.” (I walked .9 miles and back. How is that too far?) So I stopped going on walks and now she harasses me about my room. Telling me I “always have dishes” and I “always have so much clutter.” Now I admit. I have quite a few nick nacks like pop figures and vinyl figures and cute little things, so the top of stuff does look cluttered. But I don’t have dishes and shit. My mom fucking blamed me for a cup that wasn’t even fucking mine. And she’s sitting here telling me “you had three bowls and a cup” and pressing me about how many dishes I brought out. Mind you I brought out a single bowl and cup and rinsed them. Besides that. My room is fairly clean. I do have some things (from yesterday) that I can put away like clothes and some drawing stuff. But she just wouldn’t stop. Constantly repeating herself about how I need to clean my room and then constantly repeating herself about the obese lady at work and how she doesn’t want me to be like that. She kept constantly repeating herself about someone in our family that is pretty big and super lazy. It’s like when she comes home I’m suddenly some major target as being lazy and dirty. Even though I do my school and I constantly apply for jobs. She’s making me feel insane. I feel like I’m on the verge of getting an eating disorder, which is fucking absurd because I already have a hard time eating lunch and breakfast without forcing myself. To be honest I feel like I’m ready to end myself. It’s like the stuff I do means nothing to her because she “never sees” when I clean the house and do school or apply for jobs. I feel fucking worthless. I can’t ever tell her this because she makes it out to be that I’m just dramatic and I’m a liar. (Like the time that she saw me with a resting bitch face once at a family’s wedding and then without warning at the end of the week when we were leaving she was telling me I’ve been rude the whole time and I’ve been grumpy the whole time telling me that I’m doing things that I’m not. She even fucking hit me over it and my dad did nothing. She made me feel like I was crazy for defending myself. And when I cried out from her about to hit me again she got mad because people were coming down the stairs and she didn’t want them to hear me. (She doesn’t normally hit me though. I have a lot of problems when people raise their hands near me.) but I digress.) sorry this was so long. There’s so much to unpack about my mom.",10Feb2020,1
654,"So my boss hired a 17 year old kid to work in our on site restaurant. We serve wine and occasionally beer. 

This kid, is the kid of another manager that manages a separate area. 

Pretty sure he was only hired because of who the mom is and the relationship that exists between my manager and the (mom) manager. 

The kids schedule is not beneficial to business needs nor can he serve the alcohol. Can he even legally be employed as a server? 

In our state you have to be 18 for beer and 21 for the hard stuff if I’m not mistaken. 

Being that I am the kids manager, would this fall back on me? I had no part in the hiring (I usually do) but this one was done being my back and as a “surprise”.

655,"Hi!

At this point of time, I have no idea how to deal with this kind of situation. Any kind of Advice would be really helpful. Sorry for the long post and thank you.

I'm a second year medical student, few months back, I met a senior for a research assignment related help. One or two meeting afterwards, he starts getting personal and asks me out on a date. I don't (like an idiot, I am) straightforwardly tell him no and kept being nice to him because I felt like I owed him for the help he had extended to me. Things accelerate and he's all over the place and pressurizing me into a relationship. After telling him off on several occasions, i decided to tell him, with all the much needed bitch power I can muster from within myself that i am not interested in a relationship and i really need to focus on my studies. On hearing this, He sprouts some nonsense and derogatory shit and I don't know where this guy generated such a good amount of god complex and to that I tell him, that I'm really done with him. Since then, he has been blowing up my phone every single day, my socials and after blocking him from everywhere I possibly can, has started emailing me from various emails and following me around college confessing his love for me (who taught him this meaning of love?)

At this point of time, I'm really stressed, anxious, fed-up and really stuck. I cannot tell my parents because they aren't open to these topics at all and the college administration is downright oppressive and as unhelpful and uncooperative as a broken, sideways moving shopping trolley.

658,"(21M) This post may be long and scattered but Im trying to explain alot. So yesterday i was in the car with my girlfriend (21) and we are on our way back to our college town (4 hours). I had been at a conference for work all week and we went to her hometown the day after my conference (this is like 5 hours away) where she tended to her mother as she was taking care for her dying father (my GFs grandfather). So on our way back from her hometown, she is quiet the whole time because she is in her head about seeing her grandfather for the last time. I try to console her for a couple of days but for some reason when we are in the car, i feel a lack of empathy which is not normal for me. Usually i am very empathetic toward people and I try to provide life advice and care for people who aren't feeling the best. About an hour into the ride i begin to disassociate and i cant respond to anything my GF is saying. After awhile i hit myself in the head and burn myself with a cigarette and she notices and tells me to stop. She is aware i am hurting myself on purpose but we both kind of brush it off and i am telling myself to stop. After awhile we start talking and we plan to get food because i have purposely not eaten this day. I may have an eating disorder but idk. I just hate eating because i think ill be more unattractive if i eat. My girlfriend eats her food as we are driving down the road. I let mine get cold and after about an hour, i get it out and i look at the food. It makes me so angry that i crush it up without taking a bite and I throw in into a bag to throw away. My girlfriend becomes irritated but at this point i feel like i have no control over my actions. Everything is being controlled by emotion and all logic is gone. I begin to plan ways of jumping out of the car and i tell myself things will be better if i just get it over with and kill myself. I am caught up in this headspace and i disassociate again for about 30 mins. i break out of it once and i go from a blank face to balling my eyes out within seconds. Quickly after i dry up my tears and smile and then go back into that disassociation. Some conversation happens between the two of us and it is apparent that both of us are ready to be out of this car. Soon after, something happens and my brain snaps and i start beating the hell out of my face with my fist over and over again. My girlfriend begins to scream in my ear about how bad that was to do. She says ""do you want me to crash this car and kill us both"" ""i think about hurting myself alot but i dont do it."" This causes me to close off very quickly and i begin to shake. I was diagnosed with PTSD and i was triggered by that screaming and my brain told me I was about to be hit very hard by my girlfriend due to past relationships. She would never do this. She is very supportive. We didnt really talk about it much afterwards because i closed off and I couldnt let her touch me. This causes her to feel alone in this time of pain due to her family member passing away and it makes me feel like a fucked up crazy person because i couldnt stop what happened even though the person i care about is going through alot and she doesnt need this in her life. My brain is telling me to just run away from it all and that will allow her to have a better life but im not sure. I feel like i need help because this sounds like something a crazy person would do. I just had this episode of self hatred and i couldnt stop from hurting myself even though it was in front of another person and in a car which is a bad place to do that. Any opinions on this situation? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Again sorry for the scattered thoughts. I'm still alittle shaken up from yesterday.

660,"First, sorry for my english.

I had a group of friends with who I was doing some ""artistic work"" in my country.

One of them was a little famous. He was the leader of the group, no one should ever contradict him, he often said racists things, was homophobic, holded opinions on women close of what incels have,  gaslighted me often. I know I should have known better, but he was famous and celebrated so I often though that it was me who misinterpreted things or was wrong.

I, myself, became a little succefull at that time so his bullying of me got worse. At the same time somme of my work was picked by some peoples who got violent physicaly. (It actually was by a girl I knew from high school, who was popular back then and despised me, who was not.) I got very insecure and asked myself if I was wrong, and if I've done any harm with my work and the people who picked me where right.My friends at the time assured me I was not.

One day I had enought of my famous friend treating me like shit. After an evening where he told me I was ""poor, fat, and soon 35 so no men would whant me and since I had sex on the first night I should be a prostitute to at least make money"" I told him to fuck off and that ended our friendship.

My other friends took his side because, since he was succefull he could got them work and I couldn't (It wasn't by friendship for him since they were gossiping in his back like crazy) so I lost them.

I tried to continue my work but the violents one started to show where I was and I learned later (by them actually) that it was my old friends who gived them where I was. My olds friends where hated by them all the same by they where doing that to apease them.

I stopped what I was doing, today I think about delating anything I've done. Sometime I have panic attack and look to all that I've done or review all the people I've spoke to and feel ashamed of all the mistake I've made and think the violent one where right and I was, indeed a bad person.

During that time My old friend/bully is triving and seen has a hero. Even when I whant to ignore him I sometime see him. I have nothing to prove is wrong doing and I'm often scared that he has things on me.

663,"Grocery/customer service worker. 

Backstory: When I started I was happy and excited to be employed, and tried to be genuinely friendly and nice as I went about my business. Over time I got a little scared and weirded out by the attention I attracted. One coworker insisted that I was flirting with EVERYONE, flirting hard. Around that time I'd learned how to do my job and wasn't terrified of making mistakes anymore. I got bored with work and actively cut back on my 'flirty' behaviors (smiling at people unprompted, making light conversation).   
Now I'm suffering from resting bored face because I'm not 'engaged' with my environment and it's impacting how the managers perceive me. I look lazy or sullen now that I'm not 'flirting' with customers. I tried to be friendly again and I'm getting all the unwanted attention back from customers, like I'm accidentally flirting again. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't even know these people's names! These are only superficial interactions to me!

665,"Hey Reddit, I really hope you can work your magic and help me out. I’m desperate for any advice so all is welcome.

To start, I’ve been diagnosed with PTSD, Depression, Major Anxiety, BPD, and ADHD. I’ve gone to probably up to 20 doctors and psychiatrists and none of them believe my story of having such severe past traumas. I’ve been hospitalized twice and even they denied me help. I wont go into detail but I can sincerely say no one should have to go through what I have. Everyone is convinced my mental health is being faked and therefore, I’m unable to get any help. It’s gone untreated to a point where I struggle on a daily basis in every aspect. My family is out of the picture and I have no friends, my only support is my boyfriend but there’s very little he can do. 

Friends of Reddit, what do I do? Thank you so much in advance. Every response is greatly appreciated.",10Feb2020,1

670,"I dunno how to explain it. I just feel like they all think I'm annoying.  


For context, I've dealt with this kind of thing a lot. Always the same grind- I meet someone, we become really good friends, we talk often, with topics ranging from memes to the meaning of life, and it's always awesome. Then we go from talking every day, to almost every day, to once a week, to once a month.... and then they're just gone. Within a few months, they've moved on. I guess I'm used to that part by now. 

But this time its different. This time, it lasted five years. And these guys are the best friends I've ever had. I love them like they are family. But I've started to notice the pattern again. It already made it to the point where we only talk once and a while. And I'm terrified. I don't think I can find more friends if these guys move on at this point, because I'm anti-social and have a general mistrust of people, and all the other friends I've had were either luck or they approached me.   I really want them to stay, to convince them that I'm still worth being friends with and that I'm still worthy of love. But I feel like every time I message them or talk to them in person, I just annoy them. 

I would do anything for my friends, but I don't think I can live without them.

671,"Ok, so, I'm 14 and I have a boyfriend, he is also 14. Before you say that this age is too young for this or whatever, I know it is, but this really bothers me.

We've been together for almost two months now so it's pretty new. We are not very close with each other if I compare it to other relationships. We said that we will get better at this over time. We are still pretty young and that we are learning and stuff.

The problem is that I'm scared I will do something wrong. I don't know what but something. I don't know him well enough to say this but I feel like he is pretty sensitive when it comes to his emotions and I'm scared I will hurt him.

For example today I was scrolling through my phone and saw a picture of him. I literally stared at it for like 5 mins. I just couldn't stop thinking about what I could accidentally do to make him upset, I think I even started to cry a little. I was really confused because this never happened before. I mean I really don't want to hurt his feelings and I don't trust myself, I feel like any other thing I will say will hurt him.

Don't get me wrong, he is not a person that cries or gets upset over little things. He is not that fragile, but I still worry about me hurting him.

I know this is not healthy for anyone so is there a way to stop thinking about this?",10Feb2020,1
672,"I know on an conscious way about my psychological issues, what some of them might have steemed from and etc, but recently something happened that I am equal parts unable to know why while ""knowing why"".

Few days ago I washed by hand(and very throughly) a shirt I was thinking of bringing to a trip.But then I wasn't able to find it when I was looking for it, until I saw that my father was wearing it.Now, this shirt **used** to be his but it's been mine for a while, and apparently of what I understood my mother instead of asking who's shirt was that she just assumed it was my father's even thogh it hasn't been his for a long time.
My father sweats a lot, so by the time I found out he was wearing it, the shirt wasn't as clean and smelling good like when I left it to dry.

**I.Was.Pissed.**

I spent some time cleaning it while I was takig a shower, I gave my all and in the end I couldn't even enjoy it.Now I'm refusing to go on the trip unless my mother makes the shirt as clean and smelling as good as when I washed it, anything less and I won't accept the shirt, and I **HAVE** to bring this shirt or else I'll stay home.
Of course this created a lot of fights and discussions because I want my shirt to be in the same(or better) state as when I washed it, and my mother thought that putting it to wash with the other clothes was enough(*it wasn't).

Here are some points why this bothers me so much.

1.I don't know per se what issues during my raising might have developed this, but when I give my all to something I hate when others interfere in any way, and I already have an issue with something being ""incomplete"".Such as ""*I cleaned the shirt as best as I could with my own hands, I gave my all for it, and in the end couldn't even enjoy wearing it clean after my hard work*"".I already hate when someone even starts to say something but doesn't finish saying their thoughts.

2.It's not usual for me to give 100% on anything, usually I give at most 50%, so I would like to be able to enjoy and remember the moments I do give 100% as happy moments, but now this memory is ruined by this petty fight.

3.My mother must have a problem with admiting she doesn't remember which clothes belongg to who, because while she has a mouth she never uses it to ask what is from who.And it pisses me off because I ""lost"" a lot of clothes that ended up going to my sister because of this.Damn woman, you have a mouth to ask, why is it so hard to admit that you just don't remember or don't know?

Now I am here, unwilling to wash again the shirt(*because honestly, this entire thing only taught me how futile it is to try to give your all, because in the end you will be screwed or no one will care about it, so why bother doing it?*), my mother does not want to wash only this shirt(I get why in a conscious way, but unconsciously I am too pissed to care for the reasons), and I refuse to teavel without this shirt.
I don't know if I'm trying to say something to my family with this temper thantrum, or if I just haven't developed a healthy way to deal/cope with these small issues, as I do know I feel my emotions stronger than normal and do have problems with anger(I'm trying to fix this, but it's a loooooong path towards it).

Is there a way to learn or develop something to help me deal with these small issues that always seem to trigger me and make my entire day bad?How can I stop myself from caring so much about all of it?",10Feb2020,1

676,"So my stepdaughter is 10 and is very knowledgeable about growing up, what comes in time with puberty and about being gay/lesbian. Her mum got her a book about it when she was 8. (Husband and I found out after the fact)  Sha makes wee characters on an app and makes them into short videos and it’s always lesbians. She has showed me them and I told her that they were great videos and she’s talented in the video making skills. But this was before I seen the messages today. Her phone is connected to her iPad that stays at our house. 

Her iPad was pinging away and I picked it up to turn it off as she won’t be back with us till the weekend and seen messages to and from her classmate about liking one another, about dating and a previous relationship with another girl in her class but they had broken up. So I called my husband at work and told him what I seen and he told me to have a look to see what else she said. 

She mentioned in them that she needed to delete the messages incase her mum seen them. 

We are going to sit down with her on Friday to talk about it. I just want to make sure we are going to be doing things the right way. I don’t want to make her shy away from being herself and I want her to remember that my home is a safe place for her to express herself and there will be no judgment just love and caring. I don’t ever want her to think there’s an issue with being gay and that my ears are always there for a listen and I’m always open for a cuddle if she needs it. She tends to open up more to me than my husband. 
I also don’t want to step on her mums toes. My husband doesn’t want to tell her what we’ve seen because there’s a possibility this could be an issue and be damaging to DD.

It's so bad now that I have trouble even starting the majority of the homework Im assigned, and I turn in almost none of it. I failed two out of the three classes I took last semester because of it, and I'm already way behind on this one. I feel like an idiot. Nothing I do seems to help. I'm so easily distracted and so prone to rampant anxiety that homework is at this point almost impossible for me to even begin to work on. No amount of desire in me to want to get it turned in ever allows me to actually do it. As stupid as it is, my inability to simply do school assignments is ruining my life. At work? I'm fine, mostly. Again, testing? Mostly fine. But at home I can't concentrate worth a damn. I don't know what to do and I'm forced to confront the realization that I may have to drop college because of this.

684,"I've read through a few post about this, here and wherever google leads me. They all say don't. But I'm miserable and on thin ice already. 

 

I graduated college in May 2018, and ever since I've been working low-wage/min-wage jobs. Currently I'm temping for a factory. It was a much better opportunity than working in a deli, since I was getting 40 hours a week instead of 15hr. That was it. I've been there about 3 to 4 months now (started just before thanksgiving), and I'm miserable. Factory work isn't what's getting me down either. It's easier than anything I've done ever, and I don't mind doing it. But the work culture at the factory is absolutely abysmal. I think since I've started working there about 7 people have quit (most without notice), and they've let go many good workers for issues like ""bad attitudes."" I've managed to stay for as long as I can because I keep my head down, and it only helps I had good attendance for a good while.

&amp;#x200B;

My coworkers all hate their jobs, which wasn't the case. Most people liked working there, and earnestly I don't mind it either, but those in charge make it miserable. I'm a temp so I'm not expecting a glamorous time, but the factory is so shorthanded that they just move me anywhere they need, so most days I'm not even working in the area I applied for, and everyone just dumps whatever task on me regardless of if I'm busy or not. There's more but it'd get too specific, and I don't want to bore people with factory work talk. But yeah, the culture there is just very bad (and I guess its new since they were just bought a year or two ago by a large corporation). 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been steadily applying to any and every job, and I had an interview the other day that went well. But I'm still waiting to hear back, and I have another interview tomorrow at a different place, all while still applying to more. I had a whole plan made up to get to the interview tomorrow, but it got dashed by terrible weather (I commute an hour to work by foot, and it was snowing/raining heavily all morning), so I missed today, which makes this my 5th day missed out of 4 months. I wouldn't have minded since my plan was to miss tomorrow anyways, since the interview couldn't be rescheduled for any time but when I'm supposed to be working. 

&amp;#x200B;

Idk if I'm writing in a way that's easy to follow, but the point is that I'm going to either have to miss this interview tomorrow (the job is a much better opportunity, if only because the pay is better, since the pay raise I'd get going on full-time at the factory would be nothing compared to just finding a new job), or miss a 6th day. 

I feel in a sense like I've already quit, but I know I can't just blow off my job. I have rent and bills.

688,"I'm using my throwaway account.


Background information, I'm 17 he's 19. We're a long distance relationship. Probably seeing each other this summer if money works in our favor. We've both struggled with depression, I've gotten treatment for 4+ years while he's gotten treatment for 5 months. Known each other for a couple years, been dating a couple months.


Being someone who has struggled with depression I understand what my boyfriend's position is. He's in college, away from his home, struggling with harder classes &amp; finding his career path. I truly do love him and first two months of dating were great! Now, it's very up and down. His depression is seeping into my life and I don't know how else to help. I hope I'm not being insensitive with making this mainly about his mental health.


 I've tried everything, I got him to go to therapy, open up to his parents, get medication, go to the gym, study more, etc. Not actually forcing him rather, motivating him. I want him to get better but it's so hard whenever I'm working at night (freelance) and I have to be talking to him hours on end to make him feel better. He isn't honest with his therapist about everything and he hates his major. I don't know how else to help! It makes me upset when I drop my work to talk to him and nothing changes. To me it seems like he has gotten worse because of me! I'm worried I'm the problem here for helping too much or pushing him over the edge. Sometimes I feel like I'm caring for a child and I'm a therapist. I know I'm in no position to be his therapist...


Little thing about me, I take education seriously, especially if it's something I'm not paying for. Not in college yet but after being depressed for years I'm finally taking school seriously and getting good grades this senior year. The thing that pisses me off is his entire college is paid by his parents including dormitory, food, textbooks, everything. It's a fairly prestigious 4 year college too, not like a community college. I understand depression renders you unable to do things but last semester he has skipped around 20-30 classes. I'm not physically there to wake him up and he doesn't sleep until I do (which makes things worse as I work at night and he's 3 hours ahead). I want him to be better and new semester he has only skipped 3-7 classes but it rubs me the wrong way. He skips it for more sleep btw, he hates it when he does skip but behavior doesn't change.


Ok the actual advice needed, do I hang on to the relationship? I know it can take years or decades for depression to settle down and be livable with. I'm hoping he'll do better this semester and he's on a new medication. I'm giving it a couple months to see if things clear up but it doesn't look hopeful. I'm so exhausted in trying to help him yet for some reason I don't want to let go. He's wonderful, creative, and we have so many things in common but I can't handle the mental load sometimes. I'm afraid even if I made the decision to leave the relationship he'd hurt himself or worse. That's my biggest fear. When things are good, it's very good but when things are bad it's a huge wave of guilt, anger, and hopelessness. If you guys have been in similar situations I'd love to hear how you dealt with it. I've been doing okay with the relationship but I find myself more worried with him than happy with him.

I am honestly currently emotionally not in a good state, because a lot is happening. And it is maybe because of that, that I am considering to not take an opportunity.

See, the thing is: I finally finished my master's degree, which took some time, due to me first being very sick and loosing a year and a half to it and then being forced to work and only study part-time, as otherwise I would have run out of money.

Now I took up a new job for my old university on which I did my Bachelor's degree. I loved that university back then, but currently ... oh boy. As I said, maybe it is that I am emotionally not good.

Thing is: I got offered a chance to make my PhD. Which is obviously an amazing opportunity. And I always wanted to make my PhD and this is an opportunity offered to me on a silver plate. But ... the thought of staying at an university for three more years currently makes me physical sick. 

Or, honestly, maybe it is the thought to stay in Germany for three more years, while all I want really is to move. 

Most of all it is just: When I started university it was with the firm thought in mind, that I wanted to go into journalism. I love doing journalistic work and have done freelance work for some magazines. But freelance work does pay and I am unsure whether I would be able to secure a permanent position at a magazine. 

So, yeah ... I am feeling miserable and I do not know what to do.


tl;dr 

Got offered the chance to do my PhD, something I always wanted to do. Thing is: My longterm goal actually is to work in journalism and I am suddenly not sure, whether this will actually help. The thought of spending 3 more years at an university makes me currently miserable.

Does anyone have good experience with pet sitters? If worst comes to worst and we have to leave them home, we'd like to hire someone to come 3-4 days a week to make sure their food, water and litter all stay clean and filled. Then I would just fly back every 3-4 weeks to hang out with them and do a big cleanup and such. Are there any reliable companies that you would recommend?

697,"Hello. I recently made a simple mistake, by remembering a prominent political figure wrongly, by switching up some letters at the end. In a conversation with a friend, by him correcting me on it.

So I Instantly dwelled of into a hole of self-critiques, and got hit by depression. 

My self-esteem is low, and I base the selfesteem alot on other by comparing. I know this is somewhat along perfectionism. 

A solution would be to comprehend the mistake, and not make such a big deal. But it doesn't really tell alot on why it felt so intruding. 

Can anybody shed some light on this, perhaps you known this problems?",10Feb2020,1
698,"Or do you maybe even have a name for this phenomenon?

&amp;#x200B;

I sometimes feel like I intentionally keep myself bored/depressed, because being really happy and excited about something is actually exhausting. Like, I can't be just calmly happy, when I'm sincerely happy I absolutely need to jump around and hug people and talk a lot and really loudly, which is obviously not always appropriate.

Also, I feel like giving my undivided attention to something I'm actually passionate makes me lose control to an extent. For example, when we're doing a group project at school that actually grabs my interest, I tend to just forget about my group members, literally rush to the front to get the task and then proceed to delve into it and be very irritable when someone distracts me.

(Note that I don't mind helping people or explaining things at all and I'm usually very sociable.)

One time we had a task I really liked and I became so overexcited that I actually got dizzy and had to leave the room. After that i was pretty much done for the day due to exhaustion/extended dizziness, shaking etc.

So by now I intentionally pick tasks that are less interesting too me when given the choice. When I don't have a choice and I feel the overexcitement coming, I try to tell myself ""Damn, that's some boring shit actually. Who cares about X?"" to calm myself down. Which is... exactly as sad as it sounds. 

&amp;#x200B;

I observe the same to be true in my free time. I may plan to watch a lecture on something that fascinates me, but then after 5-10 minutes it just gets too much and I distract myself by watching some comparatively boring askreddit video. I don't get distracted, because I'm bored, rather the opposite. I intentionally bore myself. 

Therefore I often end up spending a whole holiday week doing basically nothing and being depressed, because doing the things I actually want to do seems... too much. By now I believe that this phenomenon is really holding me back in life and  contributes a lot to my depression (diagnosed since four years, symptoms vary periodically). I don't want to spend my life in relative boredom, but at the moment I can't really deal with the opposite neither...

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure if I maybe just avoid excitement, because I'm so used to being bored due to years of school and boredom feels like the norm/safe state to be in. 

At the same time I believe it has to be possible to do things you really like without losing control over yourself and having physiological symptoms of overexcitement.",10Feb2020,1
699,"I (male) have 2 college classes with this girl. (The class meets 2 times a week). I do not know this girl nor have I ever met her in my life. On the second day of class she comes up to me and says that she's asking people to study with her. I'm thinking it's a group study group that she's trying to arrange so I agree and exchange numbers. It turns out that I was the only person she asked which i thought was weird. She then calls me to ask when I'm free and when can we study. It did not seem like a suggestion, it felt more like a mandatory meeting that she's planning. I told her maybe next week but when the time came I made an excuse to cancel the studying as she was starting to creep me out. On the third day the teacher tells us to get into groups. This girl and I both sit on opposite ends of the classroom yet she beelines towards me but i had already made a group with the people around me. so she heads back towards her side of the classroom. Just today she waited outside of class before it started to ask me if i could study with her after class. i then made another excuse that i would be busy after class. 

I know I'm being an asshole by making excuses but she creeps me out. What should i do? Am I just over reacting? If she literally just explains herself and text or talk to me I would talk to her but she doesn't really talk. She just wants to study.... with me and only me",10Feb2020,1
700,"This might be a bit long, so stay with me (or don't, I don't care). I go to this summer school thingy for ""gifted"" minors, and there's this cute guy I saw there. I don't know anything about him, and I'm pretty sure he doesn't know I exist.
 Last year was his last year at the camp (we have a celebration for the people who are leaving) but there will be a reunion in like 3 weeks and if he's like any of the other people who have left, he'll be there. I follow a lot other people from the camp, and his profile came up in my suggestions (didn't knoe it was him til I followed him) so I requested him. He actually seems pretty cool, but I feel terrible for following him on social media (despite not knowing it was him). We talked in dms like once but it would definitely be awkward if I started messaging him regularly.

This never bothered me since thats what like, 99% of mainstream porn says on the titles anyway. Well, I was on his phone and noticed a screenshot of some girls tiktok and when I looked her up, she was 15 years old. I asked him about it and he said it was just a random girl and didnt know she was 15... I admit a lot of girls don’t look their age but this just made me uncomfortable. He says its none of my business and that he did nothing wrong and he sees absolutely no issue in having a random picture on his phone and its not like she was naked.

703,"Or if I should even do anything. A bit of advice might be helpful, as I've never been in a situation like this before. My (24f) ex (22m) and I broke up a little over 3 months ago. I went through the pain of the breakup right away and have since gotten through it and even started seeing someone a little bit (something my ex was never told about as it's not his business in my opinion). 

Now immediately after the break up he seemed just fine, living his life as he normally would- it's been this past month or so that the break up has seriously taken a toll on him. He claims he is in love with me (something he never said while we dated) and realizes that he has ""lost the only thing he cares about"", and has been trying to get me back at least once a week during this time. The thing is, I can't allow myself to date him again. He proved over and over (5 times if it matters) that I could not trust him, and I never want to feel the pain and anxiety he caused me again. So getting back together isnt an option for me, no matter how much he begs.

Here's the part where I need some advice- a few days ago my ex reached out via a friend and tried hanging out. I stated it wouldnt be a good idea and explained that hanging out would only worsen his heartbreak. I didnt think much of it and continued on with my night, which consisted of new boy coming over. To keep a long story super super short- my ex showed up unannounced while we were upstairs watching tv (hence not being able to hear the doorbell when he rang), got upset and assumed that new boys car did in fact belong to a boy and he knocked off his side mirror on his car and left. I didnt know this happened until getting a text from my neighbor soon after the fact. The next day ex admits it was him to my friend and agrees to pay all damages. ANYWAYS, since then (2 days) new boy his been distant I've been the one initiating texting and he doesnt really carry out or continue conversations like he used to. I'm afraid ex scared new boy away and I dont want that to happen as hes really cool. This was all just so unexpected, and I genuinely have never had this kind of drama. My ex isn't really my main concern here, I'm not worried about him. I want to know what I should do/ if i should do anything in regards to new boy. Before all this happened he agreed to hang out again next wednesday but I'm afraid hes been scared away and my anxiety is making me feel crazy.

Me and my bf went through a rough week but we are good now, and she told him this a couple days ago and idk if she knew we were good or not. I also dont know when she even saw my phone, because I only see her at work and I dont carry my phone on me.

1) did she look at my phone in my locker? and 2) why would she tell someone I'm going through troubles with, that ""i was talking to someone""?... this chick has a bf and is supposedly a friend.. I think that's extremely invasive and a lil backstabbing tbh, it kinda breaks a natural girl-code.
I asked her about it and she acted like she was very confused and said she doesnt remember saying anything like that, and she doesnt remember seeing my phone.. my bf is calling bologna and I'm not sure what to do at this point.

I'm curious if anyone has had similar situations? Idk what else to do but I feel like the dynamic will be weird again since we just started getting along, but it truly bugs me that a ""friend"" would do anything like that without being in some way malicious. Should I leave it be and drop it, or should I try and really stand my ground here?

706,"I'm a recent college grad that has had a lot of trouble trying to find a job. Primarily I'm looking for full time work that will allow me to move out of my parent's house, secondarily I'm looking for a job that could start my career. I draw it up this way because I'm okay working while waiting for a better opportunity, especially if whatever job I get looks good on a resume or could lead to a better opportunity.   

  

I got a job offer, the job doesn't require a degree and is adjacent to my field, but is not in my field. They did say the like to promote from within though.  

  

Apart from this job, it's been a very long time since I got an interview or job offer.     

&amp;#x200B;

  

It's a cool job, it's a young company that's still growing. The office seems cool but I'd be working on the backs of trucks (which is also what I currently do.)  

  

They offered me a full time position with benefits, which is a great first step to moving out.   

 

But they warned me in the interview that the hours are inconsistent. They said weeks around certain holidays might not have any hours whatsoever. They also said I had to be prepared to work seven days a week with shifts being up to 24 hours.  

  

As crazy as that sounds I've worked long hours before and I've got no problem with long hours. I do have a problem with being available seven days a week for a company that can't promise me the first 5.   

  

I'm all for working hard and paying my dues. This company is young and could have good office positions open in the future, and I know I'll do good at this job, which hopefully combined with my credentials could lead somewhere.  

&amp;#x200B;

I can't tell if I'm being overly wary of a hard job, or if I'm correctly sighting this might be too extreme to be considered ""paying your dues"" on the way to a more profitable career.

The professor for lab quit and she then became the teacher for that as well. most of the students would talk about how confused they  are.

I am already drained from being in school for like 2 years straight and have not had a break. I want to drop the class, but the counselor said I will have to take 2 other classes online in place of it so it will not appear as a failing grade on my transcript and on my college transcript it will appear as a W ( which I already knew).

714,"Relevant to my previous post, a recent dentist visit left me with a roughly 3000$ quote for work. The current situation is I have no dental insurance, and unfortunately my credit isn’t good enough to go thru one of their payment providers to make it reasonable for me. 

I currently have a broken wisdom tooth in my mouth, so that needs to get pulled. It’s 750$ to get that one, and two more to get pulled. 750$ is a months savings but I can afford that. I can afford all of it, but it’d set me back which is not something I want to do at this point. 

So... question is, would y’all get just the 1 broken tooth pulled (for probably 250$), saving 500$, but still taking the day off work and probably 2 days afterwards for recovery? Or would you just bite the bullet, pay the 750$, take the same time off work but reduce the amount of times you’d have to take off work/recovery time by getting all 3 pulled at once? 

I’m conflicted because I like saving money but getting all 3 out seems logical and financially I would be at the same place I’m at now, in 3 weeks. 

The other 2100$ for periodontal therapy is almost more important, as my gums really aren’t in good shape.. I just can’t fork up that much right now. I would be better off spending that money, to try and rebuild my credit, so I can just get a payment plan that I could afford per month.",10Feb2020,1

Me and my dad have never gotten along to begin with, he doesnt talk to me or my brother even when hes home, he will only talk to my mom. if he talks to me, it is because he is asking about my car and if he talks to my brother he is asking about his grades. he has never been a part of our lives in a fatherly way. he thinks that as long as he provides the money, that is all he needs to do for this family. i am terrified of him, i do not know why, but he has instilled fear into the whole family. my mom wants to leave but is too scared to try to make it on her own.

and now my bf wants to move to NY and i cant imagine not being near him and he wants me to go up there with him but with everything going on with my family, i dont know what to do, i dont really want to move to NY but i would for him.

I dont know how to tell my parents about him, i dont want to really even sit down and tell my dad because that is not the kind of relationship we have, but at the same time i want to confront him and tell  him how shitty he has been my whole life, to have some relief or peace of mind idk, and i want to start living life for me and not always trying to make my parents proud because they never will be.

725,"Alright, so there's a girl I had a crush on like last year, and is still someone I think is fairly attractive, and would date should it come up, but I asked her out, she said nah, we stayed friends, all is good. 

Well unfortunately that didn't happen, she and I are both very flirty with each other, and we didn't stop just because of the request to go out romantically. We both were are just fairly flirty, and sexual people, so it's just how our dynamic is. Nothing really happens with that for a while, I still kind of have a crush on her, but it's not like I'm dying to marry the girl. Well she and I get closer, and now we're each other's best friends, and suddenly a couple days ago she told me she had a crush on this dude. Now she's had some bad relationships the last few months, and she wanted to ask a guy out who had a girlfriend. I told her it wasn't a good idea, if he cheats on her for you, he will likely cheat on you with someone else. Which she took the advice of. Now she has a crush on this other dude she works with, he's neat, seems like he would treat her well, so when she tells me I tell her I think it's a good thing and she should pursue him if she wants.

Well she starts saying she doesn't want to date. I ask why, and she goes all quiet and just says because.

I'm not exactly someone to be pushy, but I wasn't letting up, I wanted to know. I thought she was nervous or something so I kept teasing her, and asking her, and she finally said she's afraid of hurting me...

So that was a bit of a downer, and not exactly planned at all. I ask her what she means, and she said she could tell I still have feelings for her, and she is worried that it'll hurt me, and she wants to wait until I have a relationship before she carries through with one because it's going to hurt me.

I, very confused, tell her that I'm a big boy, and that the small amounts of pain and slight jealousy would go away pretty quickly, and that she shouldn't put her romantic life on hold for me, but that clearly just made her uncomfortable. Then she delved into reasons why she didn't want to go out with me. Nothing insulting, but it was just really random, and not really asked for at the time. It had been about a year since I asked her out, we were getting on very well without any problems. Now suddenly it's a problem for her? I live in a small town, and work with a lot of older folks to save money, she had moved to a city a couple hours away and has access to a lot more people.

 I told her it will be some time before I meet many people because of where I live, and told her she just needs to go with what makes her comfortable. I said I appreciate the sentiment, but it won't be the end of the world, nor our friendship. She smiled, and we just made some jokes to break the tension, and watched Zombieland 2 until four in the morning. 

I'm at a loss. I've been thinking about it since I drove home like three days ago. I'm not necessarily uncomfortable with her saying that stuff, I just don't think it makes any sense. I don't really know what to do. Idk if this is really asking for advice persay, more of just how I should react to this.

From what I can make sense of it, and how well I know her, a lot of these things just seem like logical jumps. I don't think she really knows what she wants, and she seems confused? What she was telling me changed many times, and she told me things I knew weren't true, or at least things that contradicted things she'd said previously. If anyone has any insight or advice I'd appreciate it. She's my best friend, and I really enjoy the time we spend together, and to me cutting her off isn't really an option. I just feel like she's putting her life on hold for me, and that is extremely dumb. Especially if we aren't going to become a thing, why do that with some dude you're friends with. Like I said, I guess I do still have some feelings for her, but nothing stopping me from meeting other women, and being interested in others. A crush is different than being head over heels.

Backstory: we’ve been friends for around two years and have known each other since we were little (5 year difference he was bffs with my bffs bro). But a few months ago he kissed me and stated he didn’t want a relationship with anyone but he was attracted to me so we started hanging out. He later told me again he didn’t want a relationship with anyone, but if I were to hang on until he was ready, we would probably date. He’s terrified of commitment because his last girlfriend really screwed him up. He has tons of anxiety so that stops him from doing and saying a lot of things. But we’ve been hanging out a lot more lately (four days in a row this week) and we usually meet at our spot in the woods and look at the stars for a long time then only sometimes go back to his house once it gets too cold. It’s turned not just sexual, but spending time walking with him and his dog (who loves me by the way) and texting everyday for hours about random stuff. He also does this little thing where I’ll just sit on his lap and he’ll put his head on my shoulder and say shit like “I really like you” or “ugh you’re so cute”. And he hugs me at random times. His friends and mom knows about me but not how much older he is than me. I saw him texting his best friend the other day with a photo of me and the caption “that’s the girl”. 

Anyways, so yesterday we were looking at the stars, just chilling, and I was against his chest. I felt his heartbeat start going a little wild so I asked him if he was okay. It’s important to note I’m very close to being 18 and we’ve never had sex, just kissed. We both know it’s wrong but we both agreed not to have sex until it was legal because 1) we could get caught and he could go to jail and 2) if I got pregnant we’d both be fucked. So we were just looking at the moon, and he said “I never imagined myself falling for a seventeen year old”. I literally couldn’t speak so I just hugged him tighter. 

Was this a declaration of love or am I just stupid? I think I love him (I’ve liked him for a long time) but I have no idea if he meant “I love you” or not. Help?",10Feb2020,1

736,"So, I started seeing this guy 2 years ago in January after an exciting night at the bar and we have been seeing each other nearly once a week since then. The August after we started seeing each other I told him that I have feelings for him, but would like things to remain the same for the time being, he was very understanding and things remained. 

The other week he sent me a message asking if I wanted things to get more personal between us, to which I responded ""like more sleepovers?"" He then said he wasnt explaining it properly and would get back to me. Jump forward a week and he texts me asking if I'd like to know if hes seeing someone else. I explained that with the feelings I have for him I thought it would hurt too much to hear about that, and asked if it was serious to which he responded no. 

After a week of dealing with my own emotional turmoil over this, he came over and I confronted him asking if he wanted to tell me about the other people he was seeing. He said that he was in an open relationship and had been since around new years eve. (I spent new years with him, we had a very nice sleepover.) I prodded him about the relationship and found out that she knows my name and a few other things about me, I also found out that they had been seeing each other about 7 years ago and reconnected recently. 

Obviously I feel quite hurt, and as though my privacy has been invaded by telling her so much about me, but I also understand that is something you do when you enter a new relationship. I have been rolling over this situation in my mind and I'm not quite sure what to do. I would love to be more serious with him, but I feel that isnt an option now because he has started something more serious with someone else. I would also love to keep things the way they are because we are so good together without the additions, but I'm not sure I can handle it emotionally knowing there is a very low chance of things getting more serious between us. I know I need to discuss this further with him and see what he wants, but I feel my judgement too blurred by how close to the situation I am to figure out what's best for me and I will end up hurting myself further without some less biased input. 

The advise I need is, do I end things now, keep things the same, or push for something more?

737,"26M | Been dealing with a chronic intermittent scrotal swelling and pain for 5 years. I had my first surgery in late 2014, most recent surgery in May 2019, and have a consolation for a third surgery this week. 

While the pain and swelling is not present every single day, or even the majority of the time, the rampant depression, anxiety, and nihilistic views over the years has spiraled out of control and sucked the life out of me. I've hardly left my apartment since 2020 began, and tend to stay in bed most of the day during the workweeks, but hardly eat or do anything productive. I used to love my organization, but a promotion slightly over a year ago turned into a dead-end/needless position on an internal consulting team. I had/have zero work to do, which is mainly due to a massive organizational transformation/re-structuring. I am unfortunately not eligible for any kind of leave of absence and will only continue to be absent without pay. Filing for disability seems to be my only option at this point to protect my job that I no longer care much about. Additionally, I am inevitably going to be out of the office for a few weeks for the surgery. The job is a dead-end and I will be seeking employment elsewhere after recovery.

Surprisingly, I haven't been fired, but who knows if they're just waiting for me to come back to have the talk/give me a termination letter. I have clearly been avoiding this potential moment. My manager is extremely supportive and wants me to focus on my health. 

Everyday I feel like I am letting both myself and my support network down when they ask how I'm feeling. This has made me feel very guilty. I don't want to complain to my parents or my older siblings, but the general consensus has been to focus on my health and to stop worrying about work, as I won't be able to work in the future without being in a better state of health. I have become a huge burden to my parents and feel terrible for the stress I put them through.

I would only be temporarily upset and embarrassed if I was fired. At this point I feel like I need time off to solely focus on my physical and mental health, without having work being an everyday worry, and then seek a stimulating job elsewhere after recovery. Unfortunately it would create a financial burden and I would need to move back home with my parents when my apartment's lease with several friends ends.

I would appreciate any advice/feedback about how I should move forward, given my health, work issues, family support network, etc.",10Feb2020,1
738,"I am just so tired of my mom and my wife not getting along. This past weekend it hit a new low and I really have no idea how to come back from something like this. Any advice is much appreciated. 

My mom and her sister are both quite controlling people with strong personalities. My aunt is absolutely crazy: controlling and overprotective of her adult son who is one year younger than myself (neither of us have siblings so we grew up quite close) . He recently moved out to escape her. Being around my aunt and my cousin always made me appreciate my own mother, and growing up, I thought she was quite lax (although other people saw her as overprotective). I guess it was around the time I was sixteen my mom started getting annoying. Her father passed away and she hasn't been the same since. She was becoming more demanding yet at the same time difficult to please. I noticed this and it drove me nuts, but what could I do? Several years later I made the mistake of going to a local university since it offered me a full scholarship. My mom and dad urged me to continue living at home to save money. 

The summer after freshman year, a professor who I was working for offered me an internship in his lab. This job was quite casual; I didn't have set hours as long as I was making progress. My parents expected me home every night for dinner and if I was late I was chastised. I put up with it and did what I could not to disappoint them. This was the same summer that I met a girl, now my wife. Let's call her J. J was not from around here. In fact, she lived 500 miles away in New York. I was introduced to her through her sister who I was friends with. J travelled here to meet me, and I never believed in love at first sight until I met her. 

Now my parents were furious the whole time she was visiting. She stayed with her sister, and I was rarely home. I was out late every night, an uncommon occurrence for me. Furthermore, they could see me and her moving very quickly and that made them uncomfortable since we were so young. The following month when I went to visit her in NY, my mom demanded I call her every day. This was made worse one night when we were out to dinner and my phone was off. There was a shooting in downtown Manhattan... far away from where we were, and my mom was frantic because she couldn't get a hold of us.

J was never less than sweet. She has a very quiet and gentle personality. Every time we visited one another, my mom was nasty and mean to both me and her. Every. Single. Time. I was always being put in the middle of my mom and J and it pissed me off. They both knew that. My mom hated J because she was bitter about me going my own way.  J hated my mom because, well, can you blame her? Of course she doesn't like the person that so clearly despises and rejects everything we do. So many times they tried to settle their differences for my sake, but they always fail because my mom says something ridiculous. Like on the night we got engaged, my mom said to J: ""I really wish this weren't happening.""

They don't get along. They never have. They never will. I'm always the person to suffer. 

Me and J decided to get married in NY. Her dad's a pastor and offered to marry us in J's home church. Mom was upset because she thought it would be rude to invite my family and expect them to travel so far. So we had two of everything. Two wedding showers, and two wedding receptions all at the command of my mother. J was not keen on this, but wanted to keep the peace, so she let my mom handle arrangements for stuff here and was rather uninvolved so J could focus on the stuff in NY, which made my mom decide she was passive aggressive and ungrateful. 

This reached a new level with... the dress. Me and J went all over the place to look for a dress she could wear at the reception my mom's throwing. J didn't want to wear her wedding dress, because she was already married. My mom was irked my this a little bit, but told J to pick something she felt pretty in. Then, while walking through the store, we both were stopped by the most beautiful black gown. It was gorgeous and J felt gorgeous wearing it. When I sent a picture to my mom,  her response was ""There's no way that J will wear a black dress to this."" You see, my mom assumed that J's black dress was a way to protest this party (not her intention at all) and once again she accused J of being passive aggressive and ungrateful. This started a HUGE fight and we didn't speak for days, until my grandmother (who I frequently see eye-to-eye with, and also LOVES J) got involved and told my mom she was sending mixed messages. Thanks to her, we won. J wore the black dress and everyone in the family told her how pretty she looked. 

So we have now been married for almost two years. I finished my bachelor's degree last year, and plan on going to grad school next year. My parents have been urging me to go somewhere close for grad school, but there's no way in hell I'd do that. My excuse is that I don't like any of the local schools, I can get into some really nice places because of the work I did and the people I know. In the meantime, I have a full time job that is similar to the internship I had my freshman year. Therefore, my parents don't take it seriously. I don't see them much, and that's because I work 40+ hours a week and really can't come and go as I please, but they don't understand this. They miss me like hell. When they invite me over to see them, they take it way too casually. They call me and say ""come over."" I'm just coming home from work usually, and can't stay long because J is cooking dinner at home. Sometimes I can't because I'm tired or busy. They don't understand. They never invite me over on the weekends. Only when it's convenient for them. And when we do have plenty of time to go and visit, they never even pay attention to us. My dad watches TV and my mom talks to her crazy sister on the phone. 

By the way, my wife is pregnant now and my mom is disgusted because the baby is due around the time I leave for grad school. So she won't see her grand baby. 

So needless to say we don't visit them much. So my parents have both discovered a new strategy: GUILTING me into making plans with them. ""We haven't seen you in a long time. We miss you. You never make time to see us.  Arrange something so we can see you now before you're gone and we'll rarely see you anymore.""

I gave in the other day. Saturday we all went out to dinner. My mom and dad and grandma and me and J. We were all doing well until my mom asked J if she was going to have a baby shower. ""Yeah, my sister offered to throw me one!""

The whole room instantly got colder. You could see my mom's expression just go blank. J said to my mom ""let me know if there's anyone you'd like to invite!"" To which mom replied ""no that's too many people."" It as awkward. I nudged my dad to say something so he got up and went to the restroom. My grandma tried to meditate and suggest that my mom offer to help J's sister. My mom wanted none of it. It was so uncomfortable, so when my dad came back from the restroom, I let go and for once said what was on my mind. 

""Mom, please don't make this awkward. It's J's sister. She offered to plan it. You're not barred from helping, and no one's stepping on your feet."" When my mom gave me a disgusted look I told her ""You're acting like Aunt ____. How it's gotta be your way or nothing at all. Stop it! And by the way, I'm tired of being guilted into seeing you so it can turn into this.""

My dad got violent. He turned around to me and got in my face and let Fuck You's fly. At a restaurant. So I said Fuck you back to him and he threatened to bash my face on the floor. I've never seen this side of my dad before. He was usually so kind and easygoing. Now he's a monster? I said to J, ""we're leaving."" I got up and kissed my grandmother goodbye while my dad was calling J an ""ungrateful bitch.""

When we got home, I called my grandmother. She said the ride home was silent. She and my dad both told my mom she was wrong for acting like that, but my mom denied acting or saying anything. I started to cry and she told me and J to come over. We went and visited my grandma who said that ""her heart goes out to us. We did nothing wrong."" She was appalled at how my parents treated me. While we were over, mom called. Grandma didn't tell her that we were there, and never will. We could hear my mom on the phone accusing me of being disrespectful, and accusing J of ""blindsiding"" her. My grandma tried to get mom to see our side but mom was having none of it. 

The next day me and J didn't do anything. My mom texted me saying she wants to talk, but I ignored the message. I know how it will end up. My mom is going to say ""I'm sorry,  but..."" I don't want lip service! That's just another way of saying ""here's why my actions are justified."" No. I don't want that. And if I try to tell her how I feel, she'd just get mad. I ignored her. Then I got a text from my dad DEMANDING I apologize to my mom and show her respect. He also said he'll stop guilting me into seeing them. Says the guy who called my wife a bitch and threatened to gnash my face into the floor? I didn't respond to him either. 

At this point I wonder what can be done. Do I just say goodbye to my parents, and never speak to them again? I don't know how to come back from any of this. They are stubborn and won't listen to a word I say unless it vindicates them. 

TL;DR: I was defending my sweet wife. My dad was defending his crazy wife. They said very hurtful things and I think it's the last straw.",10Feb2020,1

I know many people who leave their dogs home while they are at work but to me it still feels cruel sometimes (like I said, my roommate would be home so someone would be with the dog at least but I do not want to ask her to take them out/feed them) Do I crate train the dog to stay in a crate all day while I am at work?

Ive recently been having to under go a few medical procedures due to high count pre cancerous cells on my cervix that my doctor has said while it is not cancer right now it will be cancer within the next 5 years. She recommends i have a hysterectomy. Since I've already had a few procedures to try and remove the mutated cells unsuccessfully.

My husband and I have been on the fence about having another child even before this came up. I love being a mom and I love babies but my biggest hang up is a bit selfish ill admit.

 Pregnancy has always been very hard on me. With my youngest I literally felt like i was dying for 9 months due to vomiting all day everyday. My husband is very sensitive to this fact.

Well now we are put in the situation where the doctor has said if you want to have another child now is the time to do it. Right now. Since i said that another child was something that may be on the table i wanted her opinion.

My husband has now come to me and told me that he does in fact want one more child and he never pressed the issue before because he knows how hard it is on me and wanted it to be my choice and still does. That he just wants me to know where he is at with it and that it ultimately is still my choice no matter what. 

The problem is I now don't know what to do. Im leaning more towards not but the other part of me feels like that wouldn't be fair to my husband and im not sure how to handle this entire situation.

My husband has always said my health takes top priorty no matter what but what i need advice guys. I know you cant tell me to have a baby or not.

752,So a few years ago when I (19M) was 15 I was befriended by a woman who was 24 at the time.

We got really close really fast and it got to the point where I was just coming over to her house to help her with chores. She always talked about how she couldn’t wait for me to be 18 (she never specified why) and how I was her best friend blah blah blah. She also talked to me about her sex life a lot and asked me questions about mine. For my 17th birthday she got me a pair of boxers. I didn’t think that was weird at first but then about a week later she asked me to send her a picture of me in them just so she could see how they looked on me. I thought that was weird but I still sent a picture. Around that same time she got together with someone else who just turned 18. Since I’ve turned 18 I barley see her and she puts almost no effort into seeing me. We go months without talking and then when we see each other we don’t really do anything. She’s engaged now and invited me to her wedding but she wants me to stand on her fiancé’s side for pictures and stuff. Maybe I’m just dramatic but as I’m getting older the weirder the relationship between me and my friend is getting. I’m debating on if I should keep this friendship going or not.,10Feb2020,1

 I'll try to explain my situation as best as I can. It's very complex and multi-faceted, so please bare with me. Any help would be greatly appreciated. This is an issue that has plagued me for 20+ years and has only gotten worse. Before you discredit me, please me hear me out. I'm not sure where else to go with this.I posted this on r/legaladvice already so this is a copy of that post.

First off, I'm not sure what type of lawyer to contact. The best I can think of is an IP lawyer. The problem is that I cannot afford a lawyer. I'm 26M unemployed, struggling with depression. My state doesnt not offer any assistance for IP law. To find a lawyer would mean I would have to find a private lawyer offering pro bono. That is if should even contact an IP lawyer.


My problem is this. When I was young I got in contact with a record producer to write music. I'm not sure to what extent I wrote music, but I know for a FACT I wrote several songs, as odd as that may sound. I'm not sure under what agreement these songs were produced, nor do I have any means, that I'm aware of, to contact someone for help. As far as I can tell I'm a ghostwriter and have never recieved and documents, or compensation.

Now I understand that I don't have much leverage as a writer, especially a new one(at the time), in terms of bargaining. To my knowledge I would have never let my work go without fair compensation. To my knowledge i have never recieved front end pay or back end pay. However to my recollection, I recall demanding substantial back end pay. My parents were clueless to the process so they were no help at the time, and cant even testify that anything happened. I never recieved a copy of any formal agreement.

The artist is now successful and i feel I am entitled to compensation, but don't know how to go about obtaining it. The artist has their own label and was produced under several other labels. I remember PROs, and other royalties, but I don't think they were ever set up for me, even though I was told they would be. I was too young to manage that on my own.

As a got a bit older I tried proving that i was the writer of these works to classmates/teachers/friends. The problem with that is, as a ghostwriter, it's not so easy, when everything you say, even though it's true, looks to be a lie. I struggled with behavioral issues, but ended up coming in contact with then artist/producers again. I feel this is where I may have been taken advantage of. Bribery, extortion, and some others I may not be aware of in order for them to get me to negotiate for less to write more. I ended up writing more successful work. Meanwhile everyone was still in disbelief. Even though they witnessed the artists come to my school, and deny my claims, no one will testify to what happened, and students were instructed to refrain from speaking about the events. I was mercilessly bullied because of this at the expense of the school.

Years later I think I did contact a lawyer, but either nothing came out of it, or I destroyed any evidence due to self destructive behavior. Either way I'm still in the same situation. I couldnt find any court cases either.

I do remember getting in contact with these labels again. This was probably not due to my part. (My life has a knack for this sort of thing) Honestly I have NO IDEA how I ever get in contact with these people yet I know it happens. I was broke at the time and I wanted to write music. The record company bought me a pencil and paper. Some time went by and they showed up at my workplace and confiscated the notebook claiming it belonged to them, and played that whole possession is 9/10ths the law spiel. My lyrics were in there and I never agreed to publish them. On top of this I had some artwork, on loose paper of my own, stuffed in the the notebook. They stole they artwork and the lyrics. They even had the audacity to put  MY artwork in a music video for a song I wrote.

Time went by and they contacted me again. They convinced me to write again. Again I have no formal agreements, nor do I have any idea how to obtain information on these. All i know is I wrote another album for them at least in part. My tracks are some of the singles. I'm pretty sure by the time I wanted to call off the deal it was too late because they were so far into producing, and people had to get paid, god forbid I ever get payed a penny. 

This is just one artist, and one Record label and its subsidiaries. The bigger problem is somehow I ended up writing for other artist under the same label. Again, documents being withheld from me. Whats even worse is that I know I've worked for various other artists for under various labels. All this would usually happen in a short time frame. I'd usually get fed up with life's, do something drastic, get in contact with a label(s), write, and forget about it, as it usually takes several years for an album to hit stores. Writing and recording may take a month, but it's usually 2-3 years before you see that album go public. 

On top of all this, I know one artist in particular who I explicitly forbid from producing one of my songs. Unfortuately I lost the master copy of the lyrics and they went ahead and did it anyway. They claim it as their own, and have licensed it to other media outlets. This person is getting payed, played, and awarded for something that I wrote.

 Most the artists I've written for are well know, and have several popular tracks written by me. I desperately want to reclaim my life. I'm sick of having to hide who I am because no one will believe me anyways. On top of this other people are getting money and awards meanwhile I cant even afford to take care of myself. Please help in any way you can. Excuse any typos. This was done on my phone.

At the end of December I  was told that even tho me and the other new guy didn't technically qualify, we would be receiving bonuses. I recieved a 5k bonus and a 10k raise. Thats a difference of 5 dollars per hour. Well I found out that  new guy recieved the same raise as me and is making the same as me. I have more experience, more responsibility, and have received a promotion.

762,"I'm so ashamed of myself. The shame really dictates all of my behavior and choices. I have a hard time figuring out what I want in life, I try to journal about what would be important to me and it usually revolves around the idea of having things like a house and a garden, but I would like to make a positive difference in the world.

Unfortunately, I have a barrier to accomplishing most things as I have a variety of mental health issues (ADHD, depression, OCD, delayed sleep phase disorder) so holding a normal job has always been a challenge even though I am a hard worker. I've had to find jobs and build my life around my schedule which means I can only work jobs that start after 11am (but I can do overnight work no problem.) These jobs are typically low-skilled and low-pay with little opportunity for advancement.

I probably shouldn't be focusing on my ""dreams"" since I have no real career prospects at the moment, but the idea of going to work day in and out at a factory or store is miserable to me, I would definitely prefer death over monotony.

I'm incredibly disciplined when it comes to health, I eat well and exercise 5 days a week. When it comes to other things that require focus, like reading, I am a mess. I can't focus on anything for more than a few minutes without becoming incredibly distractable or irritated. I should probably be medicated, but I have tried just about every SSRI/stimulant and it doesn't seem like pharmacological intervention has been particularly beneficial.

Today is Monday. On Saturday night, I was left home alone with the dog. My parents are gone on vacation out of country, my brother and his girlfriend away at a friends cottage for the weekend. Everything is going fine. I put on a movie in the living room and slowly began to doze off with the dog next to me. Eventually I fell asleep.

772,"I made a song for a friend to do vocals over a couple of months ago. I did it just because I thought it’d be a fun thing to work on together as friends, but then we had a falling out shortly after. My now former friend insisted that they just needed a break, but after about a month and a half of pretty much no contact I can tell we’re probably not gonna get back in touch.

The falling out happened after we spent a shitty night together. We planned to work and record the song, but we ended up drinking too much and getting nothing done. She blamed me for this happening, saying I focused on drinking and socializing, but tbh my friend chose to drink as well, and on an empty stomach, which I didn’t know about until she vomited and the night came to an end. I think we both made a mistake, we both chose to drink and actually when she vomited I was still in a decent enough mental capacity to work on the song (important to note as well that I did not encourage her excessive drinking, I simply offered a drink when I’d have one),  but my former friend views it as my fault. Anyway. 

During the falling out I worked a lot more on this song and I genuinely think I made something pretty great. It’s creative, original, and I put a lot of time into perfecting every little bit to my standards. So obviously I wanna finish the song. My former friend keeps insisting she will finish her part soon, but to date has done nothing, and actually fell through on her promises to send me some audio recordings I wanted to include in the song. 

So anyway, what do I do here. I don’t wanna be a dick and just give the song to someone else, but at the same time my former friend clearly does not want to speak to me and is not putting effort into the song in any way, so I don’t wanna keep trying to get her to record her part. Any suggestions appreciated, thanks!",10Feb2020,1
773,"This is going to be a long one but I really need to let it out.

I’m 20, female and severely depressed. I’ve been through a lot of childhood trauma. Ever since I can remember my dad was abusive, in fact one of my earliest memories was seeing him beat my brother until his nose was bleeding. My dad (I use the term dad very loosely) was abusive to my brother, my two sisters and my mum daily. He actually threw my 5’0 nanna across the room, and beat my grandad black and blue (RIP grandad). I never met my grandad... as the days go by I really wish I did. Just to say sorry for what my dad did to him. 

My mum was married to my dad for 25 years, but knew him longer than that - she was always too scared to leave him (until 2010). Daily whilst all living together, my dad would call us every name under the sun completely unprovoked, drag us by our hair up the stairs, grab me by my neck and carry me then throw me at the wall, throw plates at my mum, beat us in every way possible, all whilst looking like the best dad ever on the outside. What makes this worse is that my dad retired from being a policeman 3 years ago. He was a policeman for 20 years. 

My mum went to the police in 2010 when she had the courage to leave him, after receiving horrendous harassment, him spray painting the word ‘cunt’ onto the side of our new house, and getting my oldest sister to beat my mum (my oldest sister is 30, and completely brainwashed. I think she has been sexually abused by him, as when she was younger she used to say she was raped but never told anyone who. Nothing you will ever say will make her change her mind about my dad). The police did absolutely nothing and dropped the case. In fact when they came into the house after my dad instructed my sister to beat my mum, the policeman came into the house and said ‘you alright Sarge hows it going’ (Sargent). That’s how seriously this was taken. 

This is all over the place (like my head). Sorry. But during us all living together before the separation, my sister abused me. I’m the youngest sibling, and at the time I was about 6. She would lay naked and make me rub her privates and put cream on it - then when I used to cry out saying I didn’t want to do it, she would grab me by the throat, pin me up against the wall and say you keep fucking crying and I’ll kill you. This happened about 5 times.

Back to 2010, when my mum left my dad. Because I was under 16, (10/11 to be precise), I didn’t really have a say in visiting my dad. And to be honest, I loved him and trusted him. He was my dad and I thought he was how a dad should be, I didn’t know any different. So I went to visit after the separation, it would always just be me alone visiting him alone, and there would be more abuse - however, again... this was everyday life to me. I was so used to it. Although one night I was so terrified for my life that I ran in the bathroom, locked myself in and called for a taxi whilst he was trying to kick the door down. I heard a pause so took that time to run out the front door and up our house passage - he ran after me. But to my sheer luck, the taxi pulled up and I jumped in. I think he would’ve killed me if he caught me. 

After that, I went back. I was young and innocent. Again this was my DAD. I loved him. I loved him so much. I was 10 and just wanted a loving father. So he invited me to stay, I said of course. One night I went to bed at his house, the bed my mum used to sleep in, grabbed her teddy bear and faced the window ready to sleep. My father got in behind me and started to sexually abuse me - I was never raped. But I was groped, kissed, and dirty things were whispered in my ear. This same happened around 3 times. 

After all of this, I never told anyone. I was too young to know that what he did was disgusting and wrong. I didn’t visit him much after this happened a few times, but still kept contact. Please don’t ask me how or why I spoke to him until I was 18, but I did. I’m fucking stupid but that happened. The day I stopped speaking to him was the day I looked back on my childhood and remembered those nights where he sexually abused me. I never ever even remembered anything like that until one day where something triggered a memory, and it all came flooding back and I burst into tears. The day I realised is when my life changed forever. I told my auntie first, about a year after coming to the realisation, crying my eyes out, and told my mum about 3 months later. I then went to the police after so much battling with myself about the pure fear. As you can imagine, this got nowhere. There wasn’t enough evidence, no pictures, so the case was closed. 

I am never going to have fucking closure from this and it’s driving me insane every single day. I feel dirty every second of my life and I am so ashamed.

Moving on. 

My nanny has advanced dementia. She’s had dementia for about 3 years, but went missing one night; she had a fall, was found at 3am knocked out and everything has been sudden and gone downhill since the bump to her head. She’s now in a care home, she barely knows who I am, when she was my best friend. My nanna has always been my best friend, and was the one who was always there for me through everything with my dad. I’m grieving the loss of her, but she’s still here.  

I lost my job in September last year and was the closest I had ever been to killing myself. My boyfriend rushed home from work the day I lost it, and if he hadn’t arrived when he did, I think I would’ve been dead by now. I got a new job 3 weeks ago, but the first day I was made to feel gross and uncomfortable by a manager, and he kept talking about how exceptional I looked. So I didn’t go back. I can’t get a new one for the life of me and I’m very financially unstable. 

I’ve been on 2 different types of anti depressants in the past, but come off them because they weren’t helping. I hate relying on tablets to be happy too.

I can’t afford a therapist and am not being given one through NHS. I’ve tried. 

I’m sick of everyone around me thinking I’m happy when all I want to do is die. My pets are the only thing I’m holding on for.

780,"I’ve been texting this girl for the past 4 months now as well as occasionally going out to study or watch a movie, however we haven’t gone out on what we can OFFICIALLY call a “date”. I was quite certain that she had feelings for me namely because she would be the one who initiated many conversations between us. We got close enough to the point where a simple Snapchat image with no context could be sent.

For a reason unbeknownst to me, if there even is a reason, we’ve mostly stopped talking for the past 4-5 days, the last conversation we had ended on a rather dry reply from her. I sent her a funny Snapchat tonight hoping she would reply but she saw it and didn’t. If things are going to end between us, I’d rather know for sure instead of letting it fizzle out without any clear reason why. I also don’t want to move on while she still has feelings for me and unnecessarily lose the chance I had with her. It could just be because we’re both busy with school work.

I’m going to wait til tomorrow to see if she would send anything to me, but if she doesn’t, I want to ask her something along the lines of:

- We haven’t talked for while.
- Is there any reason why?
- If you don’t want to talk to me anymore just lemme know because I don’t want to bother you.

There are 3 guys who I hang out with pretty much every weekend. Let’s call them F, J and W.

W has been my best friend since the third grade. We hang out all the time and he’s been with me for as long as I can remember. That said, in the past year or so, I’ve noticed him withdrawing from our friendship and kind of avoiding one-on-one hangouts. We’ve been very at odds at some points, and have definitely been drifting apart fast. This obviously has put a bit of a strain on our relationship, and I therefore don’t know if he would even consider moving in with me.

F &amp; J are each other’s best friends. I only met them a few months ago, but we’ve grown to like each other and we also hang out all the time. The thing is, F &amp; J are likely going to move in *together*. They’ve been talking for a while about what they’d do for university, and from what I’ve gathered, they plan on living together. As in, 2 bedroom apartment. Not 3 or 4. These guys seem to like me okay, so the issue is whether or not they’d be willing to have a third tenant. I’m not sure if they would.

I don’t want to pressure anyone. I mean, the last thing I want is to be stuck in a lease with people who don’t even want to live with me. But since I plan to move out in June, I need to start planting the seeds of the idea now.

Everything makes sense to me. I need a new place, we hang out all the time anyway, we all live similar lifestyles.... I just don’t know if they’d be interested.

My question is, how do I begin to pitch the idea? Given all the info I presented in this post, what would be the best way to bring up this topic without weirding out my friends or overstepping the boundaries? As much as I want to have a shared apartment with them, I’d much rather live separately and have our friendship continue without exposing myself as “that guy we knew for 4 months before he asked us to move in with him”.",10Feb2020,1

I know I shouldn’t be friends with her, but she was so fun, we would always go out and do stuff, her mum bought us drinks and pot, and we just had a great time, which I have been needing again desperately since school is emotionally draining me and my other friends are very boring and don’t want to hang outside of school .Any advice, maybe I was just too sensitive to things she said?",10Feb2020,1
786,"My phone got stolen the other night, and since I have Find my Iphone on it, I've been able to see that the phone was online once since it got stolen. I looked up the address on Google maps and guess what, it's at a local phone repair shop which looks a bit dodgy.

It's locked as it's connected to my icloud account and I've registered it as lost so there's no way it can be wiped without being removed from my icloud account, which requires my password.

As a result of this the phone repair shop has sent me a phishing email trying to get my icloud password, which I ignored.

My question is, bearing in mind the police would have no right to search the premises, what should I do? Go there by myself and ask for the stolen phone back? Try and buy it back from the owner of the shop? Try and get a police officer to go with me (bearing in mind they can't search the shop or anything)? Genuinely stuck on what to do next.",10Feb2020,1

792,"My girlfriend is wanting to break up seemingly out of the blue. After the little call we had it seems to be a miscommunication issue where we both just kind of ignore the things we don’t like about what each other do. And it’s all coming out at once. But if I try to open that up to her, she immediately gets defensive and says it’s all my fault and I’m a complete a hole. All the stuff she’s saying i have hurt her with she has never mentioned before now. But at the same time, she’s hurt me pretty badly too, and hasn’t acknowledged that she has, and if I tell her she has, she turns it on me saying I’m manipulating her.

796,"Hello. Please,  if you have time, could you please consider telling me your honest opinion? I would be so thankful!

I am now 18 years old - it often happens that I breathe very badly, as if someone was sitting on my chest. When I try to sleep, I have a terrible noise in my head - I always try to shake it off, but it seems to be getting louder and louder. In a normal conversation, I look confident, but I always start to tremble, my whole body is shaking like its freezing cold, my voice is trembling, and I sweat terribly. Sometimes I have bad thoughts, I hurt myself, I'm ashamed of it. I regret it every time I do it, but somehow it reassures me. Nobody knows about it- but Oh boy, i am so ashamed! Sometimes I start crying out of nowhere, but not out of sadness - It feels completely different. as if I was angry and wanted to fall into the ground. as if I wanted to tear myself into small pieces. I never tell anyone - my mother yells at me, she thinks I'm making it up. Since my father left us, she's been yelling at me, shaming me about various things. When I try to open up to my only friend, I cry and tremble, and I never even start. My stomach hurts so much trough the day, like its infinitely shrinking...

Also... I have a problem attending school. I wake up sometime in the morning and just can't go among people, I don't want to be there, I don't want to talk to others. Sometimes I cry because I have to go there. Don't take it wrong, I have friends, no one is hurting me at school. It is selfish from me to say such things.

I keep smiling, at all time. Nobody suspects that i feel this way. I rather always listen to others, i help them, i give them advice. 

I've been thinking about therapy for a couple of years, a psychologist - but do I need it? Whenever I am in front of the building, I stand there and then leave. I'm afraid if I go there, they'll laugh at me. They'll tell me I'm just making it up and just looking for attention. Am I just hypersensitive? What if I'm just a typical teenage girl trying to be interesting by going to someone like that? My parents have always told me that others have lives worse than me, that everything is in my head or that I am looking for attention.

Sometimes I wish all this ended. I feel like nobody will ever understand me, no one has the answers to the questions I have. I wish to be calm and live without a worry... I feel like im just bothering everyone around me, even you- just by reading all of this bs i wrote. U've wasted your time just by reading this. i feel selfish and im trembling just by thinking about posting this. But it seems like the last thing i can do.  Im sorry, please do not be angry with me. 

Please have a great rest of the evening,

sincerely- Kateřina",10Feb2020,1
797,"So first of all I am a college student and I do work as a nursing assistant. I make pretty decent money however I don’t work many days because my school schedule is busy making it hard to work 8 hr shifts. 
With the money I do make, it goes straight to bills and gas leaving me with little money for myself. 

I could definitely try to pick up a minimum wage job on the side but I’m looking for less time consuming ways to make money as well as something quick. 

I always hear people talking about how they make so much money off selling feet pics or nudes but I don’t really know. Some girls have sugar daddies... but sleeping with older men doesn’t interest me (I know not all sugar babies do). If this is a good way, then where should I look to sell them?

I know, I am only human and I'm allowed to make mistakes however the side glances I get from my co workers are hard to ignore.

Obviously, I try to ignore it as what they say is their business and I shouldn't care. But it still hurt. I am the type of coworker who just keeps her head down and works quietly.

i had been seeing 3 ppl at once but in late november i decided to stop doing that and try to peruse something real with alex. 

it was going amazing, we had so much fun together and he just understood me. never shamed me for sleeping around, and i judged him for anything. 

it was the middle of december and i knew i was in love him him. i knew. so i told him, he said he loved me too, it was great, we were happy. the stresses of uni were somehow more bearable when i knew someone i trusted had my back. 

early january he overdosed on his antidepressants and his sleeping medicine and a shitload of vodka. it was so fucked up. 

for the past month and a half i’ve just been selfishly blaming myself and thinking of what i could’ve done to change what happened. i know we only dated for like a month but idk... this was the most real thing i’d ever felt before.

i wish i knew what he was feelin, i wish i could tell, i’m so stupid i didn’t see his behaviour change. 

looking back now it’s so fucking obvious, i was at a stupid fuckin sleepover with my friends and he called me like 10 times asking me to come over. i was so fucking drunk that i couldn’t hear the desperation in his voice, i didn’t take the time to hear and listen to the last things he would ever say to me. i don’t even fucking remember what exactly he was saying. if i had just gone to him he would still be alive.

i don’t think i can forgive myself

what do i do?

804,"This will be a lot. I don't want to talk about her past but it explains why this might be a huge thing for her. The details I'm omitting are worse. I don't want to reach out just because, we were involved in an accident, I almost died and recently I found out she's blaming herself for what happened. I just want to let her know I'm ok and there isn't a parallel universe in which she would be to blame.

&amp;#x200B;

4 years ago I was working part time at a small town university, just a run of the mill office job. One day a gorgeous girl walked in, she wanted to transfer from a prestigious university in the big city and I was helping her find the best program. My shift was ending, we continued our conversation while walking around campus. I offered her a ride and we actually spent the rest of the day together. Nothing happened, we were just getting to know each other. It was the most fun I've ever had and we made plans to go on a real date the next day. I was dropping her off, my seat belt was undone, hers needed a bit of maneuvering. While I was helping her with that a drunk driver rammed into my car.

&amp;#x200B;

It was bad, I was in critical condition for days. When I woke up the first thing I did was ask if she's ok, they told me she only had some bruising. We had a great connection, I was sure she was going to come visit but she didn't. At first I was confused, then I got angry and at one point I was convinced she was dead. I had several surgeries, combine that with the head trauma and my perception of time was not the greatest. In retrospect, I was obsessing over her for the very few hours I spent awake but at that point it felt like years. Now I'm fully aware my mind made this into a much bigger deal, it was just a great day with a girl I had just met. I snapped myself out of it while I was still in the hospital and she didn't even cross my mind until 2 months ago.

&amp;#x200B;

I started my big boy job and one of my coworkers turned out to be an old friend of hers. They were close but she ghosted everyone in town after our accident. He told me all about her, she's had a pretty rough life. For starters there were 2 other car accidents that marked her. She lost her parents as a toddler, skipped years and got accepted at a prestigious uni at 16 and moved to the big city. She's only been in 1 relationship and it was pretty bad. She was an emancipated minor, a kid for all intents and purposes and her boyfriend was in his mid twenties and freeloading off her. 2 years before we met they had a fight while driving, that human garbage ran the car off the road, killing himself in the process and almost killing her. She sustained life changing injuries and on top of that, his family took her to court to leech some more while she was still recovering. All that made her put school on hold and she swore off relationships. My coworker told me that our accident pushed her off the edge. She had a mental breakdown, eventually she was diagnosed with complex PTSD. During her breakdown she was blaming herself for what happened. Everyone was telling her it was the wrong place, wrong time situation but she kept saying I was then and there because of her. She was convinced I won't make it. Since then she cut ties with her old friends from our home town but he's heard she's doing much better, she even started driving.

&amp;#x200B;

As a part of my job I have a team meeting in her city every Friday. I'm constantly looking around and scanning people on the street, hoping I will run into her. I desperately want to reach out. I'm not hoping to pick up where we left, I just want to tell her I'm ok and she's not to blame for what happened. My coworker is pushing me to reach out. He's amazed she got in a car with a stranger and even made plans to go on a date. Not only that, she put her studies on hold while dealing with all that and we met just as she was putting her life back on track. She even shared something she could easily hide, I realize she maybe saw a future with me and didn't want to blindside me down the line, or just wanted to rip off the band-aid cause she thought it would be a deal breaker. Now I blame myself and my dodgy seat belt for hindering her progress. I don't know if reaching out will do more harm than good.

806,"Hi all,
My three bro’s and I lost a good friendship with the fifth bro because he became blind for love to a very problematic girl.
Long story short: This girl tried becoming his gf for 5 months and after turning her down 4 times he said yes to the fifth time she asked. Everything seemed alright for quite a while until she started claiming him, this became worse and worse and she started making rules. Then the gf started talking bad about us and told him not to hang with us anymore. She also got him to drop of one of us in the middle of nowhere after he was promised to be dropped of at home at 3:00! The worst part is when she prohibited one of us to date one of her friends and she completely lost it almost starting a fight!
Even though she’s dating OUR best friend.
Now we started hanging less and less with our bro because he was always with us. And eventually completely dropping us.
Now we’ve been planning to talk to him about it to give him a last chance (we’ve already had lots of small talks with him). Somehow he knew this and asked me to talk about it. Since it concerns all of us: we will all be participating in the confrontation.

Now my question is: what are the best methods of confronting him and discussing this without him feeling threatened or in a corner?
I do want what’s best for him but also we need to be clear.

Are there some ways or words to use to start this and to keep it as peaceful as possible?

811,"So, I'm still living at home, but am definitely too old to be. My parents don't mind, as I pay something of a rent and help out where I can, so I'm not in danger of getting kicked out. But, I know I need to be an independent adult.

The problem is, I really don't know what's best for me, and I'm very conflicted on a lot of things.

Seems like ""renting an apartment"" is the easiest and quickest solution. And I can see the upsides of it. That said, I also don't really like the idea of sharing walls with anyone or being that crammed in (I don't think I could do a studio at all). A lot of the apartment listings I see online look a bit... dingey and murder-y. Above most things, I don't want to feel ""unsafe"" in my own place.

It's a (probably distant) dream of mine to have my own house some day. I've actually got a nice chunk of money put away for it and I'm continuing to save. But it's probably not smart to go straight to ""buying a house"" when I've never lived on my own before. And I know I'd be responsible for having to deal with and pay for any problems that arise in a house (whereas, the landlord of an apartment complex will take care of that).

I like living in a house, but I know it's probably not the smartest option.

Something I kind of struggle with, too, is that the idea of actually living alone is kind of conflicting for me. On one hand, I want my own space and my own independence. On the other hand, it's nice knowing someone else is there with you, and it'd make the cost of living a bit more bearable to split the cost with. But I absolutely refuse to get a random roommate, and I don't have anyone to move in with that I'd be comfortable with. So I don't know what the solution here is.

I just really don't feel like I know what's best for me. I'm not expecting to make a move this year, but I'd really like to aim for some time next year. So, I don't necessarily need to ""stress"" about it right now, but I just want to start coming up with some kind of plan.",10Feb2020,1

I'm looking for advice. I'm currently in my 3rd year as a Life Science student. Because this is my 3rd year, I have to do an internship. So last Wednesday I started at my internship at a institute. I'm doing a research with someone else about something that I can't talk about (because I had to sign a confidentiality agreement). I work every day for 8 hours and I'm not getting paid. But I don't mind getting paid though.

I sit behind my labtop for at least 5 hours a day doing research and the rest of the day I'm conducting experiments in the lab. I don't have experience in researching and my interest don't lie here after all. Before my intership I was given two options: do an intership at a clinical/hospital lab or do a research intership. I was always interested to work in a clinical lab, but I chose for an research internship because I wanted to get more experience in this field and the institute I do my internship at, is world-leading in it's field. So I thought it would be a great experience, even after the interview.

I'm not sure what exactly what to do. If I quit, I can focus on my 3 subjects I still have to do, but if I'll stay then I know I would not feel great the next five months with te feeling that I have to do this.

My girlfriend and I stopped at a Gulf Station  (717 E 7th St ) this past Saturday around 2:20PM. She went to pick up a To-Go order from Koriente (621 E 7th Street) an Asian place one block down. Meanwhile, I went inside to grab us some drinks for the road. I purchased two drinks and have a time stamped card transaction from the Gulf Station at 2:26PM. I walked across the small lot separating the station and the restaurant to see if my girlfriend needed help grabbing our order from Koriente. By the time we returned \~2:40PM, our ride was already gone. I have  an outgoing call to the towing company, Austin Express towing, at 2:44 as well as an Uber receipt 4 minutes later to get out to the tow yard and retrieve our car. Signage in the lot stated you had to be a patron of the business (which I was) or you would be towed. Texas law  (§ 13-6-74 - NOTIFICATION OF VEHICLE REMOVAL) also requires that you report accurately the time at which the vehicle was towed. Looking in to this, I found that it was reported the vehicle was towed at 3:01 according to [autoreturn.com](https://autoreturn.com) which doesn't align with all the records I have. In the humble opinion of Reddit, is this something that is worth pursing ie would the discrepancies in the reported tow time versus all the information I have described be sufficient to show that proper practices weren't followed?

815,"This is not the typical ""I'm lonely, need friends"" post. I'm going to an island ""excursion"" through my school, but noone I know is going.

I'm going to be with about 30-50 people around my age (I'm 17) and I would like to make a friend or two. The thing is, I can be super awkward and antisocial. I have a couple of friends, but we mostly bond through smoking weed and talking shit about our school (it is particularly difficult and it's an accepted fact we all agree on that you'll get depression and suicidal while attending it).

I also get hella anxious when I'm in a new environment and I feel like this trip is going to be less and less fun and more full of anxiety, depressive thoughts and maybe even some paranoia.

So there is this wish for getting a new friend and there is also this fucked up feeling of anxiety that I'll be judged by everyone.

I don't think I made a very clear point of what is my problem, because even I don't know it completely.. I'm just super afraid, anxious and overall get in a very panicked state when being put into a new environment and/or around new people. I am going to be put into both of those in three days time for twelve days and I have already had about ten brakedowns about it in the past week. 

I won't ask my parents to cancel the trip because I would very much like to have this experience of going to an awesome island with a super cool program. And my parent's aren't going which is really cool, but it still gives me some iffy feelings about it.

At least I know three people that will go as well, but they're all professors and I'm on good terms with two of them, the last one didn't teach me, but did teach my brother (they hated eachother).

How should I go about finding a new friend for the trip (and hopefully after it as well) while also dealing with all kinds of anxiety about it?

Does anyone have any suggestions for how to approach someone and getting to know them without being weird/awkward?

And how the hell can I tell talking to people interested in being friends with me from talking to people who'll give me disasterous nightmareish interaction PTSD by observing them?

Should I just nope out of the whole thing and spend that time alone at home where I know I'll feel safe?

I appreciate any and all help from you guys :)",10Feb2020,1

817,"I have witnessed a YouTuber disappear from the internet completely. They deleted every single video of theirs, every social media profile, there is no way to contact them, and the reasoning behind all of this will forever remain a mystery.  

Now, there is another niche YouTuber I like. Thing is, I've been thinking of downloading and preserving all of their videos to ensure the content won't get lost if something similar happens. But is it the right thing to do?? Wouldn't the person want their videos to be gone forever?

818,"Please read fully this is very serious and I have ran out of options. Ok so I’m going to start this with a basic timeline of my life the past year or so. I’m 20 now.i know it’s long and rambling I’m sorry. 

About a year or so from today I used to be a different person. I used to be funny, everyone liked me, I had many friends and would hang out with them often. I used to go to the gym 5 days a week, and on weekends I would go to raves almost every weekend. I started dating this girl who I was friends with previously, things were going well however I seemed to always have some issues with her such as jealousy, or her not giving enough affection etc. 
We moved in together and started spending a lot of time together. I would still hang out with my friends when I had the time. I started smoking weed daily. Also doing other drugs, LSD,Molly, Ketamine, coke etc. 
Almost a year ago as of today my father passed away. We had a great relationship other than the fact that he was an alcoholic. And at the end of our relationship I hated him. Now I very much regret the decision I made to never speak to him when he tried often. Slowly my friends stopped hanging out with me.(not because of the drugs) I stopped going to the gym. Stopped going to raves. My father was my mom’s punching bag, she would often treat him like he wasn’t the man who supported our family for so long. His drinking had taken a massive toll on our family and only after his death we realized how terribly we had all treated him in the end. So I became my mom’s new punching bag, as my grades started to fall. I stopped caring about anything. I would come home to be yelled at constantly only to hide in my room for the night. My girlfriend treated me like shit getting angry and talking to me in a negative manner for so long the flame of love I had for her slowly faded away as well. I had taken acid one night with a few friends and it totally messed me up bad it took weeks to recover. I couldn’t have normal social interactions for a while, I thought. I was so emotionally broken that I would cry most of the day, I found kratom and began taking that daily. Thinking it was helping as it would keep my emotions and issues out of my mind. Here I am today, living in an studio apartment. Living paycheck to paycheck. With no motivation. My mom still trying to control my life. With the same girlfriend still because she’s suicidal and if I break up with her it may cause her to do something rash. I still care about her. Still addicted to kratom. I have no friends left. I don’t go out anymore. I can’t have normal social interactions, I bore everyone I talk to now, I’m not funny anymore. I feel broken like something in my brain just isn’t working and I feel lost in how to get back to my former self. Not to mention my best friend just passed away a month ago. I know this is heavy but this is the only place I feel could actually help me.",10Feb2020,1

I started to freak out because i know he only told a couple people including me and he didn’t want anyone else to know. when he told me like 2 weeks ago, my other friend, Brandon, over heard my phone conversation and promised to keep it a secret. So i quickly overacted, when Eva asked that and yelled at Brandon “DID YOU TELL ANYONE”. he quickly replied “of course i didn’t why would I”.

I related to her a lot because we were at similar points in our life. I just found out that she died suddenly over the weekend. I feel really upset about it. When anyone dies, particularly a young person, it is upsetting. However this has completely floored and upset me. I feel like I cannot really talk about it in real life as I did not know her and only watched her videos occasionally and quite casually, but still. I feel so upset.

She was a small Youtuber and would not get many comments. I left her a comment on one of her last videos saying how much I had been enjoying her videos and a few days later I saw that she had screenshot it and put it on her Instagram stories saying it had made her day. She is gone now. I keep thinking of when she would speak about her plans for the year, how she would be graduating this year, what she wanted to do after graduation, her plans for next Christmas, etc. I feel so devastated that that has all been taken from her.

I (20M) need some help with my GF (19F).

So about 4-5 months ago It all went downhill, we had constant arguments and loads of shouting etc etc. I spoke to my brother about this, I spoke about her to my brother as if I hated her. I didn't speak very nice about her.

Couple days later, she went onto my phone and added her fingerprint (remember this as this bit is important)

She found out I said the stuff and we both promised it wouldn't happen again. We stopped the arguments, the fighting etc. But. 5ish months down the line, yesterday I had just woke up. I was half asleep but remember this happening as it was about 9am when I woke up to her leaning over me sleeping and take my phone and I was thinking to myself that shes on my phone, but we had promised not to do this. I wouldn't say shit, which I havent, I have kept myself calm in heated situations as I am one for loosing my temper, I take after people in my family.

But she was going through my phone. I pretended to cough and turned over / fully woke up, noticed she put my phone under the sheets but knew she had it. Fast forward to about 7pm the same day I go to the toilet but put my phone on the bedside table and go out the room.

I come back to see my phone on the bed next to her but I didn't say anything to her, even though I knew she was on it /going through it.

I just don't know what to do and I am seeking help. We are meant to bed going on holiday in about 10 weeks time, our first holiday aswell. All paid for.

828,"My friend has an 18 year old female dog. I believe a pomeranian/other small dog mix. My friend seems to be keeping her alive for herself, rather than for the dog’s benefit. I know she knows the dog’s quality of life is quite unacceptably low, but is 100% against the idea of euthanizing her dog, and understandably so, since she has had the dog since she was ten years old. But....I am wondering at what point it is basically torture and what you all might do in a similar situation. Whether your own dog, or trying to convince a friend. I’ll try to sum up the situation. Her dog doesn’t eat much at all. She has recently lost a lot of weight. She is both deaf and blind. She doesn’t play. She doesn’t even acknowledge when someone pets her. She doesn’t get up and walk, at all. She literally lays on a set of towels on top of a dog bed placed in the kitchen, and poops and pees in the same spot repeatedly. She is left alone all day when my friend and her boyfriend are at work, and they both work 12 hour night shifts. They have two other dogs and two cats they take care of. But this dog seems to just be a forgotten piece of furniture she keeps in the corner. As I am typing this, I am actually getting kind of angry and disgusted at my friend for this. The dog doesn’t really seem to be in pain thankfully, or if she is, she is unable to express the pain. She has even had seizures as well.....i just don’t understand the point of keeping her here....the bad days drastically outweigh any good days. This has been the situation for the past 3-4 years, and is rapidly getting worse and worse. My friend is financially capable of doing pretty much whatever she needs to do for her dog....and has given her a great life. I think my friend will look back on this and regret not acting sooner, because she will realize she kept the dog far past when she should have. Anyway, how does someone go about convincing a lifelong friend to euthanize their pet? This friend is stubborn as all hell, so please hit me with anything you’ve got lmao.",10Feb2020,1

830,"apologise now for this being so long.

My partner and I have struggled with addiction for the past 3 years (mainly ICE). Myself I have been able to go 6-9 months clean until I have found that my partner is still using by finding his stash, my partner has only ever made a week or 2 without caving. I have known for the past year that he has been using regularly (I am not oblivious or stupid, I know when he is using) and after my last slip (just before Christmas) I gave an ultimatum that he gets clean or I will leave. It is hard enough to stay clean, adding your partner using daily has made it that much harder.

I could tell last Thurs that he was trying to get clean all the signs were there. He was getting snappy, he is actually at home for hours, sleeping most of the time and feeling sick. I have tried to be supportive and ask him how I can help and he has declined saying he just has an illness until today when he finally said he is struggling. He was a heavy user and I had feared just 2 weeks ago that he had moved to injection over smoking when I found needles in his back pack. His withdrawal symptoms have been fairly normal or usual so far. Hot and cold chills, dizziness, lethargic but still has an appetite. 

He told me today that he is seeing and hearing things that are not there? Is that normal for a heavy user? He is starting to crack a bit and found him hitting his head against the fridge this afternoon while crying, saying he can't take it. I offered to call around and see if we could get him into a  program or at least get him to the doctor and maybe get a referral. He flat out refuses to hear it and says he can't deal with that right now. I don't know what else to do, our families do not know the struggle we have been going through. I haven't wanted to admit to them what has been going on. 

I don't know where else to turn. I know how it feels, this shit is tough, and I know it will be tougher for him as he was a habitual user for almost 3 years now. I got clean (if you can call it clean) cold turkey many times now and it has gotten harder after each slip. But I have never had hallucinations along with it.  I need him to stay clean and I am willing to do whatever it takes to help him. We have been together for 16 years and I am not going to give up on him. He has helped me throughy shit and I want to be there for him. But how? Any advice on how to approach the situation differently so I can get him the medical help he needs?",10Feb2020,1

833,"Advice would be appreciated on two issues: how to deal with the situation I'm about to explain and how to find discreet work.

My mother receives payment in order to care for my 'special needs.' I put thar in commas because I dont really have any; I have a mental condition but was deemed 'highly functioning', which basically means that I'm capable of living in society without help. However, being highly functioning would mean that my case isn't bad enough for our family to need extra money to take care of me, and my mother wasn't having that. So she lied to the government and told them that it was a lot worse than it was. We didn't need the extra money at all, we were actually pretty well off.

I don't see any of it. As far as I know it all goes towards things like buying fast food when she doesn't feel like cooking and going out with her friends. If it were up to me I'd be putting most if it away for when I move out, which is one of the reasons I want to start earning my own money.

Another reason though is that my mother used to give me an allowance to buy food for myself. Used to because a while ago the mental health payment was given to me for some reason, and now she'll want me to use that money instead. I don't want to though, because I want to save it! 

My mother thinks I can't be trusted with money (likely due to my 'special needs') and would likely try to 'look after' any money I make for myself. There's also the fact that if I were to get a legitimate part-time job the mental health payments would probably stop, since then there would be two people in the house earning an income. I wouldn't put it past her to take whatever percentage of my wages she thinks she needs to make up for it. 

I've heard about people marketing their hobbies and stuff, but I have no idea how. I need a discreet way to earn money that she would be unlikely to find out about if I managed to hide it well. Any tips on hiding money would be welcome too. Thanks in advance!",10Feb2020,1

The plate just happened to be a non microwave friendly plastic one but hey, it's not like i'm going to turn the damned thing on so i didnt think too much off it.

I sat in my kitchen for about 15 minutes eating and then afterwards i went out to a mates house.

I DID NOT turn the microwave on at any point after putting my leftovers in there and there was no one else in the house 

I came back 2 hours later to find my whole house (and my kitchen especially) filled with smoke. My fire alarms were not going off (weirdly) so i went inside. 

I found that the whole house stank of a burning, plasticy smell and was full of smoke which went up my nose and throat, it stang my eyes like hell for a while (probably caused by the burnt cayenne spice in the pasta sauce) and my throat felt like it was swelling up inside. I couldn't even breathe in kitchen so i opened all the windows and doors in the house to clear the smoke (it's really windy today so that helped)

Also i found that all my kitchen surfaces are coated in a very sticky sort of oil. [My cooking rack was near the microwave and it has this weird fuzzy stuff growing on it.](https://i.imgur.com/0Z71v4k.jpg)

[I had some eggs in a metal basket and they also looked weird, they had some of that oily sticky stuff on them but also had fuzzy stuff growing on them too](https://i.imgur.com/YO7XQqH.jpg)

I've cleaned up as best as i could but my house still stinks of burnt plastic, pasta and spice (might just be the smell lingering in my nose). 

I have so many questions.

1. What is the oily sticky stuff which has coated the surfaces of my kitchen ?

2. My throat feels swollen, my head and neck have started throbbing and hurting - If it gets worse ofcourse i will go to a doctor. Is this a sign of possible radiation poisoning or is it just an effect of inhaling toxic fumes from the burnt food and plastic plate ?

3. What the hell is the fuzzy stuff growing on my cooling rack and eggs ?

4. And ofcourse how the hell did my microwave manage to switch itself on 20 odd minutes after i had put my left overs in there ?

843,"Hey Redditors, I’m writing this after being in a lot of issues due to my family background. I am tired of how it is defining me and all my attempts to avoid that are in vain.

I grew up in quite a wealthy big city in America, but my parents moved back to their home country to take over my dad’s family business. Both of my parents changed a lot during this move and it kind of broke my contact with my family.

While in America, my parents were pretty normal - they still were wealthy but we were around similar people, I could make friends easily. Also, my cousins lived around (they are quite older than me but as teens they were excited to have a toddler in family) 

Moving to their home country, we started living in a small town. Added to our financial status and my parents grown in america, we were treated with a lot of attention. Also there was a language barrier and adding to it was that we were significantly wealthier than all people in the town except for the few relatives and extended family we knew, which basically reduced our social interactions to that group of people. They also resented our family, particularly because they were jealous of the attention we got. Most kept comparing their children’s skin tone, English skills etc to mine and hence the kids didn’t really become my friends. My parents also had a big fight about it and my mom took me with herself to europe (living in different countries) for around 6 years adding to my language barrier. They eventually got back together, I was first put into a school considered very popular and reputed in the town but I never found my fit in friend groups as most kids pretended to be my friend only because of the money I could spend on them. They expected me to foot all bills, once I was advised to book my birthday in a very expensive and popular hotel, and people attended took pictures and posted them on fb/snap without even mentioning my birthday and pretended they were there to celebrate an occasion. (My birthday is the same day as a holiday) later on, I was homeschooled with American qualifications for the rest of my school years.

I have a brother who was born after my parents reconciled, my dad bonded much more with him because we had grown apart due to my time in Europe. He fits in much better in the town as he knows the language and the people have accepted us more into the society. I blamed myself for not fitting in for a long time. I got a bit depressed but was able to hide it from my family. I always thought that I’ll get out of the town and go away for college, I worked really hard and finally got into a very popular university (reputed for the amount of rich kids it has) and also got into the dorm hall mostly full of kids from very well off families. I was super excited for it and thought I’d finally be able to be around similar people and make friends. 

I’m currently home for my break, going back soon. I spent last semester there not being able to fit in at all. Most people made fun of me for having expensive stuff, I was never invited to anywhere, If I was I was mostly out of conversations or expected to pay for something. I once uploaded a pic wearing some expensive clothes (they weren’t very obvious) and someone linked the thing in comments and remarked how expensive that thing was. I didn’t get any attention in like most after exams parties until I went on a luxury trip with my cousins to de stress. I had people asking me about it, some people who hadn’t even talked to me.

I tried everything I could, tried to fit in as a not rich kid. I literally went shopping to get cheaper clothes, shoes and hid all my expensive stuff. After trying hard with no success, I did go to my rich kid instincts doing some shitty things, like over indulging on alcohol, drugs and parties. (I’m not addicted tho lol) Going back to my expensive clothing options wearing designer stuff casually and all, I definitely got attention but I feel I also got a lot of negative attention. I’m trying my best to break free from my family that is kinda abusive and want others to do exactly as they (family) desires. I’m home for the break already begging to get back and go away from them. Also they do some things that I resent, they mess with laws in their businesses, which also hurt a lot of people. They literally bought out my cousin from a court trial by somehow proving the guy he killed in a hit and run ‘insane and mentally challenged’, they didn’t pay out anything to his family but some fake witness and police to falsify stuff. The guy was working hard supporting his family of 4. Although I didn’t ever think I could cut them off, but I definitely want to minimise my contact with my family in the future by a large extent. I don’t know how to fit in with people, I’m scared they will avoid me if I don’t spend money on them. I’ve never met a person who genuinely wants to be my friend. Even my girlfriend of 4 years herself admitted that a part of why she was with me was my family’s reputation. (We both are from similar families) She wanted to be in the same social status level. 

I’m tired of all that, I’ve felt extremely bad because of all of this and my relationships have started to suffer. Every time I meet a new person, my mind immediately goes to - what does this person want out of me?. 

Also I’ve been dealing with the difference between the social levels in a big city and a small town. I’ve thought of going to therapy to deal with trauma from all of the stuff my family did, but I don’t know how to start. IDK what I’ll say to the therapist. Also I wouldn’t wanna get the stuff about my family leaked out to public. I genuinely have no Idea what I wanna do, people always assume my life is perfect due to my family, everyone projects how happy and perfect they are and each of my family member prides themselves for doing that. In reality I have no idea about what to do and I hate all the luxury facilities I have, I’m paranoid about posting pictures as I feel people with again make fun of my clothes, home etc. Even on here I see people immediately getting to the conclusion that a privileged person hasn’t done any work and has a very easy life. But trying to fit in the societal definition of what a price legend kid is has taken a toll on me. I wish I could start afresh completely but I think I gotta do with the new semester in my uni. Sorry for long post, had to vent it out. Any advice is appreciated!",10Feb2020,1
844,"My mom recently joined Monat which, for those who don’t know, is an MLM company for hair care products and whatnot. She’s having a really hard time getting anything off the ground as is and not only do I know this lack of success is emotionally affecting her, I also am almost certain that it’s not going to change towards more success. 

She and my dad refuse to believe my brother and I when we talk about how it’s a scam, even when we show them articles and lawsuits against the company.  And on top of this my mom wants me and my brother to become “market partners” so she can get some bonuses or something. She doesn’t see an issue since she’s offering to pay for it but I really don’t wanna be involved in this. She won’t try and make me but I know she’ll be really hurt if I don’t go along with it.

My mom has spent her life working in the service industry. She could have pursued bigger things but she chose to have a family and pour her energy into that instead. Now that my brother and I are adults, I can tell she’s struggling with finding meaning in her life. I want her to have something she can call her own and put time into that will bring her joy. And she wants that as well which I believe is why she’s so committed to this.

I love my mom and I want to help her. Not only do I have moral objections to this company, it doesn’t even seem like a possibility for her to succeed in it anyway. Does anyone have any thoughts or potential solutions on what I can/should do to help?

tl;dr: my mom joined Monat, wants me to be involved too, I want her to have a hobby/side hustle that isn’t a MLM scheme. Plz help.",10Feb2020,1
845,"My parents have been divorced for about 8 years and have never dated or remarried since then. About three years ago, I was on vacation with my dads side of the family and my Nana told me that the reason my parents weren’t married in a Catholic Church was because my mom had already been married before. This was news to me since I had never ever had any clue that she was married to anybody before my dad. I was very upset by this but decided to move on like I never heard it. I pretended to not believe it. I have never confronted her about it because I fear the chance of ruining what I think of as the most important relationship in my life. I am so close with my mom to the point where it really shocks me to know that she has been hiding such a huge secret for so long. Today, as I was shuffling through our box of important paperwork to find my social security card I noticed that some envelopes were addressed to my moms first name with a last name that I had never seen before. After snooping, I found many things among their paperwork for divorce. So it’s true my mom was married before my dad and she never told myself or my brother. I don’t know what to do about it and I hate feeling so uneasy. Should I ask her about it now that I am older and more understanding?

So, I've been in a school with my old friends for like 7 years. Here most of the people move after the 7th year, trying to get in ''better schools''. My friends went to other schools . So after I got accepted in a new school in 2018 (the one I go to now) I was super excited then but after the first day I realised it's fricking terrible. Ngl I've been feeling sort of depressed/sad/stressed since I had moved.

1.Most of my classmates are fucking dickheads, I am good with only like 2 of them, but the problem is that they are going to move the next year, so I'll be alone.

2. The teachers are so fucking horrible/mental.

3. The school schedule is awful.

Now it's 2020 and since 2018 I've been telling my parents to let me move and go to any other school with any of my old friends in, but they keep refusing and keep telling me that the current school is good and I have to deal with the difficulties.

TL;DR - My school is shit, how do I make my parents let me switch schools?",10Feb2020,1

Me and my manager have been very close for a while, almost 6 months now. I recently got promoted last November, due to them helping me. But recently, there has been a lot of drama between me and my manager. At least, to me I see it, perhaps not them.

Around August/Septemberish time, it became aware to me that my manager had a huge craving for a certain dessert and coffee place. Me being me, I decided I would get them some. It became almost a weekly routine, but then that turned into them almost expecting it from me. I never really thought anything of it until my associates brought it up that I almost get nothing in return. This isn't a huge deal, but something I've been thinking about.

Recently, my co-workers have also brought up that my manager has been saying some negative things about me, such as they can't trust me, they don't think I belong here, etc., Despite my manager telling me I am one of their highest HiPo candidates, they want me to get promoted ASAP, etc. 

I brought this up with my manager, but almost everytime I do bring something up with them, they get very defensive and almost never take any sort of blame. I.e. rewind to around December of last year, I was living in my car, while trying to work on a promotion. During a training session with my trainee, my manager yelled at me for talking with my trainee, even though we were talking about work and such. I told my direct supervisor I didn't feel comfortable working in that sort of environment, and my manager just said that if I didn't feel comfortable, then it was nice working with me.

So, idk where to start, so I'll start from the beginning. My family is pretty Christian: God, Jesus and all that stuff. I am participating in school ""religion"" subject which talks about that stuff. Since I remember I always took part in those lessons, then my parents broke up when I was in 6th grade, I live now with my mom and stepfather. When I was attending ""confirmation sacrament"" priest who was teaching us was awful, he said bad things about everyone for no reason, eventually someone broke onto his account and one of ""animators"" he worked with (Animators we're pepple who taught us things about religion in confirmation peroid) and eventually leaked nudes from one of the animators. Of course priest got a word from one of my classmates that ""OP has high IT knowledge and they did it"" (keep in mind that I didn't do it) and eventually they took it to the police and nothing came out of it so far. I wasn't attending this subject cause my mother was sick of this situation (she's kinda a Karen) and got me dismissed from Religion class, which I enjoyed cause I went home early and didn't have to listen to that ""blood into wine"" stuff again. Now confirmation thing was about 8th grade, later I graduated and got into the same school (we have a school complex).
To my enjoyment the priest wasn't teaching there anymore due to many complaints. After that, my mother signed me up for those religion lessons again, we got new priest who eventually turned religion lessons into sex ed.

So I’ve had the same 3 friends from when I was 11-16, they’re the sort of friends ur parents really like because they’re a “good influence”. I’m at college now and I’ve met more friends and our friend group has gotten larger. I’m now friends with lots of different people. These new friends go to parties, hookup with people, go on tinder/grindr/yubo, take drugs and just have an all round good time. This sort of stuff really appeals to me, like ik it’s not healthy or good I’ve just got that sort of “you only live once” attitude. 

Anyway my old friends do not agree with this sort of thing. Especially my best friend who is completely against smoking and doing drugs, which sounds good in theory but she is sort of ignorant and close minded when it comes to other people’s views. 

This makes me feel like I have to choose a lifestyle: stay at home all day long and watch my youth fade away, or go out partying. So I obviously don’t wanna completely destroy my life partying, but I also want to live a little and not live a boring life. 

So idk whether to stick by my old friends, despite our very different ideas of a good time, join my new friends completely or try and mix with both which could lead to me having no friends. 

So yeh, help would be greatly appreciated lol",10Feb2020,1

886,"Hello everyone! English isn't my first language so sorry in advance if there are some mistakes.

Sorry for the long post.

I know one of my coworker (let's call him Greg) has a little crush on me since december. He never said it or made inapproriate comments, I know it because his manager (in my company most employees have a friendly relationship w/ their boss) asked me how I felt about him during our Christmas party because he often had talked about me, and telling me how Greg is such a nice guy. I said really politely he wasn't my type + I'm not into relationships with coworkers.

Every friday we have an afterwork with some of my colleague , I barely spoke to him since I started in September, we're not really close. I know I'm often really cheerful (and also 90% of the time the only girl at the afterworks) but I've never did/say anything that could have lead him into thinking I was potentially interested.

Last week, Greg and I weren't near each other in the bar so we couldn't speak in person, he then started to send me messages on Whatsapp (he has my number because we're in the same group chat) asking about my day, if I left the bar when I went outside to smoke and expressed relief when I came back,...

I'm staying polite and nice but it’s making me really uncomfortable as I know he is into me but I can’t say anything without telling him what his manager told me and I don’t want to create a trust issue between them. Also I’m always nice to everybody else so I don’t want him to feel like he’s the only one I don’t want to talk with.

He sent me texts today (he never did this before last Friday) but I didn’t even open them, I don’t know what to do as I don’t want to do anything that could hurt him or let him think it’s reciprocal.

892," 

I am a 15m in high school(freshman) I've hit a wall. Actually, I hit this wall a long time ago. I've been struggling to stay myself. To remain positive, to remain...well, to remain me. I've had some troubles with friends, we have gotten past all that. There are a few kids current who are bugging the shit out of me and I either want to hit them in the face or run and hide like a little bitch. For reference on this first kid, I am came out as gay in eighth grade. Something happened, it took me months to get over(it happened in april 2019-i got over it in october 2019). When entering high school you are bound to get new students and people you don't know and I get that. But without prompting this kid decides to sit with us(my friends and I). At first we were fine with it, welcome the new kid. But, we soon learned that this kid was nothing but someone looking for attention trying to find out every detail about our lives and just involving himself in everything we did. We tolerated it for a while until we gave up on trying to get him away from us. We still don't like him and try to avoid him but will talk if needed to. Anyway my crush(who is in our group and is straight) is publicly known in my group and everyone is fine with it. We talked about it a couple times and this kid heard. For 3 months all he asked me was do you still have a crush on him? What do you think about this guy? whatever the fuck. I eventually told him to stop and he did but he keeps pestering me about other stuff. He acts like he is smarter than everyone and I'm done. Today in class we ran out of time as I was asking him to clarify an argument he said during a class discussion. As class ended he came up to me and said ""Look if everyone likes and agrees with what you say you can say it but if not, shut up and don't say it because than no matter what you are wrong"". That really pissed me off. The other kid, well he has a history of bullying and other crap(broke a kids nose in fifth grade) and I got parred in a group with him. First thing he says is ""you have to carry me"" and then he keeps asking me for things like erasers, rulers, how to draw this, what am I doing again. I got annoyed at the very end when he was trying to get me to keep his work safe for him when he could have asked the teacher or kept it safe himself and he was being an asshole all of class. Needless to say its been a couple days and he still is calling me ""rude and immature"" as well as stupid.

Another thing that is bugging me(different than these two people) is that we have a music trip to Disney in a couple months and I haven't found a group. All my friends find their own groups and all that stuff before I can ask and such and I'm just there, no one asks me to be in a group, no one cares. There is a rule can't be with opposite sex or with a partner in the hotel room(4 people per). One of the kids listed above(the first one) also does not have a group. I don't feel comfortable around him and am going to tell my band director and such but I don't know what to do about the next concern. High school while it is getting more accepting of lgbtq+ students, there are still most people who make gay jokes and insults. I'm scared(i'm pretty open about being gay) that if I get paired with people they will not be comfortable around me and sleeping in a bed(2 people per bed) with me. I don't like making people uncomfortable and I know jokes are going to be made. The trip is 5 days and 4 nights and I really want to enjoy myself but I don't know how.

I'm also very emotionally tired. Its hard to do anything. All I can do is fake a smile, pretend like I'm ok. But, I can't do that anymore. I'm done faking a smile, I'm done trying to be happy and I don't know what to do. I'm scared about the Disney trip, about the jokes and whatever may happen. I don't like the fact that I have to deal with these two assholes who think I can either carry them or that I have to shut up.

But up until then, me being like 25 at that point I've never figured out how like.. women bodys are suppose to work sexually? I've never masturbated (I don't think? I've told other people I've gotten like.. ""an itch"" feeling. But since it's never like, activated sexually friends don't think that counts) And I'm still genuinely confused on a lot of things around that area. (I never thought I'd ever actually start seriously dating someone so it was never a problem until recently lol)

 I've already asked a few of my close female friends but there's still some areas I'm worried about like- if it's just a normal thing or what.

So things I have figured out: I \*can\* in fact, get horny. Even though I'm still for sure really low on the sexual drive when I do. I only seem to get wet though as a result? Is there like, supposed  to be more to it than that? 

My other concern is there may be some actual health concern issues aside from just the sexual disconnection. And that is that the main reason I never try to masturbate I feel like, is being rubbing in that area after just a few minutes makes that area feel really raw and sore? Will get painful so I'll have to stop and just leave it be.

SO thinks that could be normal and in the case where I could feel the ""Good feels"" from the sexual aspect of it, those would overrule the pain part but I'm not so sure. Seems like it's probs not suppose to hurt? But maybe it's a case of tolerance and build up I've never actually built up? 

I've already done lots of online research but I'm still confused and would appreciate any help- thanks!

896,"Car in question has been totaled and moved to an auto repair store. They are giving 3500 for it, and the same car but in better repair is 4500 at a used car dealership. 

Now there's an option to negotiate with the insurance to see if it's possible to get a better quote on the car (since the wreck wasn't the driver's fault and 100% the truck that backed up into them's fault.)  But the same car for 4500 at the used car dealership is first come, first serve, and could be gone by the time the negotiation is finished. This would mean having to look for a different car for cheaper that could cost more in repairs than the actual price of the vehicle.

The other option is to sign over the title of the car, taking the 3500 (which means negotiation with the insurance isn't possible anymore) and seeing if negotiation with the car dealership is possible, paying the rest out of pocket. This, more or less, might require a loan but Im not sure yet. 

The only issue, is that the car dealership is over and hour and a half away, and with work and everything, it would take until late into the afternoon to even pull it off. On top of that, the car should be inspected and inspection sights close at almost an hour or so before we arrive, making it a close call.

900,"i'm 15 and in eighth grade (2 years ago) one of my closest friends told me she liked me. she did it in a really creepy way by leaning into my ear after making me guess who it was and whispered it was me. i said something like ""you're probably just realizing that you love your friends in a friend way"" because i was stupid and 13 years old. still i think it was a clear ""no.""

after she would walk super close to me and force me to sit next to her and do things like only stare at my lips when i talked. and one time after lunch me and my friends were sitting in the gym and playing truth or dare and i was sitting out because i don't like that game and somebody asked her something like ""do you have a crush"" and she got up and leaned over me and got suuper close to my face. i know the physical stuff she did to me could be worse but it still made me feel super uncomfortable and gross.

i went to a catholic school in elementary and middle school and they run stuff a little differently there. at my school, you were assigned to a class and you went around to different classes with the same people everyday. i didn't have any other friends in that class other than her so i got very depressed and anxious very quick. enough to contemplate suicide wayy too often and i got too close to it. that whole year was hell and i wish i never even talked to that girl. there's one night i got home from school and i was home alone. i just started like wailing/crying because everything felt so awful and i couldn't stop.

i never told her about it. she even asked me ""did i do something"" and i said no she didn't. i've always hated confrontation but i think about that moment a lot and i wonder if i should've said something.

i've talked to my therapist and the only reason why i'm still dealing with it now is because i never let myself process it. every time i do something that reminds me of her or the person i used to be it makes me want to scream and throw up. i'll even look in the mirror too closely and get the same reaction, or i get surprised that i look like the way that i do. i don't know who i am because half of my childhood up until now is filled with her. i just want to forget about it and move on but it seems impossible at this point. now i'm anxious about things i've never been anxious about, like scary movies, and (duh) having crushes. whether it's somebody's crush on me or my crush on them everything seems like it's 10x scarier than it should be.

901,"Hi everyone,

First off, I hope I'm not being trivial with this, as ice read some rather heart-breaking stories on this sub, but I don't know what to do.

I (27M) have a birthday night out coming up this week. I don't usually do anything for my birthday, but this year I decided to do something. I don't have many friends and it's something I've been working through with therapy over the last few months. However, I've managed to actually organise a relatively large pub crawl with some people from work. I was genuinely really excited as I've never had this experience before. 

Two people in this group, Person A (28F) and Person B (24F), do not like each other very much. Person B dislikes A much more than the other. I had only initially invited B as part of the group as person A doesn't work within our office anymore (promotion to another site an hour away) and I hadn't heard from them since just before Christmas, however I have been friends with this person for 7 years and used to be relatively close. I had said to B that A wasn't invited, purely due to radio silence for a while and assumed she wasn't interested.

I was messaged out of the blue by A saying she missed me and wanted to catch up. I had a feeling that she was probably hinting at my birthday as she knew that was this week. I avoided the subject by talking about how she's getting on. As I wanted to discuss with B because I knew this was an issue for her.

I feel awful for not including A because I know what it's like to be left out. I was losing sleep due to the guilt. So I approached B today explaining how I felt. B was not happy. Long story short, she said I was being unfair and selfish to her putting her in that situation. 

I also found that A had definitely found out about this meet up and is upset with me. B is refusing to come if A is in invited and won't talk about it with me. I know how B works and tends to have no mercy with her friendships ie will cut them out of her life with  no hope of return. 

My dilemma is:

Person A is someone I have been friends with for a long time. Though we don't speak much now, due to working else where, we used to be very close. She would happy to be civil for me if the other person attended. However chances are I probably won't speak to her again for months after. She would be hurt if I didn't choose her and may no longer speak to me at all.

Person B I have known for a while but not as long as A. I speak to her regularly at work and apart from this episode, we get on really well. She would be angry if I chose the other and will refuse to be my friend if i made that decision. I would still have to work with her regularly if we did fall out. I also inadvertently, but nonetheless, say that A wasn't coming and I had invited her first.

I don't know what to do. I like them both and the night would be great for me if they both came. I didn't mean to upset anyone, I just wanted to have a good night with some people who've made me a little happier over the last year. I feel sick thinking about it and am wracked with guilt. Am I being selfish? Should I have stuck to my guns and not have suggested the other person?

I just want to have fun with my friends. I'm sorry again if this seems trivial, this is very big for someone like me.

903,"So I've been a bit hesitant to open up about this because it was such a complicated situation. First, I'd like to give a little background information. I am Native American and I'm also half Irish. My last name is Scott's-Irish and come from the native side. One of my first ancestor arrived here in 1810 and married the daughter of a chieftain. Subsequently, that side of my family remained in Native territories, went through atrocities, and landed in the Midwest/South. I dropped out of highschool half way through my sophomore year, and I come from a low socioeconomic background as well. I'm currently working my ass off to earn a BS. In highschool I was a straight F student. I got my GED before my class graduated, took two years off to save money for school, though I am now heavily reliant on loans and working during the summer to save for the coming semesters. I have a 3.5 GPA that I work very hard to maintain. 

Last fall, I was nominated for a multicultural academic recognition award. There was the added bonus of an actual ceremony for it. Being a HS drop out, I never got to walk for graduation. I never was given awards because I had a terrible GPA when in school, and once I was out of it, there were no awards for GED students. I was absolutely elated to be invited to my first academic recognition award ceremony. I worked very hard to earn this and I finally had the opportunity to feel good about how much of my time and life I've sacrificed for this. I've set aside my social life even to focus on my studies. 

I went to the event feeling anxious the whole way there. All I could think was ""I'm too white aren't I?"" When I got there, there's was only one other white person. He's native too, and has more blood and a higher GPA than I have. I suddenly didn't feel so alone. But here's where the realization, shock, and sadness set in. No one sat by us, and we were at a table that could seat 8. Once we were called to walk and get our awards, no one clapped. I have never been in such an uncomfortable situation. 

I've been invited by my college again, and I'm hesitant to go. I've worked so hard for recognition of my education but I feel like such an outsider. I also recognize that I have not had to deal with the extent of discrimination other minorities face. I almost feel embarrassed that I decided to go the first time even.

920,"I recently hired a young man (Hindu) from India. Fron what I understand in India they do not use toilet paper, but use water to clean themselves after dropping the kids off at the pool. Fine by me, do as you please to your own body.

The issue is that he has a bottle that he fills from the water cooler to accomplish this cleaning. We are a small company of three employees, and since his start we have more than doubled our drinking water usage. Is there any religious or other reason why he needs to use this water from the water cooler, or can he just use the sink? The water cooler water is much more expensive, and is intended to be used for drinking. How do I ask him not to do this without being awkward or offending him?",10Feb2020,1
921,"My boss had a heart attack about a month ago. He was the first good boss I have had in awhile. He always stood up for me. Always tried to make me happy if he saw that I got sad. He would over look certain things. He would trust me to do my job. I was his go-to person for everything. It made my anxiety better. It made me believe in myself. It made me not want to die. I had horrible anxiety and depression for years and for the first time I felt truely happy. Then he had the heart attack and I felt like my world just died. I cried for a week. I got so worried about him. I texted him here and there. He told me that he missed us, not the work, just us. It hurt me so much. I asked if he wanted us to visit, got no answer. He texted me a couple of days ago asking if working the next day. I told him no and asked why. He said he wanted to visit. I asked what time since I could just drop by to see him. Said he would tell me in the morning. We kept on talking. I told him I cried a lot . That i felt guilty. He told me he blames himself for this, I told him I disagreed. He asked how work was to me. I told him i was moving to a new section. I told him he would be fine and soon everything will be back to normal and made a joke about trusting me because I worked in hospitals before. He texted back asking what are the chances of him dying. Said they told him he has a 99% chance of recovery. I told him he will be fine. That soon he will be able to work and drive and other stuff. He texted back saying ""but you won't be there"". It kinda caught me of guard. I asked why, said because of my transfer. I said i could move back and asked if he really wanted to come back to us again (we are a high stress department). Got no answer. 

The next morning he didn't text me. When I found out from my coworkers he was there and didn't tell me i asked him why. Said he had to control the group of people and got distracted. Said I could babysit for him. I made a joke about being bad with kids. 

One day after he texted me again in the morning saying he might visit. I got excited since I really missed him and just wanted to see and talk to him again. When he showed up, he didn't text me he was there. When I asked if he was, he said maybe. Told him i was gonna go on break. He said he was leaving soon. When i saw him it was like he wasn't interested in talking to me. It was like he was ignoring everything i was saying. Not even listening to me. It hurt. So much. I just wanted to talk to him a little. But he seemed not interested. I hugged him and he just walked away without saying bye. Said he wanted to go see someone else. It made me feel like shit. It felt like a cruel joke. Having him always tell me he was gonna show up, but then never tell me when he was there or just ignore me.

 I didn't understand what i did wrong. I honestly feel so stupid for caring so much. It just goes over in my head again and again about why he would ask if i was going to be at work, but then never tell me when he shows up. Why he would say ""but you won't be there"". I worry about him a lot and did. I worry about his emotional state after this. I want to help, but after this idk how to even feel. Idk why he even did what he did. It just makes me feel stupid for caring. I want to be there for him in his time of need (I know he has a family and such), but having other people there may help things idk...i just don't really know if I should continue to care or see if he's okay or what. Any advice on what to do???",10Feb2020,1

I made it very clear to all my employees that they absolutely needed to make their scheduled shifts as I was heading out of state to see my family that I haven't seen in years. 

Today my opener didn't show up. We are a small crew of 4 people, myself included, and the other two wouldn't come in. So my boss tells me today that if I can't get ahold of the original opener I'm going to have to make the 8 hour drive home and open tomorrow.

923,"So my brother got physically with a girlfriend when he was a teenager 20 years ago. At this point he was sober, helping his girlfriend stay clean and building his own house.

A week later he was arrested because she claimed the night she was arrested he choked her. She never needed to be taken taken to the hospital or anything when she was arrested.

She got a lawyer and is now taking him to court for attempted murder. I'm hearing all this second hand from my mom. I'm worried about my brother, but I don't want to victim shame his ex either. I'm obviously biased but I just don't believe  my brother who flinches at tiny dogs would try to strangle his ex. She was addicted to pills and I think meth. So she's not exactly a sturdy source.

924,"Okay so I recently (3 months ago) had an issue with my IUD and it came out after having it for over 5 years. When I had it I had virtually no periods or cramps and if I did they would be like once every 2-3 months

I did have a regular period again in the short period of time where I had no IUD, and it was like how it was for me before having an IUD and it was medium-heavy for around 3 days

Now I do have a new IUD again, same brand too, and my first period has been heavy and more crampy and it is now day 6 and it hasn’t really slowed down a lot. I’m kind of worried because I read online if it goes to be over a week it could be signs of an infection or pregnancy or cancer etc but I’m not really sure",10Feb2020,0

Now that the days get longer, and I have ≈2 weeks where I don't see her because of an internship we're doing, I am certain that I want to tell her as soon as possible. My thoughts. I simply don't know how to tell her and with what I should follow it up. I think that telling her and asking for a date would be the normal approache but it might be that I'm completely wrong.

927,"\[Repost from AITA sub\]

About a month ago I had attempted three different times to make plans with my brother to hang out. I had recently found out that our adoptive father looked at me and my sister sexually growing up and needed a distraction and some comfort.  All three times he canceled the day of saying that his gf was upset that he wasn't spending time with her. I got really upset the third time and sent a message to her asking why she made him cancel three times in a row, could we please be adults and talk this out because its making me upset. She ignored my message and proceeded to yell at my brother for me contacting her and from that point on made a huge issue every time I tried to have any contact with him.

At some point I messaged my brother asking when we would ever be able to hang out, to which he told me that she felt they never got time together despite living together, and that I had to wait until her wrath blew over. I basically ended up saying ""Maybe if she stopped acting like a cunt and didn't cause fights literally every time I'm over there, you'd want to spend time with her. If she wants to spend time, she needs to ask and plan it instead of making you cancel yours.""

A few days later, she went through his phone while he was sleeping and read our texts. I'm now banned from going over to where they are staying, even though it isn't their house. She also wont let my brother play on the PS4 with me or text me until I apologize.

I told her I wouldn't apologize until we had a talk, mainly because I don't know what exactly I'm apologizing for, dont want to make an apology I dont mean, and I feel like if she went snooping and got hurt by it, she got what she deserved.

I have since apologized for calling her a c\*nt, she refuses to look at the message. She also sent me a 6 paragraph message that is all essentially gas-lighting.

I'm sure he isn't telling me the whole story, but also knowing about all of his unmanaged mental health issues and what he's told me, he won't break things off with her due to both not feeling like he could ever find anyone else to be with, and fear of not having a place to live.

Thing is, I had zero issues with his gf before this, we've never gotten into a fight or had any disagreements of any sort. I even explained to her why I felt the way I did when I said what I said, apologized for the rude names I called her, but no matter what I said to her, her response only got more and more emotionally charged. Its clear she never even read what I said, and just kept escalating how bad the whole ordeal was, even after I apologized.

I know at this point I need to just let it go, but my autistic side is getting me to the point where I can't even sleep at night because of how angry I am that my reasoning and apology is going ignored while she's throwing wild accusations that I ""wanted to make her cry, and that I wanted to make her shitty year even shittier.""

All I wanted was some comfort from my brother after finding out that our adoptive father looked at me and my sister sexually our entire lives. I needed comfort and got canceled on three times in a row. I don't believe my brother to be a shitty enough person to cancel on me when he knew why I was asking for him. I also know that it had my state of mind altered when I said all those nasty things. Not an excuse by any means, but a cause.

She also claimed to work through and deal with her issues with my brother, but with how she's handling our first 'fight', I have reason not to believe her on that.

I bought him a PS4 and RDR2 right before this happened, so we can play together and as soon as she finds out he's playing with me I hear yelling and he goes offline. His place was the only place I could see him, and now I cant see him at all because she doesn't want me over at the place their staying (A friends house, not even their place. I could totally understand not being welcome in their room, but it isnt even their house.)

I'm sorry for ranting, I'm just so confused at this point.",10Feb2020,2

930,"Sorry for the long text and my grammar mistakes I'm not a native English speaker. 

[we both go to therapy] 

We dated for one year and three months until the last November when she breaks up with me, we tried to make things work again and it was working but for a number of reasons everything got worse.

We are both 18 and we have know each other since we were 16, we were classmates then we became friends after that  best friends, I became her confidant and number one supporter and she became mine. Eventually we began dating. She was the first one to fall in love this happened when we're just friends and I knew about but I didn't wanted a relationship because I thought it wasn't the time (I did have strong feelings towards her and I told her) , we graduated high school and enter college and I ask her if she still wanted a relationship luckily she said yes and we became a couple.

I been supporting her since day one in all the aspects of her life, her sexuallity (she is bi i knew that since the beginning and I've always supported her because everyone deserves love and respect), her insecurities, her fears, her dreams and her career choices, also she lives in an abusive family (cruel mother absent father), in a few words I been supporting her unconditionally for years and she did the same thing for me.

I open up to her in many ways, I always thought that I needed to be strong cause I was a man and a big brother but with her I feel safe... I feel I can show my emotions and insecurities...

It was a beautiful relationship full of love, support, and comunication, we were open about everything our dreams, our likings and dislikings our desires and fantasys, we shared the same values and ideals. We were a team... A family... 

We talked every day since February of 2017, for hours a day it didn't mater how weird, normal or tabbo was the topic we enjoyed talking with each other. 

We also had a lot of physical attraction for each other to the point we lusted for each other...we never had sex, we both wanted to be the others first time and wanted it to be special. 

Sometimes when we talked at night she would say in her sleep that she wanted to marry me and be my wife... To be honest I also dreamed about that. 

She once said I was the closest thing to a loving family she ever had. 


Now you are probably wondering why everything ended well... I have a pretty serious face and I don't smile often... She always told me she loved that of me cause it makes me see so mature, secure of myself and calm... Well at the end it did affect her even though I was always emotionally there for her, I always told her how much I loved her and how happy she made me. I always asked her how she felt about us and if could anything to make things better and she said everything was perfect. Because of that the break up took me by surprise and it shocked me to the core...

We tried to make things work again and for a while it did... Thing got worse in her household and she became emotionally unstable... One day she loved me and the next one she didn't felt anything for me... This really affected me I used to be secure of myself, always positive of the future and cheerful all the time... But her changes of mood and feelings began to make me loose myself I became fearfull because of how many times I had hope of becoming a couple and my feelings been crushed. 

I promised her to never abandon her (she believes everyone will do it eventually), but some of her actions makes me feel she is pushing me away while other are asking me to stay. 

It was a really really emotional relationship and it meant so much to me... I still love her and she still loves me (?) but we are hurting each other and I don't want to hurt her more... I would give anything for her, to be with her but her current state is hurting me... Im willing to endure it but she says I deserve someone better and all of that... 

She still says we are a family and a team... And it makes me happy but she is not capable of having a relationship in her current state... I will do my best to stay as close to her as possible and keep supporting her...  Because I still see her as my best friend and family...",10Feb2020,1

933,"Hey Reddit,

Currently going through a bit of a life dilemma that I’m hoping I could gather some insight on.

I’ll elaborate, but my current dilemma can be boiled down to this: do I go after financial security, or do I go after my passion?

I am currently going through the process to transfer my degree from B.Comm Finance to BSc Exercise Science. I worked as a research analyst at a small hedge fund/prop trading firm doing global macroeconomic fundamental analysis. I know that if I follow this career path I have the capacity to make a small fortune for myself if I work my ass off. The problem is that I hated going into work - it’s one thing working a 9-5 that you hate but it’s another when you’re working more of a 7-7. 

I have always had a passion for fitness/science and while working I would often find myself browsing the latest research in the field, completely absorbed in something that has no relation to my work. My friends and family noticed this and pushed me to go after what makes me happy, so I quit, became a personal trainer, and began the process of transferring my major to something that I actually care for.

In a lot of ways since then my quality of life has improved dramatically, my job satisfaction has sky rocketed, and I have made the decision to pursue a career as a physical therapist. Not to brag, but it’s clear that I am meant for this. I am interning at a physio clinic and I am finding things that the other therapists aren’t. I’ve given clients back their ability to lead pain-free lives. I’ve even facilitated a body transformation here and there - although the corrective/rehabilitative side is what interests me most. I have so much respect and appreciation for each and every one of my clients and I love them dearly. 

However, what I am realizing is that a physical therapist’s pay is not great and a career as a personal trainer is filled with uncertainty. I didn’t grow up with a lot of money so financial security is something I value. I recently got an offer to return as an analyst and the starting salary is twice what I’m making now and it has been lingering at the back of my head ever since.

If I knew somehow that I could make it as a physio/PT then I would do it in a heartbeat, but that lack of security is extremely daunting.

If you were in my shoes what would you do?

TL;DR take a big pay cut to work my dream job or go back to work in an office for a salary that BEGINS at paying double?",10Feb2020,1
934,"I had a roommate not long ago who was very stubborn about his views on the world and who would try to break me down to feel like shit. He would never change his mind about anything and would dismiss my reasoning and proof about the topic. I never raised my voice and never insulted him based on his views (people are more than that). One day we were talking about homeless people and he said something I didn't know how to respond to. He said that the homeless are all do nothing's who expect the world handed to them. I tried to say some examples of what the homeless do and reasons why they could be homeless and that nobody wants to be homeless, there is a reason it happened and it's different for everyone of them. But instead he just repeated his view and stood his ground. Crazy part about this is that they (him and his girlfriend) would have been homeless if I hadn't agreed to move in with them, a decision I regret. He then said that I think I'm better than him. I then told him it's not true and I went to bed sad and thinking I was a terrible person. I'm now not living there and am in a much better place mentally. Living with them was draining and they are no longer part of the friend group (the girlfriend had many instances of insulting us, calling us names and overall just bringing us down, making us sad and especially me, cry). My friends are thinking of being friends with her again but definitely not him. Even though they are dating we would explain that we don't want to see him and that he can't be a part of anything we do together so that he can't hurt us.

938,"This is a crosspost with r/legaladvice, and im fairly new to reddit so i apologize if i formatted incorrectly.

I'm a student at a high school in New Mexico, and we have a drama teacher who has repeatedly shown signs of pedophilia/ creepy behavior that we have reported many times, to no avail. I know that's a very loaded accusation so I will elaborate.

This man has now been teaching at this school for 3-4 years, and now it seems that at least once a year, he has done something like barging into the girls dressing rooms unannounced, walking into girls hotel rooms without warning, and regularly invades the personal space of females in the department. The first incident (That I have heard of) occurred a few years ago, before I attended the school, where he walked straight into a room designated for girls to change between scenes. According to those who were in the room, he took a long look around before someone jumped to attention and tried to close the door to see what he needed. He did it multiple times that year, to the point where girls changing had to select a crew member to watch the door and hold it closed when he tried to come in. Typically in high school theatre programs, two directors are required: one male and one female, but due to our drama departments size, the school doesn't want to spend any more money or resources on us, which allows this to happen. That same year, students and parents went to the office to complain about the events, but the administration refuses to listen, and states that they don't have sufficient evidence. In the years following that, every single student who reported him, and saw nothing happen, either dropped the program or graduated, so their reports are practically useless. This has happened nearly every show since he has taken the position, and the office refuses to act on any report we bring to them. Since I have attended the school, I've witnessed him barging (or attempting to, being stopped by the crew guard) into dressing rooms, and walking into girls hotel rooms on school field trips.  Another related incident happened while an elementary school was using our space to perform a show. A little girl (either kindergarten or 1st grade) needed help with a mic pack being put on. Putting on a mic pack involves sliding it into the back of your waist band and running the wire through the shirt up to the mouth, so typically, helping students is ONLY done by members of the same sex. Naturally, our drama teacher excitedly volunteered to do this, and we had to have a female crew member cut him off and help the girl herself. This wouldn't be that much of an issue, if later on he wasn't raving about how cute this specific girl was, while we were in the booth running through cues. It was a horribly uncomfortable experience to listen to a man, mid to late thirties, ranting about her pigtails and how cute she looked in her costume. We have brought all of this up to our school's administration, and they continue to say they don't care because highschoolers can make up anything they want, but we can't necessarily have a camera set up in the girls dressing rooms to catch him. Is there any laws being broken? What is a route we can take to make the administration care?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: I would also like to mention that we don't know how to get evidence to convict him. Can we set up a hidden camera? This would be on school property, and they would absolutely object to us asking them to set up a camera to catch him, they want us to drop this entire thing. What is the best way to prove to the admin that there is a problem?",10Feb2020,4

The process appears quite daunting, and many programs seem geared towards MD or PA degrees. 

I am not opposed to a PhD or an MD as a long term goal (Interested in Microbiology/Microbiomes, like clinical work, but love the lab) , but would prefer to find a program geared towards an MS first so I can get into the program, feel out academia (I've already explored medicine thoroughly), and decide.

I've worked on several websites over the last decade and have never run into a situation where our server IP changed weekly. We're not a big site (we get MAYBE 50 sessions per week in a VERY niche market), so there isn't much reason for anyone to hack us either.

Then our site went down because ""our host changed our IP address"" and ""something to do with the handoff from our sandbox developer"" which resulted in the site reverting back two weeks to before I had removed those categories. That hand off happened almost 2 months before the issue cropped up.

Something isn't adding up, but I can't put my finger on what. The company isn't large enough for me to raise these concerns internally but I don't know what to do, or if I even should do anything.

952,"So I (19F) and my sister (21F) are really close, and both work full time (she earns a lot more than me as I’m an apprentice)

It was my dads birthday last week so today I had planned for me and him to go for a meal (he prefers smaller intimate meals than a large family one so we all take our turns with him)

My sister asked to come so I said yes and it didn’t make a difference to my dad. 

Now whenever my sister buys me anything (food mainly but sometimes clothes) she asks me to transfer the money. Fair enough, she doesn’t owe me anything.

I personally wouldn’t do that, so today when the bill came to £70, I paid it all. She wouldn’t stop begging me afterwards asking if she could pay for her half (I paid for my dad as it was his birthday ofc) 

She said it was right for her to pay her half

It doesn’t sit right with me tho, her half was £30, but if I let her pay then I’m the same as her. I honestly like paying for things especially for my family, and I’m not necessarily going to be scrimping if i miss out on my £30

My dad thinks I’m being too proud and I should just let her pay seeing as she wasn’t even originally invited to the meal.

958,"Hi everyone,

I wanted to get some non-biased advice on some decisions my husband and I need to make. Ages 35 and 38. 

There is a job that I want in Atlanta and I could make around $60k a year. I can get the same job here but I have worked at many of the hospitals associated with the job and did not love the environments. I worked as a traveler at this job and I loved the environment. 

Where I struggle is my husband and I both are very family oriented and I would be moving about 750 miles away from the place we call “home”. 

The issue is I could work outside the field and start over and eventually make 40-50k, it will take awhile and I would be okay to do it but my husband is not willing to really get a “better” job. He currently works retail part time and makes around $23k before taxes.

961,in elementary school i had a best friend from 2nd grade till 6th. we did everything together. then right before middle school she became friends with the “popular” girls. i hate saying that but it’s true everyone loved those girls. eventually all she wanted to do was hangout with them. so we kind of stopped being friends. which i took that really hard because she was really my only friend. now we’re in 10th grade and we’ve talked on and off since. but when we talked once last year we joked a lot. i was thinking today about how i really miss her. and how we knew stuff about each other that no one else knew. i miss our friendship badly. i know it’ll probably never be the same. she’s not friends with the majority of those “popular” girls anymore. i’ve wished her happy birthday a couple years in a row and she seemed happy that i took time to do that. idk what to do? part of me thinks i should just get over it but the other part of me wants to reach out. but i’m too scared of rejection. i’m not even sure if she misses our friendship it doesn’t seem like she does but to her it probably doesn’t seem like i miss our friendship when i do. if i were to reach out i’m not sure what i would even say. thanks to anyone who takes time to reply!,10Feb2020,1
962,"I’m going to try and condense 20 years into a few paragraphs so be understanding, please.

When I was younger I (M) was molested by my step-father. I remember every thing distinctly despite my young age at the time. Probably 7-8.

I told no one. My step father was always extremely intimidating, angry, and physically &amp; verbally violent. He was/ is a drug user and a drunk. 
I didn’t want to tell anyone because I was confused and I felt extremely alone. My mom worked two jobs and this clown (my stepfather) was the stay at home parent. 

I grew up and decided to GTFO of my hometown and joined the service. Everyone thought it was some brave thing I was doing but secretly it was a way to distance myself. Luckily was  stationed overseas so I succeed in that regard. I still maintained contact with members of my family, and still had not told anyone at this point. This was about 9 years ago.

I met a lovely supportive woman and we got married and had children. Upon having children I realized that under no circumstances could I let my children succumb to the same suffering that I endured. I sat on this thought for a long time. Maybe 2-3 years.
About 3-4 years ago, shortly after my second son was born, my eldest brother died. That week I was on the phone with my sister discussing things and she drunkenly let slip that  she was worried for her son living with my stepfather and mother (she’s a drunk, can’t support herself) and when I asked her why she wouldn’t say much except that she was afraid of him (my stepfather) this makes me believe she was molested too.
And it made me realize even further that I have to tell someone what happened to me, and I have to ensure my sons never come in contact with my step-father.
So I told my wife. She has been an incredible support structure for me and has helped with my growth immensely.

I decided shortly after that to tell my mother and my sister. Thinking that, if my wife was so supportive, surely my mother would understand and help me rid this man from any association with my life.
I was dreadfully incorrect.
My mother called me a lot of names, including home wrecker, a liar, and said that there is no way this could have happened to me.. because I would have told someone.

I was in awe.
I told her what my sister had said and then according to my mother, my sister back peddled and said she never said those things to me (I know, a lot of he said she said shit)

That part doesn’t surprise me, because I know my sister fears that man.

I have had several conversations with my mom where I have painted a quite obvious picture of why I didn’t tell anyone and why I started to tell people.
I’ve spent years in therapy, suffered through years of depression and tried my damnedest to grow from this as a man. But I still can’t get over the abandonment of my mother in this scenario.

I am furious with my sister and I don’t even have proper words to describe what emotions I have toward my mother.

I need advice on what to do? My mother and sister keep called me weekly and it’s always the same bullshit. They act like nothing happened. But when I ignore them, it hurts me. Because well, who doesn’t want to talk to their family?
I’ve blocked them out of everything and I ignore their calls for now..

This all came to fruition in May of 2016 so I have essentially been attempting to argue my case for nearly four years.

I’m drained.
Do I block them out for good?
Do I just accept that they won’t believe me and still communicate with them?
Do I continue trying to hammer this into them?
All this time my stepfather has made 0 attempt to contact me and it feels as though he is puppeteering  my mother.

I believe that family is the most important thing. And I teach my children that. But my kids always ask about my parents and my siblings because we are so close (geographically) to my wife’s family but not mine.
It’s a weird situation to be in and I know I’ve left some things out.
Maybe I need assurance that blocking them out is the right thing, maybe I need to see a different side of things, I don’t know.

My wife says to block them out.
I just want to protect my kids and be able to shed this immense weight I’ve been carrying for 20ish years.

969,"tl;dr How did you reclaim your passion and joy?  When you've been really lost in your own dark places, what have you done?  


I'm over 2 years sober. Overall my life is better (I've had a solid, good job for that time.  I'm healthier physically.  I've been told that I seem better mentally/emotionally).  But I've never regained any passion for anything.  I've just been waiting out the time.    


Alcohol and many additive substances down-regulate brain receptors (part of the addiction cycle is needing more ""happy brain chemicals"" than you did before, causing you to use more drugs and make riskier choices).  I've been told the resultant difficulty to feel joy is called ""anhedonia"". Its pretty common for folks in recovery to not really get back the ability to feel typical levels of joy for a year or more.  My addiction counselor says to just keep my head down and stick with my sobriety (which I am).  


I feel like I've done all the important stuff.  I eat as healthy as I can, exercise, I stay positive without avoiding discomfort. I take psych meds to deal with the fallout. I get therapy to deal with the underlying reasons I was using.  


But 2 years out, I don't -want- anything.  I have trouble trusting that I'm worthwhile.  I have trouble finding reasons to keep going.  I know the world is a worthwhile place.  And I used to not really care that it all seemed a bit pointless.  I found reasons to love existing.    


A friend of mine from recovery killed himself Dec 26th, but I didn't find out until recently.  He had cut everyone out slowly (I think to prevent risking our sobriety, as his hit the skids).  I don't feel angry that he killed himself; I'm just sad he's gone.  He fought his fight for a long time, and in the end couldn't keep doing it.  I'm worried I'm running out of energy to keep going too.

I fucking dread going to work everyday. I wake up miserable and this feeling has pretty much existed since I started. I work in an office cubicle with people I have no interest in being around, doing something I have zero interest in doing.

So, if I'm offered the position, I know I won't want to take it but I feel obligated to because I don't know what else I'd do. If I'm not offered the position and my co-worker is offered it, I think it will be the wake-up call I've been needing to get the fuck out of there.

1001,"I am a senior in high school, and recently it has hit me extremely hard that everything is changing. My problems started in late October, and have worsened significantly since. It has gotten to the point where I’m sobbing every day multiple times a day, sometimes at school. Very little things set me off, like differences in tone when I’m speaking to people, slightly more work for classes than usual, and even when I misplace things.

It all started with my boyfriend breaking up with me two days before Halloween. I was and still am so broken about it, and I’ve asked for advice on that a few times before here unsuccessfully. He was everything to me, and it took me a long time to even be able to eat and sleep. I was devastated, but am learning to live with myself. I still have to see him almost every Sunday, and I just can’t get over him.

Sunday’s bring me to youth group. Which our break-up has unfortunately caused conflict at. I love my youth group. It has gotten me through some awful life occurrences, and I am entirely invested in my church. I am a student leader there, and I just keep thinking as every event passes by this year that it’s my last one. My youth pastor emailed the three seniors today and said that on our annual retreat, we would be released from student leadership and passing it on to the juniors and sophomores. Reading that physically made me sick because it’s just so much for me to lose. 

I’ve done my college applications, and everything is set up for me to leave, and I’m so checked out in high school right now that I don’t even know how my grades are staying up. I just can’t wrap my head around actually going.

Since October, I’ve been sick more times than I’ve been in my entire high school career, and I’ve thrown up more times than I have in my entire life because of how stressed I am. It’s getting to the point where I can see the hollowness in my face, and I’ve lost weight. It’s not healthy mentally or physically. I’m consistently making excuses not to go out and do things because I’m at home, crying. I need to know what to do with myself. Please help.",10Feb2020,0
1002,"So, I'm is being haunted by. . .something. I don't really know what it is, but I think it's a demon or a weird kind of shadow person. I say weird kind of shadow person because it has kind of. . . evolved? It used to be like a smudge or something in the background, But over time it has 1: gotten more physical 2: become more focused, like it's a solid shape, not just a blur anymore 3:has started to talk with me  and this new update has gotten really scary, because it's not a shadow anymore. It looks like a person, when I got home, I thought that someone might have broken in, but it was mister demon man.

Before I ask for help, I want to give a little more information - I am fairly certain that it is tied directly to me, because of a few reasons: my mother saw it standing over me one time when I was three, we have moved a few times since the time my mom saw it and it has shown up so it's following us, it only talks to me and only follows me around then disappears, and the other night, it told me something that I find really creepy - it was sitting in the corner of my room, and I was fed up with it so, i asked it why it was here, what it was, who it was, and the only answer that it gave me was ""You know me, we used to be close"". Another this is that I've started to be more violent. Like I really wanted to hurt someone, and that's just not me.

It just showed up behind me a few minutes ago, and I'm at my grandmother's. Also, I could feel it today all day at school. This isn't the first time that it has followed me to school either. It's probably the third or fourth time. It used to be more confined to the house that I was living in(like I said, it follows me), but now that it is getting clearer and looks like a person, it's getting bolder. I'm really scared, so if anyone knows anything, I would appreciate it. What I most want to know is how to get rid of it for good, and if the becoming clearer/more visible, then looking like a person means if it's getting more powerful/dangerous.",10Feb2020,1

I know people say that you will find someone and you just have to wait but I feel like I’ve been waiting my whole life.

1009,"Whenever he has a day off (that they rota in) about 80% of the time they phone him to come in and work a shift. He used to answer to say yes/no but now he’s just trying to ignore it. But apparently the manager brings it up in a rude manner that he should answer his phone, despite having a day off and potentially being busy/away from his phone.
I’m sure they managers wouldn’t appreciate being constantly badgered to come in - plus they should plan the rotas better and stop relying on the workers to fill in the slots.

1010,"Hello! So, title says it all. What do I pick- my mental health or my job?

Background:
I’ve been with this company for 6 years now. We’re undergoing a lot of changes. One of which is my job. I’m getting a higher position with a lot more stress. I already had too much stress and hardly took time off because it was useless- nobody fills in for you so when you’re back from holiday you have more work to do than before you left

What’s so bad about this new job? The person who is supposed to train me isn’t. She’s been on holiday off and on since November so there’s barely been time for me to train. I’ve had to learn as I go. Also my trainer is downright rude; it’s hard to learn when tasks are being taught to you with hostility and in a condescending tone. On top of that I still have my old job queues from before. Those were reduced but there’s nobody to give them to. So I’m stuck doing 2 jobs. There’s a lot more to it but basic moral of the story is I’m doing 2 full time jobs and having to deal with a rude trainer, and I’m juggling so many tasks that I can’t think straight. It’s come into my personal life. I fight with my partner and parents constantly now and have become just as rude as my trainer out of just default from stress. Everyday for the past 5 months I’ve woken up at 4am with stress and anxiety, so much so that it’s hard to go into work. I don’t want to deal with not enough time for lunch, and the rude attitude I get constantly. After work I don’t even have the strength to do anything and go straight to bed to sulk and try to have the anxiety go away. 

So...what do I do? Suck it up here at this job because I need to afford my bills? Or quit and stop having the crippling anxiety and rude behavior that’s a direct result from this job???",10Feb2020,1

1012,"So backstory is important:

I’ve been hanging out with this guy for three months now but I’ve liked him for a while. Like at least six months. In the beginning he clarified that the relationship would be exclusively sexual, despite him refusing to have sex just yet (I found out later on that it was because he was scared of me leaving him cuz he thought his dick was small and he thinks he’s not good at sex, his dick is not small btw haha). So we ended up making out a lot and that making out eventually turned to us texting him everyday and then me meeting his dog and then us walking his dog at least twice/three days a week. We usually hangout at our spot in the woods and let his dog run around while we talk or mostly just sit there while he holds my hand. We’ve been doing that for a while and he likes when I talk about my problems. He’s told his mom and friends about me. But we work together so he can’t tell people who I am or else we’ll get fired. He has also talked to our boss about me but I have no idea what he said or what she said only that he talked about me. Our coworkers are very suspicious of us but we try our best to keep it secret. Lately, he’s been talking about being in a relationship with me, he’s just not ready for dating yet after his last girlfriend. 

So anyways, last night we were in our spot watching the stars and just hanging out. I don’t remember what we were talking about but he said “I never expected to fall for you” and I didn’t know what to say so I didn’t say anything at all. 

So did he just tell me he loves me or am I stupid?",10Feb2020,1

1028,"I've started to notice over the past year or two that I've been masturbating frequently. Pretty much four or five times in a single day by now. It's becoming a problem for me, especially when i sleep. I can't sleep unless I rub one or two out and I'm not as sensitive too, so it takes a while. I'm starting to go to bed late. 

I also tend to procastinate. I could be doing homework or something else but my brain is like, 'nah, get the good feelings goin.' And I do and end up wasting about an hour amd a half. 

There are times where I've almost been caught or when I have family members over and I go into my room because it's about that time of day. I'm a bit ashamed to admit about getting off in my room while my grandparents are vibing in the living room. 

Around new years I was masturbating so much my arm hurt for several days. You would think the pain would stop me but it didn't. If anything the pain only got worse. 

I'm kind of worried and I'm scared it's going to affect me in some way, I'm probably being hella dramatic when I say that. Im also scared one day luck isn't gonna side with me and someone is gonna walk in on me. I'd get my ass whoop if any of my famoly members saw that since I come from a traditional family. 

I will admit I am in my late teens, but I feel like it's a bit too much. I've tried stopping through will power but I cant go through a day without needing to masturbate. I just want to see if theres a way to at least lower the amount of times I do it.",10Feb2020,1
1029,"I graduate with a BA this semester and have been accepted to two post graduate Human Resources programs which I am torn between.

Option 1: is in my current town where I live with my partner of 5 years. He has to stay here because he is in school, so he would have to move out of our apartment and find a new place for next year. The program is less renound and I would have to achieve an 85 average to get into the co-op program.

Option 2: is in the big city so I would have to move back to my hometown an hour away from my current city and social circle. The program is prestigious/highly competitive and you are automatically in the co-op stream if you accept your offer. I have a mental illness so I would have to leave my psychiatrist in my current town and find a new one.

Some other info is that I don't drive so it is not the easiest to get back to my current town to see my partner. The programs are both only a year so I know being apart isn't permanent. There are TONNES of HR jobs where I live so I don't think prestige is that big of a deal either.

I love my dad so much and my sister and I both have depression and are seeing therapists and getting medicated. My dad supports us through whatever and always bends backwards to help us get to appointments. We were dating dinner tonight and he barely touched his good, saying that nothing tasted good and that nothing has tasted good for a while. I've noticed that he's been smoking more and spending more time up in his room.

I don't know how to tell him that he should see a therapist, He's been blaming himself for everything since my mom left and right now he just seems so broken down.

I’m stuck between lying and telling the truth right now.

I’ve been dating this guy for the last month and I want to stay at his overnight. However my mother, little bit controlling, isn’t cool with this whatsoever and doesn’t even know I’m dating.

If you’re wondering why I haven’t told her, I wanted to see how it went in the early days before we told anyone because I’m... really shy about stuff like this. However also because my mother doesn’t really have anyone? And she can become truly bitter at me the few times I have dated. She’s used it against me in arguments and essentially been the reason I’ve sometimes split with the person, driving herself in the middle, and threatening to kick me out.

So I’m a little scared. But the guy I’m with? We clicked after everything I’ve been through semi recently and he’s very very supportive and won’t post anything anywhere till I’m totally ready. He’s an old school friend and... I’m genuinely happy. 
I’m scared of it being ruined but I really really want to go out without being made to feel guilty.

I can’t drive but it’s not like I’m asking for a lift? But she insists on driving me everywhere and every time I try to bring up me saving up for driving lessons she kinda snaps out. I’ve been looking for a job but I’ve only recently come off sick (I’ve had a lot of Gynaecology issues).
Last time I left the house on my own she called me crying saying she thought I’d gone to kill myself despite telling her the day before I was going out, and on more than one occasion she’s said if I leave the house she’ll tell everyone I’m mentally unhinged. 

I don’t blame her for that one because I did attempt suicide in 2016 but I’ve since been diagnosed with ADHD and Depression, and I’ve been genuinely on the up with the right help.

She also threatens to commit suicide herself, that no one will need her if I leave, and I am registered as her carer (PIP).
I just feel like I’m putting my life on hold, and I’m not sure if I should continue lying to keep myself with a roof over my head till I go to Uni this year or tell her I’m seeing someone...

Also how do I begin to help her dealing with me leaving the house more often? To the point where I could eventually stay out all night without her freaking out?",10Feb2020,1

John is a pretty socially awkward guy, which is okay he’s funny and a really good dude, but at the event he said something really weird. He said that Mary told him i “would be really nervous, because I think he’s cute”

I was surprised bc that’s just an uncomfortable sentence and not once have I told Mary that I was interested in John.

When I asked her about it later she said “well John is a really insecure guy and he really just needed a confidence booster” she went on to claim that what she really said was that a lot of people think he’s cute and so on.

Now one of my other friends is actually interested in John and is asking me for help because apparently Mary keeps embarrassing her in front of him. She showed him all of her TikToks, and is always talking about her messy nights at parties, and keeps making John go to her events as her other friends’ date.

1050,"Little Backstory:

My girlfriend and I have been together almost 3 months. And it was going really really really well. She introduced me to friends and even her parents and they instantly liked me. I spent most of the time at her house and they even gave me a house key. It really feels like that she loves me. Everyday she tells me how much she loves me and how she wants to be with me forever. She even send me snaps when she was crying because I was at the hospital for a week and we wasn’t seeing eachother. 

Now to my situation. My girlfriend fell asleep on my chest and her phone was beside me. And I didn’t really want to break her trust and look through her phone without her permission. But I did it anyway. And I found saved chats with a guy on snapchat and she was flirting with him calling him “daddy” and shit and even send nudes. But the nudes weren’t saved, so I wasnt able to see them. when I confronted her about it, she told me her friend told her to flirt with him so she can see if he cheats on her, but why would she do that for atleast 2 months. She cried and swore on her life that those nudes she sent were just from the internet. And if I broke up with her she would understand but she also said that she would harm herself if she loses me. We didn’t talk to eachother for hours, but then I told her that I believe her and we did make up. Because I really loved her and I didn’t want to lose her. Then I messaged the guy she was flirting with on Instagram and asked him to show me the nudes she sent to him. He told me he doesn’t have the nudes anymore but he could tell that it was her.

And now I’m lying in her bed besides her while she is sleeping and have no idea who to believe or what to else to do...",10Feb2020,1

Hello, I am M and recently I have noticed all of my friends are in relationships and iv been reading through some of the posts on this, some days I’m just like I want someone everyone seems so happy when they are in relationships, but I’m also worried about love I wouldn’t want to lose someone I loved,  it would be heartbreaking and I don’t know how I would cope with it. I have never been in a relationship and want to give it a go but I’m not the most attractive or “popular” guy and I am very self conscious and not very confident. 

Any tips on where to start? 

TIA",10Feb2020,1
1052,"Hi lol sorry for the wall of text... idk wtf to do, so any advice would be nice. I rescue animals and recently i rescued two sick kittens from a  colony of cats around an apartment complex, I got them vetted, neutered, and adopted. But as it doesn't really solve the problem just to take the kittens, I've gone back to TNR (spay and nueter and then let them back go if they're wild) the rest of the colony. Ive finally got all the cats there spayed (yay) but while I was doing it, a guy pulled his truck over to ask me for help w the many many cats around his trailer. I made friends with him but when i went to his place i was very upset with the conditions of his pet cats. He has several outside in a small pen like barn animals and its very cold (they did have like, hay) The rest were not much better off and their litter boxes were really dirty. However, the cats were pretty sweet and didn't even run away when the door of the pen was opened. It was like so close to a hoarding case but I wasn't sure. However, there really was a ton of feral cats around his property so like i said  I would, I took two of them to get spayed. When I came back to let them back go, the dude agreed to let me help him clean out his cluttered trailer (idk why i did really, It was just a disaster) and I successfully talked him into rehoming some of his many pet cats. (he did get pissy with me for giving him a side hug instead of a ""real"" hug??? Creepy side revealed I guess) He seemed nice and agreeable when saying goodbye and said he'd see me soon. Today, I messaged him to say I was coming over to get two more wild cats for spay and rabies shots, he told me i wasn't welcome there anymore and if i came he'd call the police. Now he's the one that would be in trouble if the police came, i'm more worried about him getting aggressive if i went there to get more cats. (now that he'd got me involved, i really do feel the need to help that huge cat colony). I literally have no idea why, and I worry for his ""pets"". I want to leave a tip to animal control or something but I really don't know how... that also means I couldn't go back for trapping but maybe I could have someone else do it for me. Just like... i don't know lol!

edit: I don't care about that guy anymore btw... he's obviously proven himself to not be a friend. It's more about how can I go about helping the poor cats.",10Feb2020,1
1053,"Ok so I just started talking to the girl I liked for the first time in a couple of weeks, and I ended up getting her number but we talked for a little bit but I feel like I just need to get to know her better, any good questions that I could ask her?",10Feb2020,1
1054,"So I have a crush on my coworker. I always catch him looking at me, but he never says hi or initiates a conversation. He always asks my other coworker who he knows from school why I don’t say hi to him etc. He’s a freaking extrovert, talks to absolutely everyone else but me. The only way we have talked before is because I initiate the conversation, even then it only last a couple of minutes, 5 max.


Here’s another weird thing, apparently he told another one of my coworkers that he wanted to ask me for my number, but couldn’t bc we never talk. 

Wtf lol",10Feb2020,1
