0,"Hi all. Maybe this belongs in r/relationships but I thought it might be fitting to post here because a lot of advice on that sub under other posts is always just “dump him!” comments and I genuinely want to know what I can do here. My boyfriend (27M) and I (22F) have been together for 2 years. We both struggle with different mental illnesses but I have known the limitations of mine for much longer. 

I have PTSD, I see a therapist, and I function fairly well aside from a few symptom flare ups here and there but I have been doing this for so long that I do a good job of recognizing when I need to take care of myself before things get out of hand. My boyfriend on the other hand has severe depression and anger issues that stem from it. I have personally suspected bipolar disorder, but I am not so sure. He frequently has off days. His depression comes off as anger. He snaps, and I have felt scared in the past because of it and as someone with PTSD from being abused, I am still scared sometimes that he will get out of control. 

He yells, he pulls arguments out of nowhere. He accuses me of slamming doors, yelling, starting fights with him when I literally do not do this at all. I love this man with all my heart, I want to emphasize that. He is not a bad person, and I know a lot of people might read what I’m saying and think he is because I say I’m scared sometimes when he yells, but for context I have never been scared for my safety around him.  He struggles with this so much and he is doing what he can to help himself by seeing a therapist and being on medications and utilizing the resources and coping mechanisms available to him in our area. 

I am mostly just worried about him, but sometimes I feel isolated because of his argumentative mentality and the way he gets upset and sad so quickly is really scary to me. I want to help him, but the mood swings and the sudden fights he will pick are so emotionally draining. I don’t know how to be supportive without upsetting him. Is there anything I can do except be patient? He just got diagnosed three months ago and living with a mental illness is new territory for him, though he has had this for years he is finally accepting it and so far is making progress (takes accountability for his outbursts, walks away before getting angry, etc.) and I am proud of him. 

I just want him to be the best version of himself he can be and I don’t know how to help him when gets so upset because my instinct is to just run away until it blows over. The mood swings are something I have never experienced before and I don’t know what to do to help because it’s hard to be around when it’s happening. 

Is there anything I can do to be supportive of him and helpful as he navigates through this without sacrificing my own emotional and mental well-being? If you struggle with similar issues, what does your partner do to help you and remind you that you’re supported and loved?",04Feb2020,1
1,"I currently live with three other girls, and we have been living together for about six months now. One of the girls and I are always on top of our rent payment and make sure everything is turned in on time. However, the other two are quite the opposite. They argue with us about payments (even though their rent is almost $200 cheaper then ours because they share a bedroom), always pay late, and waste all of their money on shopping and eating out. Our rent for February was due on the first, and they have yet to pay their potions of it. We are a day away from being charged late fees because of it. Because of a recent fight between two of my roommates, they are not on speaking terms with us.

3,"So my best friend/SIL is pregnant and very excited about it. But the father is one of the worst people I’ve ever met. They’ve been together for 2 years and her family and I have always hated him. He’s an alcoholic and does coke sometimes and is always getting into fights. He even put his hands on her over the summer, which led to her getting an order of protection against him then later dropping it when they got back together a week later. 

She told me about a month ago that she’s pregnant and they want to keep it. She’s 12 weeks now. They’re both really excited and she claimed that he’s getting a lot better (which I already doubted). But today, she talked to me about how his drinking is getting out of hand again and whenever she brings in up to him, he yells at her and calls her names.

I told her that just because they’re having a baby together, it doesn’t mean they have to BE together. But she wants to stay with him. I can’t stop her.

I’m just scared that the stress he puts her through is going to harm her and the baby. Even worse, I’m afraid of him putting his hands on her again. I don’t know what to do, I feel like I’m watching a disaster about to happen. She’s so codependent and can’t walk away. I don’t know what to do, I feel helpless.",04Feb2020,1

I just found out I am pregnant by a someone (M25) I have only known for about a month, who has made it clear he has no interest in being a father. I initially thought I could go through with an abortion without a second thought, but after talking to some people in my life I have realized I'm not so sure. I have always wanted to have a child and I live in a relatively low cost of living area with some money saved up and good health insurance.

Idk if I'm overreacting, dr.google says it could be anything from autism to nerve damage to just being a normal child. I don't want to get her in trouble or unnecessary doctor's appointmentments just because I worry too much.

6,"Hello friends,

Okay so, I’ve been with him for a pretty long time now, like a few months, and things are going okay I guess. The issue, however, is the fact that we only see each other 1-2 times a month. On top of that, we barley even text each other anymore (we used to). I’m not sure if I did something wrong, or something happened, but I’m kind of worried. Like, what are we at this point? We say “I love you” and all that but does it mean anything? I don’t think he’s cheating or anything, but I’m not sure what could be the problem? Furthermore, how should I deal with this? Should I talk to him? Is this just a phase? I need help.
Thanks a lot guys :((",04Feb2020,1

9,"My life looks good on paper, but everything is far from alright. I've struggled with severe depression for over half of my life, I put on an outwardly happy and funny sharade but I'm never happy. I have successfully survived 15 years but the last 6 months have been trying. I injured myself at work and am unable to move over 15lbs or strain myself. This is a problem as I'm an early riser and hard worker. Shortly after the injury I met a great woman who started seeing me. I'm off work and useless but she kept me hopeful and focused, I always had something to do and look forward to. We broke up, there was no fire, she had a broken man and that was that.   Here's the fun part, when I have tough times I buckle down and focus on work or exercise, with this injury I'm unable to do either, I have 2 labor intensive jobs, one is my own (newer) business and is threatened by my helplessness. 
My life crashed due to my inability to perform in multiple ways and all of my coping mechanisms are impossible now.

11,"Hey Reddit.

I've always been unlucky whenever it comes to love. My first girlfriend and I were together for 3 years (long distance) before we had to break up because it got too much and I cheated on her. I did realize my mistake though and admitted it to her immediately. I couldn't live with the guilt. Over time, we drifted apart and eventually broke up. We said we would be friends. Now, she still texts me every now and then, comments on my posts and talks about how much she likes some of my work but I just can't get rid of this feeling that I don't know what to do. Should I talk to her? Should I not? What do I do?

Then, a couple months ago I was in a short lived relationship with someone I met over Hinge. Then, and even now I can't remember her face. We did a lot together, did picnics, got tea, got dinner; she even helped me move, but I could just not do it with her. Something told me to not pursue it and when things started to get busy, we broke up. To be fair, I have a feeling that we both used each other as rebounds as she would start crying when we'd be doing the dirty (there was no p in v though... I never had a condom on me; maybe that was an excuse I kept telling myself... who knows). We mainly did christian college sex.  She would also go on about how my deodorant smelt like her ex's and I think, that's when I should've said goodbye. We ended on good terms, although, when I made a joke about getting tea where we first met she said ""I'm not giving you the satisfaction of a full circle"". Which if I'm being honest, hurt a lot.

After we broke up, I went through a big change in my life. I started going to the gym and taking care of myself. 8 months later, I'm proud of my achievements but during these 8 months, I had sporadic dates here and there, people ghosted me often or stood me up or never responded to my texts at all. Not to forget, I would tell two women I knew from Freshman year how I felt about them and be rejected by both --the second one and I still did it though... that was fun -- (incidentally, she was also the same person that I cheated on my first girlfriend with). We decided to be FwB but knowing that a situation like that always hurts both parties involved, I decided that it would be wise if we were just friends. Which we still are. She acts in my movies and plays and we're going to get ice cream and wine for my best friend and make him a tinder. He recently broke up with his girlfriend (she was a major bitch to him, she literally told him that the ""relationship wasn't a priority for her"")

Now, 8 months or so later, I met someone that (as Kenny Loggins would put it) ""eased my mind"" and I hated that because I'm leaving the city I'm in fairly soon and I don't want anything to hold me back here. No attachments. As soon as this year started, I decided ""fuck it"", it's time I take a shot and see where it goes. I tried to treat her right. I did what I never did with the others and invited her to things that were fun (I didn't know this girl well because I saw her in passing... she works in the same area as me so suffice to say, I wanted to get to know her). First I asked her if she wanted to come see a play a friend of mine was putting up. She was busy that night with work, so I understood. Then, months later, I got a new table top RPG and asked her if she liked those. She said she did, so I decided to get a one shot campaign going, it would be a great way to spend time not only with her but also some of my older friends I haven't seen in years. 

I asked her what would be the best time to create a character for her and we decided to do that during one of her shifts (I'm a receptionist and she's an RA, so she also has to sit at the desk). She worked super early on a Saturday (this was the busiest my saturday has ever been, I had this in the morning, a film shoot in the afternoon and then rehearsals for my show in the evening... usually my saturdays I try to keep for myself). I thought I'd get bagels for her because neither her or I would've had food when we'd meet. So, already running on probably 8-10 hours of sleep over a week, I wake up early and get us bagels and go to her shift. I open the door, she's not there. That crushed me.

I waited for about half an hour for her to come, just in case she stepped out to get some water, or go to the bathroom. She didn't show. I even texted her. I left the bagels and the cheese behind the desk with a note that said ""to whoever wants it"" and I bought some protein bars for breakfast. Luckily, someone in a nearby building couldn't make their shift and so I took it. Made back the money for the bagels! (success!). 

Later in the day, she texts me apologizing and says that she'd be there tomorrow too. Old me would've pounced at that opportunity, but my heart was too hurt at this time so I said I couldn't make it. Now I have no expectations from her nor do I care if her and I get together but here's where my sadness begins reddit.

I feel very alone nowadays, it doesn't help that I never had close friends before I came to this city 4 years ago and now I have to leave all of them behind. I don't want to do the dating apps because they annoy the crap out of me because I don't know how to play the app game. I don't want to find someone or be with anyone right now because I'm afraid that it would end up being a long distance and the last time that happened it sucked ass. I don't know what to do. I still go to the gym (or atleast force myself to), still going to classes but, all I feel like doing is staying in bed all day and smoking pot. Which I don't think is healthy. I don't want to get into a relationship with anyone right now but can't help but long for it. 

What do you think I should do? How do I battle this existential loneliness?",04Feb2020,1
12,"Straight to the chase. Met this Tinder girl. Been taking for almost two months now, we hung out twice In January before we both went back to college. Our campuses are 4 hours away so I likely won’t have the chance to hangout with her until March. I felt a good connection and we snap each other a lot. 45 day streak, we have the red heart so she snaps me the most out of all her friends, as I do the same. Except now it’s been three days in a row where she has left me on opened. She’ll snap back after 6 hours or so, but I’ve been left on opened for 4 hours now. Still got the red heart emoji, but did she just forget to respond, is this the start of something bad? Am I overthinking? So many mixed signals.  I want to make it work with this girl. We aren’t in a relationship yet, but I’m more than a friend to her, but not completely 100% out of the friendzone yet. I don’t want to tell her my true feelings because that seems desperate.

14,"I recently moved back home after getting evicted late last year. I moved into these apartments so that me and my girlfriend would only be about 5 minutes away.

Anyways, we were just on the phone and talking about next semester when i come back and where we’re going to stay. She’s talking about moving somewhere that’s pretty far away from where we were recently staying and from where i plan on moving to. 

I told her that we won’t be able to see each other as much but she’s just like “I’m sure whatever happens, things will work out” which doesn’t seem like  a genuine response. I get so frustrated because I go out of my way sometimes to do things for her but she doesn’t do the same and i end up feeling stupid for it.

19,"So as most people do I have this fantasy or dream of being rich and living the life of luxury. An every day occurrence of me thinking about all the things I would buy if I were typically fills my mind.  In fact I spend a lot of time researching to say the least on how to “get rich”. From YouTube tutorials to just reading articles on the already rich, people’s advice. You name it I’ve seen or read it. Now the problem becomes that I have absolutely no motivation to carry out any of these ideas that I could turn into making money.  In fact most of my reasoning seems to be me telling myself “someone has already done that”. Basically shooting myself down saying there’s no hope for anything I try. I’ve also become a little blinded by the fact I “will” be rich not just the dream of it. Sometimes I focus a little to much and leave out what actually is the reality of my future. So to that I ask for advice on how to either follow through with my plans/fantasy of being rich and motivate me in that direction or how to overcome and forget the fantasy to better focus on the truth or reality of my future.",04Feb2020,1

21,"To start off, I am caucasian and a very pale one. I am sensitive when discussing with people of other cultural background, ethnicity or skin color than mine and try to be first and foremost respectful - I don’t see any difference between us and feel like everyone should be treated the same, regardless of their background, their upbringing or personal choices they make. 

Today I encountered a pretty sensitive situation which I didn’t know how to manage properly, and I would need advice on how to set up kind boundaries in this situation. 

I come from a warm and welcoming culture, but today I felt like my personal space was a bit crossed today by a new work colleague. We met this morning, and in less than one hour I felt overwhelmed by the amount of information I received about them, including personal details about their family and even going as far as to share with me details as to how much they currently have in their bank account. I didn’t ask any follow up questions and tried to change the conversation topic to something neutral a number of times, but every time the person would go back to sharing very personal things about their life, things which I didn’t feel comfortable knowing. 

I was maintaining my calm, but feeling overwhelmed and tried to gently remove myself from the conversation. The thing that hit me the hardest was that at one point, this person (different skin color than mine) all of the sudden asked me if I ever dreamed about having different skin color myself. I tried to understand their curiosity, but at the same time felt a bit invaded, as I think if I would have asked this question I would have crossed a major boundary.

I do not want to donate to individual charities or start a new charity.  Instead I want to seek out and pick as many people as I can help and be involved with helping.

28,"So I'm really questioning if I'm just really insecure or if there's something wrong with me. I'm constantly worried about what others see of me. Sometimes I get weird gut feelings that people close to me are observing me, or just watching what I do. This usually happens in class. I'd be doing my work, like everyone else, and I'd get scared that my classmates are looking at me and judging me. This happens when I leave the house too. I'd be walking down the street and someone would be walking on the same side, and I'd be nervous. I usually think that they're judging me, or they're gonna mug me. I don't often leave the house, because of this reason. 
I also recently decided I'm gonna change my hairstyle and get a haircut, but quickly backed down on it. I'm afraid of going to the barber and being judged by the barber, and everyone around. I was also afraid of small talk, I hear that barbers do that. I'm kinda awkward. I was sitting in my bed and coming up with multiple different outcomes if I do get the haircut. Not in case of a bad hairstyle, but I was trying to prepare to not be awkward and self conscious. 
I also recently discovered that I'm afraid of big crowds. Another thing is that I refuse plans. I have a group of friends and they constantly wanna hang out or text. I often make up excuses so I won't have to leave and make up excuses on why I can't text them. I don't hate them, it's just that I have a fear of being awkward around them. This is also why non of my friends have my phone number. 
Another thing is that I just recently started to get gut feelings that either I'm not safe, or that something terrible is going to happen. Not sure if it's related to this. But sometimes I'd just randomly feel like the room I'm in isn't safe, and that someone can easily kill me.
This may sound really weird but sometimes I get a feeling that current events aren't really happening, that they're being made up in my head. Sounds weird, I'll explain. For example, let's say that a teacher calls up a group of kids to the front of class, and I'm one of them. Sometimes I'd think that it didn't really happen, that the teacher didn't actually call up kids to the front, and that I'm just awkwardly standing in the front of class. Sorry if that that doesn't make sense, I explained it the best I could. Right now I'm rereading this entire post to make sure everything is spelled correctly. I get self conscious online too. I don't wanna make a fool out of myself. If you read through this, thanks for putting up with my venting. I really don't know what's been wrong with me recently",04Feb2020,1

34,"Hi there,

I will give a little back story as this situation leaves me feeling confused and rather hurt and i’m seeking advice or maybe someone who understands the situation better and could provide explanation.

Recently I went through a 3 part interview process at Chick-fil-A and ultimately received the offer to begin employment as soon as the Orientation Director reached out to me. I waited a week and still hadn’t heard anything so I called just 2 days ago to ask when I could expect a call regarding orientation, the Executive Director said he’d speak with who was in charge and have them get back to me as soon as possible.

Still hadn’t received anything, no voicemails, no emails, no calls, anything. 

Then I get an email this morning from the Executive Director stating that he discovered they had made several attempts to contact me and was never able to get a hold of me, therefore due to lack of reliability my employment offer was revoked. 

I have yet to respond to it or wondering if I even should, i’m just very confused as I received nothing and you’d think if they couldn’t get a hold of me (Wrong number, mistake on their part) they would of at least tried to make it aware to me that they hadn’t been able to contact me, maybe i’m wrong I don’t know.

35,"So I (18f) work as a camp counselor in the summers. Last summer I got sort of involved with one of the other counselors kind of by accident. I had decided not to act on my feelings at all when they confessed their feelings for me. Problem is, they still had a boyfriend at the point and I was leaving for college very far away. So after they break up with their boyfriend and I’m hours away, we decide to start officially “talking.” And we’re talking for about 3.5 months planning a date for when I finally get to come home. Leading up to the date they’re telling me that they’re gonna ask me to be their girlfriend on the date so I thought everything was going well. We did the date, it was fun, they dropped me off at my house and 30 min later messaged me over snapchat to tell me that they think dating long distance would just be “too hard.” Fast forward to now, we don’t talk to each other literally at all but we still have to be coworkers next summer. Should I try to reach out now to preemptively keep it from being awkward? Or should I just let it be? Also, we said we’d try to be friends next summer but is that a bad idea? I’m worried they might honestly be kind of a shitty person. Thoughts?",04Feb2020,1

How do you disappoint a close friend by not asking her to be in your wedding? I have a good friend that I know is expecting me to ask her to be my bridesmaid. I am having a destination wedding and I’m only planning to invite family and super close friends.
I have asked one life long friend and my sister to be my maid of honor and bridesmaid. That’s all I really want.

39,"Hello, I moved here in November from Baltimore to progress my budding career in culinary arts. I've been cooking for 7 years and have been fortunate enough to have taken multiple international stages (culinary term for internship) at some highly respected restaurants. After working for one of the greatest chefs and people I know for 3+ years I eventually became his sous chef at a true farm to table restaurant and learned SO much from him and my other coworkers and former managers. I moved to Chicago to be part of a more serious food scene. After landing a job at a restaurant I had a lot of respect for, I was disgusted by how they treated employees and the way those in management looked down on everyone yet would not help when shit hit the fan. I shortly after left and was looking into other restaurant jobs. This wouldnt be a problem except that since moving somewhere new, where I am not already familiar with everything, I am finally realizing how much the restaurant industry forces you to miss out on in life. Being that I was recently engaged and my future wife and I plan on having a family I have become turned off by the life of chefs, having even turned down a job offer from a michelin star restaurant that I absolutely adore. I'm having trouble getting my foot in the door in other industry's that are more 9-5. I've been applying to sort of random places like a startup insurance company, or software sales agency but they dont seem to work out. I'd somehow like to stay involved with food as it is something I am truly passionate about but I want to have a more normal life and a career with better pay and hours that still does something for the community and those in it...I'm feeling a little lost sorry if this was rambling. I also have all this knowledge from cooking and teaching myself and learning from others for 7 years that I'd like to be able to put to use!

40,"I’m (F17) the only girl out of my friend group. We’re really close and I hang out with them practically everyday. In the span of 2 months 3 of these friends told me they liked me and asked me out. I don’t think they told any of each other they were going to do this for uh obvious reasons. And I don’t like any of the three that asked me out so I let them down gently. I do however have a tiny crush on one of the guys in the group but he wasn’t one of the people who told me they liked me... Ofc. Which sucks but it’s ok. 
Anyways I feel so awful cause it’s so awkward now. I try and act like nothing happened but none of them reciprocate. It’s so awful I feel like I lost my friend group. And I can’t talk about it with them cause clearly no one told each other that they liked me. I feel really bad and I don’t know how to fix this. 
Do I just stop hanging out with them? Do I confront them about it? What should I do..?

41,"I am married and at the stage in my life where I’ve been thinking a lot about having kids.  I always planned on having kids and felt like I really wanted kids for a variety of reasons.  I am pretty good with kids and enjoy being around them.  I was close with my little cousins growing up, and I helped my aunt with raising them.  I also helped raise my younger brothers.  I have had a lot of experience with kids in those settings, but I hear and read so many horrifying stories, that I’m starting to get really concerned.  I have always known that having kids is incredibly difficult financially and it’s a lot of constant work.  It can make people so overburdened and stressed to the point that they wish they could run away from their families.  That has always been a given.  But constantly hearing people talk about having kids and describing how their marriage is crumbling is making me have serious doubts.  

I know that I shouldn’t rush into having kids unless I’m absolutely sure.  But I’m just wondering how many of these people have never faced those kinds of responsibilities before?  Are we talking about people who don’t know how to cook or do laundry and feel completely burdened because they’ve never done it extensively before having kids?  Are we talking about people who aren’t communicating with their s.o.’s and planning things regularly?  Are these people not used to being around kids, so it’s a steep learning curve?  I am an instructor, and I’ve heard the same sentiment about teaching.  I know a ton of teachers that think teaching is the biggest burden they’ve ever experienced.  There is a lot of work that goes into it, sure, but it just feels natural to me.  So, I haven’t really felt the same.

I know that throwing a kid into the mix changes every moment of your life, but if I’m used to responsibility already, can I handle it?  I am already pretty proactive about keeping track of things that need to get done.  I am certainly not saying that it will be a breeze.  But reading about people who regret having kids is making me feel like it’s this awful thing that no one really enjoys.  So now I’m getting very nervous about it...like I am too confident about my abilities and will be awful in reality...how does anyone know if they’re ready??",04Feb2020,1
42,"Little background, 23 F here I've struggled with depression, anxiety, and ocd for the past 10+ years. I always thought I could just fix it on my own, that I was strong enough to fix my own problems and didn't need professional help.

From about 13 to 18 I contemplated suicide, numbed myself with drugs and alcohol and didn't tell anyone how I truly felt. At 19 after being so incredibly depressed I couldn't get out of bed and have panic attacks on the regular I sought professional help, the psychologist told me ""you're young, you have nothing to be worried about, try taking a walk"" this absolutely crushed me and I didn't seek professional help again until about 2 years ago. 

During those 2 years (19-21) I struggled with suicidal thoughts, panic attacks, ocd and just kept trying to deal with them on my own. I believed I was just weak and needed to toughen up, I thought there was something wrong with me and everyone just dealt with their sadness on their own and I just couldn't do it. Over the past year and a half, after my boyfriend was very concerned for my well being, I went and got established with a psychiatrist and psychologist, they both told me I've got extreme anxiety, depression, and ocd and recommended CBT therapy and some sort of antidepressant medication to help ease my worries. I've been politely denying the medication this whole time.

I have a huge negative stigma towards what I feel like is giving up on fixing myself and relying on a pill to do it for me. I've always tried to fix my problems on my own and have a hard time letting go and accepting the help.

So I guess my question is how much did starting an antidepressant or other medication help you with your mental illness and is it worth it?

I really appreciate anyone who took the time to read this, thank guys.",04Feb2020,1

When we first met we were very similar due the type of life we were living back in those times (partying and drinking) but we were never intimate enough, and the only thing we has in common was the fact that we both love travelling. Couple years later I’ve moved to London, and because her visa do Australia was denied she decided to move to London as well. Since the beginning I’ve realised she was a hard person to deal with, every time we would go out and she’d try to diminish me. And because she borrowed me some money, she used to tell how much of a saviour to me she was to every one. A couple weeks later she met her boyfriend and thankfully our paths went in different ways. I’ve met my boyfriend and a couple months later we decided to rent a place together me and him, then she calls me saying she broke up and needed a place and as a friend I’ve came in a deal with my boyfriend that we would get a two bedroom apartment and one of the rooms would be hers to rent. The problem is, she treats me like sh*t all the time, asks where I am going and who I am going with (if it’s with other friends she call them horrible things), she criticise the way i spend my money and constantly ask how much I make, she controls me and forces me to go out with her and do things I don’t want to, she criticises the way my relationship is and the last one she said is that my relationship is abusive because I worry about my boyfriend that has diabetes and if he really loved me he wouldn’t make me worry about it, and if she was the one with diabetes I’d never worry the same. She treats everyone around her in such a rude and condescending way, shouting she is an actress and how beautiful she is and she will be famous and people will love her.

When I get home,my phone blows up as I get WiFi. After saying she bottled up her feelings,she says this:

""When i was speaking of violent thoughts earlier in class, I was eluding to a plot to cripple your dad""
""I'll be 16 this year so that means I can get a job and buy myself shit. I would use that money to buy myself a car, go to the movies, or just buy myself cool stuff""
""But when I heard about your issues I felt the need to do something. When I told you we'd live in Seattle, I started to come up with this plot I wouldn't tell you about.""
For context,she wanted me to move with her to Seattle when she was 18 [I'd be 17] and she said she'd kidnap me. But she said she'd wait until I'm 18.
""Instead of a car being the first thing I buy on my own, it'd be a gun I'd obtain illegally. I'd have plenty of time to train. When I'd eventually pick you up, I'd talk to your dad. I would act all friendly and dressed nice,me wouldn't be aware of what I'm about to do.""
""I'd just shoot his fucking kneecaps out. Make sure he'll never walk again."" 
She has an abusive father and starts to tell me she has thoughts of violence often. She had the mental breakdown because she wanted to kill my dad. She said she wasn't going to do it or go through with it,but I'm frightened.

I would end up threatening you to come with me to Seattle."" [After she shoots my dad] ""You'd be on the run with a criminal. The police might think you're an accomplice.

1) If anyone shames me for being a catlady, I ask them ""so what is wrong with being one?"" To challenge their preexisting beliefs. 

2) Ensure my self worth isn't based on how a society sees me but how I see myself. Like seek my self worth in things like career, academics, etc 

(ok this seems contradictory to the title I know but you know what I mean. I mean to set a positive example a good role model) 

3) Even if I think I am in a good state of mind visit a therapist to prevent any kind of existential crisis (hey I am only human ) to keep risks mitigated 

4) collect sassy comebacks for anyone who shames me for living my lifestyle 

5) ensure I take my responsibiliies towards myself, my health, my presentation, my finances, my self care, my parents , my friends seriously. 

6) be compassionate to myself if I get a bit baddass sometimes. 

7) saving the best for last, acknowledging that I can learn from everyone (including people younger than me FS) and I am not better or worse than anyone else.

Any other ideas and advice ? I'd be happy",04Feb2020,1

I gave her a week before I come back for the tv because I’m a gentleman, I get it, it sucks when you don’t have tv, but she works a decent job so there’s no excuse for not getting one after that. I just need advice on how should I approach this whole thing.",04Feb2020,1

Our campuses are 4 hours away so I likely won’t have the chance to hangout with her until March. I felt a good connection and we snap each other a lot. 45 day streak, we have the red heart so she snaps me the most out of all her friends, as I do the same. Except now it’s been three days in a row where she has left me on opened. She’ll snap back after 6 hours or so, but I’ve been left on opened for 4 hours now. Still got the red heart emoji, but did she just forget to respond, is this the start of something bad? Am I overthinking? So many mixed signals.  I want to make it work with this girl. We aren’t in a relationship yet, but I’m more than a friend to her, but not completely 100% out of the friendzone yet. I don’t want to tell her my true feelings because that seems desperate.

Now we're staying in a house that we're losing, we're down to the last of our wood for heat (it hasn't been above 0 degrees for 2 months), and can't afford heating fuel, we don't have a reliable vehicle (we do have a car, but the brakes went out a few months ago and we haven't been able to afford to get them fixed.)

82,"Hi, any advice or thoughts on this issue would be amazing.

I am in the last few semesters of college. These years passed really quickly. Basically I wanted to enjoy college somehow. But I live with my parents and this is pretty much my everyday life:
I wake up and commute for an hour to college.
I get to first class.
I spend my day in university either by going to classes or getting lunch and talking to limited amount friends or go to work.
Then my last class ends and I leave for home. It’s either later at night or afternoon.
I never went to a single event or party or gathering. Maybe hung out with friends art night maximum of 2-3 times in these years. I don’t have many friends that would want to hang out with me. I have a few hobbies which are good but all are done at home.

Now why am I complaining now? Because life is really tiring and boring and I will be out of college soon. The commute’s gonna stay, so basically same thing but now I go to work. I lost the opportunity to enjoy my past few years and spent my time just studying and being at home. Now I’m here left with a known fact. If I socially couldn’t enjoy my time in this big college, then I can’t create fun after college. 
After an hour when I come back home  I just want to sleep and not think about anything because I’m exhausted, but then I’d have to do homework. I know that when I start working it will be the same, and I come back tired just to sleep and go back to work again the next morning.
I need help to get out of this. Also on weekends I get some rest and enjoy my alone time, but still not that fun and I also worry about the next week.
Thanks.",04Feb2020,1

My boyfriend has been encouraging me to get out of the house more, and I agree that I need to.

About a week ago I asked her to be my girlfriend and we hung out this past weekend and on Sunday we were chilling at the skate park and she got all quiet and I kept asking her if she was okay and she would always say yea and play it off but later on that night she tells me she is moving to a city about an hour and we decided the best thing to do was to just break up. She said living with her dad was really tiring she wouldn’t tell me any other reasons but I’m just asking for any advice because I’m really sad because me and her we’re very compatible I felt like I could spend the rest of my life with her she was amazing.

However, there’s a lot of days where I feel like I’m being dragged along with whatever she wants to do. For example, today I had an 11AM class but I was at home for the weekend which is 4 hours away. I woke up at 5AM and left to make it to class on time. Not 2 hours into my drive, she’s already laying out plans for the whole week and what we are going to do. After class we hung out. I didn’t even have the chance to put my bags in my dorm room and relax after the long drive. We drove around town doing whatever she wanted and I’m so exhausted. My bags were literally in her car the whole time so she could drop me off at my dorm. I have homework and I’m just getting back to my room at 8:45PM.

89,"So, for most of my life I've had mild insomnia. Some days I can sleep perfectly fine, practically at will.

Other days, it's just not possible. I can't do it. No matter what I do, no sleep comes. Even if my body should medically speaking be exhausted.

For most of the week, I'm usually fine. I fall asleep around normal time before work. 

But, when Sunday comes around, I always have big problems.

This is because I tend to sleep in over the weekend instead of waking up at 5am for work like I normally do. During the week, waking up at 5am always has me sleepy enough to fall asleep around 10 at night.

So, with me sleeping in over the weekend, Sunday is always very very difficult to sleep.

I'm in a predicament now.

So, Sunday morning, I woke up at about 10am. Not particularly early, not particularly late. 

I proceeded to have a normal day. Then bedtime came around.

Bedtime was about 8 o'clock, that's when I lay down and start winding myself down. Except I never wound down.

I didn't sleep a wink Sunday night. I laid in my bed trying my best to stay still and fall asleep. I didn't fall asleep, as far as I can tell. 

I kept looking at the clock after long periods of failing to sleep. First it was 10. Then it was 1. Then it was 3. Last time I looked at the clock, it was 3. I was completely conscious 100% for sure until about 3am, but there is a slight chance I may have entered some light form of sleep after 3am, because time seemed to elapse extremely quickly and then my alarm went off at 5am. So I may have actually slept for 2 hours in some form, but I can't tell.

Anyway, I had to go to work. I work in a factory, so it's really really really hard to work in a factory with sleep deprivation, especially at this level.  Your body doesn't work right. I get nauseous, anxiety, aches, weakness, dizziness, gassy.. I had that all today, but I made it through the 8 hour shift.

I got home completely dead. I'm still in the same position now because when I got home today I absolutely could not sleep either. I've been trying to fall asleep since 4pm today and it's 8:20pm now. 

I know my body is tired, I can feel it, but the sleep isn't coming. I'm not getting comfortable. My anxiety is running rampant, probably due to the sleep deprivation from the night before.

If it continues like this, I won't fall asleep tonight either. And there is absolutely no debate, I can't go to work if I don't sleep tonight. That's really bad.

I'm worried about my health a little. I'm having chest pains and feeling weird pressures in my body. 

I just want to get to sleep so I can go to work tomorrow. I have from now until 5am to make it to sleep.

I need some suggestions on what I can do to fall asleep.

I'm a Kratom user. Kratom is widely known to help sleep tremendously, and it does, but when I'm this anxious I don't like to take kratom because it either really helps the anxiety or makes it much worse.

I also have some melatonin. Took 10mg earlier, and it didn't help me sleep at all.

The only thing that seems to make me sleepy is thinking about sex, but I can't hold concentration. I'm serious, thinking about sex almost always helps me sleep but tonight it's not.

So, do any of you insomniacs have any ideas on how to put myself to sleep? Would eating help? A shower ? I dont know.",04Feb2020,1
90,"First, Thank you for reading this. 

So there’s this girl in one of my classes (college) that I have the hots for and I have no idea how to go about getting to know her/ asking her out. For context we only have this classes once a week, it’s a pretty small class, 15 students, which I suppose makes it easier. Last week was the first class we had together and I could swear that she was interested in me; caught her staring a couple of times, laughed at my jokes, smiled back when I smiled at her. I was pretty sure all that was a good sign. Today was our class, so, I decided to take the advice I’ve seen in similar questions: showered before class, shaved, dressed in well fitting clothes, basically just made myself more presentable. Nothing extreme, same thing I would do for any girl I was interested in. I show up to class early and lo and behold, she’s early too!! I’m thinking this is the perfect opportunity, but I get none of the ‘signs’ from last time, in fact, she’s completely ignoring me. I’m rather confused. Please help.",04Feb2020,1
91,"I (20F) started working at a very small manufacturing firm in October for an internship sort of deal. I was the first employee the owner had hired, and still am. At first it was going very well, I was learning a lot and my boss (the owner) was a great teacher. Then about 3 weeks in the whole dynamic got very hostile. Some of the things that have been happening are:

1. He has commented frequently about my sexuality. Saying things like ""I don't understand your lifestyle"" and ""your whole thing is a choice"". I never bring up the fact that I am gay, he always does. 
2. He believes that my mental illness (Generalized Anxiety Disorder) isn't real and I'm anxious because I don't believe in God. He tells me that I should start believing that God is real and I'll be cured. 
3. He tells me that I am not needed there. On multiple occasions he states that I am not important even though I produce parts and do my job so he doesn't have as much to do.
4. He lied to me about his business being ready to have an employee. Recently I have found out he has had me working illegally for 4 months. 
5. He stated in the beginning that he would provide a microwave/fridge. He hasn't supplied one so my lunches have consisted of protein bars/instant noodles made with the coffee pot. His wife delivers him food every single meal, and I am expected to just figure it out. 
6. He has not talked to me before making decisions about my involvement in the future of the company. He recently bought a project management system and enrolled me in it. It cost him money and he is already holding it over me. 

He also has this idea that I should be as invested in his business as he is. I am currently in my last semester of college and don't have time to work there constantly. He gets frustrated that I won't stay later than 7:00 pm, but I need time to do homework/eat/clean. 

I know that when I try to quit he will guilt trip me and try to manipulate me into feeling bad. He is an asshole and I expect him to react poorly. I have dealt with this since October and I am fed up. It has been draining to my mental health and relationships with friends and family. 

What do I say to quit? How can I guarantee that he won't try to withhold my check from me? What should I prepare myself for. 

Any advice helps. Thanks guys.",04Feb2020,1

93,"Important stuff: 
I have a very religious family, with only one atheist, my grandmother (and my grandpa/moms stepdad but I’m not super close to him). I don’t like most religious activities I’m told are good, church just doesn’t seem like my thing and overall I’m not a very religious person. And I don’t connect, at all. And I don’t talk to anyone about it because unless I can convince my grandma to keep a secret, I will just be lectured by my parents and forced to be even more involved. Church and other religious activities are not a choice for me, my parents make me do them. I want to be a believer, but I don’t know. It just isn’t working. Any advice would be appreciated. 


Details (sorry it’s so long, kinda turned into a rant, iv never opened up about this) 

I have religious parents. They grew up in the church, have been in religion their whole lives, and it’s been my families religion for generations. For context, we are Christians. And while there is some variation in what denomination, almost all my family are Christians. I have an atheist grandmother and grandfather, an auntie/cousins that are believers but are barely active in the church, and a couple of scattered family members that either aren’t active or haven’t talked about religion enough for me to know what they believe. 

My grandmother (and grandfather, but he is my grandmothers second husband and my mothers step-father so its a bit different with him) is the only close family I have that has declared themselves atheist. And while everyone treats her no different and adores her, whenever her and religion are mentioned there is always this disapproving tone (particularly from my step-father). Also, anyone in my family that isn’t super involved in the church is encouraged to be more involved. And that’s just my moms side of the family. My dads side I don’t feel like getting into to much detail about, but I will say half of them are missionaries. I’m not kidding, half, I counted. And a lot of the other people work in Christian related fields. Anyway, long story short, everyone (with grandma as the one exception) is very religious. 

As far as my beliefs go, well I also grew up in the church. Going to Sunday school, volunteering, attending services. Literally every Sunday we are at church. Often I would get jealous of other kids who had two days off instead of only one. Church would often be placed at time where I would either have a very small or simply skip breakfast, or a very late lunch. Also, not even going to sugar coat it, services are boring as fuck. So it isn’t my favorite thing. Also, it’s not a choice. I can’t not go, I have asked my parents before. They will only let me not go If I have plans that cannot be re-scheduled. Ngl, I kind of, not hate it, but really dislike it. 

I don’t connect with anything. I just don’t. As soon as I started growing up and got a mind of my own there has been this growing disconnect. I just, can’t. I want to believe, and I try. But it feels wrong, or maybe not wrong but I just don’t feel like a believer. I tried to connect, to believe, and be involved. But I just can’t, and to be honest, I don’t think church is for I’m me. Even if I could connect, I simply not a very religious person. And even though I want to believe, I don’t want to do all the stuff I’m told to do. Youth group, youth services, volunteering + sitting in service (I’m fine with volunteering, I love it, but then going right into a service and being at church for more than four hours? No), bible studies, book clubs, most church events, church camp, and even going to church is not my favorite thing. I just can’t that. I don’t want to. I hate the situation. I want it to change, I need it to change it’s too much. I can’t leave my family, and the more I think about it the more I think I may just have to accept the role of the family black sheep.

94,"I don't wanna sound like i'm submerged in self-pity, I just want to vent stuff going on cause i've never actually spoken out about it. It's not anything huge or incredibly problematic, but it's something that's been bottled up for years and years. I'm kind of hoping for some sort of reassurance or advice, but even just taking the time to read this is something I greatly appreciate. 

I have ASD, and while i'm high functioning and basically blend with everyone else, its difficult to hide the stigma that comes with autism and being hyperactive. Me and my friends all joke about it, and they assure me that i'm essentially neurotypical, but I constantly find myself rev'd up to 100 miles per hour worrying about everything constantly. I took up running (XC and Distance Track) to help with this and it's helped to vent my surge of energy and worry in a very positive way. Before I knew it, I was one of Varsity's cream of the crop, and felt good in a way I hadn't felt in a long time. However, I took up a college in high school program and my sports tanked, due to copious amounts of stress from assignments. The pressure to succeed in both aspects of my life hit hard, and it made me kind of shut down my motivation. I let down my teammates in some of the biggest competitions of the season due to just not caring anymore, and I felt like I was being pulled by my collar through fall quarter, and barely made it out with two classes having okay grades and a withdrawal. I don't regret the program, just how I handled it and the consequence it brought. Winter quarter has gone much much smoother, and I found myself being more disciplined in both sports and school, but I still can't figure out how to slow down and just be sometimes. 

As all this went on, I caught feelings for one of my teammates who i've known for a long time. I've always sort of feared this sort of thing, as its not something i'm particularly good at. I can sometimes be insensitive or too blunt when im actually trying to be joking and understanding. Sometimes I outright slip up trying to speak and convey thoughts. I was bullied a lot as a kid in elementary school and middle school, and I think I haven't gotten past it yet. As a result, I try to avoid intimacy as a way of protecting myself, and I pretty much start to wallow whenever I find myself thinking of someone. With this teammate, I actually tried to go for it. I waited a long time, long after she had shown interest in me, and hung out with her. It was awkward and conversation was dry, I could tell whatever was there before died a long time ago. It started to reinforce my self-doubt, and I've been in the dumps lately because of it. I've always wanted a deep connection with someone but I've never gotten further than friends. Maybe i'm being too desperate but its hard to see people with each other and think that i'm not capable of that. I want to be clear, however, that I am lucky to be the way I am. There are people who actually have a hard time function with Autism, and need to be cared for and such. But damn, it still sucks being so mentally fatigued all the time. I just wanna know how I can see myself differently, and actually connect with people in a more meaningful way in general without being weird.

98,"So I (28f) just returned home after living abroad for 5 years. I did this basically to be closer to my family and fiance, knowing that my professional opportunities here would be greatly reduced. 

Fiance is doing a PhD (unpaid) so we are basically spending our savings to live. We have enough savings for 2 years but I'd really prefer to get a job to at least make enough for the expenses of us both.

Dad has a small software company not related to what I studied (structural engineering) but in the same field. Since I have experience in the field he has some great ideas which he would want me to develop. I have been basically working for free for a couple of weeks because I am helping him and also because it is very interesting. I am no developer but I have learned a lot lately, and I actually find it very fun (but challenging). I told my dad about hiring me officially and he says that they can only afford to pay me say $2000 (fiance and I would need around $2700 to live comfortably but without luxuries). 

I also applied for another company to do something which is directly related to what I studied, and I think they would pay me up to $3500 based on my experience. Based on what I have heard it is very likely that I will be offered this job. I have already done these tasks before so it would be very comfortable, but probably not much room for innovation as with my dad.

My dad is very sentimental about his company, he says that I will be in charge someday and I am genuinely very happy to help him implement the ideas and also improve other stuff. He told me that he is worried that someone will offer me a good job and I wi leave him and that makes me sad. However, I am also afraid of a. Not being good enough for his company because I am not a developer and b. Forgetting everything I studied and letting go my own thing for pursuing something unknown.

102,"This post is gonna sound crazy but you’ll probably think I am by the end of it. 

I (21 F) have a decent life. I struggle with mental health but it’s managed. My ex boyfriend (23 M) broke up with me back in September. March would have been 5 years. We almost closed on a house in October, talked about getting married, and we share a beautiful (2 M) toddler. He broke up with me due to fighting. Over the past months we tried working things out and in January I found out he was cheating on me for 4 years. Emotional cheating and had secondary Snapchat so some sexual. He deleted and blocked all his girls and swears it’s now all about me. He stated he is quite far from giving up on me. I’m afraid I’m never going to be in love with him like I used to be. I have a zero tolerance on cheating and here I am.. still trying. I know I’ll always love and care for him but not in the way I have. Here’s the next part—

I (21 F) had to make a new Facebook (3rd one right now) due to my ex getting onto my last one. My first one was just outdated since I was off social media for awhile. I added my first boyfriend on my new one back in the beginning of Jan. I didn’t talk to him. He (23 M) reached out and just wanted to say I deserve love and happiness since some of my post were a little down. We didn’t talk. He has a wife and two kids. I don’t homewreck. I know what it’s like. I wouldn’t want to do it to anyone else. I reached out and bought a helmet from him. He did delete me beforehand and said sorry due to the fact he couldn’t stop thinking about me. After that we talked and it was venting. He wanted advice and insight on how I deal with my mental health. I have Bipolar, Anxiety, Depression, ADHD, PTSD, etc.. this sounds crazy but him and I have this chemistry. We haven’t talked in almost 10 years. I would have been 13 and him 15. We picked up like nothing ever happened (at the time we had to spilt because I was not in good health and it was toxic). I have never loved or clicked with anyone like him. I was infatuated with my ex-boyfriend but it’s all gone since I found out about the cheating. The sparks would come and go. Now they are gone. My first boyfriend and I confirmed we feel the same way. There’s this chemistry or whatever and when we talk it feels like we are lifelong friends. Today he had to make a decision and I didn’t know exactly what it was but he must’ve had to take me out of his life because I am deleted and blocked. Which is fine— I want him to be happy and love his life. I’m stuck now though..

Will I ever find someone who will make me feel the way he did? Idk about soulmates or whatever but when I talked to him I felt happier and lighter. I felt like I could talk to him about anything and not be judged. I looked forward to talking to him. I just wanted to help and be there for him as well since I know how hard mental health crap can be. As much as I tried to ignore and fight whatever there was we both knew it was too much to ignore. So, any ideas on what I should do? My ex wants to keep trying and win me over. Obviously my first love is out of my life...  but am I settling for my ex? Did I miss out on this lifetime of happiness with my first love? Will I ever find or feel the way I did like with my first? I don’t want to sound defeated. But I sure feel like it. Any advice or insight would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!",04Feb2020,1

111,"Hello! Posting on a throwaway just so you guys know I’m not bullshitting or karmafarming. 

A little background. I am 16 years old, my dad died when I was 13 and I was super close with him. My mom isn’t by any means poor, she has a good paying job as a nurse but is can be quite stressful. 

Even though she may not make a lot of money, she does EVERY. THING. SHE. CAN. For me. I don’t want to get into details but for the situation we are/have been in, she spoils me. It fucking kills me seeing her work all the time. She’s getting older. She is in her 50’s, she has debt, and she’s doing the best she can.

Admittedly, I don’t want to sound like I am some sort of amazing kid either. I’ve had my fair share of fuck ups and there have been times I haven’t been the greatest kid ever. But I really want to do something nice for her for once and spoil her instead of yours truely. I don’t want to get into how I got the money (yes it is legal money lol) but I have around $5,000 and I want to give it all to her.

I know she’s going to cry, and there will probably be lots of emotions going through her head. I wouldn’t say we are paycheck to paycheck,  but she does the absolute best she can. I’m just pondering how I should do it. I am going to but a butthole and record it so I have it forever (Muahahaha) but I just don’t know how to go about it. I’ve though about a few scenarios. But I really want it to sound genuine.

Obviously it’s not everyday someone does this (let alone for my age). I know it’s going to shock her to all hell. But what’s the best way to go about this? Just sitting down and having a chat? Putting it in her purse?  Any other ideas? I am just having a hard time getting past the inevitable priceless look on her face when I do it. I may post the video on reddit when I do it but I haven’t decided yet. Any thoughts or ideas on how to exactly do this is much appreciated guys. Love you all❤️",04Feb2020,1
112,"Backstory: I live with my grandparents and I help them with their daily lives and very recently began to work full time. My grandmother is in rehab due to having surgery and is going through physical therapy and will be for two months 'at least'. My grandfather has, what we thought, mild dementia. I think the stress of my grandmother not being home has driven is dementia into free fall. It also doesn't help that he hasn't taken the medication that he was prescribed to prolong his illness. He straight up won't and refuses. 

Main story:

My grandfather attacked me last week. Broke skin and even drew blood. The attack happened after I told him that I could not fix his computer due to me having to go to work, but after work I could. 


He did not like that.


I felt like something was wrong and off, so I recorded the conversation audio with my phone. There is audio of him coming after me and attacking me as I tried to leave in my car.

Now I am being told that he wants me to move out. I have no choice, he wants me gone. 

I have friends in the Midwest who are welcoming me in, however I am not sure what to do. I have only been at my new job for a month and I love it there. My supervisor knows that my grandfather is going through the dementia, but not to the full extent of what happened a week prior.

I want to file a police report, but I am scared. 

I want to ask my job if I can transfer, as I work for a company that is hired by Costco. There are like five of them where I plan on moving. 

I want to feel safe.

Although my feeling aren’t as “intense” as they were back in middle school, I still get that tingly feeling whenever I see his post. When I post a story on ig I always involuntarily check if he watched it too (he’s usually one of the first ones to watch). 
Although over the years I’ve had multiple other crushes, I’ve gotten over all of them, but somehow I can never get over him? 
We used to talk pretty often, we’d also play basketball every day at school (yeah I was “one of the boys” lol) and I think we did have a connection but since we were in middle school and then I transferred to another school. We then texted almost every day over the summer, we’d send memes to each other etc etc. 
But then I deleted ig and all connection was lost, two years later I followed him, he followed back. And although we like each other’s posts and watch each other’s stories, we haven’t talked since.

I ended up switching all my classes to online and now work full time (we're 16). I don't talk to anyone from that school.

now she's got a group of friends in her classes and I guess I feel left out. I don't have many friends anymore; I don't even want them. I just want to be with her. she doesn't hang out outside school with them bc she doesn't like them enough to do that, and doesn't want to lose time with me.

they're not very nice to her. they don't appreciate how great she is, and she deserves better. tbh she deserves better than me, and that's probably why I'm so jealous of these other people. she makes me feel whole, like a good friend does. but I miss her when she's talking to them instead of me.

I have a lot of abandonment issues from my childhood. I'm in therapy. I feel disgusted for feeling this way. im gay and I've kind of given up dating, so I spend more time with her. and maybe I'm too attached. idk.maybe this doesn't even make sense, but I had to say sth. it's hard to tell her, even tho sometimes she feels the exact same way.",04Feb2020,1

I asked to be transferred to a different location last year, partly because I don't like our office and partly because it's pretty far from my house. The only thing this job has going for it is that it pays slightly better than other jobs that I can get.

 So, here's my dilemma: We are allotted a certain amount of paid vacation days that we can take whenever we want as long as A.) we ask 3 weeks in advance and B.) two people at the same position can't take the same day off. So, I went and bought plane tickets to take a 1 month vacation towards the end of the year. I told my boss, and they said I'm not sure if you can take all your vacation at once. They asked their boss and their boss said no because ""if you take your vacation and then get fired or quit, we might ask you to pay back that money"". It did not cross my mind to use up my vacation then quit, but this pissed me off. It's like a slap in the face to say we don't trust you to use your vacation at once. Also, this vacation is towards the end of the year so it'll have been well earned. 

I've paid thousands for two plane tickets and they're non-refundable so there is no question that I am going to quit my job and go on this vacation. The question, however, is should I use some vacation time then quit over email so I can still get another paycheck, or do I give them a notice in advance so I can use them as a reference for my next job?

I found a new trainer, B, who I didn’t like as much because he isn’t as naturally outgoing and fun as A, but he was fine! Unfortunately I also kind of dropped the ball on my fitness goals around this time as I let life get in the way. Long story short, gained back about 15lbs. 
Fast forward to now, my old trainer, A, is back. I haven’t seen him yet but I’m almost dreading it because 
1. I’ve gained weight since he left, and I’m embarrassed, even though I’m still trying!
2. I don’t know what to do or who to stick with. I have had better results with A but that could be because of my own mental state when I first started. But also I just like A’s personality more!

The gf has had a lot of issues and drama surrounding her and after we all sign the following day she says she doesnt want to anymore and would rather stay with a private landlord because of a falling out with her parents. Me and housemate agreed to move in with them for next year however we have to get out of our agreement tenancy and hopefully within the month we are let go from them. It was a shocker to know that we paid deposits and then immediately friends gf backfires on the agreement and boyfriend relectunly agrees.

140,"Ok so I recently turned 18. My group of friends is super small, there’s three of us and we’re all close as can be. Last year we decided that when one of our birthday’s roll around, the other two people in the trio would spend around £50 between us on several smaller, thoughtful gifts. Friend A’s birthday was last October, so me and Friend B spent a full day collecting gifts for her that we thought she’d really enjoy. We did spend around £25 each, on makeup, eyelashes, posters, candles, etc... 

I’ve been best friends with these people for 5 years now, we’ve experienced so much together and I’m probably closer with them than my own sister. So it shocked me when, on my birthday earlier this year, they put a £10 note in a card. They got me a vinyl pop figure, which was around a tenner as well. I don’t even collect them/have never expressed an interest in them so like ??? It was so thoughtless. 

I’m not a greedy person by all means. It’s just weird considering how close we are, that they clearly put 0 effort into the gift and put it together last minute. It feels like a slap in the face, as two months before I put so much more effort into Friend A’s gift and they didn’t think to do the same for me back. I literally don’t get it. 

It seems like such a small issue but it’s gnawing at the back of my mind. I feel like they don’t care about me as much as I do them. Maybe I’m jumping to conclusions. I’m not angry I’m just kinda hurt and confused. Usually if something has annoyed me I’ll just ask them for clarification, but in this case I feel like it’d come off as so superficial if I were to bring it up.

143,"Hey,

Long story short, I want to pick up from my family and leave either the country or my city. I want to change my name, my number and just leave. I have personal reasons for this. It's something I've been thinking about doing for a while now and so now I feel is the right time to begin preparing.

&amp;#x200B;

I am 18 years old from the United Kingdom and I am working full time (£10.58 per hour 12 hours a day, 4 days a week). Please give me advice as to where to start. I am not looking to be judged over doing this again I'm just looking for advice as to where to start.",04Feb2020,1
144,"I'm going to start this off by saying, I am an almost 15 year old girl. I'm also on mobile, and crying as I type this so there's going to be mistakes. I'm not going to bother fixing them.  I'm also sorry if I accidentally broke any rules, as I'm completely desperate and fed up. 

It is a very long chain of events, but to try and sum it all up my brothers (TwinA and Twin B, 9yrs)  told my mom about the trip my grandmother was planning for me and them to go on with our father. She did not want to include my mother because they do not EVER get along. She refuses to go over for dinners, and birthday celebrations and christmas and what not. She doesnt even try to use her fake cheery voice when she's forced to talk on the phone with her. 

My mother became absent in both my and my brother(s)  lives a year or two after they were born, slowly becoming so depressed that it got to a point where an 11 year old was taking care of her younger, rowdy twin brothers all the time because her mother was sleeping all day every day. My father is a trucker, and has been since I was 8, so he's not home for a week or two at a time. 

Eventually, she overdosed on Twin A and B's 8th birthday. She locked herself in the bathroom and was acting like a two year old, refusing to come out and go with us(Father, elder sister(28) ) to celebrate. So, we left without her. We came home, shes sleeping. A normal occurrence. Finally, at 10 when we tried to wake her up she wouldnt wake up, and we had to call 911. She was in the ICU for about 4 or 5 days. She almost died. 


She claimed my father tried to kill her, blaming it on him even though we weren't even FUCKING HOME.


Anyway, she did get therapy, and was forced into the psych ward for a week. It didnt help at all, and she probably lied her way out. It's just how she is. Now we're at a point where my father is fed up with her shit, he tries to love her and treat her well but she doesnt live. She just survives. Shes back to where she was before the OD, and wont even try to love my father. 


It hurt me so fucking terribly that she wont even try to hear out my father's idea. Since she's lazy, and probably wont make it walking around parks in Florida(Disney, Universal, etc) and also doesn't like flying, He wanted to let her choose somewhere to go with my sister and her mother. She wont even hear him out, claiming she 'isnt apart of the family' and refusing to answer his calls, he is threatening to cancel the entire trip. Keep in mind, my family isnt the richest, so this would be our very first time in flordia, and  stepping foot in a disney park. I've always wanted to go since I was young, and my brothers were both very excited to go. They cant understand why my grandma doesnt want to include her. 

Now, its left to me to solve things as the oldest in the house and my sister is refusing to pick up the phone. I need advice, help whatever you can give because I dont know what to do anymore. I'm lost. I'm willing to provide more information if needed, I apologize if this was long and kind of all over because I'm all over right now and I dont know what to do. 

Please, help me.  She seems to have calmed down but she'll probably blow me off and block out me trying to reason with her.",04Feb2020,1
145,"So 5 days ago, I had a mental breakdown at work. I completely lost control and got really angry, started yelling ""kill me"" over and over. At the same time, I was smashing product on the ground, and was tipping our displays over in a rage. At one point I screamed at my store manager ""fuck you"" and told my other manager that I was going to kill myself and that I would blame him for it. Like I said, I lost control.

While I'm not justifying my actions, I do have an associated health problem. This has been something I've been struggling with for years. I was sent to the hospital for mental health problems in 2017 when I was worried I would commit suicide, and there I was treated for Major Depressive Disorder and Anxiety. Got prescribed Lexapro, etc.

I've since gone off Lexapro in 2018 because I wasn't satisfied with taking medications, and I've been mostly stable, apart from a few minor incidents. However, since December of 2019, I've been in a very bad place. My home-life has been very negative due to a verbally abusive situation with my father, and the stress of work.

I've been working in the same place for almost a full year now, since it first opened. It's been through its ups and downs, but I've always really enjoyed working there. However, in the past 2-3 months, we hired a new Store Manager. And to put it bluntly, he sucks at his job. He's easily the worst employee we have right now. He actively sabotages our work, which is like a punch in the gut, especially after we have all tried so hard to get the store into great shape. On top of that, store reviews were coming up soon, and our poor performance would negatively impact our raise, all thanks to this one guy ruining everything.

So, needless to say, I've been stuck between a rock and a hard place, and it all just exploded that night. Luckily it didn't occur in front of any customers, because it was after-hours. But my assistant manager called the police to take me to the hospital, which I gave him consent to do (I wasn't arrested, they just simply took me there).

I was given a psychiatric evaluation for depression, however I told them I didn't feel comfortable going into the psychiatric ward. Which was true. Now, I've been at home, just trying to work things out, and see a therapist. I spoke to my Store Manager and he said that I was being placed on an Administrative Leave, and that HR would contact me in a few days.

Well, it's been a few days, and HR still hasn't contacted me, however. I spoke with one of the Supervisors who works there, and he mentioned that he heard from another Supervisor that I was terminated. Apparently the other supervisor heard it directly from the Store Manager.

He also checked our records, and I was still active. So we believe the Manager is lying. Of course that's not necessarily the case, but this Manager is kind of a duplicitous guy, and it wouldn't be out of his character to lie.

At this point, I'm planning on getting into contact with my Physician to see if he can pull up my diagnosis, if I even actually have one. Then I'm going to get into contact with HR, and following that, call the Manager and ask him when I can come back to work.

I would appreciate any advice or insight at this time, thank you.

TL;DR - I damaged merchandise in a suicidal mental break at work. Placed on Administrative Leave. May have gotten fired from my job. Don't know if I'm eligible for unemployment, and am not sure what to do.",04Feb2020,1

Furthermore, my friend is really smart and got admission to a top 10 university.

Also, I really just want to make a lot of good friends, and this seems like the most reliable way. I am also wondering if they even care about GPA that much, because after all, they are frat guys.

Some context — I’m a middle class person of color (15M) who lives in the United States. I go to a super preppy, expensive as hell, private school (got in on a partial scholarship). You can probably expect that there’s not that much diversity, which is where my first problem arises. I’ve heard a lot of people talk about this before where they ‘find their people’ but there is not a single other person in my grade who looks or talks like me. I don’t feel in place at all.
 On top of that, school has been really stressful recently. I haven’t been doing poorly, but it’s super stressful. It seems like these things are temporary problems but I feel like the reality is that it continues throughout high school if I don’t address it, and maybe it might chase me for the rest of my life. 

Oh, and on top of all that, I have some serious problems at home on both sides of my family. My sister is super spoiled (goes to the same school, but has been there for longer) and she has lost all respect for our parents who sent her there. She’s just plain nasty to them and it hurts me.

Basically, my dad has and is an abusive father. He has beat me and everyone in the family. A lot of times (99%) of the times, for no reason. 

So, because of that, my mental health and confidence was already pretty low. I had suicide thoughts through my time at home but I was able to push them away. But when I went to Uni (I go to UT Austin) (I went to community college for two years) my mental health got even worse. I was depressed, had no friends, barely left the apartment, and was suicidal all the time. I was so afraid that I would kill myself that I decided I was going to take some time off (along with a 1.56 GPA and an academic dishonesty form. My parents don’t know about those). My parents were okay at first but after a few weeks, my dad was extremely mad and I was so left the house but came back the same night because I was afraid for my mom and my cousin convinced me.

A few days later, I came to live with my aunt and cousin and I’ve been here ever since. My confidence has gone up and my stress is much lower. I’m also seeing a psychiatrist and a psychologist. They think I have ocd among other things.

The past few days, my dad has been texting me and basically saying to cut him out of my life and he also said he won’t financially support me anymore. I respectfully said I understand and wish him the best (this is overall. He also cussed at me a lot). I have been looking for a job and hopefully will start applying in a few days once I have a list of jobs I can apply.

My aunt is extremely against me getting a job but my cousin says I should. I told him I don’t want my aunt paying for me and I also don’t want to be at home all the time.

186,"I'm VERY insecure. I literally can make an entire list about what's wrong with my face alone, and I spend a lot of my time focused on it and thinking about it throughout the day. I can't even chill for a second, because my mind is reminding me of everything I hate about my appearance.



The last two months, I've been seeing a guy kinda casually. We aren't dating, but it feels like we are. And even though he compliments me, I can't get myself to let him look at me in person because the entire time I'm thinking about how he'll realize I'm actually ugly and lose interest in me


I feel like i look like a little boy. My nose is ugly, I have super hooded eyes and my ex told me I'd look more feminine if I got an eyebrow lift. My eyebrows suck, and I do all I can with makeup. My teeth are absolutely awful. My lips aren't great. And I've got an insanely big forehead. I have crazy hair and tried bangs before, and it didn't work out :(



I just don't know what to do. I genuinely feel I'm one of the most unattractive girls in the world, and I dont believe anyone could genuinely find me attractive even in the least. I feel like this guy isn't seeing me for real, and thinks I'm pretty when I'm not and if he looks at me too long he'll realize


This is driving me insane. I don't know what to do. I see beautiful girls everywhere and wish I looked like them but I don't. I'm actually unattractive. What do I do?",04Feb2020,1

192,"I have a cat who I've raised since she was about 8 weeks. When she was younger she was insanely sweet, but as she got older something in her changed. I have absolutely no idea what went wrong with her, but it's like she became feral. I have never abused her in any way, shape, or form. But it just felt like out of nowhere she didn't like being held, being pet (when I try to she'll lower down to the ground to avoid it), it's like over time she grew to hate humans. I don't know where it went wrong. And I was willing to put up with it due to the fact that she's my responsibility, maybe it'll change after awhile. It got worse.

She shits on the floor. I have tried EVERY SINGLE SOLUTION to this. I've done carpet sprays, vaccuming, cleaning the box every single day, having 3 litter boxes in the whole house (because we got another cat, but it's been so long she should've been used to him by now), now I've been resorting to putting the litter box in the bathtub, but she'll still intentionally shit RIGHT OUTSIDE of it, even when there was absolutely no sand in the bathtub itself. She's doing this on purpose, I know it. I've never had a cat that's had this bad of a problem. It's been going on for a year, and I'm sick of it. I'm tired of my carpet having brown stains on the floor, I'm tired of the house smelling like cat shit that hasn't been covered.

But the problem is-- I can't find someone who will take her. No one is interested. Absolutely no one. I'm about to try to do one more option, I joined a facebook group that advertises animals for free. I'm going to try there.

If all else fails, and I mean all else, I know I'll get a lot of downvotes for this, but I might have to ditch the cat. I normally would not do this, but I have a legit good feeling she can survive on her own. Here's why:

She constantly kills wild animals and brings it to our doorstep when she's outside. Most of them are half eaten before we find them. She one time brought a mouse into the house and ate it right in front of us, and on top of that, she out runs any animal I've ever met. I think she somehow wasn't socialized enough as a kitten, even though she was extremely sweet when she was a kitten.

So, I don't know what to do. I really don't. Do you guys think she's just not a socialized cat and would survive in the wild permanently? I personally think she can survive. But again, the idea of it sounds horrible so I'm just not sure.

While ditching is the last option, I truly don't think letting her go is such a bad idea. Any tips?",04Feb2020,1

194,"Well... Let me explain my situation, my sex life used to be extremely nice, I couldn't complain about my boyfriend cause he was the best but since September he started to work in the night shift, 7 pm to 7am and our sex life got so fucking Mediocre, he's tired and sleepy all the time, we still have sex, it's good... If I had to give it a grade... It used to be 9/10 and now it's like 6/10. And I usually do all the work, like I said he's pretty tired so our sex consists on me masturbating him, me going on top, me giving him a blowjob, me going on top again, I cum he cums it's over, it's been months since he hasn't done oral in me, we always go for the same position, I mean I really like being on top but he doesn't change even when he can see that I'm tired of all the ""workout"". And I honestly already asked him a Thousand times to make more effort, to at least try to do some nice for me, oral, idk... Fore play, I payed a lot of money on a butt plug and we only used once. I'm really sad lately, not even joking, I'm always the one who starts everything, I wish that for once he tried to do something nice like ""hey tonight you don't have to do anything just lay down"" cause he used to do this! I swear, so many times he dedicated like 1 hour just to give me pleasure but after changing shifts... Things got stale. He only gets TRULY excited and interested in sex when he gets slightly drunk (but just a little bit)

I really need some advice, my sex life is boring and I just wanna improve it. Please don't say things like ""break up with him"" not gonna break up with someone because of sex.",04Feb2020,1

For some background and context: I am a recent graduate and my friend is graduating at the end of the current semester at a different school that is 90 minutes away from my current address. We have hung out five times alone, and hooked up in two of those occasions. We only text each other when we’re free and want to see each another. We haven’t hooked up since the start of winter break. Our recent texts still have a relaxed, friendly vibe and she made time out of her day to get food after I stopped by to visit three days ago. So, I wanted to surprise her with a home cooked meal because she only eats out while in school. If I do this, she’ll probably let me sleep over but I’m cool if she doesn’t. The purpose of asking her sister for help, is to find out if she’s interested in someone, if someone else asks her on a date or what time my friend will be home so I can surprise her. Her sister and I have met when I slept over at my friend’s place. Please do not tell me to ask her out straight up, because I am not concerned nor worried if she goes on a date with someone else.

Part of me wants to do it but the other part of me knows it’s a really bad idea because I don’t want to betray any trust or risk her telling him everything if they’re super close.

198,"Hi, 

I posted something along these lines in r/schizoid but thought I should probably also get advice from non-PD individuals to make sure my sample isn’t polarized. Apologies in advance for waxing poetic about the troubles of a messed up mind that is relearning how to feel.

Last year I was (sort of) diagnosed with schizoid personality disorder; my doctor told me I fit all of the criteria but that I was high functioning enough that she thought a label would only serve as a detriment to my intended career in a field where that sort of thing is frowned upon. She didn’t think she could do much for me treatment wise as she thinks I’ve dealt with it very well myself and that any progress I make must come from experience with emotions—I’m working on that. 

[(Here’s the Wikipedia entry for SPD if you want more information on it.)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizoid_personality_disorder)

For me, the disorder presents covertly: I seem “normal” and live a very average life. I have friends, although from what I understand I have a different definition of that as I am generally quite detached emotionally. At the risk of sounding Caulfield-esque, my friends are people who I find entertaining and to have a less aggravating presence than most. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not a psychopath. I would never hurt anybody intentionally—I know how it feels to be on the receiving end of such things and wouldn’t wish it on anyone, in fact I suspect this disorder came about from emotional abuse in my childhood. 

Quite recently a rather exciting but disconcerting epiphany came to me: I find myself enjoying, even craving, a relationship with someone. On one hand, I’m glad that the work I’ve been doing on myself seems to be making progress and the tin (wo)man is finding her heart. On the other hand, that specific someone is entirely problematic. 

I’ve reached the troubling conclusion that I’m enamored with my boss. We’ve a  peculiar relationship. We’re the only two workers at this business. Working closely together and having shared interests had created a strange bond: we get lunch at least once a week, text outside of work, and are pretty chummy in general. Flirting has entered the dynamic occasionally, usually initiated by him—I find it to be quite entertaining but nothing more than banter has ever occurred and I would never initiate anything further (however, I cannot say I wouldn’t go along with it were he to initiate something, which I don’t quite understand as prior to this I thought I was asexual, which is common with SPD).  For some weird reason he is one of the two individuals whose presence I actively wish for in my life (the other is my dog).  

This is an issue for several reasons. First and foremost, he’s my boss, married, and 20 years older than me.  That one’s pretty self-explanatory—no relationship other than friendship could, would, or should ever happen but sometimes the lines have become blurred by flirtation. Secondly, it’s causing me to come in to conflict with myself. I just graduated uni (I worked during my studies) and am planning on further studies, for which I would be moving away. My affection for my boss is making me question if I should wait to go to professional school for a few more years to enjoy our friendship. This sounds silly but there is something in my brain that says “You never feel anything. Doing something to do away with the rare feelings you are experiencing is foolish because you’ll never have another authentic friendship like this ever again.”

This leads me to two choices that I can think of: go on to graduate school and attempt to further my growth there, or hang on for a few years so that I can enjoy a fulfilling friendship for once knowing that those don’t happen for me (by no fault but my own).  What would you do? Being in this position and also having a personality disorder leaves me to think that it is clouding my judgement, so I really appreciate any advice or opinion you might have on this. 

TL;DR: I am now feeling things for a person when that isn’t something that happens for me. Do I stick around to enjoy the feelings, or move on with my life and career? If you’re reading this and thinking “Damn, bitch, you live like this?” that’s fair.",04Feb2020,1
199,It all started 4 years ago when I moved to another county for school.I gotta make new friends and relationships now and for the first 2 years it went decent but I was an asshole and didnt talk to alot of them after that and after realizing they weren't the best people to be around with and then my freshman year rolled around and it went very well for making friends and I had alot of them but here is the first problem since I came to this county late and people already knew each other and already have friends they talk to rather then talking to me but there is nothing wrong with that and I know this. But it just gets lonely as fuck sometimes and even when I'm with one of my friend groups I still feel like I dont belong there with them but most of the people I talk to is online and I have known them for a while and I have multiple groups there where I hang out constantly but its online and sometimes I just wanna meet them irl but all of them have there own lives and live in different places and I would find myself in the same situation with my already irl friends so I'm just having a hard time trying to ask to hang out or talk cause they got more important people to be with and idk what to do and I have tried asking people I'm acquainted with but not know them to well but I'm to afraid to ask cause of anxiety and I keep making these narrative in my head of what they will say and dislike me and its overwhelming to me.Im sorry if this is long I just wanted to vent this somewhere so yeah I just hope to get some advice cause idk where else to post this,04Feb2020,1

202,"Hi I'm in high school and I dyed my hair yesterday a pinkish-orange. The school dress code says ""no non-natural hair colors"" but I see other girls with non-natural hair colors at school including a pastel pink and blue, and they are perfectly fine. I also see people wearing hats and bandanas, which are also not allowed, so I figure I would be fine if I dyed my hair a slightly pinkish-orange. Which I admit is a little bright but it'll fade. 

The assistant principal told me that its against dress code and its ""distracting"" (trust me no student actually cares about it) and to change it and that was the end of that. Later that day the principal talked to me at lunch and said he thought it was a cool color.

I personally think that since the principal doesn't really care about it that its fine but I dont know what I should do. My friend suggested that I should ask the principal if i could keep it so that if the assistant principal says something I can tell him that the principal said its fine.

Sorry if I sound dumb, I’m really clueless, I don’t really have anyone I can ask and google searches can only tell me so much and still leave me with many questions 

So, what are expenses that may come up? I know there’s application fees, deposits, pet fees which I won’t need to do. I see some where electricity I guess isn’t included, how much would electricity be? And are there start up fees for that? How much would be a decent enough to save up to move out comfortably? I plan on getting used furniture for the most part so that area won’t be much of an expensive cost.

204,"My friend and I have been friends for 3 years now and we know each other pretty well. We always have fun together and she's always really bubbly around our friends and we are always the ones to make funny jokes, but lately I've been realizing that she is kind of scared to be alone. I don't know why I'm only seeing it now or if she has always been like this, but I just realized 3 weeks ago when we were going to apply for a university with my other friends and I invited her to come with us but she said she can't because she was shy. Stuff came around and we ended up both not coming along the college application. We also frequently meet-up with each other and every time, she is afraid that I'd be late because she would be scared or anxious when she's alone. Of course she doesn't tell me that, but when I open my messages I am bombarded by texts from her telling me to hurry up with some panic between the lines. This happens frequently.

She actually has a sister who has mental health issues (she's getting therapy now) but we both know that they are different from each other so I don't know if she's slowly getting influenced by her sister because, of course, they hang out. She is the type to pick up some mannerisms and actions from others, without her even realizing so maybe there is a relation. I've struggled with social anxiety, myself, for some time in the past but I got over it in a hard way by pushing myself out of my comfort zone and just letting things happen, but I don't know if it would work on her because she's always pretty afraid. 

I do have some ways on how to help her. I was thinking that I should let her be on her own and get used with her own company and realize that it's not so scary after all, and I always remind her that other people don't care about her being there and that they have their own businesses to handle but she gets into her head pretty easily. She doesn't really talk to me about the anxiety she's experiencing, i don't know if she's just shy or doesn't realize it, but I can feel it and I want to help her. Maybe letting her be on her own seems like it's not a good solution, but it would teach her to be comfortable with being on her own.

I have a Job lined up for me when I graduate. I journal everyday, watch my sleep and go the gym a lot. I finally sleep like a healthy person. This sounds great right?  


Unfortunately, My mental Health has degraded greatly in college. I had bunch of friends and was very social in the beginning years. Now I don't have many friends, I wasn't into drinking or smoking so I let many opportunities slip by. I go through many days now not saying a single word. I eat alone in the dining halls. The weekends I just feel gloomy while doing my school work. During Winter and Summer breaks I don't leave the house (1. because I don't have a car atm. 2 I have no where to go). I journal and go to the gym because I could literally feel myself breaking apart for not expressing myself. I try to make new friends but it tough to open up and show charismatic behavior because I genuinely don't feel happy with my life. I don't open up to people because of trying to be more masculine. (stupid, I know)   


I hate reflecting on my life, I see old friends who I used to associated with and their new friends. Reflecting my life just motivates the ""loser"" persona I try to avoid. I miss intimate relations, I haven't had a relationship since High School.  I have great self control but these past 4 years have been the times I've thought about my mortality the most. I feel if my younger self found out this is how my life was gonna turn out.I think he kill himself in that instant. I definitely feel that the horizon was brighter yesterday. I only have myself to blame and I feel that I have created a bad timeline for myself where things don't work out.

216,"Hi! Sorry if this isn’t really the right sub, I usually just lurk but this situation has really gotten under my skin a bit lately. 

Within the past few months, I (20f) got out of a really shitty relationship with this person, they said a lot of really bad things about me and coerced me into things I wasn’t ready for. I was also pretty messed up from some dumb high school relationships that I’d love to be over by now but alas. 

So a few months later, I decided to download Tinder again. I know. My own fault. I knew I wasn’t ready for a relationship but honestly? I needed a little bit of an ego boost. Feel free to tear into me for that, I feel like all of this is my own fault anyway. 

I swipe around for a while, nothing really happening, but then I match with this girl I had seen around my college campus. She was cute and she sent me a few messages. I felt bad I didn’t reply, because for some reason having actually seen her cemented her a real person in my mind so I felt the need to reply and we started talking. She was very eager to meet, and I thought this would be good for me, putting myself out there, as I’ve been pretty damn isolated these past few years in school. 

I liked her, I didn’t really feel a huge spark, but I don’t exactly believe in love at first sight anyway, so I thought it might be something that comes with time. I’m very easily drained, having spent so much time alone in recent years, and she has a handful of her own issues I won’t get into, so we talked about taking it really slow and started having dinner together and watching movies once in a while. 

I really did think it was going fine, if not a little awkward, until today. We had dinner and went for a walk, and she told me she feels like she doesn’t even know me. We’d known each other for coming on two months at this point. I kinda froze up, because I thought we were on the same page and I didn’t exactly know what she wanted from me. I’m really trying my best here, but I guess I didn’t realize how damaged I was from my previous relationships. 

Then she told me if I were a man she would’ve ghosted me by now. Which. Stung. Because why even continue dating if the only reason we’re seeing each other is because I’m not a man?? I don’t exactly know how to verbalize how it made me feel but I think I want to cut things off with her. I feel like I’m overdramatizing this whole situation, but I really don’t know what to do.

217,"So not really distressed or anything, more slightly concerned/confused. I'm a 22 male standing at 5' 11- 6' and 187 pounds. I had gained a little weight over winter break while at home but have lost it now that I'm back at school and active again (I guess it was just water weight). Now I weigh 187 and after looking it up, that's overweight, but I don't feel overweight??? My stomach is a little pudgy but my chest sticks out further than my belly and my face doesn't look like it has much extra fat. I actually feel stronger than I've ever felt. I was really stuggling with my weight for a while last year due to ptsd and other mental issues and weighed 135lbs. Was only eating a can of soup or maybe some oatmeal and frozen veggies during the day. Looking back, I looked like a skeleton. 50lbs more and I have a lot more energy, a lot more muscle (and quite a bit more fat lol), I don't sleep 12 hours a day, and I feel strong. I guess I just don't see how I'm overweight.",04Feb2020,1

220,"I’m very confused about what’s going on in my parents’ romantic life. A few years back, I discovered that my dad had been texting an old high school crush because her husband had a disease (my dad’s a doctor). My dad never used the phone before this and now he texts her non-stop. My mom has voiced frustration and upset. Even going so far as to confront us, the three children, that dad doesn’t love her anymore and is in love with another woman. They’ve had conversations where supposedly they’ve worked it out, but we still see our father perpetually texting someone. Apparently, not sure how my sister knows this, but this woman would’ve left her husband. All the while even scarier for the prospect of my parents’ marriage. 

I’m very scared. For years, I believed my parents’ relationship was safe because he loved her more than she loved him. They’re planning a trip soon to the West Coast to visit my siblings and stop in Reno, but my dad wants to go a few days earlier before my mom joins him. And he’s very insistent that she join later. And then they’re switching hotels when my mom arrives. 

My mom is smart. She’s not completely oblivious to this stuff. But she’s still voicing it to us and I’m not sure how to handle it. I’m scared that my dad will do something that tears our family apart. I want to stop an affair happening before it does, but I also know it can be damaging to intervene in a marriage where I don’t know the full details: 

My mom’s position is that she doesn’t know what’s happening and she feels helpless to change my dad. I should mention her overworks, too, and rarely spends time at home. I think he’s a workaholic. Things haven’t been the same since they became empty-nesters. 

Please advise for help! I really am scared for both of them and don’t want my dad sleeping with another woman under my mom’s reluctance. 

It’s a lot of pressure on us, the kids. Especially because we all know how great of a mom we had growing up and still do. She’s the most selfless person I know. While it’s not appropriate to tell your kids all the intimate details and fears in your marriage, I’m genuinely unsure she feels she has other options. 

I love her. I love my dad, too. I’ve never been this scared of our family falling apart.

Any advice would be helpful and is greatly appreciated.",04Feb2020,1

222,"I'm in my late 20s and stopped talking to most of my family because they're controlling assholes. I recently connected with my Uncle, who is definitely controlling, but too old to be damaging.

My brother is convenience controlling. There has been a few times that my extended family needed to reach out to be for legal matters, and my brothers are the ones with my contact information. He neglects to let me in on things for weeks, decides things for me, then only tells me what I need to know, and leaves things out that sometimes make me look like kind of a big jerk.

Like not -Hey family, I just let sister know this so it might take her a minute to do it-

Like -Hey, everyone has done this, we're just waiting on sister who hasn't done this yet.-//ignores that he literally just told me//

Aka, I visited this Uncle who is handling some legal matters for the family. He told me about some papers we all have to sign. Two weeks later my brother who I talk to maybe once a year, suddenly has an interest in my New Year, and my vacation, and my job. Oh by the way, did you sign the papers yet? Tells me ""the family"" decided we're signing the papers by XX date. //Again, I talked to my Uncle directly so I know this is not true, and I think he decided this on his own, or lied to me to make me hustle.//

I told him I'm in the middle of a very busy time and I would do them as soon as I can. 2 workdays later ""How's work?""

I ignored the messages and sent my Uncle the papers, but I'm not sure if I should say something to my brother about it. Like ""Hey, you didn't have to remind me, I already had plans to do it."", but I'm not sure if saying something like that would get me pulled into the drama hump, or if I should just ignore his messages and carry on with my life.

224,"Tomorrow I take a flight back to my husband’s country (Argentina) after we both spent a whole month at mine. Every time I leave my country it becomes harder to do it. I miss my family and friends, the food, and particularly, my mother who is seventy years old. Being apart from my family is making me depressed. Also the fact that we have eight months of cold weather, I never thought it would mess with my mind as hard as it does. 

Back in Argentina things have been tough economically, the national landscape gives too little room to make plans. My husband has a stable job that has allowed us to make a yearly trip to visit my family, but he has already told me he doesn’t know if we will be able to do it again soon because of the rise of the dollar (that went from 20 pesos to 80 in the last three years). 

My income is very low and unstable, I work in a very difficult art field, and what I have been able to build for myself in Argentina, has given me some personal artistic satisfactions,  but little else. The cultural landscape in Argentina is very stimulating in other senses and that makes it hard for me to totally make up my mind, but the truth is I just can’t see myself living forever there. i have spoken to my husband about how I feel, he has suggested he would make the chance to try to live in my country, but he doesn’t make a concrete move to do it. We have been like this for the last three years. I feel like I can’t make long term plans in Argentina, and the feeling is slowly giving me a permanent state of anxiety. But of course the idea if going back after six years has its own set of fears. Please, give me some words of advice.",04Feb2020,1
225,"Weird title, sorry. I work nights in a hotel at the weekends and the story I'm about to tell isn't uncommon. 

A woman came into the hotel a little flustered and/or drunk. She asked the other receptionist for a key to her room. I said hello and asked if she was alright, had a good night, etc whilst my colleague dealt with her request. She said she was fine but once she got the key in her hand she literally ran to the lift. That's not unusual. Maybe she needed the toilet or it was because drunk people are silly sometimes. Slightly odd but nothing to worry about. 

Soon after a man and woman walked in. I ask if they have their key (they wouldn't get anywhere without one) and the woman says, ""I'm with her,"" motioning to the first woman who just went through. 

I apologise and inform them they can't all be going to the same room as the hotel has a really strict two adults only per room. The man says they have two rooms between them. Again, not unusual but I'm getting suspicious but as some drunk guy was kicking off in reception I thought I would follow it up on the cameras once I'd dealt with the more immediate situation. 

A few minutes later went back on the cameras, it went like this:

The first woman ran to the lift and frantically pressed the call button. The lift arrived and she jumped in. The second woman was now running, just a head of the man and pressed the button for the lift. The doors opened immediately as it hadn't been long enough for the first woman to go anywhere. Just as the door was closing, the guy shoved his foot in and forced his way in. 

Ok, this isn't right. I ran up there to find the guy pacing up and down the corridor on his phone. I ask him where his room is. He tried to dismiss me and told me to go back downstairs. I persisted and he eventually showed me where his room supposedly was. He knocks and the second woman comes to the door. He tried to force his way in as the woman asked what the hell he was doing. I got in his way (which I'm really not supposed to) told him he obviously wasn't a guest and wasn't welcome. The woman thanked me and I escorted him out of the hotel as he told his friend on the phone to not bother coming to the hotel.

This kind of thing happens a couple of times a month. Some guy probably buys a woman a drink and thinks he's entitled to sex. Follows her back to the hotel and  she can't shake him. I get that she/they might be scared of saying anything directly to the guy but I feel that if she'd told us as soon as she arrived back at the hotel it could have gone a lot better. I also worry about how many times we don't catch stuff like this. So is there anything that I can do to make women feel safe enough to come to me or my colleagues for help in such a situation?",04Feb2020,1

Alright well, to the main point.... so I grew up in the same house which I like, there is nothing wrong with it, no issues or anything major. Time goes on and I get my first phone which I bought with my own money for I think around $80. I had a computer before then but also nothing too special. I was in 5th grade at the time (so 9 or 10 maybe) and of course that’s when we all go through that discovery phase. I discovered porn and all the other such around 6th grade and when my parents found out, they started to put stuff on my computer to block that stuff. I didn’t think much of it since I didn’t really understand it and I was 10, so looking back at it, it was fair. Fast foreword to today, I’m 16 and a sophomore in high school with a full license and all. I still have all those restrictions on all my devices. 90% of all websites that I’ve tried to access (twitter, twitch, Imgur, multiple gaming sites, planet Minecraft is even blocked) are all blocked. They are able to see who I text and what I typed just like they took my phone and were looking at my texts. All my devices have strict time restrictions too, and they always are closely monitoring me. I will admit, yes, there have been some stuff I should not have been looking at once or twice along the road In the past couple years. But nothing like drugs, or weapons, or violence of any kind. Just porn, and I’m pretty sure as a teenager that’s normal to look at right? Or am I insane? Every time I try to tell them about it they bring up chat sites that I tried to access, I try to explain some ads that exist and take us to some cam or r rated dating/chat site. Every time I try to talk they always bring them up and tell me that they just want to protect me. I understand they want to protect me, but i think it’s abit far.

231,"I’ve just turned 24 and I’m having a hard time gaining perspective on my life. Since I was a kid I’ve enjoyed crafting and building stuff with my hands. I was building fully functional crossbows at 10 and I built forts all through my childhood where we would have intense airsoft wars. I always knew that I had a natural skill when using my hands. I’ve been the go to person for my family when something needs fixing and even my dad and my grandpa ask for my help doing the hard parts of projects. I’ve struggled in school all my life since I don’t learn that way and I prefer to research myself which I do all day long. I love to learn and I can’t get enough. Here’s my dilemma: I’m a woodworker working my way to the top and I’m struggling with joy draining envy. I know tons of information and I work really hard. All of my bosses have told me that my work ethic is incredible... and I know I should be happy with that but I’m not. All my peers have Instagram worthy lives and I don’t. Most days I come home lay down and read devoid of energy. I don’t have any friends going the trades route and they all seem to be going on trips and working in coffee shops. They are doing well in school and I didn’t.  I suppose it wouldn’t be so bad but I’ve felt out of place in the trades since I started. Not because of the work but because of my personality. I like to study and talk about important topics. I’m really introverted and quiet and friendly. I can take a ton of insults and put downs I’m not weak but I don’t like to dish it out. I like to mind my own business and put my head down to work hard. Unfortunately, all of my employers have been the classic hard nosed blue collar types and they seem to hate me. No matter how much I try to mind my own business I get attacked verbally and insulted and mocked all day long. I don’t back down but they don’t stop. I don’t know if it’s a me problem or if this is common in the adult world. I’m just trying to be responsible and not a burden to my family. We don’t have much money and I’m supporting myself through hard work but I feel like I’m getting worn down more and more. I don’t like to talk about the things the guys at work do and I’m a total outcast. I try to modify myself to accommodate them but I find that most of them think different= wrong. Anyways I could just use some perspective since I’m kind of hurting right now. It seems like all my friends are having the time of their lives and I’m just getting abused and beat down at every turn. I’m just trying to live right and hold my own. What would you do? I’m thinking of studying coding on my spare time to eventually switch careers because I feel like I’d fit in there. But it just seems wrong to me that I should have to change careers just because I’m different. I think it makes it that much harder that all my peers are much older than me. Since not many of my generation have gone down this path I’m surrounded by people in their 40s that I can’t relate with and that bully me all the time. I can’t imagine being I’m my 40s and attacking some young kid and outing him down but it’s all I’ve experienced since I’ve started. Anyways I didn’t mean to turn this into a vent but yeah it’s been a tough time for me. I really don’t know what I should do with myself at this point and I could use some perspective from someone with more life experience. Thank you so much for your time!",04Feb2020,1

234,"Hey all. So, I've been very distant with my mother for the past 4yrs or so. I used to live with her and care for her (she has multiple mental illnesses and disabilities, and my father passed when I was 8, so for like 15 years it was just me and her), but after she suffered one of many in a history of psychotic breaks I couldn't keep it up any longer and had to withdraw for my own well-being. I moved away with my partner and after her hospitalization she moved into assisted living. Since then, I was only able to bear to see her in person once, shortly after we ""broke up"" to give her some of her things. I cry, and sometimes go into a full blown spiralling panic attack, when I hear her voice on the phone, so now we only communicate through letters in the mail.

The letters are mostly fluff (movies we've watched lately, changes at my job, how she dislikes the other residents, memories of ""the good old times"") and I try to tiptoe around anything that could potentially upset her. Our relationship is complicated, but she still loves me and doesn't see the codependent, icky nature of our old ways and wishes we were back together. I still love *her* but I'm working through a lot of stuff in therapy and learning how unhealthy we used to be, and appreciating and recovering with the distance.

My partner and I have been together for six years now, and have decided to get married sometime in the coming year. We don't want to do anything fancy, just a courthouse wedding and a small party with friends in the months after. But I know it'll break my mother's heart if she's not involved in some way shape or form.

 If I just write her a letter that says ""oh, btw we got married"" and enclose some pictures, I don't feel like that will be enough. But I don't *want* to have her physically present, because I know she'll be all I can focus on, and I won't be able to enjoy myself.

238,"So basically from my freshman year of high school I have been in a variety of relationships. I got into what I thought was a pretty serious one that lasted about a year and lost my virginity to the guy in the middle of my sophomore year. We broke up on good terms and I went away traveling for a few months and of course... met a new guy. I got into a relationship with him but part of why we got together was because there were very few guys/girls on our travels. After the trip We were obsessed with each other but we agreed not to do long distance because he lives far across the country from me. I was obviously really into him but being so far from each other with no plans to see each other next, I started to seek out other guys to distract me. I got with a diff guy and we started being a thing while I continued to talk with the other guy over the phone every day. The diff guy caught feelings for me but I was too into the other guy so I turned him down but didn’t stop seeing him. I finally got to see the other guy again and fell in love with him over the course of the week we had together. The relationship we had been building over the phone becoming an in person thing felt so surreal and amazing I couldn’t think about anything else. I stopped seeing that diff guy and talked to the other guy on the phone even more than before. He came to visit me and it was amazing but when he was leaving we agreed that we needed to talk less so we could move on. We did not talk less at all but I started talking to other guys again. I got with that diff guy a few more times and then told the other guy and he told me he hadn’t been gw anyone else Bc he was too into me. I just planned a trip to go visit him soon but I’m starting to feel like I need to just let what we have go because there is no chance for us to keep visiting each other and doing this fake long distance thing where I get with other people and he doesn’t and we talk every day but don’t talk about how stupid this relationship is. Part of me wants to end what we have temporarily Bc I want a normal relationship with someone that I can see often but I know that shouldn’t be the reason why I end it and that I should try to be single for a little.

239,"Good evening plumbing geniuses!

My wife and I are considering a gas tankless replacement for our old (almost 20yr) 40gal tank. Fortunately it's still working so we don't have an emergency - but we've just added another family to our house for a temporary time and I'm worried that may be just enough to spell the end for that old tank.

Our house is 40 years old in Colorado - a single level ranch with a basement. The current tank heater is in the basement. I realize this is like shooting darts in the dark but I was hoping someone could suggest whether we're getting rip-off quotes or something in the right ballpark. I'm seeing around $4,500 for a fully retrofitted and installed Noritz 199k btu with 20yr warranty... sounds like a nice one but I have no idea.

244,"God, this is a clusterfuck. Sorry for formatting and spelling mistakes, I am shocked, confused, and on mobile.

For context, him and I have been together for two years and have had a rocky, but very loving relationship. 

On Friday morning, my (ex) boyfriend and I had a stupid fight over me accidentally breaking his jar containing weed. However, he overreacted, and told me to leave his place, go home and never to contact him again.

I was hurt and disappointed in him and his choice to make me leave his home because of a stupid jar. So I called my best friend (19F) and we agreed to go out that night to drink and have fun. At this point, my bf was texting me how he's terribly sorry. Instead of just accepting the apology, I had to go the hard way and be mad at him still, so friend and I went out anyway. 

After _a lot_ of alcohol, two good looking guys approached us and offered to pay us drinks, the regular scheme. We fell for it, danced with them, had our fun. At that point I was too drunk to even remember I had a loving boyfriend at home, so when the two hunks called us over, it took us approximately 0 seconds to hop into the Uber and go to their place.

I will skip the NSFW part, but it is relevant for the story that, at some point, I was in a threesome with both of them.

So, Saturday morning, I wake up, go home, study a bit, then go to my BF's for our usual evening chilling out. As I was up late, I virtually fell asleep the second I came in contact with his bed.

He woke me up in tears, scream whispering, ""How could you have done that to me?"" ""I know what happened last night"", and prompting me to get up and get dressed so we could go out to talk.

The talk, of course, didn't really work. We did stay in contact throughout Sunday, talking through our feelings and what to do next (I know), so we agreed to meet up Monday evening to talk through everything and see if there is, if any, a solution to the shitty situation I put us in.

That talk also didn't work, we left home after three hours of crying and screaming at each other. 

So my pissed off BF starts texting me saying he would share the story with everyone, that my parents will be aware, and other non violent threats I percieved as a way to a) scare me and b) deal with his pain.

Apparently, no. He texted me about half an hour ago saying I should take my mom's phone and delete the message he sent her, saying he regrets it and doesn't want it to be that way. The only problem is, it's 5 AM and the phone is on the charger next to the bed. Also, she changed her passcode recently, so there was virtually no access to the phone.

At this point I am already gone inside my head - after three days of pain, shame and sadness because I did what I did, my MOTHER is going to find out what happened.

I bit the shit and knocked on her door, as I heard she was awake, and told her there was a message on her phone that I wouldn't like her to see. Of course, she read it. Class mother move. She told me we would talk about it in the morning.

How do I deal with this situation?


And I have to ask not to be crucified for the cheating. My life has been a living hell for the past three days as my regret and sorrow and every bad feeling mixed together have been exponentially growing inside of me and eating me alive.

245,"Hey, quick bio about me. I am Nick, I am 15, HS Sophomore, I am 5'4"" 115lbs, I play CB, SS, WR, and RB on my flag football team. I want to go to my public high school to play football, as my life goal is okay college football, whether Division III, II, or (hopefully) D1. My dad says high school is full of sex and drugs, but I talked to some of my old friends, and they say it really isn't. Some context, I was in public school up until 7th grade, then homeschooled, but I don't really like homeschooling.

246,"So the other day I was in the city, small town girl here, and I was staying the night at my friend/stepsisters place. We are talking bullshiting and talking about hot guys. Now at one point she showed me a vid of her good looking boss playing a party game. Now this was like right as I arrived and I had smoked a joint maybe an hour before probably less. I was decently high. Now shes drinking we are just talking about hot guys and this man that I dont know what's into the house. I don't know who he is or why he's there but for some reason when I ask she says it's her bf and of course me with my loud mouth and broken filtered head say ""I thought you were fucking your boss???"" And I'm so confused because she did not say that at any point, I had said I'd probably do it if I could. She had said nothing of the sort and for some reason I just put that thought together in my head. I keep apologizing and stuff but I have basically ruined the 2 or 3 year relationship. She called my mum that night and told her who intern called me. Now I don't think it hit her until next day what had happened cause yea it was bad. My mother and her laughed it off at the time and I'm just like. 'I am the shittiest cuntwaffle in the world omg. How the fuck do I fix this cause I just broke these two up.' And I feel horrendously bad about it but I have no idea what to do. My mother wants me to take boundary courses because i had seemingly demanded to know what the deal with the bf was and that is understandable cause I pry to much.

But honestly, all I want to know is. What the hell else do i do here, i mean i feel awful and I've apologized over and over again, i eve said I'd leave that night only to be told it was okay to stay. I don't know and I need help. Can someone please give me some answers here?",04Feb2020,1

She and her step dad tracked the IP address of the user who changed her log in information.  It doesnt show who it belongs to but it does show the geographic location to be his neighborhood.

248,"Obviously everyone values certain relationships differently, and for me relationships are of high priority since I have so little. But lately it feels hardest to maintain my friendships most of all. I have 3 best friends that are basically siblings; we have literally been together since toddlers. And of course I get that things change when adulthood and other events happen to change our lives however I feel that it shouldn't affect our bonds or the way we act with each other. I feel that maybe negarse if anxiety that maybe I am overreacting and childishly jealous with the way I am thinking and if that is the case, please someone feel free to explain this to me with these next few examples..

With one friend, asking to get together is like pulling teeth, requesting to make plans months in advance for a single day but will still refuse to compromise if things are planned this way and the desired event is a week too close to an already scheduled event. Or constantly bringing up plans with other groups of people that they would know I would enjoy too where plans with myself haven't been made together in over 3 years unless I suggest them (which leads back to the issue of refusing the plans.) 

Another friend makes it seem like a chore to get together with me, where they are never in the mood to visit me when we want to make plans, I either have to go to them instead or always meet at a halfway point, where when we were younger, they stayed over all the time. Or cancelling plans simply because they don't feel like doing them anymore. (In theory this wouldn't be so bad if plans weren't being cancelled an hour before meeting time.) And then they are later on social media doing a different outing on the same day..

And the last friend I'm unsure of if maybe they try to please the people in their life too much. This is because our relationship consists of making detailed plans way in advance that somehow always end up cancelled because their friends that are closer nearby plan something the same day and my friend can seem to never say no to them.

Since we were Young I have always told my friends everything about me, including my past traumas, where they are always too hesitant to do the same until it's too late and they have been affected beyond help. 

Am I pushing too hard for a relationship to continue with them? I feel like I am forcing the friendship constantly and that they don't want to be as close as I would like them all to be. I keep worrying about if I'm going to lose my friends by pressuring them, but I also feel that stepping back will make a bigger distance between us all..",04Feb2020,1

253,"So quick summary and then long summary.

Quick; this girl knocks my socks off but she has super high expectations for me(which I find ok w until now) but supports trump in some ways. She’s not a blind follower but her family is really republican and makes a fuck ton of money(not over $10 million). I feel like her high stands for me are in direct conflict w this horrible human of a president. 

Long story; we met on hinge. We knocked it out of the park from the second we started talking to the point we decided we should get coffee that day. I saw her in person and she just blew me away. She was educated, she had class, she dressed amazing, on and on. I’m super communicative, which she demands, and started going on about my past. I was in a 10 year relationship and was married for two. The relationship was done before we were married but we were an amazing team and just tried to be adults and work on it- but there was no more sexual attraction. I cowardly ended the marriage by getting super drunk one night and going on tinder and had explicit conversations. She found out by going through my phone that night and posting all of it on MY social media. Disaster of a story for another day. I tell this girl I’m on a date w about all of this. She seems ok and we talk for 5 hours. Next day she texts me and says she just can’t be w someone who did something like that bc of her pas experiences. I plead my case (which I never ever do) but let it go. I friend her on fb bc of reasons I don’t really know but it goes quiet for 3 months bc we are both in relationships. 

We end up breaking up w our relationships and join hinge the same exact day and match independently that day. We take it slow. We go on walks, we get coffee again but it’s clear we are connected. This woman blows my mind. She’s incredible in every way. If I ever thought I was in love it pales in comparison to what this is. We have so much in common. We love doing all these amazing activities like hiking and canoeing and being active and trying new food on and on and on(she’s also a bit damaged but who isn’t).

She doesn’t follow politics but her dad is a trumpeter. Nice man from what I can tell so far but he’s itching to talk to me about it and I can tell. She doesn’t follow politics but has so much respect for her father/parents she says how can trump be that bad if her parents like him? This destroys me. She has such high expectations for me, which I’m happy to follow, but the scum of the universe gets a pass? She loves animals and thick’s Michael Vick should be put to death and cannot be rehabilitated. I’m from philly and watched this person change their life. How can someone be so hell bent on some things but allow other atrocities like trump has done? Is this doomed?",04Feb2020,1

We both wanted to just go to community college but instead he’s forcing us to go to 4 year universities that don’t even have the programs we want.) And those things are just on the mild side. We’ve been chased around the house while he tries to poke us after we asked him to stop. My mental state is deteriorating.

But she’s hitting a depressive episode lately and I understand sometimes it’s tiring just to keep hearing the same things over again. The “ you got this! You’re strong”. I feel like sometimes she wants someone to be able to just talk serious with about her worries and fears without having to constantly look like the woman who’s trying so hard even when she’s terrified. Sh has been very positive at first but she’s on her 5th round of chemo and I want to be able to talk to her in a more meaningful way rather than just reiterating the same “well wishes” she constantly gets over and over. 

I also feel really wrong to try to sympathize with her because while I understand depression to a serious degree I could never attempt to even say I understand what she’s going through as I have never had cancer and I know she is very scared about her future.

257,"My partner’s friend, let’s say Mike(47) went through a break up with his wife of 20 years after she cheated on him. Mike and his ex-wife have a child age 13.

Mike’s wife has moved out of the house but Mike has not handled it well. Beyond alcohol binges, he has been regularly texting my partner for emotional support. However, it’s now been several weeks of Mike texting “I am going to kill myself” at 8:30pm

Crying for help and being in a weak place is normal. Suicidal thoughts happen, and sharing them is natural. But this isn’t one or two or three nights he actively calls with a gun in his lap - it’s constantly for weeks.

So now what? My partner isn’t going to brush him off, but we’ve offered to take him to the ER, he’s starting counseling, reminded him he’s loved and has reasons to live....

But Mike’s putting a heavy weight on someone else. This isn’t being there for a friend, these are threats if he isn’t getting enough validation for the day. It borders on manipulation since as soon as we offer solutions (meeting up, therapy, seeing new people) he simmers down.

After seeing him post constant things about having sex with other people, and him completely discarding my feelings and not listening. I blocked him on everything again and took him out of my life. I then proceeded to text him a couple months later and ask him where we stood. He took back all the things he about him “trying to become better for me” he just took back all the sweet things he said to me that made me want to stay.  I feel less than for giving him a second chance he didn’t want to take, and pretended he wanted too. It just hurts, bc I don’t want him to think that i’m wrapped around his finger, bc i’m not. I realized how much he manipulated when we were together, and just overall how badly he treated me. I want to just call him and yell at him so he hears my side, but I know I shouldn’t bc it would just end bad.

260,"I used to baby sit a girl many moons ago when she was only months old. Me and her mom had a thing and it was over. But with social media and such the girl tracked me down as I guess her mom always talked about how supportive I was of her being a young mom and how I helper her raise her kids even after we separated. 

Well her daughter now 16 tracked me down on social media when she was 14. We talked for a few days then stopped few months later we talked then stopped. Seemed like I was always daughters outlet / support person. She talked to me about how school was going, how relationships where going, when she was made at her mom and what she was mad about, her self harming, how she started drinking at 15 because the stress her mom was causing her. 

Well she turned 16 and got a job well her mom stoped taking her to work because she refused to help her mom pay bills and buy groceries so I bought her a car. Nothing spectacular just a cheap BMW for $1,000 of Craig’s list that had been wrecked but aside from body damage was fine. 

That car broke down and I got her a civic. She carried a 4.0 GPA and started college classes at 17 so I got her a Apple Watch for her birthday. Her mom reached out and we started talking and her mom started hinting around about needing money and I shut it down. 

Now she is about to turn 18 and is a junior in college for psychology and graduated high school last year. Her mom once again started talking to me and hinting about money problems. Her mom has issues with meth. So I shut it down and refused to giver her money. 

Her mom freaked out because I am helping her daughter through college so she don’t have to get student loans at my expense trust me a psychology major is not cheap. 

Well her mom texted me tonight and said if I did not stop talking to her daughter or help her pay her bills she was going to call the cops and report me for grooming her daughter who is attending school over 1,000 miles away from me. 

I told daughter about it and that I was going to break communications till she was 18 as this is not a situation I want to deal with. She called got mad at her mom. They had a argument but allegedly mom is not going to follow through she was just mad. 

Should I keep talking to daughter and helping her through college or should I heed my warning and stop the financial support and stop talking to her till she turns 18 in a few months. I feel I can tell mom to fuck off as she of consent is 16 in my state and 17 in daughter so even if we were which we are not nothing could legally be done. Or should I make daughter pull a student loan and start talking again once she reaches 18 ? 

I feel mom is putting us in shitty situation to try to make financial gains for herself. This has all been communicated by mom through text as I refuse to answer her phone calls and daughter says she told mom we were done talking and as long as Kim don’t know then know harm no foul.

I questioned everything, ""Why do I even need a girlfriend?"", ""What's the point?"", basically all the bullshit most would people would post breakup.

I told myself that this ""hiatus"" would be good for me to actually work on myself and it did.

279,"Hey guys, sorry In advance if my formatting is off. This is my first post so bear with me. 

So back in October we decided to let our rabbit free roam the backyard with the chickens and our goat, we had put a gate up and made sure they were all enclosed and safe and what not. Flash forward to 3 days ago, our goat (who is very quiet and timid from previous owners neglecting her) is CRYING. Very loud.  Which is unusual for her so we start paying extra attention to her and checking to see if she’s hurt and what not. She was crying so loud my dad and I were convinced someone was sneaking into our backyard and terrorizing her cause we couldn’t find any other explanation for her behaving this way out of no where. She’s been asking to come out of the enclosure and come inside but haven’t let her. We came to the conclusion it’s been our rabbit messing with her, chasing her, etc but figure it’s harmless and she’s just being a drama queen. 

As of an hour ago, I hear her SCREAM so I go outside and decide she needs to come inside cause this isn’t normal. She’s hanging out inside playing or whatever and her utter sack is TORN open, by our rabbit. She has blood all down her hind legs and she’s shaking. We tried our best to clean it, but she’s very timid to touch as is so this happening made her even more timid. I set her up in our guest room with a blanket, water, and snacks. The wound isn’t actively bleeding but it’s definitely bad if untreated. 

So my question is, what would cause a rabbit, that is VERY friendly and well adapted to the animals it lives with (it grew up with this goat kind you and chickens) to start solely attacking only our goat this viciously? Keep in mind, he isn’t attacking any other animals. 

I read online it can be a territorial/dominance thing but for one,’our goat is female and why would he only be territorial towards her? Any help would be appreciated! We’re calling the vets tomorrow to see who can help our babygirl but was just looking for some outside opinions!

Thanks in advance",04Feb2020,1
280,"Hello everyone! My parents own a small little restaurant; my siblings and I take turns working there, so my parents don’t have the need to hire people outside of our family. To make a long story short, every year we’d have a different health inspector make their normal visit to make sure our restaurant is up to par, but one particular health inspector visited our restaurant and a few days after she visited, a group of strange women performed a heist to steal my mother’s jewelry and cash. What was extremely odd is that these women knew exactly where my mother hid her belongings. I sincerely believe that this health inspector was the one that implemented this plan. Right now, I don’t have proof, because we never had the need to install cameras. My question is, how can I request a new health inspector?

283,"So my ex of one year ended things with me 5 weeks ago. She broke up with me about 5 times and always came back. This one is real, it’s devastating. However 3 weeks post break up she texted me say “Hey, I’ve been thinking about you. How are you?” I didn’t text her till 2 in the morning. 

Two weeks post break up she texted me saying I should talk to her cousin(Casually). And I called her that night we fought. We cried. We told each other that we love each other and we fell asleep on the phone. The next couple of days were I love you. But nobody initiated any thing to say we were getting back together but I kinda just stopped texting her. 

Last week kinda texted back and forth for a bit i stopped responding. Then she randomly texted me a question about a PlayStation account, which could have been googled and then asked me if I had the Disney subscription. 

This last weekend I find out that she is meeting someone already and she told me she loves me but has been out of love with me for a long time now. It was emotionally wrecking. I love her but I’m just so confused I was just hoping she would come back whenever she was ready. 

I want her back, but I don’t know if I should move on now. This just happened so fast. The guy looks nothing like me.",04Feb2020,1
284,"So I went recently to Vegas. It was my first time with my bf and my bfs cousin (who brought his gf along for the trip too). Let’s just say that all of us are pretty much around the ages of 21-24 and pretty much I only got to go to Vegas was because my bf offered to go since it was his cousins birthday. Anyways, my bf and I arrived around 7PM but we didn’t eat anything since breakfast (8AM) when we left for Vegas. And his cousin had reservations around 11PM for dinner. So you can already guess some of us are hangry. Of course his cousin and gf arrived a day before to Vegas before us but nevertheless they were having their own thing till we arrived. When we finally got to meet them my first impression was wow they’re a nice couple! Since they arrived from somewhere else, they went to go change and get ready in their hotel room since my bf and I were dressed and ready to go. We agreed to meet them back at their room to regroup, and when we got there i stood a good few steps away from the door since I had a feeling that maybe I might see something that I shouldn’t. So I waited and his cousin answers “oh shoot wait a second guys I don’t have a shirt on” and I just look at my bf but my bf kind just laughs it off since that’s his cousin. Anyways we head out afterwards and they start bar hopping but clearly I don’t want to drink because I’m on an empty stomach plus I want to run around sober not drunk for my first time in Vegas! And his cousin kept asking me (four times tbh) to have a drink and I kept insisting that I don’t want one. And he responded by saying you don’t seem to like to let loose and have fun huh? I ignore his comment and just brush that off because I’m trying to handle my attitude for my bf... we finally get to eat and more people join but no one wanted to interact or at least talk to me. And my bf told his cousin I’m just hungry that’s why I don’t want to talk to his cousin and other people. Anyways I just kept trying to talk to anyone at that dinner party but guess I wasn’t interesting enough. And I could tell the cousins gf was giving me these side eye watches probably pitying me or just wondering why I am not talking. Anyways I ended up going back to my room around 1 AM while everyone else had fun gambling. The next day I got up early to do my makeup and have breakfast with gym bf but him and his cousin and his cousins gf didn’t wake up early so I waited till 12PM for them to get up. Once we all headed out we ate and then they started bar hopping again. The funny thing is the cousin and his gf told me that they don’t party or bar hop a lot in my face (like as if I cared what you do) but then an hour later his gf shows all the pictures of the bars they went to and parties lol. I just smiled saying she must have had the time of her life and then her bf suggested to drink again. I declined again because I wanted to try a drink that my sister had recommended. So my bfs cousin asked my bf whether he’d like to drink but my bf said he’ll drink when I want to but I told him not yet so his cousin looks at me like “look what you’ve done” and just has this disapproved face. I keep ignoring but later on his cousin bought his gf a ring and he kept asking to look at the ring he bought his gf and kept telling me how sweet t was for his gf to pay for dinner last night. So I just nodded saying yes that’s very sweet and yes that’s a beautiful ring but he kept going on and on about it so I just stayed quiet after 😂 I only repeat myself once. Later on it gets dark after all the traveling and his cousin wants to smoke weed with my bf and his gf. Since I didn’t want to I excused myself to my room But then my bf’s cousin calls me out saying “you really aren’t fun you need to get on the level of my gf” and “she’s more fun” and so I just nod saying yeah you’re right because I don’t want to disrespect my bf... but I just couldn’t tolerate his shitty behavior at all. And the very last night his cousin proceeded to berate me about saying how “you’re only fun when buzzed, oh shoot I should stop but yeah you need to be more open and relaxed get more buzzed honestly” and his gf is telling him to stop but he goes on for a good minute... like wth what’s your problem? Don’t compare me to your gf! Tbh his gf cheated on him and he proceeded to cheat on her multiple times. So why the hell you’re asking me to get on your” gf’s level”",04Feb2020,1

The thing is with me is that I don’t feel much emotion it’s just not me but when I meet this girl I felt something I’ve never felt. I loved this girl so much it was unbelievable. I would die for this girl even now that she rejected me. But when she rejected it was awkward  for a few days. But it was okay I mean I still felt little sad but it really don’t effect me that much. So after a year she just didn’t talk to me anymore. She put up a TBH and I asked. She said I was an asshole and but I was cool too. This didn’t hurt me but I was like damn okay. But after that I just felt bad because I had a chance with her but I screwed it up by being rude. Back then I was just toxic and I didn’t know it. So we are in the present and I still think about her and have the same feelings. The only thing is that I can’t stop thinking about her because she is always in the halls where I walk so I just get flashbacks of these bad moments. I don’t feel any emotions but this is only thing I feel and it’s just getting ridiculous at this point. I loved her enough to let her go and not do make her feel bad. What do I do to stop these feelings it’s been years it should’ve only been a week of this.

292,"Last weekend I went out with friends and drank a bit. We normally function on a buddy system, so my friend J and I were together. Eventually he indicated that he was tired, so I brought him to some other friends and decided to go off. He didnt want me to - but I promised I would be fine
I went two floors down in the club and danced. It was so crowded but there was this beauty in existing with so many people. Then I felt somebody wrap an arm around my hips. They pulled me back tight and put a hand down my underwear. I dont know how long it was. I wanted to leave but it was too crowded, and it was too loud for anyone to hear me. It was fucking terrible. I feel terrible.

 Once I caught up with friends I asked to leave. I can't tell J about it because I'm afraid he'll blame himself, but he knows something happened. Its a few days later now and I feel like a big fucking baby. I should just get over it, but I don't know how. People go through worse and they're fine. Plus, the friends I did tell keep telling me that this is normal and not my fault - but damnit if I hadn't left. If I had worn a belt or at least looked to see who it was. I want it to be my fault because that gives me power to stop it from happening again. I don't want that to happen again. I don't want to think about it anymore. I want to forget it. 

I'm sorry. Anyway, has anyone else dealt with this? Am I being a baby? How do I get over it? I have class tomorrow and I dont even want to leave my dorm. I want to stop crying over something I can't do anything about.",04Feb2020,1
293,"I've always been a lurker and never really much of a poster so forgive me if this all is kinda convoluted and written like garbage. Also I know this post is like PAINFULLY long but I just really needed a good venting.

Also, thank you in advance for whoever gives this a read.

So, I guess some background first. My name's Claire, I'm 21 years old and lately kinda a disaster. The last 3 years of my life I feel have been really hard on me. For example, 3 years ago I had to deal with my twin sister stealing my car to go see her abusive boyfriend who she also abused, run off in the middle of the night to go do drugs with random guys she met on tinder in random hotel rooms, threaten suicide multiple times because she couldn't be with said boyfriend, then get in a car accident and not care about how worried my little brother (9 yo) and I are about her and instead use it as an excuse to get back with the same guy. I was always the more well rounded and I guess rational of the two of us so my entire family believed it was my responsibility to take care of her and make sure she didn't get into any trouble, and if she did, I had to deal with it. So yeah, pretty cool. Then for the next 2 years I started a new job while trying to go back to school, met a guy and thought things where going great. Well, the job consumed my life and I dropped out of school in order to make more money to get out of my toxic household and move in with the guy I was dating. Not only that, but I was stupid and he turned out to be a super deadbeat druggy alcoholic who I practically devoted my life to for the next 2 years which caused me to lose all my friends due to me only ever hanging out with him and spending all my money on him because I wanted to take care of him. Then, a month before we where scheduled to move in with each other he cheated on me with a girl he worked with and we of course broke up. At this Point my job was still my life and because I wanted the distraction and a promotion I started working 50 hour weeks. Unfortunately, I never got the promotion and moved stores where everyone was a piece of shit to say the least. I was recently single and dating, and a guy I worked with had a crush on me and would not stop insisting on us dating. I told him multiple times no. He couldn't take that and, because he was friends with everyone, began spreading unnecessary drama. I became some undesirable and it felt like everyone hated me. Coworkers began finding every and any reason to report me to the one other manager that I worked with and basically treated everything I did as wrong. Obviously after awhile I had had enough and put in my two weeks. I was terrified to get another job and was so burnt out from my previous one so I decided to stay unemployed for a while (It's not that big of a deal since I live with my parents still). Since then I went back to school for a bit, met my amazing and wonderful boyfriend, and have been job hunting. So all should be good right? that would be cool! As of lately, I've been avoiding being at home every chance I get (my main motive for finding a new job). My parents as of late seem to find every little reason to get upset with me and make a backhanded comment about how much of a failure I am. I've never been one to really get worked up about things, but lately every little thing seems to set me off, especially if its something said by my parents. For context, I'm a very very clean person, I don't make a mess but when I do I make sure to clean it up. I clean my room every 2 to 3 days and if I do make any mess I keep it in my room where no one else has to deal with it. I tend to stay out of the way, for obvious reasons, but my parents act like i wreck and steal everything in the house. And heaven forbid I do any sort of cleaning or help around the house, I'm bound to do something wrong according to them, and if I just don't bother doing it at all, I'll just get an earful about how useless I am. I tend to spend most of my time with my boyfriend and his family who is so kind and loving and accepts me with open arms. However when I can't do that, I just stay in my room all day trying my best to just forget I'm at home.

Lately, I've noticed just how lifeless and consistently emotional I've become, whether that be painfully sad or extremely irritable. Not only that, but I've also noticed how incredibly selective my memories have become, like it feels like I've been repressing things without realizing it and at random one will just pop up. For example, the other night my boyfriend was dropping me off at my house and he mentioned how my sister told him I had a cat when I was younger. I had completely forgotten but in that moment it had all came back to me. When I was about 11 or 12 years old, I used my birthday money to buy ""my own"" cat with my mother. Obviously I was very young and didn't have the knowledge or the resources to really take care of any animal on my own, let alone a cat. we ended up taking home 2 cats, one my mom picked out and the other I did. My parents later discovered my little brother had asthma (turned out it flared up due to the rabbits we owned, not even the cats) and in response, instead of re homing them, my mom decided to throw them outside. After being outside for a week, my cat broke a tooth which turned into a horrible tooth infection. Her condition was horrible and she looked practically dead, thinking of the pain that cat was going through makes me feel sick. Her infection then made its way to her brain and caused neurological issues on top of everything else, and instead of taking her to the vet or at the very least put to sleep, my parents left her outside. When I would ask them to let her in or at least help her they told me it was ""my responsibility"" and that shes ""my cat"" so if I wanted to get her help I would have to pay for it and take her myself, even though I was no older than 12. She then disappeared one day and about a month later animal services found her half dead and put her to sleep with permission from my mom, I suppose they just thought she ran away. The other cat actually stayed around till I was in high school, however she was then hit by a car and I had to help my dad scrape her off the side of the road. After remembering all of this I started crying and when I finally went inside I started crying even more. That whole experience was something that I guess I really pushed deep down and it made me really scared about what else there is that i just can't remember.

I know this whole post is mainly just shitty stories but I feel like they need to be a part of this post to kinda get my thoughts across. Lately I'm just really confused about my life and what I've been feeling. I never thought I had things bad, I wasn't ever physically abused but is there a chance I was mentally? When I got a pixie cut and my mom called me a boy for months on end was that just all fun and games or is it bad because of how much it hurt me? I know there are people out there that have it much worse than me, but does that make my pain any less valid? On top of all of this, I've always been a relatively level headed person, I've always credited myself for being strong and able to carry myself and be independent, however lately I feel like I cant even stand on my own two feet anymore. I feel like I cant amount to anything and I wont amount to anything and that's just not who I am. I feel like I need help but I don't have any right to because no matter what I can't have something wrong with me and why would I waste that help on myself when it could be used for someone else. The other night I had what felt like a panic attack wake me up from being dead asleep and I know that's not normal but I feel like I'm convincing myself that it is. I know I'm struggling really bad and I feel like the people who love me can see it too, but I don't feel like I'm allowed to do anything about it. Even then I wouldn't even really know where to start. I think I need help, but I don't deserve to get it. And frankly, I'm scared. I've never felt this way before and I'm terrified on where it may take me.

If you read the whole thing, thank you for hearing me out.

296,"Recently, signed a renewal for 8 months with someone I found through my school's Facebook page. We have been getting along great and she seems like an overall cool person. Tonight, I received an alarming message from her old roommate stating that my new roommate would steal from her, would sleep in her bed while she was on vacation, and use her things without asking. She also stated that she was her 9th roommate in the past couple of years and that she had to get video surveillance set up.

This sent chills through me because a lot of things are lining up with what my roommate jokes about. The first thing she would joke about is that she hopes this won't be another short term living situation. She also mentioned a story about having a kleptomaniac friend that she promised she wouldn't invite over. I've also noticed bank notices of her reporting fraud on her cards hanging in her room.

297,"Hey everyone... I'm currently struggling with an addiction to video games. Or rather, an addiction to one specific game: League of Legends.

A lot of games I can play and lose track of time, and still be happy: like Monster Hunter World, Maplestory, Furi. But for League its different. I'm completely hooked to solo queue ranked, and I keep playing it, many hours every day. It has been affecting my sleep- making me stay up later than I normally would, and has been affecting my meals; instead of cooking or looking for snacks in my fridge I just order food so I can spend more time playing.

For some more information; I'm stuck in a specific rank- Silver 4. And I know I can reach higher since I always play really well, and had reached much higher in prior seasons, but due to always what appears to be horrible luck with teammates, as well as my main character (Yuumi) being statistically the weakest in the game. I manage to win exactly half my games, and lose exactly half, meaning I'm stuck at a frustrating standstill- Which seems to be engineered by design. I feel like I'm running full force into a wall over and over hoping for a different outcome and can't seem to get out of the cycle

I'm a (22 F), currently in college. I've had a boyfriend before, he was a coworker and was the same nationality as me so flirting seemed easy. But now, I feel like I actually never knew how to flirt?
There's this guy, you see. I don't even know much about him apart from the fact that he's my senior in my program and he volunteers in our labs. He's smart, cute as heck, and honestly makes our labs even more fun. When I see him, it just makes me so giddy. It didn't even matter if I was having a bad day. As soon as I see him, I just get this burst of energy and suddenly my day feels better. I haven't felt like this in a while, not even for my ex. 
I want to get to know him, even as just friends, but I feel like it's weird and I'm too awkward. I can't even look at the guy when he's explaining something to my friend and I. I try, but then I have to look away or else I feel like I'm going to stare. My friends say I'm being too obvious lately but I can't help it. He just really makes me giddy and I'm actually getting worried since I'm getting too attracted to this dude. AND WE DON'T EVEN KNOW EACH OTHER.

What should I do? Do I just build up my courage and talk to this dude? If so, what do I say?

299,"Okay so. I'm in college, and there are these two girls in another course who are pretty close friends to the point both of them have their own group inside their class, don't really get along with anyone else, go out drinking together, have dinner at each other's daily, etc.

One of these girls, she can be Suzy, is a friend of mine's roommate. And for this reason I hang out with her sometimes when I go to their house, or out for coffee and she tags along, or anything like that.

Now, thing is, Suzy and I... never quite hit it off. I've given up on figuring out why. I mean she laughs at some of my jokes and we can have fun together, but that's it I never really felt any connection or friendship or anything with her at all. And now she reached that territory where I really just don't want her to bother me anymore because sometimes she comes across as quite entitled or is outright mean.

Now I don't care much about this girl at all. The thing is, I'd like to get to know her best friend better. The first time I talked with her friend she had been dared by her friends (including Suzy) to wear a beanie to college and I commented on that to her. Then I spoke to her two more times while Suzy was present and things were just... awkward as fuck to be quite honest. I remember approaching them because me and some friends were going to a party, but something happened and most of them cancelled so we had vacant seats in the car. Suzy wasn't enthusiastic at all, but her friend jumped in to say she'd love to go if only she had more money and was sorry she couldn't. As I said ""Alright, see you guys around later"" and got up her friend asked if that's all I wanted to talk with them about which I took as a sign of semi-interest. Idk though.

Anyway things are really awkward when both of them are together. I haven't been with Suzy's friend a lot, but the few times I was with them we vibed off somewhat well. Energetic, fun, cool conversations. But if I made a joke, Suzy's friend would laugh and then look at Suzy... and Suzy would just look at her right back completely stone-faced and not react at all. Not participating in conversation, not talking, not doing anything at all really.

Now I've given a specific scenario in this post, but I've had this happen before with another girl. She would constantly laugh at my jokes, or touch me, or smile at me when I passed by and lock eyes. And her friend always hated me for some reason too. I remember during a class I sat next to her and we both drew each other for fun, and she enjoyed my drawing and showed it to her friend, laughing and going ""Ahah I bet you wish you had a drawing like this"", and her friend just went meh and paid attention to class. And what ended up happening was that the initial girl eventually stopped doing anything like that. In that case we still talk to each other but there's just no energy there anymore. So if there is any advice overall for these situations I'd appreciate it.

What do you reckon? I mean I will still try to strike up conversation with her if I catch her alone or with someone I get along with because I have nothing to lose, but I'm not expecting any kind of success at all in this particular case.",04Feb2020,1
301,"I put in so much work and failed. I don’t want to get into it but sleepless days, sacrificing relationships for the sake of work. I let a lot of people over use me for my resources and talents, I’ve made myself and my home available to people who’ve been unreciprocated, I keep reliving the day i was held up at gun point and froze while they threatened to kill all my friends and cut one of their fingers off.

Isolation, self criticism and drinking was obviously a bad choice. For a year I was unable to make eye contact with people at all. I felt crazy, broken, insecure &amp; worthless.  I don’t know. It’s one thing to think something about yourself and it’s another thing to have something confirmed in someone else’s eyes. I relive these moments enough that it feels like I won’t get past it.

I want to be better but I feel like I’ve given up on life. Not suicidal at all but in reality my routine makes me feel dead already. Days just pass and I’m just going through motions. I feel like I hate people. I’ve isolated myself, Usually I just watch my phone ring, I deactivated all my social media, I never set up my voicemail, and for 2 months I told everyone my phone was broken so I had an excuse to not keep in contact with anyone. If it isn’t about wanting something, I don’t understand why people want to talk to me.

I want to be motivated but I historically am a failure. I won’t lie to myself to make me feel better, but I will strive to be better I’m just lost at the moment.

He also touches me here and there. Again super small. Like he puts his hand on my wrist if I'm typing to interrupt. Or a hand on my shoulder when trying to make a point. Or tap my thigh during a joke. I've never reciprocated. But I always thought it was normal because he touches, but never rubs.

So after a year she just didn’t talk to me anymore. She put up a TBH and I asked. She said I was an a**hole and but I was cool too. This didn’t hurt me but I was like d*mn okay. But after that I just felt bad because I had a chance with her but I screwed it up by being rude. Back then I was just toxic and I didn’t know it. So we are in the present and I still think about her and have the same feelings. The only thing is that I can’t stop thinking about her because she is always in the halls where I walk so I just get flashbacks of these bad moments. I don’t feel any emotions but this is only thing I feel and it’s just getting ridiculous at this point. I loved her enough to let her go and not do make her feel bad. What do I do to stop these feelings it’s been years it should’ve only been a week of this.
Please help!

312,"I’m scared of mentally or severely physically handicapped people or severely under any sort of drug/drink influence people. I don’t clearly know why but whenever I’m around such people I get extreme anxiety and can’t interact with them without looking visibly scared. 

I don’t want to be rude. I know they are people that are just as deserving of every right able bodied /sober people are. I need help now because I have a college course with two high-functioning autistic classmates, one has taken a liking to talking to me and now messaging me online (I also have no clue how he found me which scares me and so I didn’t answer yet, it’s been a week). I want to be able to talk to him without freaking out and have a friendly conversation because he seems genuinely kind and interesting. But my body feels like it’s in fight or flight mode and I know I must be giving off serious awkward vibes. 

This may be linked back to my autistic cousins who used to chase me and torture me as a kid while our parents would always take their side and scold me for “excluding them” if I tried to runaway from them. I feel like their unpredictability and ticks are what scared me most and make me anxious. Please any advice? I know this will probably get hate but this doesn’t come from a place of hatred or lack of respect for those with mental or severe physical disabilities. I believe in their rights and will stand for them. I just can’t get my hands to stop shaking or my mind to stop running or my heart to stop beating so fast and my mouth getting so dry and I never know what to say.

318,"18M here, almost done high school

I live an average and slightly underwhelming life. I have a few friends, I go out once and a while, I have the occasional date. But most of the time I’m pretty lonely.

I regret a lot of things I’ve done in the past, and literally shake with anger at the thought of what others have done to me. The ultra-short version of my problems is that I was forced to be someone that I was not by my family and friends, so I never rly knew who I was.

When I’m alone I just feel so empty / angry / lonely, so I drink and cry to deal with these bad feelings bc I have nothing else to do. I sleep it off and try and get through the next few days, then repeat.

This is a horrible coping mechanism, and I recognize that. No one knows about this. On the surface I’m just an average teenager.

320,"This is the first time I have taken to the internet searching for advice. I do truly feel pretty helpless here so I appreciate any and all advice received. I apologize for the throw away but some of our real life friends follow my normal account.

&amp;#x200B;

Back story. My wife and I have been together for 8 years, married for 5. I love her more than life itself and I have no reason to believe she doesn't feel the same way. We have been through a lot of shit together but we always come out the other side. For reference and because it may be relevant, I am 27 and my wife is 30. 

&amp;#x200B;

Recently(4 months ago) I got a job with a new company, previously we had both worked at the same company for the past 6 years. We didn't work together exactly but we both knew, and enjoyed that at a moments notice we could be at the other's desk. For context, we would go weeks at a time without ever seeing each other at work. We both worked first shift for I would say 80% of this time. Now I work second shift and on top of that I am pretty much on call 24/7. I work in IT contracting now. If something goes bad with a client they don't necessarily care what I am doing at the time.

&amp;#x200B;

So to the heart of the issue. My wife is not adjusting well to me not being around in the evenings. We both knew it would be hard and we discussed this entire move together. I did not make it unilaterally and she supported my choice. It was supposed to be a great move for us. I got a large raise and the opportunity for me to advance was much better. At first things were hard and we just thought it was an adjustment period. But they aren't getting better.

&amp;#x200B;

At least once a week we have a conversation before she goes to sleep about how she is feeling. It always leaves me gutted inside. She says about how she comes home to our empty house and she just wants to cry. She is getting anxiety about it now. We don't have children and never wanted any, so that is not a factor but it does lead to a lonely evening for her. She really has tried to deal with it. She tries to make plans with friends and things to keep her occupied, but we have a dog and we don't want her spending everyday alone so she can't do that all the time. She has tried making schedules for herself with chores/things to accomplish. She does okay for a while and it helps in the short term but then the weight of coming home alone every evening to an empty house gets to her. She mentions anxiety and saying how she feels worthless. 

&amp;#x200B;

At first I was not helping the problem because most of the things around the house were falling on her. I get home at 10:30PM so I wasn't really doing many tasks around the house other than taking out the trash. This made her feel even more alone. I have gotten better with this and it did seem to help a little bit. So that is a bright spot.

&amp;#x200B;

So now for my advice request. How do help my wife? I want to try and find something that she enjoys to help her stay busy but I fear that if I don't get to the root of the issue it will only help in the short term, if at all. I have mentioned in the past that I think she should speak with a professional. I haven't implied that she needed medication, even though she has said that herself. She is not very receptive to the idea even though I think she may feel that is what she needs to do. I also feel if I push to much I come off as ""Not wanting to deal with  it anymore so go get some pills"". Ideally I don't want my wife to have to medicate. I would never want that. Really I just want her to talk to a third party, I have even offered to go along. 

&amp;#x200B;

Holy shit this is long. I apologize and thank you to anyone who reads all this. I didn't mean to make this sound like a diary entry but I really am inside out over this. I love my wife more than anything.",04Feb2020,1
321,"So I have been at this semi engineering job in an industrial setting for about 5 months now and I hate my life because of it. I want to go back to school for teaching but because of the hours I work I can’t really do that. I work every weekday 7am-5pm plus or minus an hour or two and I do not get a lot of time off.  I also have a lot of people at this job relying on me so if I quit I’d be fucking them all over royally. Not to mention my bills rn as a right out of college worker are stupid. 

I make $55k right now which is awesome for a starting job and is kinda pulling me out of the slump my student loans, rent and other payments left me in BUT as I said I’m miserable and if it weren’t for my gf, I’d probably be dangerously depressed. I suck at my job because I am not industrial minded at all and I don’t care about engineering in any sense. I just did it because I let my dad talk me into it when I was having a moment of uncertainty when I was 19 with my original education major. He’s been shoving engineering down my throat ever since I played with legos as a kid and constantly said “you’re too smart to be a teacher” which is just parental bs. (I know I got daddy issues. Wanted to see him proud of me so much I didn’t think about what makes me happy). I also did it because I am really good at math and analytics and knew I could get the degree pretty easily. Well I have my BA in Mech Engineering and I hate the jobs it’s gonna get me. 

I ALMOST have all of my teaching credentials in the state of Illinois. I have my observation hours and artifacts in from my community college days when I originally was going for teaching, but I still need the BA, which would require student teaching hours that I cannot do because of my hours of work. 

Disclaimer: some of this is to vent parental frustrations and isn’t important to the advice I need, but I genuinely don’t know what to do or where to start to get back on track and I am hoping someone has been in something similar.  Or at least a teacher who started somewhere else can tell me what I need to get a teaching job. 

Tl;dr 
I’m trapped at an engineering job I suck at and hate to the point of mental illness. I want to go back to school for teaching, but I have too many things leaning on this job for me to quit. If I don’t quit, I don’t see myself living to see 28.",04Feb2020,1
322,"Second semester of my grade 11 year was rough, I dealt with my problems by not confronting them most of the time and running away, this was usually procrastination and skipping class.  I found it difficult to walk into a certain class late because I knew no one there, and the first time I skipped.  I noped out and told my friend I couldn't walk in there, she said to join her in the library and I did.  After that I made sure I'd be one of the first in there. This first semester of my grade 12 year was quite easy.  Only one class.  I dropped out of co-op because I couldnt handle it anymore (hence my one class).  The experience was not worth it.  I'd feel anxious everyday, about doing the work, seeing the people.  My principal spoke with me and said maybe I should try speaking with my supervisor and seeing of changes could be made but when she suggested that I started crying because I really didn't want to deal with another day of this.  It wasn't something I could suck up and face and emerge stronger, I felt so sick and anxious all the time and it really interfered with my happiness.

Now beginning my last semester of high school I'm feel anxious about the future.  I'm in the school play, we perform in a month.  I have 2 courses rolled into one and so all the student will be writing an exam at the end of March, alongside this I'm juggling a semester long project in English, and the Physics and Kinesiology. I know it's going to get hard at times.  But here's my problem, kinesiology class gives me a weird feeling.  Like that same anxiousness I had before.  In grade 10 I switched classes midway through october because I hated waking up in the morning because it meant I had to go to that class.  I don't want to have this attitude with kinesiology.  And today was my first day and already I thought ""I'm going to want to drop out of this aren't I?"" But I cant afford to drop out of this, I need this credit.

I can't keep running away from my problems bug it seriously makes me feel crazy out of my mind sometimes.  I get so overwhelmed.  The principal did express concern when I told her about the skipping class out of anxiousness and she said I can come to her office anytime and ask to speak to the school counselor, and no questions asked she'd let me.

I've tried going to my friends, actually only one I really trust but even then the things she says does not help.  I don't even know what I want to hear.   She's not even in a place to give me solid advice so it's like she's not reliable.  My sister has moved away for college so now I'm alone.  I can't communicate these feelings with my parent's because they'll tell me to focus on religion more, and then there's a whole separate issue of stress and anxiety with that.  I don't want it to get so bad that I need to talk with our school counselor. 

I don't want to keep running away from my problems but I dont know how to cope with the feelings I'm feeling.  I can't carry on like this because if I do I will literally fail university. 

I'm dealing with a disordered relationship with fitness and food as well and that often stresses me out and fitness takes up some time but I'm learning to use this correctly so it benefits me instead of hurting me, so kinesiology may be the slightest bit triggering.  I'm thinking I might switch into an art class of there is space, but I need to wait until a day I can speak with my sister because I consult her, but it's hard to find a time she's available.

323,"Hello everyone,

Context:
-Currently a trainee as industrial office manager
-The pay's absolute trash (like the ppl I work with, though) 
-Friends live far away, barely have any time to just call/ talk anymore
-I'm kind of a sociophobe (talking to ppl is alright, anything further; no thanks)
-Very unhappy with pretty much anything I do except playing video games and listening to the music I love (also sports, but I had to quit my gym membership due to shitty pay) 
-Find the thought of selling my time (and soul) to make money for another guy (that pays me so little) revolting
-Have rarely been truly happy since like 2012
-Everyday seems like an uphill struggle against myself; if my resolve isn't perfect everyday, everything seems to come crashing down on me (which kinda happened yesterday, called in sick at work, stayed at home playing games, which inspired me to ask for your help here)
-Find it hard to be passionate about anything else besides games and music
-Again,selling my time and soul for someone else's gain doesn't sound appealing to me. At least not if I don't really get much back
-See no purpose in this life really (We all die, so why even bother; try to convince myself that if life's worthless anyway, I might as well make myself a good time. Haven't had that so far)
-Don't wanna end it all, but just wasting away is dumb, too
-Want to be somebody, but not in a monetary sense (more like being important to someone other than my family, on the other hand don't want anyone to miss me when I'm gone) 
-Wanted to be a salesman for musical instruments, but the only company close by rejected me
-Thought about becoming a soldier (still on the edge about that one)

330,"before Christmas i started speaking to and fell in love with this girl (i know youve provably seen this like 1000 times but please) and one day when we were texting she asked me if i had a crush on her, she told me to be honest and even if i had one, it wouldnt be awkward. So of course i said yes, and she said that she had one too. I was thrilled, but also suspicious, because of anxiety. We kept talking and chilling together until friday last week. I was doing something at my house and i invited a group of friends, in which some of the girls in the group were her best friends. A few days earlier she had texted me asking for weed while trying to make it pass like a love confession (To make me answer faster? Idk), so i put 2 and 2 together and thought she was just talking to me because i had weed, but i still invited her to come over on friday and she just ignored my messages, until later during the night when she wrote saying she "" didnt see the messages"" but i was fucking gone because i abused a bit on the weed and i fucking french kissed a girl like the whole night and because the girls were her best friends she knew like the next day. Like 2 days after i wrote to her to ask her when she felt most comfortable to do my piercing (she said she could pierce me, so of course i accepted), but she just left me on read, and at school i saw she was actively avoiding me, so i wrote to her if she was mad at me and she said no and she also said that if i wanted to get pierced i should go see professionals, but she had already pierced me before (it wouldve been the seconde time) and i understood she didnt want to talk to me anymore so i let it at that, but today i was in english at the same time as her, and she knew that.

332,"
So I (F21) have been dating my significant other (also F21) for a little over a year now. My girlfriend is prone to major mood swings and sometimes I don’t know if the next things I’m gonna say will make her mad or not. She always tells me how she values honesty and openness in a relationship but this past weekend, we got into an argument about my honest opinions about the future. She is a “I date with the intent of long-term/marriage” type of person. I mentioned that while I do have feelings for and love her, I do not want to think about any of those things while still at a young age (I am much more of a “one day at a time” person) . We are both in university full time all week, but I work all weekend. Between those two things alone, and still trying to make time for hobbies and social interactions, I don’t have much time to think about my relationship status 10+ years from now. I want to focus on getting school, finances, a potential career, etc. in order before focusing on that. When I told her this, she got furious. We spent the whole day arguing (via text) about it, eventually leading to the revival of old arguments. Then toward the end of the day she said she was tired of fighting and changed the subject. The next day, she acted as if nothing was wrong and went back to being all lovey. I have noticed this pattern before with her, where she will become extremely affectionate (she is usually clingy, but it’s exemplified after these situations) following fights where she gets way more upset then-at least how I see it-what is called for. She says she doesn’t want to get “played” like in her previous relationships and how there is an “unfairness” in this relationship because I brought this up.  Is it unfair to her? I’ve done nothing but give her all my affection and attention for over a year, but I sometimes feel like she doesn’t see it as enough and this past weekend has just added on to these feelings.  

Any advise on how to handle this would be appreciated!",04Feb2020,1
333,"I need help in managing my anger, I am now 22 and I can't be in the same room with my father without going on a rage.

Okay, so it started when I was younger. My father wouldn't always be around in our house, just my mom. But every time they were together, they'd fight. My father is not good with money, so he'd steal from my mom (even if she's a stay at home) and my mom would often cry and ask for the money he stole... He never admitted it and pretended he never stole from her.

Then came my Pre-school days, I remember my dad asking me to sit on his lap and he'll grind his groins unto me. I didn't know that it was bad, but i remember it tickled me and that it hurts when he's wearing jeans... It was in his room and he'd force me to suck his nipples and he'll say something like, ""this one has beer on it, and the left has coffee."" I remember that disgusting look on his face when I looked up at him whilst sucking. 

Around 3rd grade when my mom left my dad. hence my sister and I were stuck with my dad, we'd sleep beside him and weirdly, wake up at night and see him standing up and staring at us. 

I blamed my dad because my mom left us. Now that he's grown old. He claims he gave us the best life, when in fact, he ruined our lives because of how he spends his money, he lies about the girls he's seeing and he was stuttering when I gave him facts. Our education was compromised because he didnt want us to go to a prestigious university AND most of the money he spent was given by my Uncle and yet claims he did it all by himself. He has this image of himself that he's saved by God for being a good father and a family man. 

I hated him growing up because he fucked me up. And now he's telling me that I am going to have a miserable life because of how i treat him, because it's written on the bible, ""Honor your *father* and *mother""*

I want to forgive him and let it go - Just *move foward*.

But I can't, he keeps on reminding me of my childhood. He opened up my mind about sexual pleasure in a young age, and I remember ""playing"" with boys about it. because I thought it was normal.

Then buy another house in the same price range. After we get 2 houses, we want to buy an apartment complex.

338,"yesterday i hung out in my room with a guy who I'm ""talking"" to (aka were not dating but it's clear there is romantic intent) and we were having fun but at one point he started going on and ON about anime girls and how cute they are, and how he has a bunch of anime waifus. i did nothing to warrant it, he just kept saying things like ""they're just so cute and small and soft"" and I just kept telling him ""why would i want to hear about that"" but i was laughing uncomfortably so I guess he thought it was funny for both of us. he kept naming every freaking anime girl and celebrity he has ever found hot or cute, also literally saying the cringy ""2D &gt; 3D"" thing.

i got tired of it eventually and went quiet, i didnt know what to say so I just put my shoes on to walk him out. 

we talked about it the next morning and he apologized for ""joking"" like that, but to me it didnt feel like jokes, i mean he was pointing out specific girls in the movie we were watching and saying ""HER!! ive always thought she was cute as hell"". I cant figure out his intentions for saying that stuff to me. maybe he was trying to get me jealous or maybe he thought it was funny to see me get flustered, either way all he did was make me feel yucky. also approximately zero of these girls look like me in any way. I have no problem with anime but I dont wanna have to share someones heart with a bunch of fictional fudging characters (and some real life celebrities) who are impossible for me to compare with. i have a hard time moving past this personally, because i cant think of any pure intentions for sharing that info with me. or any intentions at all really, like WHO SAYS THAT TO A GIRL THEY WANNA DATE???? but anyways although we talked about it I have not been making a big deal out of it to him (besides essentially kicking him out of my room lol).

339,"Sorry this one is so long. 

I’m 26 and male. I just got out of a 6 year relationship and I’m not sure how to go on. I’m not trying to sound dramatic but i grew up and lived with the person i thought was my soul mate. 
To explain further i was raised in a super Christian household. I came out as gay at 19 and it was really really hard. I was told i was going to hell, i was yelled at, i was told i could never date. Then i met a boy and we went on an innocent date mini golfing. He was the absolute sweetest guy i had ever met. We ended up going out and along the way my parents met him and liked him and for the first time my parents started to accept who i was. I moved out with him and felt like i had it all. Over the years there was bad times and good times but through it all he always felt like my absolute best friend. I will say sex with us wasn’t always the best. He isn’t as sexual as me and we did clash that way. That was the first and only real issue we ever had. I wanted sex a ton, he wanted to just cuddle. He didn’t like that i turned everything sexual but it was just in my nature to do that honestly. 
So there was one fight we continuously had this past hear, me wanting sex more and him not wanting it as much. This past year he also got a job long distance so he was gone 2 weeks every month in another state. I trust him completely and know he wasn’t cheating and neither was i. On my birthday this year he text my siblings that he was going to propose sending pics of rings and all but on my birthday we ended up having the same fight only this time he didn’t come home. He went to his friends house because he didn’t wanna fight anymore. Side note: we were about to move to the state he works in 2 weeks out of the month and so we were packing and ending our lease at our apartment. He ended up not coming home for several days. We just kept fighting about the same thing over text. Eventually he came home and told me he needed time away from us. 
Now I’m 26, i was broken up with on my birthday week, i have no move back in with my parents because i have nowhere to go. He told me to quit my job because we were moving out of state so i have no job. I have no friends because he was my only friend and my best friend and i feel so lost. I don’t know how to go on or what to do. I feel like everything was ripped out from me. Now he’s moving for 2 months and then coming back. (It was the shortest he could do on the lease we were moving to) 
I guess my biggest fear is, what if he doesn’t want me in 2 months. Why would he one second want to propose and the next not? I don’t wanna start over completely. I don’t want someone new. I thought i had my forever. I’m scared I’ll end up alone forever. It’s so hard to find someone let alone someone compatible when you’re a gay man. I’m the loneliest I’ve ever felt in my life and i wish i was dead.  Any advice on what i should do or how to move on right now would be nice or even someone to talk to.",04Feb2020,1

I'm stuck and I need your opinion/help; girl I have been seeing fell asleep at my place bcs I wasn't escalating properly, what move am I supposed to do?

u/imgentleman4m

So there's this girl Wendy, that I talk to lately very often, almost every other day, we have been on couple of ""dates"" and I generally think she likes me because she does spend a lot of time with me. But also is finding out if I'm worth it.

Now, I haven't tried anything. Unfortunately I do have a bit anxiety and I'm not that experienced. Plus I do have problems with having sex while drunk.

Things got heated little bit yesterday where I think I could have went for a kiss but unfortunately I haven't. We have been cuddling a little when we were drunk and stuff like that. So it's a bit romantic.

Now I think she's person who likes men who take initiation (something I should be but I'm not.) And probably likes to be straightforward but wants to be seduced as well.

So hop onto present time. She said she feels bad for leaving me on the bus stop yesterday and came over. We chatted a bit and had fun although I guess I was a bit annoying later on because of weed cookies. I didn't made my move because...well because I had that anxiety and there wasn't any moment.

So now it's 7am rn and I can't sleep bcs I'm horny af, little bit high and overall sad that I'm fuckwit. my question is, should I make my move in the morning? I could face the potential rejection but I won't see her for next two weeks. Also she might be grumpy and not in mood.",04Feb2020,1
346,"My friend and I were buying concert tickets together last week, we were on the phone with each other and whoever got through first on ticketmaster was going to buy the tickets.

It happened to be me. I read her the pricing and we picked $250 tickets. I asked her if she was okay with that price or wanted to go lower, she said go for it, I made the purchase. 

The concert isn't for another 9 months but we haven't discussed how she's going to pay me. She's been a close friend since childhood, I 100% trust she'll pay me, this isn't one of those situations. But maybe she got the idea that she's paying me closer to the concert, but $250 is a lot to hold onto for someone else.

350,"Before anyone freakS out, no, this is not about being in love with my teacher and wanting to date them. So I (20F) was checking feedback for an online class assignment from my professor (M, 50s??). The first section indeed commented on the homework (which was about networking, so it’s not like it was me delving into all my feelings or anything personal). But then after that, he writes: “ And, if you'd like to have coffee sometime let me know. We can simply chat about whatever with no agenda... during this quarter and/or at any point down the road afterward.”

This immediately struck me as being... not right. Maybe if he was offering to help me with homework or things related to the course, or invited me to his office hours. /Maybe/ if the assignment had included very personal feelings that made him concerned for my well-being or something (but even then I’ve never even so much as met the guy for office hours, we aren’t close). I showed it to a friend and my mother to see if I was overthinking it, both agreed it wasn’t appropriate and the wording was just creepy. I feel so uncomfortable as the days have passed since seeing this, but I decided just to ignore it and not even say anything to my professor (especially since it was an open offer, not direct question).

351,"So about 3 (almost 4) years ago I went on a school trip to Europe (France, Switzerland, and Germany) with a program called EF Tours. When I became apart of the program we were notified that another school from a different state was going to join our group and I personally thought it would be cool because I get to know more people. So fast forward to the day I got to Paris, we were all having a group lunch and I was sitting across this incredibly pretty girl and I decided to talk to her and we hit it off pretty damn well. Although that talk went well we still didn’t really talk throughout Switzerland because she was with her group of friends so I just let her be for the mean time. Anyways, fast forward to our last day in Europe we were in Germany and a bunch of us were hanging out in a room and I was laying on a bed and she decided to come lay down next to me and we ended up cuddling for a bit so at that point I thought she had a crush on me. When it came
to us leaving and being at the airport she was pretty distant from me, but we still had small talk. Ever since that day we exchanged snapchats and have talked every single day (she’s currently my longest streak at 1188 days) since we left Europe. 

So, fast forward 2 years, I was a freshman in college and she was a senior in high school, we were talking more than usual, we were flirting and she decided to ask me to be her prom date and travel to her state. At first I was pretty broke because I went to an expensive college, but I decided to transfer to a different university and I ended up getting a refund back from financial aid and I ended up renting a tux, buying my plane ticket, and staying at her place. So as I was going to Florida I got a text from one of her friends saying if I could be their prom date and I told them that I already had a date. I decided to tell her that her other friend asked me to be her prom date and she proceeded to say “ha, well at least I got you first” at first I was like “damn alright” but I figured out that her group of friends from Europe are no longer friends. Afterwards we were at prom we danced for the night and decided to go to an after party and that’s when I met all of her new friends. 

They started to ask us questions and one of them said “are you two dating” and her being drunk at the party said “no he’s too far” and I for sure thought she had a crush on me. Later on the night she was cuddling another guy and he was telling her how much he used to have a crush on her. I left because I was a bit jealous but I didn’t make a huge deal out of it, but I was laying down on a recliner chair and she got in the chair with me and we pretty much just slept together. Later the following morning she was completely distant from me and we barely said anything the entire day. I thought I did something wrong and we were at her house watching a movie and I told her that she can lay her head on my lap cause she was in a weird position and she said “Na I’m good” but she said it with an attitude. When I left we snapchatted each other, but she didn’t say anything and just sent pictures of the wall, etc. At that moment I thought I was friend zoned for sure because we weren’t flirting anymore and our conversations just went pretty bland. 

Now (2 years later) we are planning a skiing trip here in my home state and we rented an Airbnb and she said that we should bring a couple of bottles liquor when she comes to my state. Now she bought her ticket and we got an entire condominium to ourselves and I don’t know where I stand with her. I don’t know if she likes me and I don’t know if I should make a move. My friends have stated that I’ve been friend zoned because of everything that has happened with us in the past. So, if anyone has some advice on what I could look for that might be a sign of me being friend zoned or if I still have a shot with this girl then that would be greatly appreciated.",04Feb2020,1
352,"Alright, so for context, I am currently on my junior year of high school, and back in sophomore I had really bad anxiety to the point that it honestly seemed difficult to me at times having a basic conversation with most people even if I knew them, and back in sophomore year I had this crush who was the only person I’ve really liked since middle school, for most of my freshman year, my friends who knew her from middle school(we went to different schools) were kinda trying to point out that she might’ve liked me too, even with her kinda making it obvious for me as well. Eventually when I got enough courage to try and hit her up, I felt like I came off really dry and boring, that ended whatever little interactions we had, then as time went on I still continued having feelings for her but I figured the feelings weren’t mutual since she was talking with someone else. Then when I thought I had a chance, I felt like a came off too strong and I could’ve toned it down. That sort of killed my hopes on trying to start something with someone else, my anxiety worsened, and I just kinda felt like awkward for the fact that I still had feelings for her, they worsened however, and more and more I was just fantasizing about being with her, and for more than what you’d expect a teenager to want to be with someone for. For the rest of sophomore feelings started coming and going for her, more towards summer my anxiety started getting better that I could  actually hold a decent conversation with anyone really but mainly if I got brought into it, that also kinda helped me feel more like I could start talking with more females trying to get to know them like that and all that, however when I tried talking with females like that, I felt like I would also come off as boring or uninteresting that the conversation would honestly just probably go nowhere, or when I came off with stronger and more straightforward, I just felt like it was putting me in more awkward situations where the feelings just straight up wouldn’t be mutual, one of my friends has told me go in more straightforward since that works for him, another said to try and let it get somewhere. I guess what I’m really trying to get advice with is how to better talk with females when trying to get at them, or really just in general to make more friends.",04Feb2020,1

354,"Hello everyone,

I would like to start off by apologizing for any grammatical errors, or sounding misinformed in any way.

So the thing is.. my mother came home earlier tonight in tears  saying that my brother was pretty much “skin and bones”. Now the way this goes,
My brother (let’s call him B), was a very shy kid yet always so kind and gentle.
He used to be average built, some 167lbs around 17yrs of age or so not sure or accurate, but he always danced around the house, was passionate about working out and having his protein shakes, and fast cars also.
He was a funny kid always looking to put a smile in your face and never took a joke too hard and was always there for you when you needed.

Some years ago my parent’s (mom and stepdad, his dad, my mom though I met him as a newborn) they went through a divorce. Long story short that hit him hard when he found out my step dad cheated on my dad. Now “B”, didn’t take it too well at all, sometime goes by later, and his grandmother passed of cancer.
Some time later he goes out with this local girl, (I say local because little did I know she was the sister of a former close friend of mine some years back, and lost him to drugs I believe).
Something didn’t seem right about her, she was rude, and already with a kid. Had problems with her kid’s dad, and well then found out she had some other issues. Drug related issues. 

“B” goes on to live with my mom for sometime until she realized and couldn’t take the fact that he started doing several bad things in the wrong, where he began to take aluminum foil, lighters or matches.. etc not really sure what he was doing.
So my mother gave him an ultimatum on where he either needs to tell the girl to leave or they both did.
So he did.. both of them.

I insisted to my mom that this was the worst thing she could’ve done considering he was already all fucked up due to drugs and he wasn’t gonna care also considering that he had some strong feelings for this girl and was not gonna let her go.

Now she comes home some time later, crying and then panicking about how she can’t believe how he looks as what she described him to be “just skin and bones” and how he looks so “fragile, weak and can barely make up a sentence without him mumbling and or biting his tongue every 2 seconds”. 

“B” lives in Mexico, thanks to my shitty stepdad. He lives with said woman, and an uncle (who is the same way) and so my mother asked me for advice. 
Last conversation she had with “B” was about “suicidal thoughts” and how as he said “I sometimes think if I weren’t around I would not have to hurt myself or you anymore mom”. He admitted to feeling alone and scared. He rarely eats or has ever any money but truthfully people of reddit I need some fucking advice. I am trembling as I type this, I don’t want to loose my baby brother to drugs.. he deserves more than that and a better life. To me he will always be that kid to start randomly dancing because he wanted to make you laugh by being silly. I apologize for the long thread, and thank you all in advance.",04Feb2020,1
358,"I'm shaking like mad and can barely keep my head on for more than a minute, so I'll try my best to articulate this mess as I can.

I'm currently living with my mother, my young teenage sibling, and my mother's now ex-boyfriend in his house. We moved in around late September, leaving behind the only affordable housing we could find for quite a distance-- a deal we only uncovered because it was a studio in her manager's house. My mother is now attempting to leave that company for reasons many and the manager has since occupied the studio. 

My mother and her boyfriend have frequently fought over the months, but tonight was particularly nasty. In a few words, there is no coming back from it. He gave us a month to leave. He will be out of town for most of this month anyhow, and some friends of his will be around to check on the state of things. He is a kind enough individual that there is trust he will give us the month, but the rub is that I am utterly mortified of moving out with my mother/somehow leaving my sibling behind in all of this. 

Almost a year ago to-date, she experienced a break up with her significant other at the time. After boozing it for a week, she beat the shit out of me because she blamed me for said break up/verbatim cited a want to feel powerful after such an event took place. She came to my room tonight and mentioned many precursory sentiments that lead to this event. She did not touch me, but she did kick my door in at one point and spent about an hour or two screaming at me, telling me to die, and then storming off into the night when I refused to pack a bag for my brother and I. I do not believe I will be safe in this situation going forward if I am to stay. I do no trust her.

She has cornered me in so that I have no work experience/had to decline my college acceptance years back because of my responsibility to household needs. I have only two social ties because her last marriage went to hell and I ended up being pulled out of high school (to instead take classes online with very minimal student contact, so I do have my diploma) and not allowed out of our apartment for 4 years solid. That trend has continued in the years since because I have had no way to get out. I tried doing transcriptions for a while for pocket change and once was very active with my illustrative commission output, but circumstance has left me, bluntly put, too depressed and suicidal to pick up the pen.

A friend was collaborating with me to have me move in within them later this year, but they are on the other side of the country and it puts my possessions in state of question. I cannot ask them to help me on such short notice, especially when I feel so guilty about having them help me period. All I really have to lug around are a few plastic bins of art supplies/clothes, my desktop, laptop, drawing tablet, a (musical) keyboard, and 4 guitars... two of which I am begrudgingly willing to part with. It's not a lot, but it's enough to have me uncertain how best to store or transport them safely, minding that so much of what I possess is delicate. Maybe I'm clinging too hard to not wanting to give my things up again. My entire childhood was spent that way, and when we left my mother's last ex-husband, we were faced with losing everything to a shelter. I just barely managed to redirect our fate by contacting some estranged family members, all of which are no longer available as avenues of support. I don't want to lose what few things I have left. I don't want to lose what few pieces of me I still have.

I don't know what to do. Even if I were to stay with my mother, we no longer have any mattresses, cookware, or general home necessities per this recent move, which we had only recovered in the year before. We have no one to turn to. My mother doesn't make enough to sustain us and I *still* can't get a job to balance this because of either some arbitrary bullshit she'll pull on me or the fact that I have no transportation nor guarantee that I could even access any job I get in this area after this month.

I just want to wake up from this nightmare. This morning was so full of hope-- I left the house and even had a schedule to pull me from this pit since I could easily garner $100+ a pop for a single, simple illustration. And now everything is on fire with no hope of being put out.

I'm so scared. I don't even know what to ask for this time in the general sense. Maybe some insight on moving my things/storage? Thoughts on what the hell I'm to do? I've not a clue. I appreciate what time is spent on this nonetheless.",04Feb2020,1

So today I was at my favourite bar for my new-to-2020 weekly pre-gym drink and chat and everything has unexpectedly gone incredibly unpleasant… The staff gave me a special discount card a few months back, they’re all really kind and lovely to me, and I try to be kind and lovely back. A couple of them—one male, one female—are friends on Facebook, etc. etc.

Been getting along really well with the one female Facebook friend for the past couple of months. I’m 29, she’s 23 with a three-year-old kid. She just got out of a weird relationship with a coworker, I’m in a publicly ongoing nightmare with an ex who is seeing someone else but does say she loves me, wants to be with me, and wants to cuddle me constantly, so there’s nothing more going on than friendly chat and a few “have a good week!” Facebook messages. We went to the same university, have the same ambitions, we have both struggled really badly with body image in the past—her anorexia, my BDD—for which we’re both seeing therapists, we have a shared interest in feminist literature and history, writing essays and reading too many novels simultaneously. About a month ago she introduced me to her two sisters, about three weeks ago she said I should’ve been out and met her university friends on a night out. Though I’ve never asked, every time I say goodbye she steps out from behind the bar to come and give me a hug.

The ongoing nightmare has really triggered the extremely bad self-worth I worked so hard to expunge, and I’ve been thinking myself worthless for the past two weeks, fighting intrusive thoughts of suicide and self-harm, but I’ve tried not to isolate myself or think that everyone secretly hates me. WELL. Or maybe WELL.

On Saturday I made an unexpected stop to the bar because I had plans in an hour but nothing to do immediately. It was really busy, Facebook friend was there along with three other staff members I know. Since it was busy I talked the smallest of talks with another twenty-odd year old guy for about half an hour and didn’t get in the way. When that guy went to the bathroom, Facebook friend came over and whispered that he’d been hanging around all yesterday too; I joked that she’ll want rid of us both then. Very sincerely, in a soft voice, she said “no no, you can stay… I like you”. She was really tired, it was really busy, and I had my plans to attend to so I left shortly after. Because of her exhaustion, about an hour later I sent a quick screenshot of a few YouTube videos on “relaxing whale sounds for sleep” with the caption “SUGGESTION”, she replied with a laughing emoji and “thanks!”

At about half-three this Monday, I got a message on Facebook from the bar owner asking if he could speak to me. I noticed it about half-five, while I was at the bar sitting quietly on my phone—Facebook friend I really should’ve given a name for by now—waiting to disappear for book club. I’m normally in about an hour on the Monday, and an hour and a half after my therapist appointment each Thursday when no set staff member is in. I say to her “Hey, how come the owner messaged me asking to speak?”, to which she said “he’ll just be being overprotective because you’ve been coming in on Mondays when I’m here alone”, which… okay? It has been four consecutive Mondays, but I always ask if she just wants peace and quiet, if it’s okay to sit at the bar, everything I can possibly do to be considerate. She always says yes to me sitting at the bar and there have been times when I’ve made doubly sure after about half an hour to which, again, she invariably says “no please stay!” Almost all the time there are other customers around, last week a mutual friend appeared and we all got along really well. Again she said I should stay when I suggested leaving.

When I waved goodbye today she came out and gave me a long hug, told me not to stress about the message from the owner, that I’m not “like, being banned or anything” and I’m fine.

I spoke to the owner over message an hour later and he straight up told me to “stay away for a bit” because “at times” I’m causing “some” of the staff to be a “little uncomfortable”. He doesn’t know the ins and outs, he said, and though I apologised immediately I have “nothing to apologise for”. Asked afterwards if he’s sure I’m actually the right person on account of, well, everything I’ve said in this post, but it’s late and I haven’t had a reply.

Genuinely the only time I can think I overstepped a boundary was three weeks ago when I brought her a gluten-free peanut-butter brownie because she’s celiac and I’d watched another celiac friend wolf-down three of them in a row. From time to time I’ll tell her she looks well (but never “beautiful” or anything that could be construed as flirting). Unprompted, last week she showed me a photo of her underboob tattoo which you wouldn’t do for someone that makes you feel uncomfortable? Every so often I’ve caught her staring at me from the corner of my eye, then smirking and quickly looking away when I make eye contact. She knows all about the ongoing situation with my ex, and the only time I’ve suggested we meet up outside of work was a month ago when she told me of her loneliness during the day and wish to make more time for writing in cafés—I messaged later that we can do that if she likes. Note I messaged later so there would be no putting her on the spot at work, doubly note that she said it sounds good.

I don’t know, I’m worried about messaging her directly now in case it’s seen as a boundary-overstep. It seems insane to me though, all of this, and with my self worth at an all-time suicidal low, losing one of the few places I’ve felt comfortable in these past months brought me to tears in front of friends. She accidentally dropped a quick thank you note from her purse that I’d written to all the staff and snuck into the tip jar back in *July*. It wasn’t addressed to her, I knew her far less well at that time than most of the other staff. Why would you keep that on your person every day for five months if I was a weird creepy dude making you uncomfortable? Why all of this?",04Feb2020,1
368,"I'm a guy that doesn't know how to pull off scarves or turtle necks (plus it's a little too warm). I had an anterior disc replacement last Monday and just got the bandages off today. It looks like my throat was slit and covered in surgical glue, plus I can't shave a big section of my neck for at least a couple more weeks, so it's really not pleasant to look at. Any suggestions on how to look more presentable?",04Feb2020,1
369,"I've hit a slump where nothing interests me anymore. I fell into such a habit of work, clean, cook, and sleep that I don't know what to do with myself. I used to read, write, and even draw. I used play video games a lot. Now nothing hold my attention, I've tried getting back into writing and I just pull up a hard blank. Honestly I'm also grasping to distract myself from things stressing me out lately but nothing does. I feel like a shell now. My boyfriend went to sleep earlier than me and I just kind of lay there tearing up because I felt so lost and restless without him as a distraction. I don't know what to do with myself anymore.",04Feb2020,1
370,"I used to be a smoker, thankfully I only did it for around one year, and I decided to quit, I bought a pack of my favorite cigarettes, smoked one and bowed to never smoke again, and so I put that last pack in my room, so I could see how strong I am and proud of myself for quitting, it was kind of a reminder that I can achieve things if I put my mind into it. But one day my pack of cigarettes disappeared, it turns out my mother stole them from my room. And I was furious, that pack of cigarettes meant a lot to me, and ever since I never forgotten about that, I still call her a robber every time I get mad at her and I don’t know if this causes me to get even mad at her for simple things because of this. What’s your opinion on this? Should I forgive her? How could I? Or how should she amend this? My last fight with her got out of control and I broke some plates because I was pretty angry at her for throwing a pack of vegetables leftovers I was saving to do a veggies stock. It made me angry because it was almost. A month of saving them and I told her about it before and she didn’t even ask if she could throw her, she just did. So what do you think? How should I deal these situations with my mother?",04Feb2020,1

BANGS, ladies and gents.

Do I seem like I have the face for them?
If so, what kind of bangs?
Personally I thought face framing and a little bit in the middle but I'm not a professional 
(I cut my previous bangs when I was 4 years old and It looked like I just got out of a mental hospital)

What is my face shape? I've talked to multiple people, some say oval and some say round or square.
Just overall curiousness I guess.

375,"So my neighbor is probably the biggest piece of shit out there. I live in a “half double” sort of, but there are 3 apartments in one building (that looks like a regular house). We share the same backyard and all three tenants have a dog. We moved in in this last summer, and shortly after we brought home our sweet soft coated wheaten terrier puppy. The first week we got her, our neighbor reported us to the landlord for him stepping in dog poop. The weird thing is, every since this summer, we haven’t seen that neighbor  EVER take his dog (a little derpy dog the size of a cat) outside to the yard. Never. We have cameras that show the front of the building on the street, and also on the back porch where the lawn is and where our door is and we get notifications of motion on our phones, so when I say we NEVER see him take his dog out, I really mean it. Anyways, last week, I got home from work around 11pm, and I went inside to get the recycling ready to go outside. I put my dog outside on the line during this time, while I do what I need to do. About 15 minutes later, we let Millie in and she’s limping and crying with each step. We are horrified, because there is NOTHING in the yard that could have done this to her, plus she’s on a line so she couldn’t have wandered off. Anyways, while we are checking her out, we get a knock on the door. It’s the police, they say our neighbor called them to report us abusing our dog. We are in total shock. He quickly sees that we aren’t hurting our dog in any way, and leaves. After this we decide to pull up the footage from the camera because at this point we are already putting together something in our head. There is one part of the yard, the part closest to the driveway and my neighbors door, that is not in view of the camera. We see me bringing her out, us going back in, then her walk off camera. All of a sudden, you hear a door open (the only door in earshot of that camera besides mine is his) we then hear footsteps walk down his porch steps, and the steps get closer and louder on the camera, a little movement then my dog crying out in pain 3 different times. We then hear my neighbor say something, sound of footsteps fade and we hear him walk up his porch steps and his door open and close again. A minute later we bring Millie inside. This motherfucker hurt my dog. We brought her to the vet, and he said it was blunt force trauma, like she was kicked at least once, really hard. It’s been almost a week since this happened; she is still limping. The day after it happened, my boyfriend was taking the garbage out and the neighbor went outside and smirked at my boyfriend. My boyfriend said calmly “I know what you did to my dog” and the guy TOTALLY freaks out, screaming and yelling that my dog is stupid. He tried lying and said he came home from the hospital and saw my dog hurt, which is a lie because we would have seen him on our second camera walking down the driveway to his house. He straight up lied and tried to fight my boyfriend. My boyfriend is on probation, has been for almost 4 years. He gets off in a month, but he has a perfect probation record (no violations or anything) so he can’t be fighting the neighbor because of this. My landlord basically said she can’t get involved, and because it’s only audio, the evidence we have is “circumstantial”. I really want to make my neighbor pay for what he did to my dog. She is so very sweet, she thinks everyone is her best friend and she doesn’t even bark at people. She looks like a little 20 lb teddy bear. If anybody has any ideas on how I could get my revenge on a piece of shit animal abuser, please let me know because I really would like to get him back.

379,"I know this may sound kind of crazy but I can't help but suspect my best friend of 15 years of stealing from my parents and I'm not sure what to do. Me and my friend have been through A LOT together. He was on vacation with me when his mother died when we were both 11 years old. We went to elementary, middle, highschool, and even some college together. Over the past few years he has gotten addicted to drugs to a point to where he has stolen almost everything that his father had locked in a safe and pawned all of them. Most of which he was never able to get out. Every gift that he gets he will later just sell so he can buy more drugs. Over the past couple of years we have grown apart as I have started attending a college that is over 2 hours away. The only time we really see each other is during the summer. Recently, I have learned that he has broken into businesses, homes and cars and stolen their stuff. Then pawned it all of course. Getting to the point, my parents told me that somebody somehow got into our back yard (which has two large dogs, a German Shepard and a Black Lab) and stole over $600 worth of lawn equipment. The reason I suspect my friend of doing this is because about 2 weeks before the break in he started texting me about how he was parked in front of my house trying to take a nap on his lunch break (keep in mind i live over 2 hours away) and that the dogs keep barking. I asked him why he thought it was a good idea to nap in front of my house and his reasoning was ""He didn't want his boss to see him sleeping on his lunch break"" which sounds weird as hell I know, so I told him that it wasn't a good idea to do that but he responded with, ""I walked up to the gate and the dogs recognized me and they quit barking"" All of that is weird to me but he is known to do stuff like that. In retrospect, I feel that he was actually trying to see if he could get the dogs to trust him so he could come back later and steal our stuff. Am I being paranoid or am I right to suspect him of this? If so, what in the hell do I do.",04Feb2020,1
380,"So pretty much, myself and 2 others have our own bedrooms but share a common area that has a sofa &amp; chair. There's a kitchen down the hall that's for all the suites. The kitchen's often taken at night by parties, and those parties very often leaving it reeking like food, dirty, and just unusable. One roommate usually takes the couch literally ALL evening. I left my laptop on the couch to kind of 'claim' it and came back to her sprawled out on the couch after finishing a quick shower. I cannot study in my room because my desk is super uncomfortable to sit at and my bed = I WILL fall asleep/not study. The library is too noisy, the librarians do not enforce quiet spaces nor care; I need perfect silence to study, literally 1 person whispering from across a room to someone next to them or a loud chime like a phone alert can cause me to lose my focus and take literally over an hour to get re-focused. The only other place that's really adequate is a space that's closed after 5 pm. 

So, I really feel super unable to get ANY work done. I have ADHD, hence the pickiness with study spaces &amp; such. I don't have a psychiatrist, so going very untreated, because all are either outside of my insurance or have ""probably getting license revoked soon"" level of awful reviews. 

How do I either 1. bring up to my roommate that I'd appreciate it if she wouldn't hog the couch all night (literally, yesterday she was on the couch from \~3 pm to 4 am, got take out food and so she really never left the couch) or 2. locate a good study space?",04Feb2020,1
381,"This all started two weeks ago, some weeks my roommate is hateful to me. I’ve tried to ask her what makes her mad and she just says that she doesn’t like me hanging out with our new friends we’ve made in college. All of us hang out together everyday but I have more classes with our new friends and have to go to mandatory events because we are all in Honors. When she feels like Im getting too close to them then she’ll give me the silent treatment and give me dirty looks. She usually waits until after they leave to throw her fit but two weeks ago she started trying to be mean to me in front of them (I guess to see if they would stand up for me?)At the end of the week I noticed that a lot of my stuff (mostly food and tampons lol) went missing. So I told her that from then on we would ask each other for permission before eating each other’s food etc, I feel like I addressed it in a grown up way and didn’t accuse her of anything. I simply said “ hey I noticed some of my stuff is going missing, from now on I think we should keep our stuff separate, etc”..... she blew up on me and cussed me out about how she couldn’t believe that I thought she was a thief. I just sat as she yelled in my face for the next 20 minutes until she stormed out. She has only came back to the room once (while I was in class) to get clothes. We haven’t spoken since when she blew up on me. Except my mom went to her work (grocery store) a few days ago and saw her and my roommate gave her a dirty look. 
Welllll, My friend and I went for a walk on campus this morning and I saw my roommate driving to class, she had to stop to let us walk across the road so we smiled and waved at her. She gave us a dirty look and drove off... our mutual friend just snap chatted me and told me “he’d see me tomorrow.” It kind of sounded like a threat  so now I’m scared he’s gonna do something to me or my room. Im mostly confused because all I said to her is that we need to keep our stuff separate so idk why she’s making it into some huge thing. I think the new friends is a major part in this because I can’t imagine her just being mad over food and tampons. So now idk if my roommate is moving out, and if that’s what he meant then I’m scared they’re gonna take some of my stuff or fart on my pillow. Idk, I’m very conflicted about the whole situation and don’t know what to do, I literally wake up in the morning anxious about if she’s gonna come back. Even I’m confused about what’s going on so any advice will help!",04Feb2020,1

About 6 months ago, another guy, M, started working with us and we all get along really well. He had the same interests as R and I, and is a really nice guy.

Recently though, M, has begun making personal insults about my social life and really insensitive comments. I thought maybe I was just being thin skinned, so I laughed it off. 

Strangely enough, when R isn’t around, M and I get along really well too. As do R and I when M isn’t around. It’s almost as if they’re trying to impress each other, often at my expense.

This afternoon during lunch, they were talking politics (I’ve learned that I probably shouldn’t talk to them about that, because they’re far left liberals and I’m more centrist/libertarian.) They somehow landed on Yasser Arafat and they were discussing his cause of death. 

I mentioned that it was more likely he died of polonium poisoning, since his death was sudden (something multiple credible journalists have suggested.) This was met with “Ok, Alex Jones.” (A common phrase when I present any sort of alternate theory. M, followed it up with “That might be the most absurd theory I’ve ever heard. None of your opinions on politics live anywhere near reality.” 

I spent a few minutes, composed myself then left the table. Later I approached M, and told him that I was tired of his dismissive attitude, and that I thought he was a dick for trying to impress R, by putting my opinions down. He said “Fuck you.”, then walked off.

Trying to figure out if I overreacted here, or if I should just cut my losses and just interact with R, when M isn’t around, since things seem to be much better when he isn’t around.",04Feb2020,1

394,"What do you do when you do your best but life keeps going wroung. Isue after issue keeps poping up and just when there is light at the end of the tunnel you get hit hard.. $12,000 hard. .
This is a story so buckle up.
I want to make things clear. We are a family of 5 with pets. My husband and I do our best to make sure our kids have everything they need and are taken care of even if we don't. But things just never seem to go our way. 
Started when my husband left the army. We are both vets but I got out years before he did. He ended up getting a herniated disc in his back and after fighting it for over a year he said F this and took a quick out on failing tape. Turns out when he got to that unit S1 made a mistake and he was getting paid more then he should have for years. We had no idea as we went from Colorado to Hawaii and knew we where going to get a bump in BAH... Well kiss his severance pay good bye oh yeah we find all this out the last day of clearing and have only hours to make our plane back to the states.
Now we have to make it from Texas to Kansas and find a place to live and jobs on 3 grand. Not easy but we do it. Becuase of this we end up under the local slum lord. House is a duplex, not in great shape, dirty, but it's 4 walls and a roof. Not surprised when his handy man dose not fix even half of what needed fixed and takes a fight and a half to get anything done. Hell the external ac cought fire and we had a trash bag taped there til we moved over a year later.
At some point we gave up fighting. 
Among these issues some troblesome ones arose that we never put them together. There was a bad smell no mater how much I cleaned. Odd stains on the walls that kept coming back. Then there was a roach problem that even bug bombs wouldn't fix. Then we kept getting sick and never got better. Months and a slow bleed of finances started. Pay checks where spent before we got them dealing with issue after issue but we took each day at a time till a knock on the door changed it.
It was the lady living in the other half. She had been fighting with our slum lord for months over the smell and other issues we had also been having and finally hired someone out of her own pocket to take a look. His findings? A sewer leak under the house and remember those stains I could never get rid of? Black mold.
Land lord wouldn't answer or return our calls or texts. Other then the one to confirm payment that 1st. So we sliped a 30 day under his office door after several more attempts to contact and moved out.
For a while things were okay with our new landlord. He waved our deposit if we helped cleaned out the old tenets stuff as they hadn't paid in 3 months. It sat in the garage and basement for another 3 months til he found a place to store by our request.
All was good... Til he died... Of a heart attack...
Our house was turned over to an estate to be sold. We even tried to buy it but bank said no... We don't have or use credit cards. Our only credit? A car we paid off years ago. So what ever... They said we could stay til the house sells and we then work it out with the new owners. But the house never sold and so we found ourselfs with a 30 gtfo notice.  The old landlord's duaghter even told us it was to ""make the house more sellable."" So bit of legal issues later both sides deside we just want to walk away (they wanted to peg us for cleaning and repair fees but after they found out they would be accountable for moving fees and more since they had no reason to make us move it became a do either of us want to deal with this? No ? Fine, lets move on.(still hasn't sold half a year later btw).
Now we find a place by some how that has enough bedrooms (on paper atleast), takes pets, and is willing to work with us on paying off deposite and pets fees. It 300 more a month then we were paying for half the space but you deal.
Then it started... The curse of the small things... The new house is mosquito cursed... My eldest suffers the most of it yet wont do anything about it. He was 12 when it started and would not use bug spray unless dad or I stood there and made him. But he would scratch... Gave him cream after cream but he refused to use them. Why do I menchen this? CPS.
In the end they found no negect but it ment dad or i 3 times a day stiping him, cleaning, creaming, spraying etc a now 13 year old. Why? Becuase he just didn't want to.
Anyway the bad luck(?) goes on. Microwave dies... Get new one... That one dies... My dad has a spare he give us... Also dies... 2 coffee pots... RIP... 2end one was one that you use on the stove top but where you put the grounds got stuck and the handle snapped... Speaking of stove issues our stove is down to 1 burner and the warranty went out last year...
Then the mother for the van window went crazy (its curently wedged in place) then we needed a new tire becuase a two inch cunk of metal got wedged in it... The list.. It gose on and on and on... Vet and medical bills. Schools requiring more and more for this and that. I had to sell the last of my good jewelry, family pieces I got when my grandmother passed to buy school supplies and pay tec fees.
We live pay check to pay check.
We don't drink much he gets a 6 pack ecah pay check every 2 weeks... Maybe. We don't smoke. No drugs. Ne expensive drinks or coffees. We dont eat out sept maybe 1 or twice a month. We buy store brand, price check and deal hunt. Things are tight but we deal, pay bills and treat the boys to pizza if we can. We dont complain. Life is hard and it sucks.
I hear you askinh what about all that money you talked about at the start I hear you say? I am getting there. We just did taxes aka our yearly God sent. Where we can pay off any rouge bills and catch up and this year our only major purchase to be a new stove and all other issuse small we thought we could at last have something to put aside for the first time in years then it hit...
Remember the slum lord we first moved in to? Apparently he sued us for God only know what. We never knew until we got a letter saying we need to show up to court with all our tax and wage info for the last 4 years. Apparently his lawyer posted a notice on our last address after we moved out and that was good enough. We had no idea. So now we owe 12k to a guy and didn't get a notice to apear in court or on the ruling.
Trying to find a lawyer 0 for 3 right now
1st has too many cases to take on another
2end works for skym lord so it a conflict of intrust
3erd has eye surgery next week and we are due in court on the 19th.
Waiting to hear back on a 4th but...
But its too much...
I try and roll with the punches... But its one thing after another... Fix one to face two more... The stress of not making enough but yet according to the state 20k a year is too much. Yeah... Our taxable income last year was 19k.... And now we somehow have to pay slum lord 12k?
I just don't know...
I just can't...
Please... Someone. Anyone. What do I do?",04Feb2020,1
396,"It all started one day when a guy showed up to her front door with a rake. He was begging her to pay him to do her leaves. She declined. He kept begging and she said no. 

Maybe 3 days later, he returns. He asks for a ride to a neighboring town. She says no. 

She talked to some neighbors who said they thought he lived a few houses over. 

Last week he knocked on the door, letting us know a box was on the porch. She said I know. He asks about her holiday. (This is when he started getting more personal). She said they were good. He said he was in jail for the holidays. 

I’ve never seen the guy, but my mom calls him a “kid”. I’m guessing early 20’s. She originally thought he was a teen, but he would’ve been in Juvenile detention, not jail, if he was under 18. 

So anyway today he knocked on her door and asked for $5 to go to the convenience store next door because he was hungry. She said no. (She doesn’t want to give him anything because then he’ll REALLY keep coming, more than once every week or two.) So then he was just making small talk. He asked if that was her car, she said no it’s my daughters car. He’s like “oh that’s cool you guys both drive it or something?” She said sometimes. He made a comment about living in our county’s homeless shelter type thing. My mom is under the impression it’s for young boys who are homeless, not adults. So he’s looking for a job and lives there (which is about 15-20 minutes away from her house). 

So he’s freaking riding a bus down to my town, and always finding his way on her door step? What do we do? Call the cops? 

Trust me, I know she shouldn’t have answered the door. She thought he was a neighbor the first time. She thinks she should stop answering from now on, which I agree. But then maybe he’ll assume no one is home and try to rob her, which could escalate? 

I’m literally worried sick about a 60 year old woman that lives by herself with a little yapper dog who won’t do anything to an intruder. Hopefully someone has had an experience similar to this, and can offer some sound advice. 

TL;DR Random (kind of) homeless guy keeps knocking on my mom’s door, asking for favors or just trying to talk to her. What the hell do we do?",04Feb2020,1
397,"As someone who has difficulty with empathy and emotion in general... I wonder what the norm is.  What I consider to be love is something that is constantly fleeting for me.  I have to dig for that feeling, and even when I consciously do I'm not always successful at finding it.  In my day to day it never comes to me on its own.  And when I do feel it, it is overwhelming and joyful and I want to hold onto it and share it all at once.  So what is normal.  When men say it to their SOs, is it rooted in logic or in emotion?  I can list logical reasons why I love my wife, but it seems redundant when (what I interpret as) love is not based on logic.

And though I've been told I'm loved, and though I know that some people have felt love for me, is there something beyond that... can you \*feel\* being loved?  Or is the feeling of love itself something that factors both love for \*and\* from others.",04Feb2020,1
398,"LENGTHY POST

Yeah ik everyone told me I was making a mistake from the start (mother, sister, best friend of 6 years and his gf). She was my first girlfriend ever around sophomore/junior year of high school. 1 year prior to us hooking up she had a one night stand with her best friend (m) and she told him they should stay as friends and nothing more. They both agreed to it afterwards. I came in the picture and they still still talk to this day even with us being back together for 5 months. I shouldn’t have ignored what I felt was a red flag honestly . A little bit more background info about me; I was diagnosed with CF (Cystic Fibrosis) around 2003 at 4 1/2 - 5 yrs and it’s progressed to the point of me just not being able to get more than a part time job because of the time all of my medical treatments from machines take do to multiple times daily and from multiple hospitals visits that last for weeks at a time (minimum 2 weeks per hospitalization) on a good year. I turned 21 this past December and am unable to be living on my own without assistance from family and government aid and such. With that bit being said I try to take my girlfriend out to places and buy her clothes when I have money saved BUT her “best friend “ takes her to movies, amusement park rides, out to eat AND buys her stuff and recently she told me that he admitted to still having a crush on her even after knowing I’m in a relationship with her again. She says she would never cheat on me but the thing that makes me question that is she admitted that she did cheat on someone else and said she was justified in doing so ( won’t say what happened to her with that previous relationship apart from that guy was an absolute d!ck to her). She has gotten upset at me for not paying attention to my phone to see if she texts me on multiple occasions. I’m not going to bs I do play video games daily all day because it’s how I’ve always dealt with my depression since I was about 7. I always have my headset on playing with friends and first chance I get I answer her text between rounds or after a game. On multiple occasions that she’s been at my house she has very clearly said without any sort of hesitation that people that play video games are fucking losers and need to get a life and not live with their parents making me feel stupid and worthless and like a nobody just like in school. One time we were planning on going out but I had been using my oxygen during the day due to poor weather conditions instead of usually just when I sleep and when I said I was bringing my oxygen tank with me she literally said looking in my eyes in front of my face in her car in front of my house “ew wtf hell now I’m not gonna be seen like that never mind we’re not going anywhere anymore “ I cried myself to sleep that night while that same night she went either to her best friends house or drinking i can’t recall. I felt replaceable, unwanted and ashamed like an outcast like in school all over again. On multiple occasions when we were in my room cuddling and stuff she’d take pictures of us together, caption it “controls him” and says they were cute and wanted to show her friends or post it on IG. She has gone to other guys for attention when i fail to respond quickly enough and has said that at least other people love her. Whenever either her or her best friend are upset (depressed, stressed or angry) they go to each other every time without fail. They have gotten upset at each other a couple of times but the longest they stopped talking was slightly over a month but immediately start talking afterwards. His parents have told her that the two of them are basically a couple and should just get married. He always gets jealous when he asks what she’s doing or what she plans on doing later and says she with me or is planning on being with me ( that was one of their fights btw). She has apparently being feeling weird for the lack of a better word but she says nausea and in general upset stomach and he immediately thought that she was pregnant, got upset and took her to the store and bought her a pregnancy test for her to use. She is supposedly unable to have children and I’m infertile. On top of all of this my parents have literally spit up this week after +20 years of marriage so I’m stressing and depressed more than my usual amount. I’ve only left the house to enjoy myself I think twice since my parents splitting up. On the night of my parents arguing , I told her to stay home and to not see me because shit was going to with my parents , not because I’m like her ex or my dad ( last generation man dictates all decisions in the household and his word is law without anyone to question it and women should only kiss ass and serve men once in marriage) and I didn’t want her getting involved unnecessarily for our and her sake. She told me that I can’t tell her what she can and can’t do and she’ll do what she feels like and it isn’t her fault my family was in a “crisis” as she said. I’ve been genuinely pissed off at her since that night and only texted her about 2-3 times total these past 6 days. I’m honestly thinking about braking up with her again but since she was my first ever girlfriend I’m second guessing myself.....",04Feb2020,1

I’m already well aware I don’t care enough to try to force myself to go to school so I atleast want to do something that I’m interested in that can help with my future.

(No I’m not gonna go to therapy or anything like that so I’d prefer it if people stopped telling me to dothat).  
I don’t work very well with teachers or people for that matter and get in trouble for not listening in classes like maths English and music,

402,"So it was really difficult for me to compress all of this into a TL;DR because there are so many twists and turns, but I did my best in the title...anyway, here's the situation I'm in, some of which is NSFW so please be advised:

From June of 2018 until December of 2019, I dated a lovely girl. Now, I'm going to call her ""Person A"" from here on out so as to increase clarity, despite that obviously not being her real name. But you know, privacy and all that. Anyway, breaking up with her really fucking sucked. I mean, I suppose it always sucks making a conscious decision to destroy somebody you love, then watch it happen in real time right before your eyes. That being said, I am 100% certain that I made the right decision, as there were differences between us that could not be reconciled. I originally wrote out the main ones in great detail, but it was simply too long, so I decided to cut it for convenience's sake.

So, long story short, these divides between us resulted in far too many unnecessary fighting and tears, and when that's happening as regularly as it was for us, you know that the relationship is past the point of no return. Which was a shitty thing to have to realize, because I do love Person A. She's a wonderful person, and I honestly have nothing bad to say about her. But I'm pushing 30, and I'm not getting any younger...it was time for me to start asking myself some questions. Unfortunately, once I was able to answer those questions honestly, that was curtains for my relationship with Person A. So, I drove down to her place at the end of 2019 and I called things off. I can say with utmost certainty that that day will live on in my memory as one of the absolute worst, most heartbreaking days of my life.

FAST FORWARD TO 2020, and enter another girl, whom I'll call ""Person J"" just for the sake of anonymity. I've known Person J longer than I've known Person A, and despite us both being in relationships when we met, there was always this sort of ""energy"" between us. I don't know if I would call it ""sexual tension,"" per se, because it was far less about climbing on top of one another and more of a ""this is literally the perfect person for me and there's nothing either of us can do about it"" type of energy. Unfortunately for us, our timing was always awful. So, when I was single, Person J had a boyfriend. When Person J was single, I had a girlfriend. The only brief period during which both of us were single and able to see each other fairly regularly was about a week removed from the end of her last relationship, so it was too soon for her to jump into something new...but we still knew.

So, this past weekend, I invited Person J to brunch to catch up...and yes, I do mean *just* to catch up. No ulterior motives, no expectations, hell, I didn't even bring a condom ""just in case"". Because there was no ""just in case"" - this was just two friends meeting up to chat over some Peach Bellinis and Eggs Benedict. And that's precisely what it ended up being; we sat in this adorable, contemporary brunch joint in the city and talked about everything under the sun. Then, we made a spontaneous visit to a local bookstore/bar, where we got a couple cups of tea, continued our conversations, and admired their wealth of feminist/anti-fascist literature. It really was the most perfect day that two friends could ask for.

...but at the end of the day, we could no longer ignore our conspicuous chemistry.

We've known since the moment we met that we were meant to be; it was only a matter of when. I mean, she's literally everything I have ever wanted in a partner - she is brilliant, she is kindhearted, she is empathetic, she is deeply passionate, she is strong, she is forthcoming, she is someone I could talk to all day and never want to stop, she is immensely talented, she makes me laugh, she never fails to make me feel better when I'm down, she is on my side of the political spectrum, and to top all of this off...she is one of the most drop-dead beautiful human beings I have ever seen. She's got this huge, ovoid pair of hazel eyes that glow like pools of honey. Whenever she's happy, they sparkle and shine like freshly-fallen snow. She has a flawless, gleaming smile that could set aglow a nameless street at midnight. Her voluminous brown hair cascades down to her shoulders like a slow-yet-inexorable stream of waves lightly caressing the shoreline. Her cute little nose is stippled with freckles that adorn her face like a pointillist's masterpiece. She's just...I can't even. Like, I'm sorry I just waxed poetic just then, but I couldn't help myself...she's so breathtaking. And I want her. I guess I always have, deep down. And after this weekend, I can fairly confidently say that she feels, and has felt, the exact same way for me.

...but there's a bit of a problem with all of this.

See, Person J became friends with Person A while we were dating. Of course, both of these women could make friends with a tree stump, so it made sense that they would hit it off. While they're not ""besties"" by any stretch, they certainly do confide in one another. And Person J has actually helped Person A quite a bit with much of the post-breakup feelings, seeing as I was Person A's first truly-serious boyfriend. I was the first person she dated for more than a few months, I was the first person that she ever had sex with...our relationship was heavy shit. And I loved her with all my heart, and she loved me right back. So naturally, our end was particularly devastating for her. Hence, she reaches out to Person J, because Person J has had more experience with relationships and is adept at knowing exactly what to say and when.

Now, of course, I've got absolutely no problem with them being friendly at all. I have mentioned before that I hold no ill will towards Person A, and I mean that. What I do have a problem with, however, is that she apparently told Person J that she ""knows about our history"" and actively discouraged her from dating me. Not because she's built me up as some sort of anime super-villain or whatever; just because it would hurt her feelings if we got together.

Okay, so...I get why she's saying this right now. The wound is still very fresh, so it would suck like crazy if she saw me with somebody else (especially a mutual friend) just over a month later. Hell, I realistically probably wouldn't do anything about this right now for that very reason. But...am I a dick for thinking that this is kind of unfair? In other words, am I wrong for feeling as if Person A is intimidating me into not moving on? mean, I didn't break up with Person A because I wanted to be with somebody else in particular. And yes, this includes Person J, who I basically just wrote a fucking Robert Frost novel about earlier...I broke up with Person A because we simply were not going to last in the long run. That, of course, is not a knock on either of our characters; it was just two people who got together and ended up being a long-term mismatch. It happens.

But why, now, after we've broken up, does she get to decide who I'm allowed to date? Does this disqualify *everybody* that we know mutually from ever dating me? Perhaps most important, though, is this question - is there *ever* going to be a ""right time"" for me to date somebody else? Because I've got a sneaking suspicion that it won't matter if I start dating Person J tomorrow, or somebody else (whether we know her or not) in eight months, or if I move to an entirely new state and find someone over there two years from now...I'm going to catch flak for it. And that's not fair, is it?

Look, you don't need to answer those questions, Reddit - all I am looking for is any sort of guidance here. What do I do from here? Do I continue to spend time with Person J and see where it takes us some day? Do I spill my guts to Person J again? Do I reach out to Person A, whom I haven't said a word to since the day we broke up, and earnestly tell her how I feel about what she's telling people? Do I shut myself off from dating? Do I date other people? Seriously...where the hell do I go from here?

Thank you in advance. I'm sorry that my writing is so long-winded.",04Feb2020,1
404," Sorry if this is the wrong sub in advance.

After some inward reflection, I have decided to put myself out there a little more. Let me preface this by saying I am very inexperienced with anything dating related in general, as you will probably notice. In doing so, I saw a customer (I work in retail) I have interacted with for months seemed to be really interested me. She asked me if I had a girlfriend. My age. Various other constant questions. Continually hanging around me in my personal space. She even tried to initiate physical contact on several occasions.

I finally worked up the balls to ask for her number. I initiated texting, and it seemed to be going, ok? In the beginning. Yet now, she has ghosted me for 4 days. Is there any coming back from something like this? Is it even worth it? Was she just not as interested as I initially thought? Or did she just lose interest due to my texting. I think I might have come on to strong or needy? Am I overthinking this?

If I screwed up, this is fine, as I now realize that this is the only way I am going to learn. Especially now that I am open to learning. I want to learn about what I did wrong. Here are exactly what I sent and her responses. Any and all feedback is welcome. Thank you!

Me (Thurs) 7:57 P.M.: Hey xxxxxxx, It's xxxx. Here's a text so you have my number too. Try not to blow me up to much cause then people will get suspicious.

Her(Thurs) 9:07 P.M.: Lol you got jokes i see

405,"Hello, so I've been planning on moving away from my home town to go to college for 2 years now and I'm getting pretty close to finally being able to do it. My problem is that I'm still not entirely sure what I should do. I stayed an extra year in my hometown to upgrade some courses so I would be able to go for a Bachelor's degree in Business. But I recently found out already that I have the courses required to get a diploma in Digital Media and IT: Business Analyst and once I complete that I can go for a Bachelor's Degree in Technology.

I have an interest in both routes but I already started upgrading and I hate it. I've also been telling everyone I know that I'm getting a Bachelor's degree in Business and I would feel weird if I just switched out of nowhere and didn't follow through on what I was saying. Plus I already started the process of receiving funding in which I would have to tell them if I can switch. Am I just prideful? Should I just make the switch to make it less stressful for me?

We have drank a lot before but never seen her drunk, let alone drunk to be grinding on a middle aged man and letting another co worker smack her ass that she said she didn’t remember. This behavior is concerning. I could never see her doing this. 

She immediately told me the day after of her getting drunk that all this happened. I respect the fact she told me what happened and her being honest and upfront with me. I didn’t take it well. I didn’t really say anything but she could tell it made me upset. She got defensive over the fact I was upset about her grinding with someone that we both were friends with. She said that she was showing platonic love and some people took advantage of that. After I briefly expressed my concerns about the situation we ended the phone call. She called back several hours later being very remorseful and sorry she acted the way she did. Talking about how other people saw what she did and how it reflects on our relationship. I was just trying to be there for her and lift her mood, “ babe I trust you, don’t worry it was just having too many drinks” we both were happy and moved on even though it still pained me what she did. She also told me she wouldn’t be getting drunk over there anymore due to the fact coworkers were feeding her drinks and rumors of them trying to get with her. It’s shocking because I know these guys and considered them my friends. I get all of my info from her. I trust her word because she has never let me down or lied to me. We agreed we wouldn’t talk about the situation until she returned (2 weeks from now)

About a week and half later she called and everything sounded good. ( we talked several times in between, having wholesome conversations) work was going well etc. but then she said she was getting drunk if she had the day off. I just replied “oh” and she started to get upset me. “ oh? That’s it?” I replied “ just drink responsibly” she took that not so well “ your not my parent I’ll drink if I want to”. I mentioned that fact she didn’t remember a guy slapping her butt when she was drunk last and that only made things worse. She said she didn’t want to talk about it only because it was upsetting each other. 

At this point I’m very concerned. I’m dealing with other stressful life shit and on top of it I have to worry about what’s going on in another country. I don’t believe at all she would cheat on me but I do also have a fear she would do something on the border of cheating and then turn it around on me saying I don’t trust her and it’s my personal issues surfacing.

412,"Last year I picked up Japanese classes at school after dropping the subject in my first year. I'm now in my final year of school and I've been paying off this trip to Japan which is supposed to happen later this year but I don't think it's a good idea for me to go. I wanted to get better at Japanese and learn the language but jumping into a higher level class than I probably should have been in made it difficult for me to get on the same level as everyone else last year and I ended up barely passing 2/5 assessments. Since I committed myself to go on the trip last year I had to take Japanese again this year but I'm worried I'm going to fall even more behind and it's one of the only reasons I came back to school this year (I've thought about dropping out to take a course). I'm extremely nervous to go on this trip because I can't come up with even a sentence of Japanese and my teachers have really high expectations and feel ashamed of how poor my skills are. I want to pull out of the trip but if I did the teachers would be dissapointed and it would mean the cost of the trip would be more expensive for everyone else that plans on going (since we have to help fund the teachers to come because the school doesn't pay for them). It would also mean I wouldn't get a full refund of all the money I've deposited &amp; since my parents very generously helped cover half of the cost as well as helping me with all the fundraising I did I feel like they would also be mad/dissapointed because I would've wasted their time and money. I feel completely useless and I don't know what to do. I still really want to go on the trip and I know that Japan isn't too bad to travel to with no language knowledge but because it's a school trip we will be doing a homestay and also visiting a Japanese school, we have to give a speech in front of the whole school as well. I'm really lost and any help is really appreciated. I'm not having a good time rn

Tldr: committed to going on a trip to Japan but I can't speak Japanese &amp; I will be placed in situations where I need to speak it. Pulling out of the trip means losing at least $1k and making the trip more expensive for everyone else as well as disappointing family/teachers. Going on the trip means embarrassing myself and teachers and having to spend lots of money.",04Feb2020,1
413,"Ok brief backstory, my mum and dad have been married 25 years, and hes been constantly abusing her, physically and mentally, would beat up my brother who had meningitis and because he wasn't ""normal"" he thought that he wasn't his child. He would verbally abuse me and my sister too, all while being an alcoholic by the way, he would come home every night getting drunk on cider and when he runs out he would command my mum to go get some more and keep belittling her. She cooks food he doesn't like? She HAS to go cook something he likes or he will ""starve to death and he is the only one here working"". I started feeling like crap all the time and started harming my self, smoking, drinking, (attempting suicide which they never knew about) because tbh I just couldn't take it anymore. I even had a social worker bc of the s-h I was doing and everyone was worried about that.

&amp;#x200B;

So about 6 months ago over the summer holidays, my mum couldn't take it anymore and she went to move in with her mum for a bit, who was just across the road. Thing's got worse, he started drinking vodka now, and me being a 15 year old drinker now I stole a bottle of him and I kept stealing wine from my nans because this miracle drink seemed to solve everything, right?

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually I came home one night at half 9pm (but apparently as a 15 year old it's too dangerous past 8pm) and he was drunk ofc and got angry at me, I was drinking a glass of milk and he burnt my hand with his cig and took it off me. I was crying and ran to my room, and eventually when my social worker came I told her what happened and I had to go live with my mum for the time being. (sorry this is long story) So I was at my nans now, drinking their wine all the time, feeling like shit about my self. Keep in mind I had a girl-friend through this who was also s-h and I never realised that she made it worse. He kept showing up to my nans, throwing bags of my mums stuff there which he wasn't allowed to, because at this time my mum got a court order saying he couldn't touch her stuff, and he needed to leave in 2 weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

So he did leave, me and my mum moved back in with my sister, and for a month we lived happier, my mental health improved by a fuck tonne, school started and I was happy, then after that month, my mum randomly said ""dad is coming back to live with us"". Out of nowhere. No discussion, just ""dad can't stay at (friends house) because he was taking his money for drugs, he's staying here for a few days until he can find a place"". Okay. Few days. Few days turned to a few months, he would still come home drunk about once a week. She even found a bottle of vodka but he was saying it's for his ""bleeding gums"" (he doesn't even brush his teeth so no wonder why) and it was so obvious that he would be coming home drunk. One time I did an alcohol test on him, and surprise surprise, alcohol! So I didn't wanna be there so I ran away to my friends house, but I couldn't stay there so had to come home to my dad who'd wrecked the christmas tree, threw peoples cards away which had money, and was just an asshole. My mum told me he would be out straight after christmas, then christmas came, ""just 2 more weeks and he's out, or if I find out he's been drinking I'm kicking him out"" It's been way longer than 2 weeks, he's admitted to drinking and nothing has been doing.

&amp;#x200B;

So what should I do? I want to tell my social worker because I don't want to be here anymore but then my mum will be in serious trouble and everyone will hate me, so I should just endure the pain or just try and stop it because I don't know how long i can hold on like this for :(",04Feb2020,1

I was offered a manager position at a different shop. I was told during the interview the shop hours were the same as ours and the main thing he needed from me was inventory. I thought no problem I been doing a shit ton of inventory here already so why not do it somewhere money doesn't just go missing.

Fast forward to yesterday. This place is awful. Its the most disgusting coffee shop I think I've ever been in. Everything I learned not to do during my first barista job they do. They don't properly steam milk. They pre-grind all of the espresso for the day at once. They don't wipe the portafilters before putting grinds in them. The espresso hopper has so much oil build up in it that the beans stick to it. Same with the grinders for the batch brew coffee. 

The employees seemed nice until they basically started bragging about how they haven't been able to keep a manager. They've had 5 managers in the last 3 years. Most of the employees have been here for 4+ years. And on top of all that I was told that I am only going to be scheduled 35hr tops a week. There's no way I can pay my bills on that without getting a second job.

Im at a total loss. I was so excited to start this new job and I literally cried on my way home because it was so awful.

435,"A long back story

Flash back to my post divorce lifestyle in the Navy. I'm half devastated and half ecstatic with my new found ""freedom"". I meet a girl who was way WAY out of my league and things take off. We talk, text, hangout and drink with one another on a consistent basis and we both see what this is slowly turning into. We say screw it and dive into things headfirst. It's good for the better part of a year and then it happens... The fight. Relationship apocalypse. Things go bad really really fast. At the same time, my service contract with the Navy ends and I go home with the assumption this thing between me and her is done and eventually I get over it. Took me a long time to see she was the problem and some problems I can't fix. Like I said... nasty breakup.
Three months after I get home, I get a Facebook message and request from a girl back in NC who I had a very small fling with but never pursued because of her ""career"". I become interested in her and we talk more and more each day. We make plans to start meeting up, going on vacations, and traveling back and forth. Keep in mind, this was a very small fling back when I met her so I didn't know much about her. But some of the things that would happen just didn't make sense. Her voice always sounded forced but I completely forgot what her voice originally sounded like so I wrote it off. She wouldn't add me on social media to video chat, had constant problems with Skype, and always had something come up that ruined our plans. Then I started noticing other shit. Every picture she would send me were ones she uploaded to Instagram and Facebook. She had just entered a life of sobriety and was making strides to handle her emotional stuff as well (depression, suicide, and risky sexual encounters) so I was always worried about her relapsing. Eventually I called her out on it thinking she was dating someone there or even married. Just like I feared, our fight sent her into a nosedive. I back peddled hard as damage control and eventually we were good again. But it always stuck with me. That was until I get a message from a friend still in NC saying she was arrested on some pretty serious charges the previous night. Obviously I had no way of contacting her since it was very unlikely she would post bail with the charges she had. That was until she texted me. Alarms started going off and I decided to bait her. I asked how her weekend was and what she was up to. I get a long story about her weekend with her family and how she was sitting at home with her sister watching Netflix. I went to the north Carolina court system website and found the police report, took a screen shot, marked out important info, and sent it to her. An hour later, I get a 14 part message explaining everything. The entire time, it was the girl at the beginning of this post. She said she took measures to hide her voice so I would have a hard time catching on. Then I asked why she chose to impersonate THAT girl. Like something right out of a movie, she admitted to stalking me after our breakup and followed us when wne and the second girl went out on our first couple of dates. After everything was said and done, I cut ties completely. Blocked her number, every profile I could find online including her family.
Three days later, I wake up to my phone going ape shit at 2am. 39 friend requests, 22 messages all from different numbers, and 50+DMs across Instagram, twitter, and snap chat all saying something along the lines ""please talk to me. I think I fucked up"" and ""I need you to listen"". As soon as I would delete and block everything, I'd have new ones withing an hour. Eventually this turned into voicemail that in all honesty, I was scared to listen to. And now for the last week, I have had strange viewers in my stream chat sending blank messages or ones with just ""... "" in them. I'm honestly at my wits end trying to figure out what to do.

I don’t want to become passive aggressive or petty with this friend (and I don’t actually want the friendship to end) but it’s becoming increasingly difficult not to act like that - e.g next time they message about meeting up I just want to ignore them because that’s what they’ve done to me.

447,"So, my best friend and I attend the same uni. We used to be internet best friend, because we lived like 12 hours away from each other. Then it all changed once we realised we wanted to attend not only the same classes, but also in the same city.

That sounds perfect right? I was so excited and I couldn't believe this was happening to me. So naturally we started talking about moving in together and becoming roommates. 

Fast forward to five months later, everything is fine and we still hang out literally every day and I consider myself very lucky to have him in my life.
Unfortunately his parents are still unwilling to let him get a house with me because he has family in this city, so he is currently living with his relative. In the mean time, I rented a very small studio apartment on my own, but that was originally supposed to be for a few months, maybe a year. The plan was to wait for his parents to change their minds about me and about the whole moving in situation.

A few days ago he said that he had made a list of reasons why being roommates wouldn't work for us so of course this lead to a more serious discussion where he said that after actually moving to this city and getting adjusted to this new reality, he feels that he needs his own space. He says that he would still prefer me if he had to have a roommate, but that he would rather live on his own.
He says he needs to be lonely from time to time. I understand that 100%, but that broke my heart.
Also, I moved in with my cat and he says he loves my cat but that he is not ready to actually live with a pet. Moving in with me would mean he would get the whole package, so also my kitty.

First of all being roommates doesn't mean we would have to share everything. He could still have his space I think. 
Second, my apartment now is kinda expensive, so I was hoping for us to start looking for a new house soon, but now I don't have that possibility anymore. 

I have told him that he broke my heart and although he feels sorry, we both agree that he shouldn't force himself to do something if he doesn't want to.
But now I can't even look at him without getting sad, he really hurt me and I don't know what to do. 

He knows how much he hurt me, so there's no point in telling him over and over again, but this changed things between us. I just wanna be able to have a good time with him like I used to without the constant reminder that he let me down big time",04Feb2020,1

He’s the type of person that’s a really fun guy, nice, outgoing and handsome. I’m a gay woman and I’ve always been open about this. But a couple of months ago he broke some boundaries and touched me inappropriately while I was drunk and half asleep. He had a girlfriend at the time who was in the next room. I told her a few days later and she defended him. I stopped talking to him for a while but he came back into my life. He’s a really nice guy otherwise so it didn’t bother me. 

But his girlfriend broke up with him recently and I’m thinking that it’s weird that I’m trying to be there for him when he said he didn’t remember touching me inappropriately. And didn’t take responsibility. He was also a shit boyfriend. Constantly partying and waking up in girls beds.

449,"Hey Users,

If this is important for the legal situation: all of this takes place in Germany. Two years ago, my grandmother died and left my grandfather behind alone. Shortly afterwards, a woman (let's call her abuser) came into the scene, going to his house every week, cleaning and cooking for him for a little money. We didn't think any wrong of it, as it seemed to be good for him. 

A few months ago, we (actually my mother and two aunts, grandfathers daughters) started worrying a little. Abuser apparently got a new smartphone, an expensive trip to another country and \~2000€ gifted by grandfather. Grandfather is very stubborn and he doesn't understand that he is being used by abuser, thus keeps telling his daughters to mind their own business. Now the whole situation escalated. One of my uncles confronted abuser about what she's doing and told her to go to grandfather and tell him about it (she pretty much admitted to my uncle what she's doing). Instead, she called grandfather several times (on of my aunts was at grandfathers home at the time, so abuser called until grandfather answered the phone) and told him that his daughters and everybody else wants to harm him and that she is the only one he should believe and the only one that wants to do good for him. Well, apparently grandfather believed her, and (obviously) my mother and aunts are very hurt now and don't know what to do anymore. 

I hope that I can get some answers and somehow help my parents, aunts and whole family in this situation...we all feel very helpless right now and don't know what to do. So thanks for any advice!

457,"Never is maybe a big word, but I'm fairly confident we'll not see each other in the coming few years. What happened is that I did an exchange at my school, met someone from my group who I hit it off with particularly well, but who I had to say goodbye to because they had to go home again, basically back to the other side of the world. We admitted we had a crush on each other after we said goodbye and although that felt great, there's no way I can see myself act upon those feelings. I've never been in a relationship before and I don't think I want it in this form. That said though, this alone doesn't really mean you have to cut off contact right? It's just hard both ways around. Just texting reminds me of all the things that could have been but can never be now, but it also makes me feel good because I have a friend who I can care about and who cares about me (not a very common resource in my life).

Is there any point in continuing to try to talk to him? He's so accomplished, and handsome, and has some habits I find really adorable (he reads the news from an actual newspaper! Like our ancestors did).

I notice  I don't act like myself around him, though. All that composed, open, confident part of me is out the window. And I'm a little more sarcastic than I need to be, and I think I know why (from therapy): if I'm more sarcastic, I get to skip all the steps to real intimacy.

I am thinking now to go apologize for picking on him for the newspaper thing. Not to grovel for forgiveness, but kinda apologize for dragging it out by calling the habit quaint and then having him feel like he had to explain himself (which he did - that whole exchange felt so forced and awkward to me).

And then... I don't know what to do. I'm so attracted to him, and I drawn to his personality, and I don't know what to do. I've always had an issue with guys I like too much: the only time it worked out was when he and I were friends for a while, and all these feelings blossomed from there.

Otherwise, every time I've dated a guy or been in a relationship, it's been with guys I didn't like too much before the first date. I can't always only be calm and collected and loving when I don't find the guy too attractive or he makes the first move. I want to be in control of feelings, or at least work with them. Right now, I feel like I like my coworker, and I want to go out with him. Why am I unable to make that happen?

460,"Hi I'm a 20M in his third year of a four year maths masters course in a university in the UK. In school I absolutely loved maths did it for A-Level along with an AS in further maths got top grades in everything so logically I went on to choose it at university as I didn't know what I wanted to do as a career but knew I loved maths. First year went fine experienced uni a bit in terms of drinking and partying made some new friends outside my course but none on my course apart from one guy who I'm still friends with to this day. Exams went fine nothing to brag about but got better than a passing grade in everything and had nothing to worry about. 

Then second year hit and a close family member became very ill very quickly and died in December so I never really went in to university unless I absolutely had to for the first half of the year. Then after I was overcome by grief lost all my new friends from the other courses and got myself in a job working overnights in a supermarket so I could be there during the days when my family member was sick that I absolutely despised but had to do for money. I importantly also was not attending university apart from compulsory classes and tests. I felt pretty low and assumed that all this was the cause for it. So after the uni year (I barely passed everything this time and dont know how I didn't have to repeat any modules but it sorted itself out) I took actions and got over my old friends and found new ways to spend my time, time eased the griefing process and I eventually changed jobs within the same company and now actually enjoy working. I felt great for a few months and even eventually found a girlfriend who is amazing and wonderful and really has brightened up my world in every way imaginable. Also during this period had a few other small victories in life like becoming an uncle again to 2 twin girls who I see all the time and they brighten up my world too as well as buying myself a new car using money my family member left me in her will.

The problems came again when I started taking uni seriously again recently, this is the first time in over a year I've been to every class and am actually doing work above and beyond what is necessary and I absolutely despise it. This became especially apparent to me when recently my girlfriend became an aunt and after I went and delivered gifts to the baby went in late to uni and instantly felt my mood drop and for the rest of the day I was just a downbeat mess so much so that when I went home I just broke down in front of my mum which isnt normal for me I'm a person who can normally keep his emotions in check and find pretty healthy releases. From there I reflected on my life and realised that literally the only thing I have in my life causing any unhappiness routinely is university I hate my modules, I find it boring and I have no friends in the class to help me(apart from the one mentioned earlier. I find even that sitting to do the most simple task taxes me very heavily mentally and will drain my mood to the point of me getting headaches after sitting for long periods of time doing this work. 

Can anyone give me some advice on perhaps ways to improve my mental state while working or perhaps offer other solutions. I'm happy to provide any more context necessary. Thanks in advance for your help.",04Feb2020,1

We have been texting almost daily for 2 months and we were finally gonna see each other again this weekend because she was coming to Denmark for 10 days.

In this weekend we were with a lot of the other friends and time went by very fast. I wasnt sure if she had the same kind of feelings for me as i had for her. Therefore i wanted to find out in this weekend and eventually tell her how i felt. However one of her friends found out about how i felt and told me that she could talk to her and indirectly find out if she had any feelings for me. Unfortunately i was told by her friend that she didnt exactly feel the same way, and that i was a bit too silent of a person for her as a partner...

&amp;#x200B;

I really regret that i had someone else try to find out instead of just talking to her in person. And now that i have come home from the weekend to my apartment i feel more lonely than i ever have in my entire life. yesterday i couldnt even step out the door. It felt like i could have a panic anxiety attack at any moment. I really dont know if she even has a hint of how i feel about her and it is terrorizing me.

So there's a guy in my class who I'm sorta close friends with. He's a great guy outside of school, really fun to talk to and we hang out sometime. But in school he's a bit... incompetent?

Here's what I mean by that:
1. He barely takes down any notes in class and repeatedly asks me for the schedule and pointers for class. I wouldn't mind but he never replies to MY texts asking for pictures of the worksheet I didn't get because I was sick.
2. We get a lot of homework everyday, so my classmates in our clique would split the work 3 ways. He never does his part and I end up doing it, saying he feel asleep or he forgot. So we never invited him to do HW anymore.
3. We were in a group of 3 and had to make a presentation for Biology class. Me and my other friend did the research, interviews and compiled them together. All he had to do now was make the powerpoint. Yet he forgot to do it for 2 months (even though I constantly reminded him through whatsapp, steam and in real life) and we didn't get to present.

""Just don't partner up with him"". It's not that easy. I hate everyone in my class except a few people. Everyone else is noisy, dirty, and just assholes. So him and another guy are the only people I can bear working with even though he doesn't do jackshit.

I had just gotten paid and, after months of trying to become stable on my own in a very expensive new place, the paycheck that I just received would have finally allowed me to buy some new clothes. The shoes I was wearing were literally falling apart. I had just come from a meeting, and had my hands kind of full. Then, out of nowhere, someone runs past me and grabs my phone from my hands, with both my debit and credit cards in the phone wallet, and just keeps running. Even with regular shoes, I wouldn't have been able to catch him. I'm fine and all, I've lived abroad before and have survived without a phone.

477,"Warning, there's a recounting of a form of sex offense ahead, if you need to stop reading, do so now. I know the right thing to do in this situation, just looking for ideas on how to best go about it.


So to start, I'm a mid 20s guy. The other party involved is another mid 20s guy. We met a few months back and joined a pre-existing friend group that invites us to events with them. One of them was recently, during which I shared a bed with this individual. 


The first night, I woke up right as he was finishing masturbating, with me in bed right next to him. I was just in shock, but told myself he was probably sleep-wanking or whatever. I was planning on sleeping on the couch the next night, but we all got drunk and stayed up late and I forgot. 


The second night, I wake up to it again, while he's in the middle. I move around a bit and he immediately stops. He's awake and conscious of what he's doing. I lay there frozen for a couple minutes to see what happens, and he starts back up. Yea, time to leave so I fuck right off to the couch in the next room.


We never spoke of it. I'm not traumatized or anything by this, doubt it will affect me much, just sort of a ""what the fuck just happened"" feeling right now. But, it is sex offense, I did not consent to being part of his masturbation. I wouldn't have imagined he would do something like that, so I'm not sure what else he might do.

Edit: posting the dumb ass poem because maybe it dies suck and I do deserve what he said

I escape from apathy I dress myself in white My whole body takes a gulp of air I take a step into A bed of clouds more magical than I dreamed. Sun setting over the remains of my heart

Buried in pieces in the River.

My heart tentatively prepares to take flight The blended sky, the escaping cloud canopy.

My head swims, intoxicated by the colours

Rapidly advancing met by smoke and air, 

A sudden change to black.

Can it be? the clouds wave to the forest trees.

Now the clouds line up like in a vineyard.

And in a second swim into an exquisite state of disorder.

A large patch of green, misty island or Atlantis.

Then the clouds began to rise like leavened bread.

Then my eyes opened wide as a magical village appeared under the watchful clouds. I imagined strings of stars hanging from the clouds to light the way of the hardworking villagers and the beautiful lasses.

The sky’s colours are now separated by a harsh line. I suddenly wonder what lies beyond the borders of the sky. A desire to jog to the boundaries of the universe awakens.

Then we rapidly plunge down into the labyrinth of fluffy clouds.

For a moment we wait with baited breath, if it could be that an enchanted fairy village lurks below.

Rapid black fumes are pumping furiously into the cerulean blue.

Fog engulfs the village with a vengeance but cannot win over the immortal strength as the lights come on and fix their stare.

For a moment my heart stops because I feel that the clouds are an illusion hiding the sea with fearsome creatures.

But then the sun rises and the brilliant gold makes me feel in all my soul that the gods of mt Olympus tower just beyond the cloudy Gates. My heart waits for them to leap out in all their glory.",04Feb2020,1

I find it very hard to get up in the morning to go to work. This is something I have been struggling with for years. I don't get excited about being at work or going to work but does anyone really? The pay is amazing and the job isn't a bad job. But for some reason I struggle going to work. I can tell myself all night that im going to just wake up; make a nice breakfast and go but once im awake I keep fighting myself to go and most of the time I stay home.

I've dealt with depression in the past but I dont know how to read the signs really.

My major problem with the idea that I need an exciting job is that I can't afford to leave my place of work. As someone who lives paycheck to paycheck I dont really have time to set up something im passionate about like cooking or gaming.

I see it clearly, she's preparing the terrain for when things end between the both of us, we've been dating for six months and she trashed the drawings I made for her from her bedroom, she deleted most of our chats and pics, she openly flirts with other guys... And it hurts to see the little romantic gestured that we used to love, dissapear everyday :/

I'm not helping, I'm showing signs of the lack of interest too, I think I was the first one to do it and I can't blame her. At this point I think she's also keeping me there until she finds someone else but shit's going to crash before that happens and it hurts.

I also feel very guilty, I've emotionally hurt her by accident with my insecurities and I think that's why she's finally moving on on someone else, our relationship was perfect but I ruined it, I indirectly made her feel rejected sometimes and she finally got tired and she's moving on. 

I'm happy for her thought, she's going to find someone else. She's not perfect either and she has bad qualities too, so ehh I think I deserve to meet other people after going to counseling because I know I was the one to fuck it up and I want to not do it again in the future.

**The problem? I dont know what to do! I cant bring myself to see the plane fall slowly everyday because that hurts like hell, but I cant bring myself to break up with her because she's TOO PUSHY. She wont let me. Shes gonna cry and everything and beg me not to go and I dont want to hurt her like that, I tried to do it once and it was like that.**

But I cant also delete my discord account like nothing and dissapear with no reason just because she doesn't know my full name, its my first relationship btw XD

485,"Im going to try to keep this short anyways Im 18 turning 19 (M) but this happened when I was 16 going on 17.

Anyways I had just moved to a new neighbourhood and was going to a new school and wanted to know what kind of people were at this school and maybe try and get to know someone before I start at the school so I would have an easier time making friends. I posted on social media just asking if anybody went there and any tips beforehand etc. 

Not long after I got a reply from a girl, she seemed nice so I clicked on her profile to see what she looked like. She was so pretty it honestly made me alot more excited for this new school. Well I started the school met some people but I didnt talk to her straight away, guess it was just nerves. Until I did talk to her. She was so easy to talk to. I remember just talking and talking well, it was fun.

Fast forward a year and I had somehow gotten into somesort of """"beef"""" with her and her friends. What I mean by that is it was mostly just me and my friends making jokes about them putting to much make up on and them saying I have greasy hair or sum like that nothing too harsh. I just liked talking to her.
Slowly that rivelry faded away and we were actively talking when ever we crossed pathes.
Well that soon turned into something more.

I remember we were doing this thing late at school and we were sitting in the couch playfully talking and I looked into her stunning green-blue eyes and just going in and kissing her. I didnt care what people were around us or how many I just wanted to kiss her and nothing else. Well we made out a bit before heading out for icecream.

We talked alot on phones and social media but didnt hang out all that much, it sucked but at least we did hang out sometimes and those moments I will never forget. 

We went on for a few months until near the end we started having a lot of arguements, I dont know why but when Im mad at the people I love the most I become just furious and say things that I always regret saying. 

She broke up with me, even though she was a bitch to me in the end and I am 98% sure she cheated on me with her next boyfriend after me I still felt like complete shit

Well shortly after she got with this guy who was a year older than me same as the girl

We were buddies once, not friends but buddies.
That changed after they got together you see I saw him as the guy that just stole away my girl and he thought of me as the guy who had just been with his girl. 
Anyway once late he started annoying me with attitude and when he shoved me I punched him straight in the face. Well after that my now ex despised me and didnt speak to me at all that semester. 

We didnt talk for a while until I messaged her just saying sorry for being so immature and that I felt sorry for how things ended between us. She said it wasnt anything to say sorry for and we small talked a bit.

A few months ago I asked her out saying that I've changed but her boyfriend just sent a picture back.

We dated for a short while but I still think about her sometimes and still get sad everytime

Why does this happen!!?

Ive dated a few girls since then but I dont miss them like I miss her even though Ive dated girls for longer than I dated her and overall just been with them more than I was for her but it still isnt the same.

What can I do to finally just clear her completely out of my mind and just stop missing her.
It just doesnt make sense to me why I feel this way when the time that has passed is like 5x of how long our relationship lasted.

When I was a kid I used to go around chasing little animals and trying to hurt them, mostly cats.  
Grandma helped me make cat friends

I loved them alot I kissed them and let them sleep on me. And begged for catfood for them, but when I got older I started neglecting them,, I never gave water and the bowls were always dirty, some of the cats came very rarely and when I did give them some food, it was just milk with bread or biscuis or a piece of chicken I saved, they always used to meow at the windows, I promised them I'll come outside tomorrow or I would pet them and give some bread , they always got diseases and stuff, they would go away most of the time (the diseases), most of the time they were dirty and thin outside, one day a cat died after I came back from a seven day trip , the chef usually gave leftovers mixed with meat at night and my parents said he'll give the food I was comforted and didn't think of them the whole trip. I just pitied myself afterwards for the ""loss"" I had.

I also bullied my brother because he was spoiled yet He still loves me now even though all the fights we had.

I wanted my mom to die to and called her bad words because I thought she was abusing me (she hit me a few times In the past because of stress .)

501,"I live in a terrace house with my mum and brother. We have one parking spot for the drive way that accommodates two vehicles, but it it shared. One spot for her car which she needs for her job, and the other spot for our neighbour.

Our neighbour has one car for him that he seldom uses, his son's car, his son's truck and his wife's car.
So a grand total of 4 vehicles.
His son often parks his truck round the corner, which is where my boyfriend parks his car, but when the spot is taken the son parks in front of their cars.
If not, my boyfriend parks his car in front of my mum's, leaving space for out neighbour to move in and out at will.

The problem is our neighbour is paranoid about his car and has almost broken down our front door many a times accusing my mum of hitting his car. This has never been the case.

He parks well into our side of the driveway, forcing her to park right in front of our doorway and making it hard to get in and out the house.

Recently he has hit the bumper of my boyfriend's car when he claimed it was too far over his side, in front of the houses. He claimed he is not liable, and my boyfriend was illegally parked (he was well over our side, nothing was wrong)

He is a paranoid guy, he has hit my mum's car with his doors more often than not, and blames it on my mum (again, he is always on our side)

His wife has given up with him and his son can't stand him and they therefore say nothing.

It's made my mum paranoid about parking, my boyfriend feels worried about visiting because he doesn't want my mum to get grief.

506,"So, my mum doesn't think she needs counselling, and just the suggestion of therapy is an insult to her (thinks you're calling her crazy).

The problem is, she kinda is crazy. She was abused by my dad and never received therapy after that. Her personality is so erratic. One minute she's talking to you normally and the next she's obsessing and controlling over something simple. Or you have a conversation with her and then she misunderstands what you're saying and conveys the wrong message to people. She always defaults to snitching to my gran on myself and my siblings if we do ANYTHING and it honestly makes me feel uncomfortable in my own home, because then my grandmother gets involved instantly and yells at us. For e.g. my sisters and I were going out, my mum blocks the doorway and obviously asks where we're going, we tell her we're going out for a few mins. Then she cusses us out, and then leaves to the TV room. So we take this as approval and then before we know it, she has blown up my grandmothers phone, crying and talking badly of us, which causes our gran to come out and yell at us. Another example: she will go through my room, see my medication on my bedside table, and then call my grandmother to snitch on me that I'm taking medicine and she doesn't know why. 

On top of all this, she has no people skills whatsoever- e.g. she lost her job due to inability to follow instruction and lack of professionalism (starting fights with coworkers).

I know it's bad to say this, but I am so over her behaviour. I am at my wits end and I am so tired of feeling like I have to tiptoe around her, or that feeling of fear I get around her. I want to feel comfortable in my own home knowing my mum isn't going to gossip about me or snitch on me. I feel so drained and tired, I just need to figure out how to get through to her. I don't want to feel like she's an older sibling, I just want her to be like a mum. Sometimes I wish we had someone to stand up for us just like how my mum has my gran to stand up for her.

I have this problem where if a teacher is wrong and I am right I will make it clear to everyone which has gotten me in lots of trouble but today was the worst. So I had physics and had lost my ID card (I attend a private school we are required to have an ID or else we are suspended) so I was look for it when the teacher walked in and told me to sit down so I do. After a while I spot my ID next to one of my friends so I ask her to give it to me. The teacher goes full monster mode and starts shouting at me and said he was gonna give me a warning report (basically like detention but worse it stops me from scoring anything above an 80 for an average that year and stops me from running for anything the next year like student council etc.) so I get shocked and I might have raised my voice just a little point it is he wrote a warning report and I’m probably gonna be the hot topic of the staff room for the next couple days but it usually takes about a week for the warning report to get recorded. Is there anyway I can get the teacher to stop treating me unfairly (the group of guys next to me were laughing and talking and he didn’t do anything to them) and stop him from filing the report before it’s too late? I’m gonna go apologize tomorrow so wish me luck but is there anything I could do Incase it doesn’t work out or just for her to stop treating me unfairly. Thank you

As a kid I was smart, knew multiplication back in kindergarten, decimals in 2 grade, a little bit of astrophysics at the end of elementary, I also had 1500+ rating in chess, I was apart of a drama program, and I also actively played sports.

&amp;#x200B;

However over the years my interest in pretty much everything has slowly diminished. I used to read everything storybooks, comics, reports, research journals, and articles; I no longer care anymore. Regardless, my grades were always phenomenal, whether or not I tried and still are. 

&amp;#x200B;

Towards the starting of grade 6 is when I really started to stop caring, I no longer did homework, pay attention in class, or even care about my exams (I would no longer be at the top of my class but still maintain a 90%). This did not really matter as school was easy. But I changed school in 9 grade, and my new school follows a different curriculum that requires a near perfect work ethic, something I no longer had. I somehow managed to scrap through last year with a 93% and this year my first report card 95%. My second report card was a 93%, but only because of my homework and some teacher leniency; my tests were abysmal to say the least. I believe the main reason for that performance was my lack of interest, I barely studied at all. \]

I've always had problems deciding on anything ever, and with my current situation there's no solid ""win"". I don't have anyone I can divulge the entire situation to due to certain parts of it, so I'm hoping reddit might give me a guide in the right direction. I worry this indecision might lead my suicide.

*= buildup and explanation, but not direct current predicaments

*   Here's (a lot of) backstory to give insight as to how things ended up as they did. My parents weren't the best growing up, opposite ends of the spectrum even. My mom was insanely overprotective and attempted to shelter me from the world, and my dad was a carefree drunk that secretly bought me bottles and smoked weed with me. Mom has bipolar, anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia. My dad is an alcoholic. Both were emotionally abusive towards me, my mom seldom physically abusive towards my father and I. Food wasn't always in supply so I learned to steal around age 6, either food from stores or money to buy some. Ultimately this led to me being a kleptomaniac. When I was 11 my mother and I got into a car accident on the way to the airport from seeing my grandparents. My grandparents were in the car at the time and died. This accident gave my mom TBI, which in addition to get disabilities, led her to losing her mind. After the accident she was in and out of psychiatric hospitals regularly, probably spent more time in them than she did at home. My father tripled his drinking after the accident, going from a 6 pack a day, to a 12 pack, to a whole bottle. My parents being lost in their own struggles didn't seem to care what I did anymore. From age 13 up I drank, smoked pot, went to parties, had sex, snuck out, and engaged in misc illegal activity.

    One thing that consistently brought me joy was animals, cats in particular. I got my first cat when I was 12 from petsmart. The next was a stray I found outside my middle school. A couple years later I convinced my parents to buy 3 at once from petsmart because they looked like the ones we had so they'd be like a makeshift family. Then I got my final one off of Craigslist. Being adolescent I never thought of the repercussions this would have.

   I also have never really had luck I the relationship department. Every guy I dated cheated on me (besides the last 2, but what they did was arguably worse) which led to trust issues. In the beginning of 2014, I met this seemingly amazing guy (let's call him Todd) through a mutual friend. The first couple of months were great, but then suddenly he started accusing me of cheating out of nowhere, despite him having access to my phone and social media. When I wouldn't ""admit"" to cheating, he started physically abusing me. My dumb ass figured I should deal with it considering I could handle abuse from my parents, and at least he wasn't cheating on me, as if hurting me was any better. The abuse built up to be a daily occurrence, but no matter what, my mindset on 'abuse is better than cheating' didn't falter. In addition to beating me regularly he held onto my phone for me, I wasn't allowed to talk to anyone without his permission, never allowed me to leave the house without him, and I wasn't allowed to even work (even though he didn't either, and he just leeched off of my parents) This all occurred while I was living with my parents, who witnessed a lot of this. My dad tried to stop him at first, but after I consistently defended this POS he stopped trying. And my mom thought he ""kept me in line"". (Though now she defends herself by saying she doesn't recall any of it) This guy ruined me with severe PTSD. I used to thrive off of spending time with others, now I avoid people if at all possible. He thought since I was bisexual, if I made eye contract with anyone that meant I was interested and he later beat me for it, so now I cannot make proper eye contact. My laugh was gross and my smile was ugly to him, so I trained myself to avoid doing those things and I can't seem to do them naturally anymore. Many other things as well that I'd rather not put the effort into recalling as this is only for additional info anyways.

   When I finally found the strength to leave, a week later my dad was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver. Luckily our house was paid off, so I was barely able to make ends meet. Soon after my dad was hospitalized, I realized I had unfortunately lost the majority of my friends due to the isolation.*

   5 months later, I started dating the man that's now my husband. We'll call him Jack. He has severe anger issues that have always gotten the best of him. About a year into our relationship Jack beat me up because I told him I was hurt that he saw an old friend of mine without me. Sometimes I wonder if I should've just left him then. Though he didn't beat me as regularly as Todd did, at this point being almost 5 years into it he might've beaten me up more. As I've grown to know him, it's at least somewhat predictable when his anger might trigger, so I've learned to avoid it. Jack understands me in a way most others don't. He's my best friend. We like the same food, anime, videogames, hobbies etc. We have developed our own language. And I trust him even more than my own parents. However, this has me at a constant internal battle with myself, with thoughts like 'Surely this must validate all the abuse Todd put you through since Jack can't keep himself from hurting you either' , 'If the person you love so dearly could nearly kill you so easily, so many times, why even bother trying to live?' and thoughts of the like. I have no one besides Jack in my life, which I know is a bad thing. But I'm terrified of people now, I can't even make phone calls. I don't know how to even talk to people anymore, I honestly find it astounding that Jack would even still want to be with me.

   So I'm uncertain if it's healthy if I stay with Jack or not. My therapist doesn't think I should, but my staying with him also affects a lot of outside related things. For instance, he's providing for the both of us as my crippling anxiety has made it hard to hold down a job. We are still living in my parents house which is paid off (dad in nursing home, mom in psychiatric hospital). 

   The house has several issues though, the plumbing is busted and is a few thousand dollars to fix, however we can still use the toilets (can't flush tp though) and can't use hot water. The electricity in the garage and some of the kitchen isn't working, but easy to ignore. The house smells like shit because I would let it go a bit after every altercation since I'd be too depressed to get out of bed. No matter how much I clean, the smell remains. It can even be smelt well from outside the house, and I worry that it might be repossessed because of it. There's a slight bug problem, and it could use some cosmetic upgrades. We could sell for $80k cash (best offer we've received) but I'm not sure if that's the right call. We've put thousands into restoring the house already, and I'll be receiving a settlement check next January that could help with repairs. When moving, I have to think about what place would even allow all of our animals. My husband doesn't like my cats but they've given me unconditional love for years, so I can't imagine losing them. I could try to find new homes for them, but my oldest is 15 and I can't bare the thought of him passing as soon as I might give him up. I'd also have to consider if I'd be willing to give up my stable environment to live somewhere else with him. We don't have enough money to rent, so we'd have to buy outright. And Jack can tend to be a frivolous spender. So I worry about living elsewhere worry him. And what if we moved and I decided I wasn't safe anymore? Then I'd have nowhere to go.

   I also worry about staying though because I've stolen a LOT of food over the years, especially since both of my parents hospitalizations. Well over thousands of dollars worth of food. I'm sure a few grocery stores recognize me at this point. I'm surprised I haven't gotten caught. As of recently I decided one way or another I have to cut myself off because I don't want to be arrested, but I worry it might not help seeing as I'm sure multiple cameras have caught me, as well as I pay in card so they can look up my info through my transaction. If I move, I might not get caught and can start fresh. It might be fine if I stay in this particular regard, but I feel uneasy about it.

   With all these uncertainties, it just feels like suicide might be the simplest route. I have no desire to kill myself, but I can't stop racking my brain on what exactly I should do, which leads me to just doing nothing. I know there's no clear cut answer, but any opinions and advice on this whole situation would be greatly appreciated.",04Feb2020,1
518,"This is my first post on reddit;  hope I write this in the right subreddit.  
Basically I need some advice on how to best approach a person, who is stuck in a victim role but is obviously in the wrong; and needs to make up for her wrong doings.

Background:

This person I am talking about is close family (my aunt and godmother).  
She has some financial problems. She hasn't worked since she turned 40 and has three children to take care of.

She is very jealous of my parents, since they seem to be doing well.

Now, this person tries everything in her power to make my parents' life miserable.  
From badmouthing, manipulation of me, my grandparents, to ""stealing"" money.   
She sold a family-owned artifact worth over €600.000 without telling anyone about it and keeping the money all to herself  
After selling this artifact, she had the nerve to manipulate my grandparents into making her the primary heir apparent of their most valuable possessions (talking about another €500.000)

Now, I did not know any of this, since my parents don't badmouth people.  
Last year, she (my aunt) wanted to meet up with me to ""catch up"". During this ""catch up"", all she did was tell horrible stories about my parents. It was very hard for me to listen to them.

Mainly, because this is my aunt. She is about 30 years older than me and I have always known her as someone I should be respectful to and be kind. She is my godmother after all.  
I had never heard her talk bad like that, and it came as a surprise. I didn't really know how to react.

It was also during this ""catch up"", that she told me all of the things she did, such as selling the valuable artifacts and that it was the only ""right thing to do"" because my parents didn't know ""how to handle that amount of money"". (Funny enough, they (my parents) are financially very stable in comparison to her)

She basically did not make any sense. All I could feel was resentment and jealousy. She was talking about the last 30 years, from before I was born up until now what my parents did wrong according to her and why she is the ""good one"".

Now, I talked about my parents about the situation recently, about a year after what happened, and asked them about the situation.  
I could feel my father was obviously hurt and said he was never hurt as much in his life as by my aunt, in the way she treats them and the way she badmouths my parents while they only have have her best interest at heart. My parents even financially supported her for some time. All they got back was jealousy and a lot of money she owes them. While behind their back she even tries to set me up against them.

Now for my question:  
I feel guilty for not putting my aunt on the spot when she was telling me all those stories. Instead of defending my parents I just sat there quietly listening in disbelieve of what was very new information to me. I didn't know what to do.  
I have the feeling that maybe I could do something for my parents to straighten the situation.  
I feel like my aunt actually likes me (or is it another manipulation trick?) and that she might listen to me when I tell her how I feel about the whole situation. In a respectful way.

I want to tell her I want her to stop hating on my parents, badmouthing them and actually go with them into a conversation. Also about at least €100.000 she owes them and doesn't want to pay them back. (not even considering the valuable heritage she sold behind their back - which my parents forgive her for since they understand she is in need of some financial stability)

Do you think it is wise to put her on the spot, or will this only heat up the situation?  
I am just conscious about my parents suffering because of this situation. All they want is the conflict to be resolved, but they are so hurt by my godmother continuous bullying that I want to step in and help them. But I also don't want the situation to worsen.  


Any advice on how to handle this?",04Feb2020,1
519,"For 9th grade, we have to take additional class on Monday/Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Saturday. This is due to Indonesia forcing kids to take UN (a test similar to IGCSE). And since our school is international we have to take both UN AND IGCSE, so normal school schedule isn't enough. So on weekdays I get home by 5:30 ish and on Saturday I have to go to school til 9. 

I have to wake up at 6:00 to arrive on time at school, so my curfew is at maximum 22:00 (10 pm).  But I'm only ready to do anything at home by 18:00 (6 pm). That means I have about 4 hours to do homework and have a bit of leisure. However, the amount of homework we get is ludicrous + we have tests nearly every day.

So the question is, how do I balance studying while still having time to play video games in a short amount of time.",04Feb2020,1
520,"I used to have 2 friends that I was very close with. They were really big into drinking and partying and that’s all we really used to do. I’m at a point in my life where that no longer interests me. I have no desire to drink anymore. I’ve gotten into a more healthy lifestyle this past year and now I enjoy working out and running. It also makes it awkward because the 2 friends are fighting and don’t talk to each other so I’m stuck in the middle. 

I feel like we’re are all at different points in our life and we don’t have anything in common anymore. They are my only friends so I feel like I don’t have anyone anymore. I don’t even know where to find new friends with similar interests as me. I live in a pretty rural area so there’s not many things to do or places to go. I’m in my mid twenties so it just seems hard to find people my age who are past that partying stage in life. 

I thought about getting a second job at a craft store since I enjoy crafts in hopes of meeting people with a similar interest. But, I don’t know it seems a little extreme to pick up another job to make friends.",04Feb2020,1
521,"I’m a little irritated myself, to be honest. I feel that lately, no matter what I do, it is somehow wrong.

For a bit more context, I found out that my friend group that includes my roommate had a separate group chat without me in it so that they could play detective on my new relationship, talk smack about my sex life while I was single, and complain/jump to conclusions about things that had they talked to me, would have been resolved easily. When I found out about this group chat, I was brokenhearted because of how close I thought I was to everyone. I have blocked all their numbers except for my roommate’s and though I have received a couple apologies, I’m not mentally prepared to forgive or even have a normal conversation with anyone in that group but my roommate.

Anyway, my boyfriend knew I was upset and since he had staff duty Sunday, he had an extra day off yesterday. So he made the drive from base to come see me. I told my roommate “Hey, (BF) is coming to visit. Just a heads up.” She said okay.

When she got home, I made attempts to make conversation with her and though she was friendly, she was getting shorter and shorter with her replies so I figured perhaps she wanted to be left alone. So, I went back in my room with my boyfriend and we decided to go eat. Before we left, I asked her if she would like to join us for dinner and she said no. After that, I probed a little further and asked if she wanted me to bring her anything from where we were going, and she said no. Both of these conversations go on with her basically refusing to look me in the eye and looking at the TV. 

So, we left. While we were out, I shot her a couple texts asking if we needed anything from the store and if she needed anything. Then, when we got home, I once again tried making conversation and each time sort of fell flat. I gave up and took my boyfriend back in my room and we just laid there scrolling through reddit on his phone for a couple hours.

Suddenly, my roommate stomps into her room and slams the door. I shoot her a text “Are you good?” I receive the following reply. 

“Not really, when we (her bf) are here we dont act like you don't exist. He'll actually speak to you or we dont just stay in my room the whole time because I know how that feels but it's all good. I'm tired anyways”

I was floored. Every single time I’ve had my boyfriend here while she is here and we’re all in the living room, she either leaves or there is an awkward silence and difficulty making conversation. I figured perhaps she felt that we were hogging the living room, so I decided to stay in my room. I know it’s not exactly fun to watch a couple cuddle when you miss your significant other, so I thought I was doing the right thing. Plus, I felt I had made ample attempts to include her and each time was shot down. 

How in the world did I manage to literally do nothing and still do something wrong? Am I not entitled to literally just stay in my room that I pay for? I am so tired. I feel like no matter what, I do something wrong. My boyfriend insists that this behavior has literally nothing to do with me and that there’s nothing I could have done about it. I feel like I’m constantly gripping at straws trying to figure out how to make everyone happy and I fail every time. I need support and advice. 

**TL;DR: My roommate is pissed off at me because I stayed in my room with my boyfriend instead of spending time with her in the living room. I tried to include her several times before I went back in my room and each time was shot down. Before this, I had just found out that she and a bunch of our friends were in a group chat dedicated to playing detective on my relationship and talking smack about me. I’m beyond hurt lately, and I feel like nothing I do is good enough. I need advice.**",04Feb2020,1

He said he lashed out at someone at work and doesnt want to do this with me and ruin things forever.

However I really dont know how I'll cope. Even if we do get back together, I am still going to feel extremely lonely in the mean time and dont know what to do. Yes I have friends and hobbies and things to do, but as I said I'm severely depressed and so he was really the only thing making me happy.

Sorry for formatting, like everyone in on mobile

(I am 14M if that matters)


My dad has been a smoker for almost his entire life. He was able to quit smoking and was smoke free until this year. This year it ended up being to stressful and he went back on cigarettes. He hid it from me, I only found it when I confronted him about the smoke I smelled on him and the constant “walks” he would take. Recently I went looking through his  drawers to borrow a sock (as a ran out and it was Friday) I noticed in one of them what looks like a pipe sticking out of a condom box, suspicious I look further. I opened the box and found a pipe that  reeks for weed, multiple lighters, and a little folded up bag that had some weed in it. I also found multiple inhalators in one his drawers with the name “Truelive” on it. (A medical marijuana company) Now here’s where the grandparents come in. My grandfather has arthritis, back problems and other conditions (I’m not really sure of it all) In my state it is legal for medical marijuana but not recreational yet. My grandfather because of his problems was able to get a card for it. So I have seen multiple times them with weed and a bong. My grandmother smokes it too, even though she dosent have  card because she has the same problems, and has no reason to get one because my grandfather has it. I have also seen them with the same “Truelive” inhalators. I know my father does not have his own card because he dosent have those problems, and if he did have his own card why would he hide it in a little bag and in a condom box? So this is why a believe my grandparents gave it to him. So yeah,     AMA

532,"I’m going to try to sum up all the details as quickly as possible, I am a mother to 3 beautiful boys who I would go above and beyond for (as I’m sure most of you would for your children as well) but, to be honest, as much as I wish I could do it all on my own I can’t. 
My first born (T) who is now 8 is from a previous relationship. His father (J) and I have had our ups and downs, but have always been respectful to each other for the sake of our son. Now a days J is married to a wonderful woman and we all co-parent and get along great. I have T most of the time and J has him on the weekends. 
So when T was only a year old, J and I had decided to end the relationship and I never initially asked for any financial support, I was very sure that I could manage without inconveniencing him and I felt proud to do so. Well after a year I had to face the hard realization that I couldn’t financially support T on my own, so I reached out to J and we agreed that we would stay out of the courts and he would give me $50 a week. At first that was perfectly fine, but as T got older and required more things I asked for more money a week. It was a struggle, and J was very hesitant originally, but eventually he agreed to $70 
(Quick timeframe update in case I confused anyone out there...sorry if I did)
We separated 7 years ago
Asked for $50/week 6 years ago
Asked for $70/week 1 year ago
Well now, for the past 2 months I have been getting the run around when it comes to payments, and whenever he does mention having it on a certain day for me, if I can’t get to him that day then I get ignored the following day and finally a text way later that says “sorry, I’ll have it next week”
Honestly I’ve seen that same exact text, word for word about 6 times now. The most recent text I got from him has also asked about going beck down to $50 a week so it will be easier for him to make the payments.
I’m getting to the point now where I feel like I need to go to the courts. The only reason we’ve avoided it before is because it seemed like such a hassle, and he’s worried that he would be paying too much through that route. Now I know that I’m getting the crap end of the deal amount wise, I’m not that naïve, but I was just willing to get the bare minimum if that meant not making to much trouble for him....and as the post says, to also not be the a**hole. 
I have no clue what he is making now, it’s none of my business and I don’t need to know that information. But I do know that he has been with the same company since we were still together, and 7 years ago he was bringing home a weekly check of $390. I have no indication if he has received any raises or promotions, again that’s not my business, but I do think that off of what he was making 7 years ago, paying $70 a week on time should not be that difficult...again AITA? I don’t know what to think or do.

535,"Ok so a quick backstory, I met this girl just a over a year back and a couple months ago I started getting feelings for her. She was pretty much the only person I get I could really talk to about my feelings and shit and if she ever needed help with something or she felt sad, I would be there to help as well. I knew she didn’t feel the same way cause like a week before I told her, she told me she had never felt like she loved someone before and I only told her because she found out. We both thought it would be best if we just stayed friends and it’s been pretty good since hyphen. It’s never really come up and it’s all but forgotten at this point.

But a couple weeks ago, I found out she had a crush on someone, and as a sort of bit I kept on asking her who it was. We were talking with each other at about 1am where she was doing a bit where she was typing really retardedly. It was all funny and then when I asked who her crush was, she said it was me. At first I didn’t believe her because I thought it was part of the bit or to just throw me off. But then I kept on asking and asked why it would even be me, and she seemed genuine. 

Ever since I told her how I felt, I had always had a little feeling that I still liked her, but I had just tried to push it down cause she didn’t feel the same way. She also had a boyfriend which lasted about 2 months but they broke up the day before New Year’s Eve which kinda messed her up but she tried to focus on the positives which I think got her through it alright and she seems fine about it now. I think it was cause the guy just said he wanted to work on himself and shit but idk, I didn’t really wanna ask her about it cause I didn’t wanna out her in an uncomfortable position but whatever.

So I asked her genuinely twice, if I was actually her crush and she said yes. We agreed to talk about it the day after and long story short, she didn’t wanna ruin the relationship we already had. I didn’t wanna miss this opportunity cause of how I felt but I also didn’t wanna ruin our relationship so again, we stayed friends.

It’s kinda been difficult for me though cause I’ve kinda had doubts that I’m actually her crush and it’s kinda fucked with me a bit. It kinda seemed rushed when she told me and her sort of quickness to go to just wanting to stay friends in order to not ruin our current relationship just made me doubt it a lil. 

She also got messaged by some random guy on Instagram and she told him that she had a crush as well so idk what to do.

We have a really good relationship though. We talk to each other every day, on Fridays and Saturdays we pretty much always stay up till like 1 or 2 am. We meet up nearly every Friday with someone else and have the same sense of humour.

We go to different schools though, both are same sex grammar schools so we don’t see each other apart from the Fridays and occasionally Saturdays when we go to town with the friend we meet up with in Fridays.

Also, the guy we meet up with on Fridays goes to my school and he’s bi, mostly hay though u think so there isn’t any ‘competition’ with him, I guess you could call it.

But as much as I don’t wanna admit it, I keep on thinking about her and I guess, having fantasies about her. I always think about being with her in my later life or something or just being with her now. And sometimes when I’m in the mood, I’ll think abut her sexually but I’m not gonna go into that.

We never really go round each other’s houses cause one, she’s allergic to cats slightly and I have two, so she can’t come round mine, and idk why but going round hers never really comes up. I’ve been round once around a month ago when she was still with her ex, and there was 3 of her friends from school and the Friday guy as well.

I still do feel like she’s the only person I can really talk to and I really want a human connection, like someone I can hug and talk to. She’s one of 3 girls that I actually know (actually know and can talk to without it being a new conversation) so it’s not like I have a wide net but that’s not really a problem, I just really like her.

I’m pretty sure that’s it so any help is appreciated, thanks",04Feb2020,1

TLDR: Since I rampled, even though I try not to. I was directionless all my life so I pretty much wasted my life away. But now that I'm closer to 30 than 20, I REALLY need to start building a foundation for an appropriate life, but I'm not sure where to start. Also I think the only part that needs to be read in this post is the ""Current mental state"" part, but I don't wanna delete everything so....

For some background: 

**High school:** 

Sports: captain of the team, made tons of friends, broke a few school records. That said, the records were low. Mine were only slightly better. Pretty sure they're beat by now. 

Classes: took AP classes thru all 4 years, had an above 4.0 gpa (weighted by the AP classes).

Popularity: Almost? won prom king if that even matters. I was no stud or anything special. Just someone who was friendly to a lot of ppl and knew ppl from every social group. Pretty much ppl nominated me and were voting for me because they disliked everyone else. 

**College**:

No planning whatsoever. Grew up with no goals unlike most ppl; just wanted to make enough money to live and take care of my parents.

So...no idea of what I wanted to major in but I took some Comp sci classes in HS and was pretty good at it so thought maybe I liked it. Loved Bruce Lee and knew that he had his own philosophy in life so was very interested in Philosophy. Ended up going to a private liberal arts school that had those majors (despite not being that great at comp sci). Main motivation for that college despite other schools that are related so much higher was that I could do my sport....in Division 3....

I just didn't care cause I didn't know what to do. Just went to college cause it was a norm. 

Learned quickly that the strict structure of Highschool life (6:30am wake up, 6:45 bus, school, 2:45 sports practice, home at 6pm, nap til 8, dinner, and then hw until 1-3am depending on the assignments) helped me tremendously. I lived on campus and had so much more freedom. Convinced myself that I worked hard in HS so I can relax a little. A little became a lot; missed classes, procrastinated to a point where I had to pull all-nighters to finish assignments. 

Didn't help that the college was very easy. I thought HS was much more difficult so it lead to a overconfidence that lead to more lax and lazy lifestyle. Roommate was also a bum that only wanted sex and parties.  After a semester I started feeling like I was just going to school to get a signature that says I went to school.

3 years in, started thinking about job prospects and realized that the only Philosophy job I wanted was to sit there and talk...which is pretty much impossible to get. Switched schools to a better comp sci school. (1 more year and I would have graduated with a philosophy &amp; comp sci major and spanish minor) 

Workload between a more prestigious school took me by surprise. Almost failed an easy compsci class my first semester. It was easy in that I had already knew every concept. Got B's and A's on my tests but the workload was much more intensive. A workload that I did not do, cause I didn't read the syllabus to see how much they were worth. Projects that students were struggling on, I procrastinated and did it in 1-2 hours. The projects weren't perfect tho cause I didn't leave me enough time ( it was online submission) so I had an average C in projects. Other stuff I neglected only barely gave me a B passing grade (needed B to pass).

That comp sci class wasn't enough to wake me up, that I needed to take this college more seriously. After 4 semesters there, I ended up failing 4 classes. I had never gotten a C in a class before, so failing just one class was odd, but it wasn't enough for me to change. Because I still didn't care, because I still felt like I was just working for a signature. 

I then took a year off. Told myself I'd get a part time at some retail store, but I kept delaying it.

**Present day:**

Daily lifestyle revolve around gaming, watching twitch streams, watching tv shows, and wasting my life away. Sitting at home without doing anything productive and being taken care of by my aging parents, who wants to retire soon. I know it and I want to help them, but I don't know how. 

I still believe that if I can find something I'm passionate about, then I can be successful. People have told me that I just need to try different things, but I'm sure what to try. A different major isn't free. I'm willing to do muscle work, but I prefer not to do it daily as I'm already starting to feel back pains (Partially from lifting too much from high school to college, and partially from sitting around all day in front of a pc). 

Only upside is that I have a lovely gf, who I know is in it for the long haul and wants an eventual marriage (she pretty much suggested it) but she says that I need to get it together or else we'd end up breaking up (understandable).

**Current mental state:**

I'm still interested in philosophy and it would be a dream come true if I can make a living by just talking about things (like a podcast), but I know that's unrealistic.

My take away from going the comp sci route is that I really do not care for it that much, even though I still believe I'm pretty good at it. I just don't want to return to school and go through the same process again. I wouldn't mind a job in the field like databasing and such, and I wouldn't mind getting certified for SQL and the like, but I really do not want to go back to college. It's just not for me. 

I was interested in kinesiology (sports science) at one point and still kind of am. I coached a lot of my teammates being the captain both in high school and college. I have gone with my coach to a high school once to help him coach for a few days and loved it. It's something that I do enjoy doing, but I don't think I'm competent enough to be an actual coach. That and I'm also kind of introverted. I just fake being extroverted very well.",04Feb2020,1
541,"Hi all, sorry if this is a longer post. I’m 21M and self employed specifically in the real estate industry. And the past couple of months I have been struggling with massive procrastination. 

I have tried many things such as getting clarity in my goals and more accountability factors to stay on top of things, but over the past couple months the days have become less and less productive.

I’m at the point now where in my head if I wake up anytime past like 4:30am that I can’t do any work until tomorrow, and I have huge resistance if I even try to do anything if that wasn’t the case. I’ve forced myself to sometimes, but it’s not consistent at all and falls back into procrastination. So I actually get out of my bed every morning at 4:30 to go to the restroom,  but I jump right back into bed and get warm under the covers and go back to sleep. I’ve tried staying out of bed, but at that time for me, I’m cold and I’m sleepy and I don’t care about what my goal or intention was and I get back in bed.

I always feel like shit when I do things like that, and I know it’s procrastination because it’s the same feeling I used to get with school work. The year before this in real estate my career was doing amazing, and I was busy all hours of the day and making great money. Now it went from 5 hours of work a day, to 3, to 1, to virtually no work at all each and every day. 

Sometimes I think that I only work really well when someone else has an expectation of me, which I’m still not sure is true or not,  but I’ve always had an awesome work ethic, and have been at higher positions in everything else I’ve worked at.

Does anybody have any advice to correct this? I know where I want to be in my life, but that still isn’t helping me get where I want, but bringing me guilt daily.

I need some advice and I' too embarrassed to ask on my Facebook. 

Last night I got into an altercation with another driver. I was making a left and so was he but I had the right of way since he was at a stop sign. I started to flip out in my car and so did he. He rolled down his window to shout obscenities and I did the same.

Then he turns around and follows me back into the parking lot. We pull over and he gets out of this truck and comes to my window. Stupid me rolls down my window and he immediately grabs me by the jacket,shouting ""Say something now"" over and over. I tell him to let me go. After 30 seconds he lets go, but I hurt my left ring finger trying to get him off me, and now it's in a lot of pain and will be for a while. It's not broken, just jammed.

I really don't know what to think about it now. I kinda understand though why my best friend won't tell me this; its private, I know. She didn't even tell me about their first kiss. My guy friend had to tell me all about it. Since then I knew the sexual tension was arising between them, especially when I see them together at school. They do kisses here and there when they get the chance. Our other friends warned them about it too. But at this point, I don't even think my best friend is thinking straight anymore.

563,"People of reddit I need your advice.
I’m afraid I’m losing my best friend and I don’t know what to do.
I’ll try to keep it as short as I can.

Background: we are very close friends, we met almost two years ago at the university and instantly became great friends, we had great chemistry together, I later told her that on the day I met her I knew either she will be my girlfriend or my best friend, either way I’m not letting her go. On the day that we met she even told me it’s something she doesn’t even have with her boyfriend. But as she was in a relationship I didn’t act on it, and we stayed good friends. I should mention she’s gorgeous and get a lot of attention from guys.
We even lived together for one year, just the two of us, in a student apartment. Her boyfriend at the time was cool with it, because he knew I wouldn’t try anything as long a she’s happy with him.
Her ex, the one she was with before her last boyfriend, tried to harass her multiple times but I stoped him every time. When they were together he used her and was a piece of shit to her she’s a very strong person, but when she’s with him she’s weak and doesn’t act like herself.


We kept being very close even after we moved out. After she broke up with her bf, we were already such good friend I guess we didn’t want to ruin it. We kept seeing each other every day.
Everything was perfect until two weeks ago.
We had a normal day together, and in the evening when we were kinda tired and lied on the bed she told she needed to tell me something important and she needs me not to get angry. I said sure and she told me she met her ex and they slept together a few days back,
I was furious, she then began to hug me and told me she was sorry. She kissed me and we started making out. My mind was all over the place and I couldn’t think straight. Being the dumb ass that I am, I stopped it, and we started talking about why she met him and everything...

A week past and we acted like nothing happened, I didn’t want to risk our friendship by trying something, and as the week want by she kept dropping comments on how  “in the end it was me who didn’t want her” or “she didn’t think if it would come it I would be the one to stop it” and stuff like that.
I couldn’t get one night of sleep since then and every day she was on my mind, I started thinking how stupid I was and we’re perfect for each other.
And so one week after that day, we want out to a bar with a friend of mine, we drank I was a bit drunk, later then we got back to her place. We laughed and talked and again she commented on last week, I finally told her how I feel and that I do want her, and every day since I can’t stop thinking about it,
She said she was sorry, it was an accident and she wish it never happened that I had my chance and I blow it. I couldn’t understand why and asked for answers, she didn’t know what to say. I felt humiliated as I got up to leave, she asked me to stay, I said I couldn’t and want outside for about 10 sec. got some fresh and decided to come back inside to talk this out and not leave this like this between us. When I came back inside she was on the phone with her ex I asked her to hang up so we could talk, she said no and asked me to leave. I left in anger and tried to call her later but she was with him.

The day after that I send her a text saying something like this. hey, I’m sorry how things ended last night. No matter what happened we’re still good friends and can overcome this, can I one over later?
She responded a few hours later with a long txt saying, I ruined it and not to call her ever again, not to speak to her around campus and that we had something great and I ruined it. And if I contact her again she will file a restraining order against me.
It shocked me, I know her ex guided her what to write but still.
It’s been one week since then and I’m lost, we had fights before but not like that.

Hope it’s not to long, I tried cutting out all the small stuff.

We recently dealt with some issues regarding an old roommate, and decided to stay in the same apartment complex, just get a one bedroom since it’s just the two of us and the cat. A few days after moving in, I noticed the obvious that my neighbor is a drug dealer. A few days after that, him and his girlfriend/wife started having painfully loud arguments for a very long time. And a few days after that, I found out my neighbor has a pretty decent stereo system the hard way.

The fights got worse, his drug dealing clientele got more ignorant, and he just constantly got loud every day with no respect for anyone else in the apartment complex. Usually by now, one would say to talk to the office and file a complaint. We did, many times, and there’s not much that they want to do in the office about it. It’s hard enough to get them to fix their website, let alone do any actual work.

Recently, I came home from grocery shopping to some people hanging on my front steps. I politely said excuse me, and they immediately got defensive saying “yo, don’t tell me to move” in which I told him I would knock them the fuck out if they don’t step away from my front door. I have had clientele knock on my front door thinking it was my neighbors front door so they could buy their drugs. Even that isn’t enough for the office to do something.

Fast forward to last night, the fighting was worse than it ever was. The girl that he lives with had all of her stuff outside and was threatening to leave. It is most definitely an abusive relationship, and she blatantly yelled about how he has hit her many times in the past while drunk. He claims that drug dealing is his real job, and that it is a tougher job than construction workers or agents… Yeah, literally his words. When they were fighting and his girlfriend brought up the fact that she goes to work every day to come home to him he responded with “try doing what I do for one day, bro.“

The police, the office, and everyone else involved doesn’t seem to want to do a damn thing about it. My lease expires at the end of the year, and I think he is going to be there until it rides out.

568,"So for context I just turned 21, I'm a student and I'm currently staying at home. I've been in the same house my whole life, with a single mother who is quite overbearing at times and can have quite an irrational temper. The initial plan was I was going to stay at home while I complete my course, with my mother only charging a generously low amount a month, as a way of saving money. Despite the security I have here there's a lot of negative emotions and bad juju that I associate with the house. So due to a series of events and coincidental timing my three best friends are all looking to move out, my Gf convinced me that it would be a good opportunity to throw my hat in and now we're looking for 4 bedroom flats. 

Now the actual point of this post: I know that getting a place with my best friends will be good for me in many ways both mentally and for my health and teach me valuable life skills, I've done the number crunching and I can afford the rent comfortably (that's just with my student loan and I'm looking for part time work) and this is the only opportunity I'll have to move in with people I know and get along with but for some reason I'm feeling paralyzed at the thought.

I didn’t pay attention for a single moment in high school and was far more concerned with trying to fit in socially and find myself, which I ended up doing quite well in the end. I put in minimum work into every homework assignment and sometimes would go as far as turning in stuff as long as the late policy allowed because I was that lazy and didn’t mind losing the extra points. I ended up pulling off a B average throughout school and it wasn’t until senior year when I wish I had tried harder. The only thing I was involved with was the school's Model UN. I got into our state school, which was the only place I applied, and took the fall semester off. Now I have started and I want something more, but I’m not even sure where to begin. I have been working really hard in all my classes and one month in have all A’s and A+ (I know it’s still early). I haven’t joined any clubs, and am majoring in CS. I am thinking about trying to start my own non-profit this summer, not just because I want it on my application, I have a genuine interest in starting it. What extracurriculars do I need?

575,"This all happened yesterday and I'm still finding it overwhelming. I (37F) was shown a screenshot yesterday of a comment my Aunt made on a news post about JayZ and Beyoncé not standing during the National Anthem at the Superbowl. 

For clarity, we are Canadian, not American, so her disgust seems misplaced to start with. But she ended the comment with a racist remark that I don't care to share. 

I was shocked, horrified, embarrassed, and angry. 

We live in different provinces, so I sent her a message with the screen shot and explained that I was very saddened to see this from her. That racism is not ok, and her comment was disgusting. 

Rather than feeling remorse, she doubled down and said ""Maybe, but they have no respect for their country"". 

So besides the fact that she's uneducated about the issue at hand, she then showed her racism on top of it (which is why they were sitting in the first place). 

I told her that it doesn't matter. Even if she disagrees with the individual actions someone took, it does not justify such hatred and divisive language. 

My sister, father and cousin also all messaged her to express the same. 

She is no longer responding to any of us. 

I guess I'm hopeful that you can teach an old dog new tricks, and that maybe she'll be willing to listen, acknowledge and change, but right now I'm not feeling so great about that possibility. 

So I guess I'm asking: Is it possible to change the attitude of a racist? Can they be educated and see the hatred of their ways? Or in calling out my Aunt for her comment, did I effectively end up cutting her out of my life? (If it means we're done, I'm ok with it.

582,"Has anyone else experienced something similar to this? 

My boyfriend and I recently ordered a treadmill on Amazon and since it was a 225 pound box had to schedule a delivery to our second story apartment. We paid the extra fee to have it carried up the flight of stairs and left in a room of our choice. I had never dealt with scheduled deliveries on Amazon before and assumed that it'd be two moving men with proper lifting/carrying equipment for heavy objects. What I got instead was a headache.

A husband/wife duo showed up at my apartment in a box truck and called me to tell me that the box was too heavy to move up the stairs. I told them I paid for it to be moved up the stairs and they begrudgingly started getting it out of their truck, but not before the husband part of the team told my neighbor that the box weighed 400 pounds and the wife told him it was ""way too heavy to get moved up any stairs"". Once they got it out of the truck I realized they had no sort of useful equipment. No  hand trucks, no lifting straps. They had two tiny broken down looking square dollies that they loaded it into and began trying to shove through my gravel driveway.

Long story short, it took both of them and my neighbor and I to get it up the stairs, almost entirely due to the fact that they were wildly ill equipped for the job. I asked Amazon to refund the extra $25 dollars I paid to have it brought upstairs since I could have just as easily asked the neighbor and my boyfriend to help me move it and achieved the same end result.

Amazon did refund the $25, but about twenty minutes ago the female half of the delivery team was in my apartment building taking pictures of the stairs leading up to my apartment and I overheard her saying that I'm a liar and tried to say that they didn't help me move the box. The way I see it, I shouldn't have needed to help them at all. I'm also not super jazzed about this woman being back in my apartment building unannounced and taking pictures of the property. 

I'm mostly just sitting here wondering if this is par for the course when it comes to scheduled deliveries with Amazon. Has anyone else had a similar experience with Amazon home delivery? How does Amazon hire/outsource their delivery drivers that aren't UPS/FedEx/USPS? The whole thing has been a mess and a joke from where I'm standing.",04Feb2020,1

590,"Dear Redditors,

In the last couple of weeks, I have really been struggling with a lot of things with my GF. We've been together for almost 7 months now, and she's my first GF. Before that I had a crush on a girl in my class which was really nerve-wracking because I completely changed for her. I was overweight, and then decided on losing -a lot of- weight but then she got a boyfriend. Now as for my GF I started dating her about 1 week after we met and everything changed from there on. My GF's really sweet and we laugh a lot together and she also helps me alot but she isn't that smart but I cannot blame her since she is very kind. If I look at my old crush I sometimes fall in love with her again and that's why it is so hard. My old crush has a stunning physique and is smart whereas my GF sort of misses these things (Not that she isn't attractive though don't get me wrong). Now I once made one attempt to just take a pause with my but I couldn't get it over my heart. I sometimes also look at other girls and even girls I have any feelings for and find them more attractive than my gf. One thing I noticed is that always after we go out for dinner or sth. I always sort of love her. But what really sort of holds me back from breaking up is that she loves me (more than I love her) and I can be as weird around her as I want to and I just feel comfortable around her. She also helps me a lot and supports me. When it comes to more NSFW things I can't really finish since I'm not that attracted to her. Maybe I don't know how it feels like to have a gf who doesn't love me or simply haven't had enough relationships and that's where I have my problems. What should I do?",04Feb2020,1

Hi, people, i am a new comer to Boston, and i live at Somerville.  I live in a 2 bedroom 1 bathroom apt. The landlord rent the apt out to my roommate. Before i moved in, she told me that everything will be included and i only need to pay 1100 dollars per month. I think it is indeed a reasonable price. And since its not renting from a agent or real estate and the landlord just living downstair with us, there is no deposit fee or anything. However, one day i was talking to my roommate, and she accidentally told me that the rent is 2000 dollars in total.  But she has all her stuff in the living room and all her stuff in the kitchen and her bedroom is also bigger than mine. My bedroom is way smaller than hers, but i am paying more than her. Originally i thought, may be because the utility and internet are really expensive, however, its not really the case, i asked her, and she told me the internet is 45 per month, and the heat is about 45, i didnt really ask how much is the utility bill, but all together should be around 150 ish. So the total rent should be about 2150. Although i lived in a smaller bedroom, she is letting me pay more than i should pay. Its winter right now, but there is no AC during the summer. So the heat bill will definitely drop once the weather warms up. It is unfair to let me pay 1100 compared with hers. Am I overreacting? I have a decent relationship with her, and she is willing to drive me together to gocery shop and letting me use her pans etc. i just hope the rent can distribute a bit more fair since i am still a student and really dont have much. Should I mention this to her? Or am I overreacting? How should i handle this?

I have been with my other half for 2 years now. We have a good relationship but for some reason I live in the past. We are in the process of getting a property but the cold feet are sure hitting me.  
I grew up in a very fundamentalist household to extreme levels although I left the religion I have internalised mysogynystic  views from my upbringing. I vowed that I would wait till marriage that if I didn’t lose my virginity to the one guy I’d end up with I’d be doomed for life. 
At 24 however I got into a relationship and because it was my first relationship I was a damn fool, giving way too much of myself and time. I ended up losing my virginity to him drunk totally unplanned. We broke up soon after and I began sleeping with someone at work because I had already ‘ cheapened’ my self. 

When I met my now current he was uncomfortable with my past and didn’t like that other men had ‘ had ‘ me especially as one without commitment. He soon apologised, recognised he was hypocritical, worked on this quietly and has never ever brought it up since - it’s as though it never bothered him. 
But still in my mind I find myself wondering every single day if he thinks less of me, if our relationship would be even better if I had waited for him like I had planned. 
It’s making me wonder if I can marry/ own a home with someone I’ve waited so long to find. 
I know it may sound stupid but it eats me up it’s almost mental torture to the point I feel like I’d be broke up witn me I’d be free but at the same time I’d be lost without him.

612,"I’ve been friends (with benefits) with this guy for 2 years now and we’ve really become close friends to the point that I consider him a substitute for my high school best friend that I’ve drastically grown apart from since she got in a serious relationship with her boyfriend. Now, he’s got a new job which requires him to be away from home/country for 8 months a year, but what I’m really having a hard time accepting that he probably won’t have internet connetion so we won’t be able to stay in touch (now we speak on a daily basis for about 2-3 hours). Every time he comes over I’m trying to surppress my tears (I’m even crying as I’m writing this) because I already miss him greatly and I try so hard to cherish these last weeks we have together. I’m so happy for him that he’s got a job that he loves and I share his excitement about it, but at the same time it really pains me to see him leave because we’ve shared so many great memories together, and I’m sad that it’s probably over now. If you could please give me any advice on how to deal with this situation and make it easier for me (he knows how I feel) it would really help me a lot! Thank you so much for all your help in advance!",04Feb2020,1
613,"So I'm a woman, early 20's, and since middle school I've spent a significant amount of time having crushes on other women. There have been 6 women since high school that I've been seriously infatuated with at one point. I can't help it. When I get this crush, I think about them 24/7. It is obsessive. I can't stop thinking about them, or looking at their social media. I find any excuse to talk to them. Every single one of these relationships has followed the same pattern: they see that I'm struggling with my mental health, they decide to be my friend/talk to me, they think that they can 'save' me, and that I've got a lot going for me, that I just need their help, and then I push the boundaries further, and further, and further (nothing sexual, just the amount of time that I take up). Then they block me. I've literally had six women block me from their lives. 

The last two have been female therapists. The first therapist didn't truly ""block"" me, but told me she couldn't work with me anymore. I just really don't want this to happen with my current therapist. Right now we're at the stage where she likes me. The other day I sent her an email telling her I didn't want to see her anymore, and she responded by sending me a 600 word response basically telling me she wanted me to continue therapy and that she is going to support me however she can. This feels so incredibly nostalgic of my last therapeutic relationship, where the same thing happened, except her email was 1110  words. 

The crushes I had in high school weren't sexual, but since then they always have been. I've struggled with my sexuality, and am bisexual, leaning towards women. I've never had a crush on a guy. I have never spent any significant time thinking about guys at all.

Is this some sort of attachment issue? My mom sort of abandoned me when I was a child, and I have a trauma history. Any advice would be much appreciated.",04Feb2020,1
614,"I’m looking into getting an apartment. It will be my first, so, I just came up on a question they’re asking for scheduling a *touring* of the place, asking if I have any pets, which I do, no problem there.

The next question is “have you had any prior criminal charges or felony charges filed against you?” Just as that. I had a minor ccw on my record from like 6 years ago at this point, a ticket only disorderly (a citation not a misdemeanor) but a few years ago I had a felony and a couple misdemeanors filed, but they were all dismissed by reason of plea and I’m clear of that and never convicted. 

So.. yes I’ve had charges filed, but am I obligated to tell them? Or are they allowed to discriminate based on that? I understand when/if they run a background check these things will pop up so you shouldn’t fib, but it just seems more discriminatory then anything else. 

I have plenty of income and a decent credit so I’m not financially worried, just rather concerned questions like those might lead me to getting canned from the candidate list very early on. 

Any thoughts/opinions/tips?",04Feb2020,1

616,"Asking for help
I have seen so many posts on here where people share experience and advice and I am at a loss. I know this is long so I tried to do a detailed tldr. I’ll answer any questions.
Young, 28(f) lawyer. Primary experience in criminal law (internships, clerkship in criminal division, private criminal defense firm post-clerkship) and recently starting working in a private civil firm. Part of keeping my job is passing the bar in February which is less than 3 weeks away. Having never worked in a private firm that handles civil litigation, it took me a while (too long) to acclimate to the job. While trying to acclimate to a new firm with a practice I had never worked in, in any capacity, I was also expected to study for the bar. I split my time between work/studying as 80/20 in November, 70/30 in December, 60/40 in January, and I was about 28 hours behind on my billables in January from taking 3 days off to study. While I am hitting my hours, I am suffering. Mentally, I am drained, I cannot get out of bed in the morning, I leave things to the last second (very unlike me), I have been crying almost every day/night for weeks. Physically, I feel horrible. Coming home and studying after work has been one of the hardest things I have had to do. My first time studying for the bar I had just graduated from law school and I studied for 2 ½ months, 8 hours a day Monday to Friday. I treated studying like a full time job. I barely passed that bar and I am a bad test-taker with severe anxiety. I don’t know what to do. If I take the bar and fail – I could lose my job. Not only this, but sitting for the bar means I forfeit my ability to rely on reciprocity (I could waive in without having to take a test in 2 years).
I am happy being barred in the one state where I currently work, and have no interest in taking another bar aside from trying to keep this job. I have already spoken to my previous boss at the private criminal defense firm and they said they would take me back. Both options wont be easy. But I have become so reclusive, depressed, an anxiety ridden. I have gained almost 25 pounds in 3 months because I eat frozen food for dinner, I barely (if at all) eat lunch or breakfast because I am so busy at work and when I have any extra time I sleep. I have been working at jobs since I was 14, every single summer bartending or waitressing, in law school I had a job every summer and externed during the year. I had one month off between finishing the bar exam and starting my clerkship, I had one month off between my clerkship and new job. I feel lost. I have $40k in savings and I live with a roommate in an affordable apartment. I am fortunate that my family is well off, they paid for my education and I don’t have student loans. For the past 2 years I have paid the full rent for both my roommate and myself, including cable, electric, water and rent. She was kicked out of her parents home, does not have a college degree, and I was able to help her get a job nearby where she makes very little. Because of this, I have helped financially. She has not contributed at all. I have asked her to contribute in any way if she could, even if it was $50 a month it’d still be something. She gets toilet paper and laundry detergent more than I do, but that is the extent of her contributions. I get a lot of negativity from her, which surprises me, about my career choices and decisions. Despite the fact that she works only from 11 am to 5 pm Monday to Friday she has made zero efforts to get a second job with her free time. My family has helped her by paying her for odd jobs because they know she needs it and has tried to get her jobs (once, to my dads detriment).
Now, I am 3 weeks out from taking a bar exam I Know I will fail (which isn’t helping my mindset for studying), my roommate and I are just co-existing because it is clear that I am upset, yet she just goes about her day and doesn’t even ask. She is one of my best friends. I get shit from other people for letting her ‘dictate’ my choices, and its true, if I didn’t feel obligated to help her financially I would be making different choices. At 28, I feel like this is the time to figure things out because I have savings to last me some time between jobs, I am single, untied to anything. I used to be happy, in shape, and loving life. Now, I am depressed, I can’t even bring myself to look in the mirror so I just don’t as much as I can, I can feel myself changing and I hate it. The only time I am content is lying in my bed with my eyes closed just being able to breathe and think in silence. Do I quit my job before taking the bar because I know I will fail? Do I take the bar, fail, and see if they fire me? I am feeling so guilty because I know the firm took a chance on me hiring me, I came with good recommendations, and now I just feel like I am letting everyone down.
 
Tldr: 28 year old with enough savings to take time off, feeling stuck because as a condition of my employment I have to pass the bar, 2 months after being hired. I am failing my practice tests. I asked for time off to study before I was hired and they said no, so I should have known better. The test is in 3 weeks. My roommate struggles financially and I have helped her for 2 years, and she has ignored my requests asking for her to contribute. I am trying to save up to switch jobs (and maybe move) and I am losing half my money because of her. She is one of my best friends. All of this is culminating this month and I don’t know what to do. Quit? Move? I am worried if I don’t do something soon, I may fall into a depressive state, I can feel myself toeing the edge of my mental-wellbeing.",04Feb2020,1
617,"I’ve had it a bit mentally tough growing up. We had food on the table, my father was a stable figure who encouraged me to be intellectually curious. But he never got in the way of my mother’s daily psychological abuse and her open and volatile narcissism. The usual stuff, decades of nursing the needs of a self-absorbed woman, who then worshipped her first son (despite abusing him too, even physically, in one phase), no matter how much he screwed up and brought problems into the family. Despite the preferential treatment my brother grew up to also become a piece of work, he is exceptionally emotionally and psychologically manipulative. Currently he is accused of two rather public sexual harassment accusations. Since my father died I speak to both of them in very controlled, public situations. I am trying not to remember all the horrible treatment. Nor should it be the focus. The focus is I’ve been out of practice when it comes to feeling my self-worth. I live with an overwhelming sense of shame that is often, I know, irrational. But I can’t help but feel I need to apologise each time someone sees me (for being so unsightly) and I get anxiety attacks. I’m disappointed in myself, because I have fought against it. I’ve had a successful award-winning career, I went on to study in amazing schools with multiple degrees. I’ve completed regional projects and now I am on my PhD in one of if not the best school in the world. Yet even now, with all that experience around the world, I hate meeting people (I need to psychologically prepare myself for them all the time, I keep thinking friends and relationships come to me out of pity or secret hatred for me), I revise events in my head as total social failures, I only have terrible, cyclical narratives attacking me. And it’s sad because I’m thirty-five. And I’m exhausted by this. I feel trapped. I’ve tried mindfulness, I’ve tried not listening and going towards my fears. I’m not getting anywhere. And I am afraid that once I’ve run out of accomplishments I’m back to the beginning. Back to hating myself. I’d be grateful for any advice.",04Feb2020,1
618,"I work at a small family restaurant as a waitress for my part time job. I also go to college full time and commute (my school is around 30 minutes away). I told my boss I am only available Friday-Sunday but she keeps trying to get me to come in Tuesday-Thursday (we are closed on Monday). This is not a good option for me. My last class from Monday-Thursday ends at 5:20, so I would get to the restaurant around 6. I would work for only 3 hours which is a waste of my time because I could be doing homework or practicing (music major). Especially since weekdays are slow and you only need one waitress on. There might be a language barrier but I think she just doesn’t care. All of the other workers have a pretty flexible schedule because they need as many hours as they can get (most of them are mothers with children they need to support). I told her it would be fine every once in a while (once in a while in my mind is once a month) but she is slowly trying to get me to do this every week. There is another waitress who could work those days but my boss doesn’t like her as much. She is constantly asking my boss for more hours, but my boss prefers me because I am quicker and ‘do a better job’. 

How do I remind my boss that I can only work weekends (and once in a while during the week) in a respectful manner? I’ve only been working here for a month but I want to set my boundaries early so she knows I will stand up for myself. My mother suggested writing it down and giving it to her so she has it in writing.",04Feb2020,1
619,"Firstly, the boss' wife is on salary but only works for 2 hours a day (comes in whenever she wants). To add to the nepotism here, their niece gets paid $200 a week for ""social media work"" even though she doesn't do anything at all. She emails me every month or so to ask if there's anything she can help with and I genuinely say no (I'm manage the digital aspect of the company, marketing/branding etc). Anyways, the boss' wife brings in her unruly dog everyday and leaves him here to distract and cause disturbances in the workplace. He constantly barks until the boss takes him out, the wife ignores it because she's too busy however I work directly behind her and she shops online most of the time. The dog also chews up and literally eats pens and even eyeglasses. He goes through the trashes and makes a mess. He'll eat your lunch and your only meal for the day with the boss and his wife only feet away from you and they don't even punish him or offer the employee to buy them lunch or ANYTHING. They just tell the dog to leave the person's office.

Today, he ate my lunch and would NOT stop making a mess and eating it, he looks away for a second and I go to grab it off the floor and he bites me constantly until I move away. I was afraid to hit it or kick it. I told them that he bit me and it caused injury but I'm pretty sure all they'll do is take care of the medical bill. But that isn't enough. This dog has costed me so much money in the past and same with every other employee in the office. We've complained about it before and no change has happened. 

I don't feel just by just getting medical payments paid if I'm honest and maybe it's from the built up resentment. I've been wanting to leave this job for awhile but I cannot find another one in this field, this is my best opportunity still at this time. Is it still worth it to value myself more and leave?",04Feb2020,1

The guy next to mine is gross, he has a cough all year round and during the winter months like now he just constantly is coughing and hacking up mucus it’s gross. When he’s not doing that he’s having food. Eats at least two cooked meals a day at his desk and the snacks constantly on apples and chips the loudest things possible. Never chews with his mouth closed and you can just hear him chirping away. It’s gotten to the point where it’s hard to even concentrate for work. The bosses know and don’t like it but they don’t want to more then they’ve already done. They’ve asked him to leave for the day like once a year without me even saying anything it was that bad.

623,"Ugh I feel so stupid writing this, I'm not even sure if I actually have a crush or if I'm just overreacting. Obviously this is my first time ""to have crush"", which is especially embarrassing since I'm already 18 years old haha.. But hey, at least this clears up my suspicions on being aromantic 🤷

I just noticed how often I think of ""him"" and how even the slightest bit of attention he shows towards me makes me happy. But he doesn't make me feel special (stan Twice btw).. Like, people always describe this sort of tingy feeling, but I guess I don't have that? It's just that I like it when he looks at me or if he says my name.
We don't even talk to each other that often and if we do, I feel incredibly awkward. But he's like a total social butterfly who gets along with anyone.

We'd make a horrible couple. I'm that quiet and introverted person while he's the most popular guy in my grade, or school even. The only thing we have in common are our good grades. Our teachers always compare us to each other, but I know he's way better than me. 
If he or any of the girls any found out I even remotely like him, they'd be so disgusted haha.. And I'd go from an unpopular person to the outcast real quick.

Maybe it's just my wish of finally having a crush on someone that makes me feel this way, but why does it have to be him? He's way out of my league and I'm not his type at all.

Whether this is a crush or not, I have to stop thinking about him. I've been feeling this way for quite a while now and at some point he and his friends started posting pictures of them working out and when I saw a picture of him flexing his muscles, I was totally turned off for some reason and just stopped thinking about him. Sounds weird, I know. But now, not even that picture phases me anymore. It's still his voice and the way he talks that get to me.

Nothing was good enough for any of them. No phone calls or visits when I was in the hospital, they watched my boyfriend beat me, every single day is a fight, my room has an outside lock so if they don't want to deal with me they can lock me in, my money is controlled by my mother and I'm $18,000 in debt because of her, I have a camera in my room so my family can make sure I'm not doing something they don't want me doing, I'm tired of finding my belongings in the yard, I'm tired of everything.

629,"Hey guys. 23M and 21 F. I’m super anxious writing this because it’s been a long and anxious process, but my girlfriend and I have officially split up. We love each other for sure and have loved each other very hard for 3 years. About 2 years ago she mentioned she would need a long “break” to discover herself and such - which is totally fair - but led to me being super anxious about it frequently.

So for two years, we did our thing, lots of ups but lots of downs (mostly because of my aforementioned anxiety). All in all, our love was much stronger than the anxiety and we would have so much fun and were so happy together.

During this time she gets pretty depressed - her studies aren’t going well, she’s not seeing friends much, she really just doesn’t like herself and it’s awful to see, but I love her soooooo much and want to help/be there to see her bounce back. It just didn’t happen. 

Fast forward to the present, she had just spent a month out of the country visiting family as she does usually twice out of the year. Her and I texted the whole time, but on a shitty schedule between the time difference and my working/sleeping. We would spend all the time talking about how we loved/missed each other - the usual shit. 

Now she gets home(meanwhile I’ve been sick with the flu for a week so I’m still feeling kind of shitty), we hangout one night, make dinner, cuddle, normal stuff.

Hangout the next night, still seemed normal, had sex whatever. 

Now on the final day, I’m at work and she texts me early in the day talking about grabbing food later and hanging out! We’re excited and happy - normal! A few hours go by and she’s acting strange, I text her we can talk when we hangout later! And she breaks open... basically dumps me via text out of the blue while I’m at work. Things don’t feel the same to her since she’s returned apparently...This is all the day before her bday, which I had taken off from work to spend with her as she knew....

She comes over later, I get out my anger and sadness. We talk. She says she really wants to be with me again once she had this figured out. She definitely loves me and I believe that. We have sex one last time, hold each other, cry a bit. But we always talked about how she just wants me to be happy and was super terrified of hurting me... 

Now it’s been about a week and we still text and say we love each other and miss each other. I am the anxious one so I tend to be more dramatic and stressed and sad and I think I’m just making things worse, but I seriously do not want to lose contact because I still love her and really want to make it work eventually even if years away. She too wants to hangout and sleep together still and do whatever we can to make a future work out... but basically on the condition that I have to be comfortable with it. I just feel so disconnected and fucking sad man. 

It doesn’t help that I just bought my first house and live alone in a town where I don’t know people... it’s not far from my hometown but my hometown makes me sad as hell too lol. 

I guess I’m not sure what to do. I love her so much. She loves me so much according to her and I really do believe it, but I’m having such a hard time letting myself believe it.. if that makes sense. Like my heart knows it but my brain does NOT want to believe it or be left vulnerable.

Do you guys think I’m crazy for thinking it could work out? Do you have any tips for me to gain some confidence and start feeling better? I genuinely want to spend my life this woman and I am basically in a void and clueless right now. 


TL DR : we are in love but broke up because she didn’t think things felt the same. Came at a weird time. She wants to be with me in the future and actually claims it to be “the goal” of this whole thing. I need help learning how to feel confident and good again and wonder if I’m crazy for believing her.",04Feb2020,1
630,"burner account, i never use this website, i just really need some outside opinions right now. also this is gonna be a long one, sorry in advance for the wall of text.

like i said, really long and complicated situation. a few years ago group of friends encouraged me to let a friend of theirs stay with me for a weekend so he could attend a convention. he seemed nice enough and they all assured me he was completely harmless and a total sweetheart blah blah blah. fast forward to him arriving at my home. the second night i woke up to him on top of me. as soon as i realized what was happening i tried to shove him off of me, it got his attention and after a moment he stopped. i didn't really know what to do, i just said ""do not do that"" and he responded by apologizing and saying ""i thought you would like it"".

i told my closest friend from the group (referred to as F from this point on), someone i had known for 4 years at that point, after the perpetrator had left my house. F said ""that's rape"" real bluntly. after that i didn't say anything, then out of nowhere like 5 months later the perpetrator himself fucking texts me saying ""hey, just wanted to check and make sure i didn't do anything that made you uncomfortable while i was there"". i told him he knew damn well he had and there was a word for what he did, he owned up to it and apologized then promised to never bother me again.

as for my relationship with F. our friendship is currently my longest standing friendship, i lost a lot of friends when i came out as a trans woman (MtF for the uninitiated) and in the years following shed a lot more. i met F right after i had started transitioning, he was someone who was there for me when no one else was and i was dealing with a lot of shit from the world around me. i fell a little in love with him and it never went away, he's married now, there's no love story here, just someone i love a lot. i think that about wraps up why he's so important to me.

i decided to tell everyone what happened after the dipshit texted me. the response i got from everyone else was fucking bullshit. i got told ""this is between you and him"" and ""don't expect anyone to do anything on your behalf"". F tried to play the middle ground, he was supportive to me in 1 on 1 conversations but he wouldn't say anything to anyone else, he didn't get upset with them, he just let it happen. just realized i should have mentioned this earlier but F introduced me to all these people in the first place because of my lack of friends and difficulties with socializing.

anyway that was that, i faded away from that circle, eventually met other people, i have a good circle of genuinely supportive friends now. recently something triggered my memory of the incident and i lost my shit. i sent F this huge rambling text about how awful it was of him to not do anything. he just agreed that it was fucked up, ""i know sorry isn't enough but i am sorry"". he's still friends with these people. i told him i wanted him to bring this back up to these people and for something to be done about this guy who raped me.

it's been about a month, he doesn't really talk to me at all anymore, i have to beg for updates on whether or not he's spoken to anyone involved, he's given me excuses and short responses and doesn't seem emotionally invested in the conversations at all. i don't want to lose him as a friend but i don't know how to go about repairing our relationship at this point. i'm sitting here panicking over the thought of losing him but the thought of just dropping it so shit can go back to normal or whatever makes me wanna panic too. i just need some input to help me make a decision.",04Feb2020,1

Now we have a 2 week break (we’re 4 days in now) and well I don’t know if I should text her to let her know that I think about her, but I don’t want to be too clingy and annoying either. Today I sent her a yt short-documentary about how we got to this modern art with the weird shapes and, well impressionism in general, because she mentioned that she’d like to know how art got there.

634,"Logically I know our marriage was bad, that what he did to me was abuse and the reasons why it fell apart were not my fault, but sometimes I can't help but defend him. 
Everyone around me labels it as abuse, but it's so difficult to admit that to myself. I feel like I'm a fraud, because all I can think was ""It wasn't that bad"" or ""Maybe other people would have taken it better and I was just being sensitive"" or ""But I wasn't perfect either"". 

Sometimes I get so angry when I think about him and the malicious part of me wishes that he gets karma for what he did, and that he regrets his decisions, but the other part of me just wants him to be a distant memory. 

I know I'm young and we didn't have any children but what he did to me was life changing; I have significant trauma and PTSD and see a therapist to try and get back to a semblance of normal life back. There's a part of me that wants to confront him, to tell him what he did was wrong and get an apology but I know seeing him or thinking of him isn't healthy. I just feel like he got away with everything he did with no consequences and sometimes hope that everything falls apart for him too. 

I'm moving forward with my life, and I'm trying to put it firmly in the past where it belongs, but I am tired of holding this in.

637,"She's a very sensitive person and has a lot of insecurity issues. The thing is, I need her to start taking more accountability for her actions as she's been treating me like a doormat. She is also exceedingly jealous and possessive of our mutual friend. 

It's gotten to the point where when me and the mutual friend hung out when she wasn't around, and she spent the rest of the evening sulking. She left the apartment alone, ate on the floor of her bedroom, and refused to talk to either of us. She had been out all day and all my friend and I did was watch tv with each other while doing our work. 

It's starting to really bother me at this point. Her and this friend are pretty close, they've even taken a vacation without me before. But I didn't really mind, but god forbid I try to hang out with her and I'm the devil. 

It seems she can't allow me to be equally as important to our friend as she is. 

She also commandeers conversations, talking over people and talking for inordinate amounts of time. It's hard to get a word in edgewise.

I don't know how to bring this up to her because, as I mentioned, she's extremely insecure. She's a very caring person, but I can't deal with her possessive nature. I feel like if I tell her this, she'll spiral into a well of self-hatred, which is what I'd like to avoid. But being treated like I can't matter to my own friend really hurts me.

 I tend to be the calmer, less ""soft"" one of the three of us.  Because of that, I'm put in the position of never being the person to ""rock the boat"". I have to pretend not to feel anything for the sake of this friend, but lately, I've been feeling very disenfranchised. I am mostly unaffected by this sort of thing and because of that, I think she's taking advantage of me. Whether or not she means to.

640,"Backstory: 
I was born a muslim, with a very muslim name, in a muslim country. I spent the last 5 months living in Germany for university (something like an exchange program). I, however, am not a muslim. The way I think is like a hybrid mix of both cultures, western and arab. I cherry picked the best of both sides in my opinion. I have been an atheist for almost 5 years now. 

The Main Topic:
When I visited Germany, whenever I would make any form of social contact with anyone, be it dating or anything else, I’d find the look on their faces would shift the moment they hear my name (Obviously not everyone, but a lot). And it’s not an offensive name or anything it’s just muslim. I also would not get any matches on tinder, I doubt that’s the reason tho, tinder is all about marketing yourself and am quite bad at that. So online dating was completely non-existent. I am aware of the stigma Arabs have and the way a lot of people see us. And at times I don’t blame them, the things that are being done by arab people in the name of religion are horrible. Religious killing being the most horrible thing, but that literally NEVER happens in stable countries, but there’s also how arabs see women as lesser and outright as property. I can go on and on on shitty things arabs do. I don’t wanna fall into my own hole here by painting a lot of people with a wide brush, but so many arabs do these things, that it became impossible to not see it like this. 

I mean, everyone’s ancestors has done horrible things. Sometimes for necessary reasons or religion or wealth or land or whatever. If you’re alive today, that’s most probably the case.

Conclusion:
I’m simply asking, How do I let people see who I am, not who I appear to be? Is there anything I can do about it? Of course I’ve met really open-minded people and they treat me like family. But that shame in the back of my mind of where I’m from and my background, haunts me.

Feel free to say that which you think is right. I’m posting this question here with no expectation. Maybe there’s a side to this am not seeing.

Peace be with you all! :)",04Feb2020,1
642,My best friend and I are moving in together soon. She just got out of an abusive relationship recently. This guy hit her multiple times when they were together. And was verbally abusive. They have talked things out when she went over to their apartment to get her things and they agreed to be friends. But the problem is they still sleep together and hang out. I’m worried that she’s gonna get back together with him. And if she does I don’t want him at our house that we’re gonna move into. And the reason I mentioned moving in together is because I’m not sure if I’m allowed to voice that since we’re splitting the rent 50/50. I haven’t talked to her about it but every time she sees him she tells me. I try to remind her how bad he is for her and that he’s a horrible person. I think she does it because she’s lonely and she doesn’t wanna be alone on her days off and they both have weekends. I’ve had a few choice words with him over the phone and I hate his guts and I don’t want this guy at my house. Please tell me what can I do? I’ve been there for her through her whole relationship and she says I should support her no matter what she does but I can’t support her hanging out with a guy who hit her in the head with a tv remote.,04Feb2020,1

644,"So, I \[M19 - Madrid, ES\]  am not what you'd call necessarily an ""introvert,"" but I am not the biggest extravert ever, either. My class and my classmates are all very very friendly, and quite open, and trust me, they mean a lot to me, because we treat our university and everyone in it sort of as a family. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, somehow, I cannot manage to get a good and real friends-relationship out of this. My university, while open, everyone sort of remains with their old friends and their plans, and when I ask them to do something, sometime, they always respond with the fact that they are ""busy"" (which I sometimes don't really buy, but I don't mind nor do I push people into hanging out with me or anything, people are free to do whatever they want to do, besides, time is precious). When in class, and everyone speaks between lectures, I just tend to listen to music and do my own thing, because I don't think it's worth talking for 2 minutes about nothing.  


However, I then hang out with my friends from my previous schools, who are my best friends, and are also introverts, so we just get drunk, play cards, drive around (when we're completely sober, before the drinking, don't drink and drive, kids.) and talk about life. All in all, we have a great time. I am (one of) the most introverted people of best friends, so that might say something.

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to extend my borders and also get to hang out with people from my main lecture and get to know people who I don't know from my lectures.

I'm just horrible at starting conversations and making friends from nowhere when it's in the middle of the year. I guess it's something to do with confidence.

648,"I am a temporary staff and is currently being overseen by a number of rotating supervisors who are permanent staff. Every supervisor is different, most are unsupportive and IT illiterate, giving promises to visitors to ""find relatives"" even though the software is not able to do so. It lacks basic search functions. You must key in the relationship so filling up the form is a need.

The hospital currently limits 2 visitors per ward. So the some people attempt to circumvent this by just walking pass the counter pretending we don't  exist and I have to chase after them. Others have two visitors come in, then come out, and they expect the next two to be able to come in immediately. Unfortunately the software they use do not reflect that. This result in a buildup of visitors in my lane's queue. This happened to me at least 50 times a day.

Some visitors are very uncooperative and rude. They refuse to fill up the questionnaire reflecting their travel, health and contact history, and don't like having their temperature taken. They claim they are allowed to because they ""come everyday"" and I have a feeling that this is because of different management styles. Some cases are heartbreaking, like family members (in-laws?) who didn't time out and have zero commutation (husband didn't have contact details of in-laws) to the husband of a patient. He waited for hours but still wasn't allowed in. He was very old as well. I decided to help him by logging one of the visitors out, so he would be allowed in. Some how the two visitors time out was never captured for that day. Image waiting a day and yet you can't see your own wife.

I feel that the permanent administrative staff can be rather unsupportive or at best ignorant. They have no idea how the software works, follows the rules blindly without judging the situation and doesn't really seems to know how to lead. I don't feel supported at work, my temporary co workers either have problems on their own (one suddenly revealed to me he's suicidal which I was like wtf) or have zero interest in the job, pushing all the work to me. The health ministry has yet to raise the alert level despite confirmed cases of local spread, meaning the infected didn't travel overseas but caught it locally. It means I am not going to wear an n95 mask despite being on the frontline.

I am sick and tired of having to ask the same questions over and over again, sick of chasing ""runners"" around, sick of strict ""by the book"" and IT illiterate supervisors, the outdated IT department who has never updated their software (i checked software history), sick of taking temperatures and sick of software. 

I may not be a permanent staff but I deserve support too. Why aren't we given the same benefits as the permanent? Why isn't there a staff longue? Why the lack of care and concern from the management if we're coping okay?

Maybe I give too much fucks about his job. I should stop chasing people, stop wasting my timing scrolling (no search function. Stupid software) through name list not even arrange by alphabetic order and throw that stupid form away and give zero shits about the job. The problem is I do take my job seriously but the stress of it makes me wanna pull my hair out. I hope my efforts will not be forgotten when this NCov crisis is over because i am a temporary staff.

Okay, on the advice part, how do I cope with the stress? I am seriously considering quiting before I don't need the money (just waiting for school to start), i hate how underappreciated I am because i am a temp staff, i hate my supervisors.

650,"Please help, I really need reassurance. This is driving me crazy.

(I’ve posted this twice on different subreddits and I’m sorry for that, but I can’t stop freaking out. My anxiety is at a downfall and I keep crying and crying). 

Hi, I’m 18 years old and I live in California. This is a REALLY LONG STORY. Recently, my home has been infiltrated with mice, yucky I know (Since the end of November/early December). We’ve tried just about everything, and resorted to glue traps. Friday, January 24, a mouse had gotten stuck on a trap. 

My brothers and I decided to shove the mouse, with the trap, inside a plastic bag and to not let it suffer, my brother smashed the mouse with a hammer. He claimed that the blood went through and stained the hammer with blood. So, in result, we washed the hammer with the kitchen sink. We’ve never touched the part where my brother claimed there was blood, but we held it by the handle and put it under running water. I proceeded to put dish soap all over it. But, we had to scrub it if there was blood. I set the hammer down on the sink and came back to wash it. I did so and set the hammer aside and put soap all over the sink. The thing is I used my bare hands to wash the sink, I had a cut on my finger because I chew my nails and break sink. I started freaking out about “what if mouse blood went inside the wound?”

This sparked my rabies anxiety craze. I’ve looked so many things up and saw so many results about rabies. I started to cry and was fully convinced I inherited this disease. I went to 3 doctors, resulting in 300 dollars being wasted, to only be consulted rhat everything is fine and okay. My anxiety was relieved and I felt fine. 

A couple days later, last Tuesday, my brother was on the floor playing with his toys and suddenly, touched me on my lip. My lip had a cut on it due to the fact that I bite them a lot. It wasn’t bleeding nor did it look open at this point (but really who knows) I started crying and freaking out, because what if there was rabid saliva from the mice on the floor? What if it wasn’t dry? What if it was wet? All these questions ran through my head. My mind is going crazy. I went to the sink and quickly rinsed it with water and soap but it was so fast and for only like 4 seconds, since my mom caught me in action. My mom had mopped the floor on that Monday night with bleach, and the incident happened in the afternoon. I freaked out because nobody was home all day that day, until we came home in the afternoon. What if the mice came out when we were gone and put their saliva all over the floor? Nobody was home to watch if they were there or not. Then, I went to work and kept messing with the cut and it started to bleed and it opened, and I cried because what if the infected saliva was still on my lips and now it FOR SURE got into my cut. 

The reason why I’m freaking out is because I’m totally convinced that the mice in my home have rabies, even if they haven’t shown any symptoms. The mice act not odd at all and they’ve even had baby mice? But I’m still fully convinced they have rabies, that they’ve put their saliva all over the living room floor, and that it is now in my cut and I have rabies. I’ve read that the virus can survive up to 6 days out of a host’s body. I keep crying, and telling my mother to take me to the ER to get rabies vaccinations and she insists that I’m fine and is not willing to indulge into my anxiety.

I went to the doctors two days ago, telling them what had happened, and the doctor informed me that mice don’t carry rabies and I needed to be bit anyways. My mind didn’t accept this because I know for a fact that mice CAN carry rabies and that infected saliva can enter a wound and give you rabies. I cried in the car a lot. I keep crying. I can’t sleep, I feel nauseous all the time, I can’t eat, I can’t do anything but think of this constantly. I can’t go to class. A slight headache gets me frightened, if my nose becomes runny due to the wind outside I get scared it’s bc of rabies. My head hurts a little right now, and I’m scared it’s because of rabies. 

People tell me it’s so RARE for mice to have rabies but what if I’m so unlucky, that the mice in my home have rabies??? I’ve looked up statistics in California and their counties have been called “Rabies Area” so now I’m even more scared. But, the city I live in hasnt had any reports of rabies or any animals with rabies? So maybe its just unreported? I thought about sending a mouse for testing, but when I looked to see, the submission said “Small mammals such as rodents do not pose as rabies risk in California, and should not be submitted for testing.” I’m freaking tf out. This is damaging me so badly. I can’t live anymore. 

I don’t want to die. I can’t even get vaccines because we don’t have insurance or money and my mother doesn’t believe me. I’m going to die of rabies and nobody cares. Everyone says it’s in my head. I can’t even be home without crying. I keep thinking everything in my home has rabies because of the mice. 

Please help, I just need reassurance. I just want people to say “no you’re going to be fine” I don’t know what to do. I keep crying, nobody will help me. I’m going to die. I’m sorry if this is ridiculous but it’s really killing me. I’m too young to die especially like this. I just need to let this out. I can’t do this.",04Feb2020,1
651,"I have this friend, I'll call him Jack. We were very close when I first moved to my current city four years ago. There was a tight-knit trio of me, Jack and our friend, Ben. We drifted slightly as I settled into my new job and new school and everything. I also started a brief relationship with Ben which I think alienated Jack slightly as we started spending more time together, but it wasn't totally one-sided -- Jack got more into drugs and student politics, I was working multiple jobs and Ben was really focused on student athletics. Ben and I broke up but stayed best friends and still live together, Ben and Jack gradually drifted to the point that they stopped speaking (no fight, just don't have anything to say to one another) and although Jack and I don't hang out so much, whenever we do run into one another we usually end up having very long chats and hanging out for a while to catch up.

One night last October my friends threw me a small birthday party, I invited Jack as I was going through my list of facebook friends. Some friends came back to my room after the party and we hung out for a while, drinking a bit more and playing music. Everyone else gradually left, but Jack stayed and we had a really deep conversation til about 5am. We ended up cuddling on my bed, and he kissed me, which honestly I would have been fine with but for some reason it caused me to have a flashback and an anxiety attack and I ended up pushing him away and leaving the room. He left and I went back to bed, he clearly thought he had fucked up. He ended up leaving his coat so I returned that to him, but we didn't really speak after that until I drunkenly texted him happy christmas, we had a bit of a chat and then he texted me happy new year a couple of weeks later.

The last few times I have seen him, he has been acting very weird with me -- it's hard to explain because he's naturally a very sardonic, aloof person whereas I'm a bit more gregarious and bubbly, but in the past he was always a bit nicer to me, a bit more willing to seek me out in a room and talk to me about nothing. He'll still speak to me if I speak to him directly, otherwise we'll just exist in the same room without him treating me in the friendly manner that he used to, like we're strangers rather than good friends. I don't know how to apologise for my behaviour without telling him the reason for my anxiety, and I'm not really ready to tell people about that, particularly him.

655,I’ve been friends with girl since freshman year in high school which was in 2010. Everything was fine during school. We had sex one time during junior year it kinda just happened one night after I walked her home after we were hanging out at the park smoking weed. We always acted like it never happened. I’ll get back to this. After high school she went MIA due to her boyfriend at the time was very controlling. She ended up having a baby with this guy. Thing didn’t work out between them. She came back Around 2016. We’re class of 2014. In 2015 my high school sweetheart broke up with me and I fell into a state of depression. During that year I separated myself from friends and family. I used to be fun outgoing person but now I’m more of an introvert. Anyways when she came back into my life telling me everything she’s been through and how her baby daddy(BD) was treating her. Me being able to be there for her help pull my self up slowly. I’m just say this she is with out a doubt a hoe. During 2016-present she’s been off and on with BD she’s been seeing multiple guys at the same time. She’s been with more than a dozen of my friends. It’s never bothered me cause it her life and I have mine. As of last year and she started coming to me telling me she wants to change and she doesn’t want to be like that no more. So I told her she basically needs to chill and drop all her sides. Figure out what she wants in life. All though she said this she still haves sides but keeps claiming she wants to change. I like to rave. Fast forward to escape of 2019. She tell me she want to go. She’s never been to one so that was her first. I tell her okay and she says she wants to roll. Also first time experience. I decide to get molly since it’s not it doesn’t hit as hard as ecstasy or lsd. In my opinion. We get the rave and we’re having fun she’s rolling I’m rolling. Then things take a turn for the worse and she starts having a bad trip so I pull her out the crowd sit her down by the swings. Making sure she has water and massage her back from time to time. She then becomes incredibly horny just trying to have sex anybody who will give to her. I decide to leave the rave so I can take her back to my house so her molly wear can off. We get back to my house. She’s keeps rubbing on me and trying to get to me to have sex with her. I’m not going to lie and say I didn’t want to I did my molly was still in full effect so I was in more than in the mood. I didn’t due to the circumstances. I didn’t want to take advantage of her especially in that state of mind. Finally after a hour of trying to get me in the mood she started to relax. We start talking about random stuff. Then she decides to tell me she loves me and how I’m the only one who cares about her and her daughter. Bring up how we had sex in high school and how of lately she’s been thinking about it. Telling me stuff along those lines. I know people say things when their under influence but something in me snapped. Like I always knew the feelings were there but I was just ignoring them. I decide to kiss her pushes me away. Thing get awkward as you can imagine. After a hour or so her molly wears off so I can her home. She then texts me in the morning asking if I remember anything cause it’s mostly a blur for and  what I tried doing to her and I say yes keeping the info about love. After than thing become really weird between us.  She ignored me for about a month due for that. Saying she didn’t know how to react to it. During that month I’m just feeling completely bad about what happened because she didn’t say she needed space or anything sort of cut me out. Finally we start talking again and she says she didn’t expect that from me. She thought I was the only person who wouldn’t try something on her. We make up and decide to not talk about it ever. I still don’t saying about what she said still haven’t. Rn we text about once or twice a week. She tells me about her boy trouble but it annoys me more than anything. She barely ever wants to hang out. I’m pretty sure it due to what happened. I’ve come to the conclusion of telling her how I feel. But when I think about being with her I can’t trust her as far being faithful. There’s no relationship that’ll last without trust. She’s never been faithful in any previous relationship. So as of lately I just been thinking should I tell her how I feel and tell her I can’t be best friends with her anymore. Or just act like everything’s the same. Mind you she’s still behaving the same way.,04Feb2020,1
656,"Title says it all. Always had a flat butt ever since, and I feel so damn insecure about it everytime I see another female with round af peaches--either they worked hard for it or just plain blessed genes. My SO [M 21] has a much bigger butt than mine which, I don't know, makes us kind of an awkward couple by appearance? Like our appearance or physical features has awkward huge differences. In short, I look like his baby sister or some shit even though we're the same age. 

Ya'll know that these days big butts gets lots of praises and worships than big breasts, in my opinion. I know this isn't even important since my SO has been saying he's happy with what I got and what I can give. But I just feel so damn insecure of it--each of my body part seems fine to me it's just this small of a butt gets in the way of my insecurity. 

Does anyone feel the same? Especially for females with small butts who are expected to have round huge butts? How do you deal with it? I know working out is the answer, but what about those who worked their ""asses"" off already and it still stays flat? Due to genes?

663,"For the past five years, my\[30M\] wife \[33f\] has been doing exceptionally well in her bjj/no-gi classes. She won the gold medal in five consecutive tournaments until she struck up a friendship with this strange woman\[24F\] who had recently relocated to our city and joined the same academy.

This woman claimed to be a child prodigy in the sport and regularly defeated my wife in their bouts. The gold medals started turning into silver and bronze.

Recently. I overheard this lady telling my wife that beautiful women rarely beat the ""tomboyish"" ones. My wife is an extremely good looking lady and works as a model while this friend of hers identifies herself with the ""tomboy"" variety.

I am worried that such ideas might ruin my wife's self-belief. She performs quite well when she faces the other women but **she always loses to this friend of hers.** Despite this, she calls that lady her best friend! They frequently go to movies and dine together. A few weeks back, when I returned home from work in the evening, I saw them watching television together. My wife's friend gave me a triumphant smile and proudly declared her victory over my wife in the final match of the tournament. I was so upset that I did not reply. My wife giggled as if nothing had happened.

In a one to one conversation with my wife, I bluntly asked her why she loses to the same woman every time and she simply replied that her friend was ""much stronger"". In fact, I happened to notice one of their practice bouts this Sunday.

My wife's friend held her in such a position where she could hardly breathe and released her only when my wife tapped her on the shoulder. I was scared she might die or something so I asked her friend to release her but she didn't. At the end of the bout, when my wife was getting up from the mat, her friend held her firmly and **slapped her bottom** several times. I found that extremely disagreeable but my wife did not seem to mind it so much and in fact, moved away only after her friend was done with this awful slapping ritual. I later asked my wife to set boundaries with her friend and say a firm ""no"" to all this butt-slapping. My wife said I was overreacting and that this ritual was actually a ""gesture of friendship"" after an intense match. I am scared that a quarrel over this friend might strain our relationship. Is this friendship proving unhealthy for my wife?

TLDR: My wife always loses to a particular opponent, who happens to be her best friend. How do I prevent this lady from influencing my wife?",04Feb2020,1

668,"I grew up in a really toxic household. My step dad was mentally abusive. I would watch him continuously bring my mum down everyday. He favourited my sister and made it clear he had no time for me. Absolutely everything was my fault, I always got the blame for everything. He’d snap at me for no reason and made me feel on edge in my own house to the point where I refused to come out my bedroom. 

And the abuse wasn’t always just mental abuse. I have memories from when I was 3 years old of him lifting me upside down and putting my head in the toilet. No one ever believed me, not even my mum, despite the fact she later admitted to me that when she got back from the shops my hair was wet. When he got really angry, he’d push me and pull my hair. 

We eventually moved out when I was 13 but my mum has still been on and off with him for years now. Round about the time we moved out my depression became really bad. I stopped leaving the house, stopped going to school and stopped socialising. I was suicidal and came close to harming myself multiple times when I was in the house on my own. It was also round about this time my mum found out my step dad was seeing another woman. Instead of being there for me, when I needed her most, she would just go on and on about my step dad to the point where it became an obsession. It was exhausting. She bought voice recorders to hide in his house and everything. It just upsets me she could be so caught up on a man who abused her own child. Surely I should have been more important? 

Anyway for years now she’s apologised for allowing him to treat me the way he did etc but about 8 months ago she revealed she’s pregnant with his baby. I couldn’t do anything other than burst into tears at the news. This would mean he would be an even bigger part of our life’s. I’ve tried to accept it but after 8 months it still makes me sick. She doesn’t have long to go now and I can’t bare the thought of the baby finally being here. 

Family members despite knowing how my step dad treated me keep asking if I’m excited etc. Last night I finally snapped at my mum and said some cruel stuff that I didn’t really mean. I told her she was selfish and I was she had just got rid of the baby. I later then overheard her talking to my auntie with my auntie telling her to just kick me out. Yes, I said some things I didn’t mean but it infuriates me how people can’t see this from my point of view.

675,"Hello Reddit,
I’m not sure this is the right subreddit to ask advice to but I’m going to give it a try.


Basically, I met an international reporter approximatively 4 months ago, since then I only seen him twice.

We don’t talk much, and our conversations are pretty casual, except when he mentions his trips that I find amazingly interesting. He’s a well-known journalist and Ive seen his work on TV so don’t worry it’s safe.

So one day I texted him out of fun « hey why don’t you take me with you during one of your trip » which he totally ignored.

I didn’t expect much so I wasn’t surprised. We talked about other things, but one day (like 1 month after) 
he mentioned it with 0 context, texting « I would gladly enjoy talking with you about what you could bring to the project with your desires ».

(Sorry it’s not the exact translation, we’re both french. It’s not desire in a sexual way, more like « what I wish »)


Anyway, the project that he wants to make is about a special category of mexican women, and basically how they perceive the world etc, and other stuff in South America.

The excitation that I felt, just simply imagining that I could be a part of this project is indescribable.

This would mean a lot to me, being a part of a possibly one life time aventure, meeting incredible people, discovering the different jobs in journalism.
I want to start studying politics next year, and/or possibly journalism and this would help me a lot figuring out what I like.


Anyway I was very happy, but I really didn’t get what he meant by « what you could bring with your desires »

I felt like I could only bring something concrete by being a professional, like a photographer, which Im not, Im a 19 year old student.

I didnt really get the desire part, like why would it matter to him ?

When we talked about it I felt like i disappointed him. I didn’t know what he expected from me (I still don’t tbh), but he gave me some infos; 
he told me that he wants me to be an actor not only a spectator, he even used the word voyeurist, which I totally agree with, I personally don’t get why some people travel in poor areas, post pics on insta talking about « it changed me so much »  while doing absolutely nothing for the locals or only a semblance of humanitarian stuff. 


If I don’t find something interesting to do, I will just stay, I don’t want to be a hypocrite (he wouldn’t take me anyway), but I feel like this is an opportunity that I can’t let slide.

 I want to have an impact in this world,  (Im not delusional, we’re not going to change the world overnight, but all the ppl working so the forgotten can be heard, the diplomats, the association’s givers, just imagine if all of them stop, what would happen to this world ? I know a lot feel like we stagnate but at least we are not regressing all thanks to them)
and I feel like this could be the beginning of something.

Understanding the people I want to help is a must.

I keep thinking about « being an actor » but ugh, I just can’t seem to find what I could do to really help these women.              
What he does is making sure that they feel like they matter, they are going to exist forever inside his films, in the archives. 
He actually helps them.

I don’t even get if he wants me to help him with that or if I have to do something on my own.

Anyone has advices ? I’ve been trying to make a powerpoint for days, I firstly learnt political context about the countries etc, but I have nothing to say about the actual « actor » point... Im lost.",04Feb2020,1

683,"So I have two snakes. A ball python and a rainbow boa. Both are about 4 feet long and live in Rubbermaid tubs.

I will be moving out of my current house at the end of March. I am thinking about potentially moving into an apartment downtown. Problem is they don't allow pets of any kind. They said they don't allow snakes, despite the fact they do not leave their Rubbermaid tub at any point.

If I really needed to, I could just leave the snakes at my parents' house. But that would mean I'd have to drive there once a week to feed them, clean out their tubs, etc. My parents are about 45 minutes away, one way. So I'd rather not have to drive there once a week, considering how busy I am with working overtime + grad school.

I am contemplating just hiding the snakes if I move into the apartment. I already have them in my current house, which I believe requires a pet deposit, but I never paid that and nothing has come of it. I feel like it would be a non-issue if I had them in my next apartment, considering they live in plastic tubs and I could hide them very easily (even potentially locking them in some other opaque enclosure, meaning they could be both hidden and inaccessible, so long as I design it so air still flows in for them to breathe).

At the college-school thing I go to both judo and kickboxing are subjects. I really enjoy them however when we're supposed to find partners this one girl alwys runs over to me. I don't know if it's cause I'm one of the only other girls or not. The problem is, she's shorter than me and weighs less. So in judo  I won't get proper training. She'll also constantly complain about everything or pretend things are fine.

We were practicing leg sweeps (osotogari) and hurt her heel somehow. When it was my turn to Sweep her she was obviously in pain and I offered to sweep her other leg if her heel was in pain. She got visibly mad and was pissy. Last lesson I quickly choose another partner, but the this girls partner came and just took the guy I was working with away so I ended up

In kickboxing she kept complaining that I hit her during sparring. Keep in mind we have gloves with a lot of padding and it was light sparring so they were Very light punches. She kept stopping the fight and going 'don't pnuch me in the eye' (she was wearing a mouth guard so I aimed somewhere else, also the height difference meant she was easier to hit there and her guard wasn't great.) the I hit her on her cheek and she asked me not to. Kicked her in the thigh, same thingv happend. The instructor walked over and told me I should kick high cause I can. So I did (lightly) and she flipped and went full angry mode. The instructor stopped her cause we don't do 'angry fighting'

It’s not just me that tries to avoid her. Everyone choose a partner thst wasn't her. Of course I feel for her and I try to be nice but I don't want to train with her unless I have to. It affects my workout and my technique as I can't work on anything properly. She'll get mad if I try to help or correct her, or if she can't do the exercise. She never wants to do any extra excerices if we have time (it's often partner work) and she alwys complains. I try to make the best of it but I'm so sick if her.

Another thing, I have chronic hiccups and she'll alwys comment. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. I've been visibly annoyed as to try to hint at her to stop, and told her it's annoying (I've had em for four years so it gers annoying in the long run). She keeps trying to talk to me but she's super defensive and gets pissy easily and I don't want anything to do with her. I haven't told her this, but I've been trying to avoid her.

When it comes to training I prefer training with the guys cause most of them, like me, have been training differnt martial arts before. She annoys me and puts me in a bad mood. I don't know what to do as I don't want to be mean with her. I just don't want  anything to do with her...

Side note: I'm 19 and she's 22 but acts 15ish.

I'd be grateful for any advice. I already try to pair up with others, but as I said her partner will usually ask mine to swap so I end up with her (and I don't wanna be a bitch and show her I dislike her)",04Feb2020,1

Maybe if I could turn back time and do it again I might got that opportunity. I tried so hard for it but I failed and yet I kept trying but it doesn’t make any difference since at the end of the day I find myself failing over and over again. It is just too much and I don’t know how much I can take.  No, this is not a suicide note I’m not giving up on life. I just feel so lost and I don’t know who I can talk to. I mean this might be what most introverts feel like when they need someone to talk to. I tried to talk to people and every time it always feels like I got left out. You know I have that gut feeling that I can sense what a person is thinking or might be thinking while I’m talking to them and I’m sure that everybody does. You know when you can sense that someone is not the right person you can trust or to tell all of your problems because it might freak them out (I know and it’s funny how I’m telling this to strangers all over the internet) or even worse that I can’t imagine or think of the awkward situation that could happen. Yet, I know this,the introvert stuff, is all just an assumption in my head. Maybe I have such a negative thought. I mean that’s fact and I hate myself for it.",04Feb2020,1

693,"Hi everyone,

I have hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and with that comes a laundry list of completely unpredictable symptoms and circumstances (most commonly severe dizziness and fatigue). My symptoms are debilitating on my bad days, which have become more frequent recently. 

I currently work in accounts receivable. I requested accommodations for my illness (with the support of my doctor) requesting intermittent leave when needed as I cannot perform my job when I'm in the throes of an autonomic attack. Unfortunately, my job requires constant on-site presence as well as the ability to maintain consistent attendance, which I am unable. In short, they've denied my accommodation request. Nothing against them, they need people who can functionally perform the job requirements.

However, this leaves me in a very tough place. My employer and I agreed that I should start seeking employment somewhere that can accommodate me. But the issue is, I don't think that a place like that exists. I'm not bed bound, so I don't qualify for disability benefits. My illness does impact my ability to work constantly though, so I'm at a loss.

I recently opened up my freelance services again, but I've been out of the game for quite a bit and I have to start from the ground up. Until that picks up, I have to keep working full-time until I get fired for repeated absences.

What should I do?",04Feb2020,1

I was still a bit zoned out from the alcohol so I told her that it was fine and that she shouldn’t be so hard on herself and that I didn’t mind. 

She said that I should be mad at her then stopped texting. Looking back now, I think I wasn’t listening to her when she said that she feels horrible and instead was dismissing what she felt she was doing. What should I do reddit?

695,"So for a backstory my boyfriend and I moved into a rental home on the 1st, this is the first home we've rented and signed a year lease. Previously we were living in an apartment in a downtown area for a few years. We decided to move to a house because we wanted more space, quieter neighborhood and frankly wanted to try it out. Downtown living was cool but for our budget we could get a lot more. After a lot of searching, touring and whatnot we found something that met our requirements. My boyfriend is pretty particular about things so we took our time. We find a cute place in a neighborhood we loved, central air, well kept property, honest and friendly landlord. The issue is the bathroom. My boyfriend hates the toilet and the lack of a ventilation fan. It's a fairly cheap, small toilet that doesn't flush very well. He wants to reach out to the landlord to see if there's a possiblity of us upgrading it. Of course this isn't something we'd do ourselves, and if the landlord wasn't interested in pitching in for it I think it's a big enough issue my boyfriend would pay the costs. We fully understand we'd be ""losing"" money paying for a new toilet and a ventilation fan installed, but it's a big enough issue that my boyfriend doesn't want to spend a year (or more) with a crappy toilet.

So tl;dr

I posted this on another subreddit but no one was commenting and I couldn’t even find the post myself so idk what happened there...

My husband has been so incredibly helpful thru this really difficult time. I’ve been majorly depressed and haven’t found the right medications. Since I’ve been so down and just not even loving myself, he doesn’t feel the love I know I have for him which is understandable. I’ve been suicidal and have hurt myself multiple times and he’s just been my rock and my support. My parents abandoned me and because of that it’s so hard for me to trust people who say they love me and it’s been especially hard for my husband. I’ve constantly told him i hate him when I have depressive episodes and I recently had a septic abortion and that was really hard on us. I wouldn’t go to the hospital until a week In with abdominal pain, vomiting and very high fevers. Doctors said if I had waited any longer i could have died. My husband stayed by my side and put up with my anger and my resentment and just overall awful moods. I was really angry with God as to why He keeps making me suffer but that’s another story. We really wanted that baby and I just had a miscarriage about 2, 3 months ago.

His birthday is coming up and I really want to do something special so he can feel special and loved and appreciated but I honestly don’t know what to do. We don’t have a lot of money but I have about a month to plan. Does anyone have any ideas as to what I can do? I really want him to feel like even tho I have really dark times where i hate myself and want to cease to exist, he is the one person I do love and would do anything for.

Condoms were used every time because we both don't want the risk of pregnancy, but I did realise the last time we did it, when he finished, the condom didn't look like it was on correctly, like it had slipped off a little bit. 

My period is normally irregular but for the last 3 or 4 months, it's come on the 25th like clockwork. I've taken 3 tests (never first thing in the morning though) which all come out negative but I really have this gut instinct. I genuinely don't think I could carry a child because I'm going to uni this year, I'm in no financial state to be a parent. Also the idea of being pregnant and giving birth is extremely distressing to me for obvious reasons because I am trans, and that's probably my worse nightmare, and the idea of telling my parents about this is horrible because they're not the most supportive people.

711,"I'm making this post for my sister (Jessica) who's having trouble with her good friend and roommate (Sophie). The girls live together in a very small dorm room and they get along well, but like in many roommate situations, Sophie feels entitled to Jessica's food and doesn't keep the room tidy or sanitary. To summarize:

\- Sophie will help herself to Jessica's food. She will take food from the shared fridge without asking or notifying her. Jessica has taken to buying ""decoy"" food that she doesn't mind sharing, and hiding her personal food, because otherwise it will all be gone within days. Jessica has a drawer that she used to store her personal food in, but after offering a drawer snack to Sophie once, Sophie now feels that she's welcome to grab whatever she wants from the drawer. They both have all-day access to a cafeteria that is included in the tuition, but Jessica likes having a back-stock of snacks when there's no time to stop by the cafeteria. Jessica feels like she can't really say anything without hurting Sophie and it's a sensitive topic because Sophie's parents are not as wealthy and it has recently come to light that she struggles with an eating disorder.

\-Sophie is a big slob. Jessica doesn't mind this as long as the mess is not encroaching on her side of the room, although it often is. The main issue is that Sophie is very unhygienic- she will leave dirty dishes laying around and let them get moldy. She has been sick for several weeks now with a terrible cough (probably Bronchitis) and lets snotty tissues pile up in the trashcan. She doesn't wash her hands after blowing her nose and because the room is so small, Jessica always catches whatever illness Sophie has at the time. Jessica keeps reminding Sophie to make a doctor's appointment because her terrible cough has persisted for way longer than what's normal for the common cold. Sophie always brushes her off and her latest excuse is that she's too tired after class to go see the doctor. Students here can make appointments very easily and inexpensively, and usually can get an appointment on the same day they call to schedule one.

Sophie doesn't have a lot friends due to social anxiety, and Jessica is afraid to hurt her feelings or cause tension in their friendship. At the same time, she's annoyed and exasperated with Sophie not respecting her space or personal belongings. I would really appreciate if anyone has an idea how Jessica can go about confronting Sophie, if at all, and how it should be worded so that it gets the point across but doesn't come off as hurtful.",04Feb2020,1
712,"Hello Reddit, the title says it all. I'm 23F, coworker is maybe 28F. I've worked at this place for a few years tbh, and previously we got on fine. I think where I went wrong was trying to be her friend, which I guess we were for a while. I have trouble saying no to people because I'm a pretty anxious person. But there's been a few previous people who worked at our office who she decided she did not like, and flat out refused to speak to. One girl she used to totally ignore if she made any attempt to speak. The other wound up leaving due to finding a new job just to get away from her. I had been warned not to get too close, but I like to give people the benefit of the doubt.  Which evidently blew up in my face. 

Now we didn't have a fight perse, she sort of just weaned off talking to me outside of work which is fine as all she really did was text me to complain about her roommate. So when she eased here I was a bit relieved. But now when we work together she will not say hello, does not make any effort to speak to me, no longer will we have coffee or snacks together and she goes out of her way to be passive aggressive to me. Here's where it gets annoying: I like my job, I'm good at. I was recently promoted. I don't want a new job. It is very flexible with my schedule. But my god is it exhausting to work with somebody who will flat out ignore you existence and just stomps around. She quite often will complain about literally anything so to set the scene, an average shift with her we will speak maybe two sentences if it's necessary, she will take some passive aggressive jabs at me, she might see something that annoys her in the workplace and complain about how nobody does anything right, shit like that. 

How do you work with somebody like this? Part of me is telling myself that in life not everybody will like you and she doesn't have to like me. I just feel very drained.  My boss is aware of some issues I had with her a few months ago and we had a chat about how I can't let things get to me to the point where I'm upsetting myself. Which is true I guess, like I said I've worked there for a few years and I'd like to think I have a good relationship with my boss and he knows I have pretty bad anxiety and I am an over thinker. I think part of my problem is that I am dwelling too much on the snide little remarks she makes.

My problem is if I should tell her about it. I would say I don’t have a high self esteem, and in the past, when I liked a girl, I didn’t tell her because of a multitude of reasons, mostly revolving around me not being good enough or something similar. She’s talked about a relationship she was in just after I think I started to question if I liked her, which soon after broke. 

A while ago, we were talking about a dance we had had at one of these camps, which was both of our first dances. When I say dance, I mean more sort of smiling and swaying to the beat with someone else. This brought up the topic of effectively prom for my school, which she was really eager to go to, and wanted me to pass my exams so I could go with her to this, which also brought up the topic of costing each other.

I can go back for a two year diploma in RPN with an okay salary pay off or I can go back for 4 years and do the Bscn and become a fully licensed RN. I need advice on what would be a better option for me. If I was 18 and entering school I would for sure do the full RN program, but at the age of 25 I am wanting to start a family and don't know if I feel like waiting until 31-32 to do so. I guess my question is, is it worth it to bite the bullet and do the 4 years, or can I make a comfortable career with the 2 year diploma and then maybe look at continuing into RN when my family gets a little older. Any help is greatly appreciated! Thank you!",04Feb2020,1

733,"I’m 14 and my mom passed away, before she left she told me not to trust anyone in my family because everyone fucked her over. They stole about a million dollars in inheritance money from her. Now I’m staying with them and at times they seem sincere but then at other times they seem like they’re putting on a show. I watched my grandma call at least 8 people and fake cry each time about my moms death. My dad has always been a dead beet but he offered to take me and my sister in with him but the trouble with that is that I have a baby brother who I don’t share the same dad with. I don’t think my dad will take a kid that’s not his in, and I can’t leave my brother. Also I think my brothers dad is trying to take my brother away. Before my mom passed she was very careful with visitation from my brothers dad because she always knew that my brothers dad wanted to take my brother away from us. I don’t know what the fuck to do, I have no one to talk to about any of this. I don’t know who to trust.",04Feb2020,1
734,"A few days ago I was walking through an outdoor walkway, kind of like a nature trail. I had just bought a drink and had some time to kill so I decided to go and sit on a nearby bench. Walking towards the bench I saw a weird looking man, but thought nothing of him and sat down. After around 40 seconds he comes back and walks past me again, which I found very weird but just assumed he went the wrong way. But then he walked back a final time. This time he stopped about 20m from me and proceeded to walk in circles. He seemed to be checking if anyone was around. Me, now feeling uncomfortable, decides to get up and leave, so I do. When I look back, the man is running towards me so I run away. I look back and he has stopped running. The whole situation freaked me out. I think about it quite a bit.

736,"I’m really bad at reading people in if being around them is healthy for me. I always have been and if anybody could help me figure out my shit I’d be very grateful. 

My friend is a year older than me (she’s 21) and she’s always been hard to be around. I feel like I have to monitor everything I say so that she doesn’t get pissed off or upset. We’ve argued a lot but I don’t normally get angry about anything for more than an hour. It’s been 6 days and I feel like I’m just getting angrier and I don’t know what to do about it. 

She left her charger on the 25th of Jan then came into my work (food retail chain store) the following Thursday and started yelling about how she’s gonna kill me because I didn’t bring her charger for her to pick up. I think she was joking but she was pissed.  She’d sent me two messages. One saying she’d lost it Sunday 26th and one saying she was free the following Tuesday. 
I told her I’d talk to her later because I’m at work. She’d alarmed my supervisor and annoyed a fair wack of customers before leaving but luckily we got no complaints and my supervisor left it at that. I phoned her straight after and I was pissed but stayed calm, trying to explain to her how inappropriate and disrespectful she was for coming into my work and acting like that. She said “Im not in the mood for this right now” after telling me how it was my fault and that my supervisor was stupid. She gave me death threats while I was at work! Of course my team leader was concerned. Everyday since then I’ve messaged her when I’ve been in. All she’s sent since then was a paragraph about how she will let it go as long as I get her charger to her. I messaged her saying that she can’t just say an argument is over because she’s uncomfortable; that’s not how that works. I’m so frustrated.  

She hasn’t messaged since. 

What am I supposed to do?

It’s been a week and I just want to throw her stuff out and tell her to go ahead and collect it all from the tip. I’m so mad. How do people stop being this mad?",04Feb2020,1
737,"So, since Windows 7 is no longer receiving updates or support, my dad decided to upgrade to Win10, he's been having trouble working his way around it.

Now, he's 65 years old and has Alzheimer's, so bear with me on this one please. He's had trouble switching from the older OS versions to Win7, but took the hang of it afterwards. Now he's struggling a lot more than I imagined.

What are some good settings / software / themes(?) that will make his experience feel more like Windows 7?

Mainly, he needs an easy way to access his files, a decent start menu and a way to get rid of unnecessary features like Cortana or that stupid Notifications bar.

738,"Hi I’m a 23f and I think I have some sort of anxiety. I’m asking for advice rather than seeing a dr because I don’t want this to end up being nothing and these feelings are totally normal. I didn’t necessarily have strict parents but my parents had high expectations of me that were reasonable- be a nice person, be considerate of others, make good grades, go to college, be polite, show authorizes the upmost respect, etc. My mom and bio dad split up when I was very young (like 2) and it’s been her and I ever since, she remarried when I was 5 but there’s always been this bond between us that it’s us against the world. I have these separate feelings of I’m not sure how I “love” my mom or dad or other family members or significant other. I feel like the way I love my mom isn’t nearly as much as she loves me and I hate it. It’s annoying that I know I should talk to her more (I moved out recently) but I have this devil voice saying “this is your life you should live it like you want to. Taking this space and not talking to your family as much as they would want shouldn’t be taken personally, I’m just in my young 20’s doing whatever- going with the flow”. So why does going home or talking to my parents get me to nervous? For example I was watching the super bowl game with my friends and my mom tries to FaceTime me, I decline it and was going to text her if I can call her later. She was out of state, and I knew this, and she texted me before I could that she just wanted to call me to pick out a shirt and that she would just talk to me when she flew home the next day. I took it as a threat but why? Was I wrong for declining her call when I knew she was out of state about to come back home? Why do I feel this resentment towards these people who I’m suppose to love unconditionally? I haven’t made the best choices about school and my lifestyle that I’d like to keep private but I think I’m going about it the wrong way. I constantly think my whole family is upset/mad at me or talking about me when I don’t show up to a small get together. Do I feel this way bc I know I shouldn’t be so private about my life? I just need some insight on what’s wrong with me",04Feb2020,1
739,"I’ll try to keep it short. The job pays just over half of what someone in my position (new grad etc) typically makes. The city is one of the #1 in the country for retirees, but it’s main industry is summer tourism. So it’s boring here 75% of the year, but the COL is insane because we get hundreds of thousands of tourists, year round population is ~15k.

The job itself really isn’t bad. It’s in tax. Here are my issues: One, I don’t like working 11 hour days 6 days per week, never seeing sunlight. Two, the way we do our billing, if I’m not actively working on a specific project for a specific client, I do not get paid. Since I’m still new, there are periods where I don’t have work. So I’m physically at the office 10-11 hours but only paid for 8-9. Three, just stress. I vomit every morning before work bc I don’t want to go in. I’m having pretty dramatic auditory hallucinations at night and do’t get any rest. Four, this is so embarrassing, I was called to HR last week because apparently I smell disgusting. For anyone wondering, yes I already was showering twice daily and using both deodorant and perfume, but I don’t have a sense of smell so god knows how long I’ve been stinky. I bought new super expensive deodorant and have been running home at lunch to reapply every day, so I really hope that’s fixed. Lastly, I don’t know a soul up here. The other intern gets invited out to bars and stuff, I (obviously) have not been so every night I watch a little tv then go to bed super early. It’s really depressing.

If you managed to read all of that, I guess I’m not sure if I’m just a lazy POS that doesn’t want to work or if I should more strongly consider quitting and getting a job at McDonald’s or something. The only thing locking me in is a lease with 3 more months, but I could technically cover that with my emergency fund.",04Feb2020,1
740,"I just turned 16 yesterday. There's a lot of complicated emotions I'm feeling but this is the main issue. 

I'm actually kind of embarrassed to say these things out loud. I've never realized that it was an actual subconscious thought process I had until a few days ago and I'm kind of scared that it makes me arrogant and self centered to think this way at all.

I recently had a boyfriend. It was my first time having a boyfriend and I was so excited. I have very strict Indian parents and if they had found out they would have killed me. Anyway, I really thought he was in love with me, and I with him. It was an on and off relationship and he told me it's because being in a relationship made him feel trapped but he still loved me and stuff. Very messy and if you want to know the rest of the details you'll have to go through my profile: all about him running away and me talking to his brother and him telling me that I was the only one he told about running away... Anyway, he ended up breaking up with me by ghosting me for 2 months over a misunderstanding. 

Recently we started talking again, just as friends. He's always saying how he's depressed and sad. He's doing online school now and he doesn't really see me or anyone else anymore. Recently he hung out with his ex from like middle school and they went rooftopping at night and cuddled and almost kissed. He told me. It's been months since he and I were a thing but that still killed me.

That was the kind of stuff I wanted to do with him. And then he told me the only person that makes him even remotely happy is that girl. This fucking broke me. I thought that all the conflict between us was because he wanted to be with me but his issues with intimacy screwed that over.   Now I'm slowly learning that he was only attracted to me sexually and that I've never actually been ""loved"" like I thought. Now they're having their own coming of age moments together... The ones I so desperately want to have.

It feels weird and cringey to say this but I can't help it. I'm so jealous and sad. I really thought that even if we weren't meant to be, we had a deep and meaningful teenage relationship.

I just feel cheated.  I don't know what to change to be That girl for a guy, y'know? Be the one that makes him happy. I just feel like I'm always friendzoned by all guys eventually. They tell me about their feelings and they tell me all their secrets but like.... I'm never the one they talk about like my ex does about any other girl he likes.

I'm not even that bad looking guys, people tell me I'm like a 7/10 so like fuck. It's gotta be my personality. I'm not love interest level, I'm like the Girl The Guy Hooks Up With before they realize Who Their True Love is. Or Friend Who Gives Advice until the main character has a Turning Point. 

Fuck. Im so honored my friends trust me enough to tell me about their deeper thoughts but when will I stop just being the therapist friend and be wanted in that way? What do I do to fix this?? Why am I not gf material? Why am I always less than other people????

On top of that, I'm taking all APs next year. I have to get into Georgia Tech. So this year is the last moderately teenage year I have left and I'm spending sad and worried about grades and being Less Than.

I'm going to have a lacklustre 9-5 job life aren't I? Come home to shitty kids and a husband I don't love and just be so fucking N o r Mal . I saw a Reddit post the other day about how this guy misses highschool and being a kid and how going to a job every day of your life is just fucking horrible and boring and mundane.

742,"   In short I fell for a 'take-over payments' for a scam on a vehicle I had a loan on in California in 2015. I did however, draft a contract with the potential buy that was notarized in person at a UPS store. Fast forward 8-10 months after receiving $0 in payments and I recieve the repossession notice. I have suffered and dealt with my legal responsibilities on that end for the last 5 years.                 

     Turns out the buyer sold the vehicle for about half of its value in cash to an elderly couple, who the truck was then repossessed from. I am only aware of this from speaking to their legal representative and subsequently clearing my name with their firm by faxing a copy of my ID and his clients confirming I was not the individual they dealt with. I believe the buyer sold the vehicle using my name as he was also provided with a copy of the contract. 

    Since then, a young lady from a different part of California  has contacted me asking if I knew the buyer. She referred to him with the same name he used when dealing with me, but refused to share his contact information as she had a sale pending with him. I have been unable to contact the buyer since 2016, despite hiring a PI for some time in an attempt to locate and serve him.

743,"I like this girl, but we only truly see each other in the summer for a week and in autumn for a weekend (camps), and sadly we live in opposite sides of the boarder in Ireland, neither of us can drive for a few years, so we would have to take the train, which will take hours to just get to her, never mind spending any amount of significant time with her. She knows I like someone, and she recently said she liked some as well, but said he was oblivious, and would wait for him to take the hint. 

My problem is if I should tell her about it. I would say I don’t have a high self esteem, and in the past, when I liked a girl, I didn’t tell her because of a multitude of reasons, mostly revolving around me not being good enough or something similar. She’s talked about a relationship she was in just after I think I started to question if I liked her, which soon after broke. 

A while ago, we were talking about a dance we had had at one of these camps, which was both of our first dances. When I say dance, I mean more sort of smiling and swaying to the beat with someone else. This brought up the topic of effectively prom for my school, which she was really eager to go to, and wanted me to pass my exams so I could go with her to this, which also brought up the topic of costing each other.

745,"I just want to start off with saying that I'm not addicted to porn, I don't watch hours upon hours every day nor do i chronically masturbate multiple times a day nor does it get in the way of my life.

I feel conflicted because of NoFap. I don't participate in NoFap but it's also something that has been messing around with how I view porn and it makes me doubt whether I want to watch it or not, even while I consume it these thoughts pop in and I become confused. I can feel my mind and body saying ""There are better things to do than doing this, start investing into your own life just please do something"" but at the same time it's like ""In moderation it's okay no harm done"" but jesus christ this whole NoFap thing has fucked with my mind.

I personally do not believe the whole ""energy boost"" that comes with abstaining, I mean yes, not jerking it every day will give you energy but what really determines how much energy you have is how physically active you are and what your diet is like. Abstaining from masturbating isn't magically going to give these people superpowers, but at the same time this whole ""anti-porn"" thing has riddled my mind and I feel like I want to side with the ""anti-porn"" side but at the same time i watch it because I want to relieve myself, I don't have a partner that I can be intimate with nor am i healthy enough mentally to support such a relationship.  


I mean as a person, I don't do anything. Don't have a job, don't have a girlfriend, don't study and I live with my parents as a 25 year old, so one might think ""Oh yeah you'd probably watching porn all the time then"".

750,"My cousin is getting married in a touristy area this summer that is a 4 hour flight away from where I live.  I'm married and have 2 kids (3 and 6) and we made tentative plans for all 4 of us to fly up there on a Friday, go to the wedding on Saturday, and then fly home on Sunday.  Three of the four flights would be free because my husband has a ton of miles, and our rental car and hotel rooms would also be free.  The one flight would cost around $700 and wouldn't be a financial burden.  But my cousin announced that the wedding is kid free and now I'm rethinking all of us going since it's such a short trip.  

Should I just go by myself or should we all go anyway?  We can't extend the trip because my husband travels for work and already has trips planned on either side of the wedding, so we aren't able to turn this into a proper vacation.

* It's easier to travel alone (my 6 year old had a bad experience on her last flight and travelling with kids is a PITA)

I recently got a scholarship and am not sure if I should tell my parents about it. I think I should withdraw it and put it into an investment account instead, while they pay the fees as planned. Here's my reasoning for this:

1) We are not struggling financially. We are not rich but certainly not struggling. My sister has left college so they just have my fees. They have planned for it.

2) The cash for the tuition has been kept in a safe for some time along with most of their other cash. It is only depreciating. Putting my scholarship money in an investment account would achieve way more of a return.

3) I could use it for them in the future. I do not plan to use it for at least some while - it would be nice to gift to them at their retirement or something.

4) They would not see the point of taking the money and putting it away if I were to tell them about it - they would rather see it being used to cover expenses in the short term.

765,"Hi everyone.

So I (25f) am spending a few days away way with my ndad and his fiance next week. As of last night I cant stop thinking about this memory and I couldn't sleep. This has happened before with other memories.

The current one is the following: 

Myself, my two younger brothers and my dad sit at our assigned seats at the dining table. My mum is not there. I ask where she is. Dad says something to the effect of ""It's not important, eat your dinner"". 

I hear something in the room off the kitchen, I get in there before ndad can stop me and find my mum in floods of tears trying to cry as silently as possible. She tries to get me to go back out to the table. Dad is furious and also tries to get me back to the table. I cant remember if he dragged me, but that would be normal for him.

I am demanding to know what's wrong and what he did to her to make her cry. He keeps telling me it's none of my business. I keep saying my mum crying is my business.

I cant remember how it ended, or what my brothers were doing. I have a feeling we were quite young. I remember I never found out why she was crying, but I know now that he was never shy about letting her know how physically repulsive he found her. So could have been that.

The thing I cant get over is my dad's plan was to have her silently crying in there the entire meal and to not let his children know where their mother was. She would have had to go past us to leave that room. Our meals took a long time due to his obsession with table manners and not letting anyone leave the table until everyone was finished (plus some extra time for our 'food to go down').

770,"Hello everyone, 

I’m a [22F] and I recently blocked my now ex on everything [22M]. For the last month or two we’ve been having a lot of problems ever since his dad passed away. He snaps at me whenever he’s in a bad mood and doesn’t know how to communicate properly anymore. Whenever he’s angry, he likes to yell and take it out on me. I’m not a punching bag. He’s changed a lot and it’s getting to the point where I’m really starting to dislike him as a person. 

We were having problems a week ago, and I just stopped responding to him because I needed to cool off. In his mind, he thought I was done with him. So on Friday night when we weren’t talking, three of my friends called me and told me that they saw him at the club with a whole group of people. My ex doesn’t know that I saw videos of him surrounded by a lot of his friends and a lot of girls. When I asked him about it, he lied and only told me that he was with his friends. When he called me yesterday he said, “I thought you were done with me. That means I can do whatever I want.” So I had to ask my friends for the full story since he wasn’t telling me the truth. My friends (who I haven’t talked to in a long time btw) said they saw him walk out with a girl and he was really close to her. They said he didn’t put his hands on her or anything but he walked out with her &amp; followed her out the club. When I asked my ex about it he got very hostile &amp; said that he didn’t do anything that night. I don’t believe him at all especially because I always catch him telling little white lies. 

My mom told me not to jump to conclusions but I don’t think that I am. It doesn’t sit right with me at all &amp; I feel like I should follow my gut on this one. Do you guys think I jumped to conclusion too fast?",04Feb2020,0

773,"Been texting my wife about this for the past 30 minutes.  I would like to go, free seafood is cool, but I'm concerned about transmitting something to my niece.  She's healthy but was very premie and is just now getting up into normal weight for her age.

For the 'sickness', It wasn't bad at all for me.  Last thursday I noticed a throat tickle which developed into a cough, which then turned into headache/sinus pressure/drainage/sore throat/cough.  By Sunday things had gotten a little better and I didn't really feel ""sick"" anymore.  As of now, I'm still coughing a little due to drainage, my nasal passages are a little irritated, and I have a slight headache and sore throat.  An important note here is that my wife also developed a cough during this time, though hers has already gotten better.

My office (IT in a cube farm) is a chorus of coughs and sneezes, and the sickness that's been going around is a topic of discussion.
Also to this point, my SiL's husband also has an office job so it's possible he's come into contact with the same pathogens.

My wife has said ""well I'm going to leave that up to you.  If you feel you are too sick or too much of a risk then let me know before I get off work"".  I am struggling because I don't know the correct course of action here.  I see 2 potential futures for me:

1. I stay home, and look like a dick who didn't want to go to his SiL's birthday dinner.  What makes this even worse is that, since my wife was feeling a little ill over the weekend, it looks like she was willing to tough it out but I'm a weenie or didn't want to come.

2. I go.  Things are probably fine.  Or, a couple days from now my niece gets sick, and maybe it's no big deal, or maybe a week from now they're back in the hospital getting it taken care of.

I do not know which of these options is the correct one.",04Feb2020,1

So to get things in set, there's this girl I've known for a few years and we've always been in the same class. The first year I knew her I had a big crush on her and was getting pretty good signals from her but I was a noobie so it never happened, I never even asked her, it just went away after some time. Then I kept this small attraction towards her for a few gears but now the crush is back and it's pretty big but the thing is we're not really friends. I mean we do have a good acquiantance but not much more. She's starting to show signals again but we don't really talk that much but at least when we do (in class) talk it's pretty good. She is totally in my league so I think I should be fine here but this is where I need help.       What do I do ? 
Do I ?
- Become friends with her but this might take some time and I'm afraid her crush might die out if it is real and if so how ? How do I make it not weird and obvious that I like her. I'm not really sure. I have really good female friends but most of the time I'm friends with them because my male friends are friends with them but this can't happen here because my friends aren't friends with her. How do I approach this ? Im

- Go for it right now but this might be too risky and might not be a good start for a relationship. 

I don't wanna sound creepy and depending on the way that I do it, both of the options could lead to me looking creepy.

777,"Yes I’m a teen. No dad hasn’t done anything bad. I juts don’t seem to like him as much as my parents. I seem to grow distant from him and exclude him in my life. Admittedly, sometimes I exclude him intentionally and that is disgusting to me. I want to try and love dad but it seems so so hard. It almost feels like any time I talk to him, I have to or I’m in trouble for something (which is rare). Typically he’s off on business trips or in his office for half of the day. I’m the type of person to be tired all of the time so it’s unlikely  you’ll get much conversation from me once I get home.  Apparently I’m missing out on many father-son activities. Also he and I don’t share many of the same interests

Sometimes I unknowingly hurt him when I try and respond to his questions but it comes off as dismissive because I’m tired.

781,"My entire life I've been walking on eggshells living in this house. When I say there are fights everyday between my parents, I literally mean that. I'm not exaggerating that claim. They will literally fight and get loud and disturb the household almost every single day. I'm in my 20's, and I pray everyday that soon I'll be able to escape this mad house. I've never been able to bring friends over due to the massive embarrassment that I would have inevitably had if they started fighting. My father has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and can barely keep it together. He has an extensive history of violence. He has been in and out of jail for putting hands on people violently in the past.  My father refuses to take the necessary dosage to keep him glued together. He keeps insisting on taking a fraction of what is required. I've spoken to his psychiatrist about this and the dangers he brings to the house, yet he can't convince him to take the full dosage, so he says. My dad last night went off on my mom while me and my brother were upstairs. It's just another normal night. We typically have the doors closed all day in both of our respective rooms. Last night my mom yelled out ""HELP ME!"".  We both ran down to see what happened. According to my mom he pushed her to the floor and threatened to ""snap her neck"". My dad pulls out a knife from the kitchen and threatens to kill both me and my brother if we don't go back upstairs.  My mom yelling bloody murder and threatening to call the police, sent my dad into a panic and he ran out of the house. For hours he sent foul text to the family. Eventually he came home and we managed to calm this nightmare down as much as possible. What's upsetting is that this story may not even be the worst story from our family history. My mom has a lot of issues of her own, and she will never get rid of this guy. They've been together for 30 years now, and nothing has changed. She will never ever leave him, and she will do anything and everything to keep him and my brother and I in the house, but We can't stay here. It's like a hostage situation. The constant verbal abuse, fighting, threats, property damage, it's just too much. We want to leave this madness, but we are very poor. My mom managed to convince my brother and I to take out loans on vehicles and they have us up to our neck. The payment is ridiculous! As much as we need to leave, money is the issue. With no money, we're almost forced to have to live this nightmare every night and we are trapped.  Sorry for the rant guys.

J is negotiating a huge deal with U (for Unsuspecting third party).  I don't know U very well but he seems like a decent, honest guy.  He has no experience doing deals like this.  He and I have talked a few times and he has shared some of the details of the upcoming deal.  The more he shared, the more nervous on his behalf I became.  

I suspect, based on my previous experiences with J and his wife, that they have a particular plan in mind that is going to screw U (and in a way that can't be well addressed by something like getting a lawyer or going to court).  

The way I see it, I have three options: 1) say absolutely nothing to U, 2) tell U exactly what I think J and his wife are planning to do and 3) something in between.  

I have no real reason to look out for U other than ""doing the right thing"" and everything to lose (quite a lot) if I say something and it gets back to J that I said something.

801,"I posted this on r/LegalAdvice but I suppose I didn't phrase my question properly so my post was removed. Anyway,  
I need to give you some backstory for this situation so here goes:   
I work at a car dealership, and in late December/early January it was discovered by a Sales Manager that a Salesman and his sister-in-law (who does NOT work for the company) were remotely monitoring and had access to employee computers to gain access to parts of the system he normally wouldn't have access to, and customer information in order to be the first one to contact them so he has a better chance of getting the sale. This Salesman has been #1 for the past few months.   


The Sales Manager who found all of this out was very transparent with everyone, and said that the Salesman may have had access to the HR Portal, meaning that he had access to employee records, SS numbers, account information, 401K's, etc. The Sales Manager went on to suggest that we seek legal advice, and go to an attorney. I did this, and essentially, my attorney said that nothing could be done unless my information was used - if my credit card was used, my SS number took a hit, etc. The Sales Manager also alerted HIS direct boss, the General Sales Manager, showed him all of the evidence and explained the entirety of the situation.   


Everybody assumed that this would be an automatic fire. Not only was HE downloading customer information, his sister-in-law, someone who has NO business seeing thousands of customers' private information also had access to everything. Basically, the General Sales Manager took the Salesman into his office, effectively slapped him on the wrist and told him not to do it again. He got away scotch-free, the Owner wasn't alerted of the situation, and work proceeded like nothing had ever happened.   


Fast-foward to yesterday - Monday - when I came back after a coveted weekend off and logged into my desktop. There was a tab dead-center of my screen that read ""Remote Access"" and was prompting for a code. I took a picture of my desktop, showed the same Sales Manager who then went in and confirmed that, yes, an ""Unknown Account"" had access to my computer. He quickly disabled access and reached out to the General Sales Manager who said, and I quote, ""What are you trying to say?""   


The Salesman is off today but shortly after the Sales Manager disabled access he showed up for no apparent reason, walked the lot for a little bit, and then left.  


I have been using my laptop since, as I do not feel comfortable using the desktop computer. I am sure that the General Sales Manager is not going to act on the situation, yet again. He took over less than a year ago, and the dealership has steadily been going downhill since. This particular Salesperson has been one of the few to consistently sell 20 cars per month, but I am absolutely certain it is because he has had a very obvious advantage.   


Basically, my peace is this; his sister-in-law has no reason to have access to the customer system, or the employee records. The reality is that so much information is compromised, and I have no reason to trust that he and his family are not using it, or selling it. I'm trying to figure out what to do next. I think that the most logical step is to speak to the General Sales Manager, but if that doesn't go anywhere, talk to the Owner. 

But by doing so I would be going over 3 people's heads. I'm not the only one upset, obviously the other Salespeople are as well. What next, Reddit?",04Feb2020,1

804,"Hi guys I have a very interesting dilemma. I started talking to this guy soon after I ended it with my ex boyfriend of 3 years. It was at first a rebound. Something to just get me out the house and to get my mind off of him. However things happened and I ended up developing feelings for this new guy who we can call J 

Me and J’s relationship got serious rather quick. He told me on many different occasions that I am the woman of his dreams and that he plans to marry me in the near future. As time progressed he told me he plans to do so this summer ( as soon as he has enough money to support the both of us ). A couple of weekdays later he got a promotion in his job. This was the first big step for the both of us. I got very excited and started taking the relationship more seriously because I sensed a proposal would be coming soon ( like he said and his friends have been saying ). However the relationship took a down hill. It started with his ex girlfriends pictures ( explicit pictures ) were on his phone. I brought it up and told him on many different occasions that I was very uncomfortable. I had to bring this up 6 different times for all the pictures to be deleted. Then I planned a mall date and for the both of us to go shopping. We first had to go to the mall he wanted and shop for him first which I got annoyed of at first but did adjust my tone and attitude to not ruin the day. When we finished picking out some attire for him and it was my turn he had a whole attitude and wanted to go to another mall to get more cloths ? I got very frustrated however he then dropped and we went shopping for me. I decided to go to another mall. On the drive there I was directing him and we accidentally went the wrong way and he got mad and yelled. I told him there’s no need to yell I simply forgot the way to go. We finally arrive and I pick out my cloths and I ask him if we can go down the street to another store so I could pick out a couple of more things. He immediately gets frustrated and says that he has a event to go to and he’s running late . He had to help one of his close friends set up her birthday party. I got very angry and told him to just drop me off and ask why he didn’t tell me this earlier then we could of just planned this shopping trip another day . He replied “I didn’t know it would take this long “ . I told him then to just drop me off at the store since he was in such a rush. He then offered to come in with me if I hurried but I declined and told him no don’t come in Since I was no in the mood for this anymore due to him not even trying to help me pick out some cloths previous to leaving the prior store . He was just standing there on his phone. He ended up leaving me there and I had to call a friend to give me a ride back home.

He later seen how his actions were wrong and apologized and I let it go. Weeks past and another situation happened. I was sick and need to go to the clinic. I called him and explained and before I could get to the part of asking he said “are you asking for a ride ?” “do you need a ride” in a rude tone. No offer or asking me if I’m okay. I got offended and declined his offer. I ended up explaining my frustration and he called me childish because I’m a grown women who could of just “asked “. I got angry and just ended up ending things and blocked him number. He then proceed to text me off another number saying he was a “100% done “ . We then started arguing again and he disclosed how his mother kicked him out. I felt bad how I reacted to this situation and apologized and asked if he needed help. He kept declining and then told me he was in his own little world . I tried to help him and was about to take a Uber to his location when he finally answered my 30+ calls and said he was “fine” and that I was “childish “ and he wanted to be done. I then cried and said I was worried about him and was having anxiety this whole time and asked why he couldn’t just tell me he was alright. He just said “sorry” and after a while of me asking him questions he ended the call. Out of frustration I told him I wanted nothing to do with him anymore especially since I tried to cater to his needs ? And he couldn’t even take me to the clinic or check up on me when I’m sick and in pain. I felt extremely offended and told him to never contact me again and removed him off of all my socials. 

Am I wrong in this situation ? Is the way I approached this wrong ? What could I have done better ( positive feed back please ) 

What should be my next steps moving forward ? Should I just let things go ? I haven’t heard from him in almost 24 hours ? 

How can I better myself from this situation ? Any advice would help :(",04Feb2020,1

806,"  Ok, so before I get into the story, let me go into some background. For a couple years I worked with a girl at a restaurant. We'll call here M. The two of us got along very well, and we quickly became friends and would frequently talk about this and that. Before I continue, no, I don't have romantic feelings for her. I saw her more as a cousin, as she was a few years younger than me (I have no sisters, but a lot of female cousins, so for me girls I only like as friends go into the cousin category, and no, I am not one of those people who are ok with dating a cousin. I’m not in that part of the country).

Now some days she would talk about her boyfriend, you know, the usual stuff girls do, complaints about this and that. But as time went on, the complaints seemed to be more legitimate, and raised red flags. Things like she could not have any friends that were guys, even if they were childhood friends or could only talk on facebook, or even if they were gay. He did not want her going on a trip to her home country Brazil, which is where a lot of her family and friends were, because he didn't personally know them. Stuff like this went on, and it made me think that while I only heard her side of the story, this guy was possessive and controlling. Now, one of the other people I worked with, lets call her C, became her friend, and told me that I just heard her side. I still kept my opinion, but kept the fact that there were two sides of the story into consideration. Now I didn't tell C what M told me, as I assumed she must've knew as well. 

Fast forward a year, I just got back into the state from college, and decide to talk to M. Turns out she no longer worked at the restaurant, and worked at a supermarket down the street from the restaurant.  A little later, I found out her and her bf had broken up, but still hung out and worked at the same supermarket. Also, the sisters of the bf started working at the same restaurant I work at, and also became good friends with C. But, things seemed to be going well. M and I and up hanging out and going for a walk, and are talking about things so far, this and that. Things are going well. Then, about two weeks later I have to get surgery, and this is where stuff starts. 

I told M about the surgery, so during the recovery she would shoot me a text and ask if I was ok. One day I asked her how she was doing, and she said she was a mess, and showed me a text between her and her ex. Basically, she said that she didn’t want him in her life, which considering they were together for 5 years previously, would understandably sound harsh. His response was “oh, do you want your virginity back too?”. Now, I understand being hurt about being told by someone that they don’t want you around, but that response really pissed me off. The next day, I ask her how she was doing, and she was freaking out. Turned out her ex had physically abused her at work, and she threatened to report him. Members of my immediate family have had to deal with abuse in the past, so I took what she said very seriously. However, she was too afraid to do it since she thought it would ruin his life. She ended up not doing it, and the two of them got back together. I am assuming they kept the whole thing secret from their friend group (the bf’s two sisters and C), as they seem to think everything is fine. It’s been a year and a half since the abuse situation, and M and I haven’t really talked much. I understand why that is, and I don’t judge her for it. I am also well aware that I don’t know the full situation, or what ‘physically abused’ means in this case, but the situation still bothers me. The reason it still bothers me is I work with the people that hang out with M and her bf most of the time, and I have a strong feeling they don’t know what I know. I find it very frustrating that in the past I said something seemed wrong about the bf, and the people I was around said I was wrong, when from what I was told by M, I was right, and still no one thinks so. Someone they call their friend is in a relationship that they support yet don’t know what I know.

What I’ve been telling myself is that it is not my place to tell these people I know someone else’s personal story, especially when I am not involved in their friend group. Also, I think there could be a lot of things they know that I don’t, or maybe things have gotten better between M and her bf. I really can’t know since we don’t talk much now, and it probably would not be appropriate to ask her if things have gotten better in her relationship, since I may remind her of what happened. 

I still don’t plan on telling them, but the situation never leaves my mind because of where I work, and I currently can’t find a better flexible job with my schedule as a student. I’ve been trying to find a way to move on from this, or just forget about it, or accept it, but I can’t. I want to know if anybody has any advice as to how to deal with this, and just what they think in general about this situation. Am I acting obsessive? Is it normal to be this bothered about this? Was staying quiet all of this time the right choice? And is there a better way to think about this whole thing that might bring me closure?

I really want to know what you redditors out there may think.

808,"Hi everyone! This is a throw away because I normally wouldnt feel comfortable even bringing up these issues to anyone..

You can read but just to give some background on me and why I am... how I am... 
Basically, growing up my mother was and is constantly bipolar. She had never went for treatment or help as she is from a strict Asian background. When I was young however, I already had some other scarring childhood trauma.. my grandfather had sexually abused me as a child and my best friend had died from cancer. Since my mom refused to believe in mental illness, so did my dad, and subsequently, I went without seeing a professional psychologist until much later in life.

At 18, I ran away out of how unhappy I was- and only ended up in a more abusive situation. At the time, this man had kept me locked up in a room, with 0 to no social interaction, had raped me, starved me out, and at one point broken my fingers. 
I was a very fortunate case because I was probably saved by the most wonderful group of friends I could of probably ask for today. They called the cops for me, got me out of that abusive household, helped me to restablish myself, and then dealt with my psychotic issues from the trauma as it came.

This was all pretty much 8 years ago. Since then, I have moved back home. I took physical theraphy classes for 2 years to start strengthening my body to walk again and do the basic rehabilitation of everyday life. It has been an incredible struggle. My mind was not at all where it is today. I now have PTSD, several slipped discs in my back / disc degeneration, panic attack dosorder, schizophrenia, and just horrible anxiety. There were times when I would go into a panic attack and I would completely black out. According to my psychologist / friends / family, I would basically disassociate from my surroundings and turn ""off.""

My anxiety has brought me so much discomfort in my life. Ill avoid what i consider to be stressful situations and ill avoid most people if I can help it.
After many many years, Im finally at a point where I can identify my stressors and hopefully minimize the effect that my anxiety has. I dont constantly seek out anciety inducing situations...

My love life is complicated. Not many people can have the patience to deal with someone like me. I feel like theres so many other people out there who might be like me, but are constantly told that their mental problems are messed up too.. but onto the issue.

Ive felt like a freak almost my whole life. Most times I feel like I beling nowhere and Im almost always scared that the older I get, the lonelier Ill be from separating myself all the time. 


I finally have managed to see someone for the past 2 years and some change. We only get to see each other on the weekends (Saturday noonish until Sunday noonish)

On Saturday, I had a horrible panic attack. A lot of things were stressing me out and Ive had to turn my car around 4+ times on the freeway at peak traffic time to just get things for people or go back and bring something with me. On top of finally arriving at my destination and having no parking, no food, i was just about done. It felt like someone had put a brain spike in my brain and I stopped thinking.
I came to his house absolutely in tears and he was upset at me. Didnt console me. Just asked why did I have to be in tears, silently ordered me some food. This is the routine, I just accepted it and moved on with my day and thanked him for the uber eat order 

Move on to Sunday and he said he wanted pizza. Sometimes I eat breakfast in the morning. Sometimes I dont. Most the time I do a routine like this all week or just on the days we dont see each other. I told him Id take him out to get pizza before I leave for the day to do my errands.
He didnt ask if i wanted pizza. He didnt ask me what flavor. He knows im a picky eater and should hopefully remember i dont care for supreme pizza at all (especially since we were about to order for dominos last week and he asked me for my order - all italian sausage... simple right?)

Anyways, once he picks up the pizza and gets back in my car. He asked me to eat the pizza- I said no thanks dont feel like it. He then proceded to kind of argue and be standoffish saying i should of told him my pizza order.
Then he went on to care about my needs and still insisted to get me something for breakfast- but by this time we already made it back to his place.
I said while still in the car, i guess I can look around.
Instead: - gets out of my car, stalks off, gets mad about the pizza even more, but the kicker is this:
""So, if I can go down to the doctors and get them to sign off saying, I am anxious, itll give me a right to act like a brat."". All i said was I dont like supreme pizza :/

Unrelated because at this point I wasnt mad or crying.  No attack. At this time; he has refused to contact me and it just hit 48 hours- normally he calls nightly. What do?

I just spent the last 48 in a whirl of emotions between feeling like a freak and anger over the misunderstanding?

TLDR;;
I feel like a freak because even though Im with someone- it feels like they dont support me / understand my mental problems and are taking it out on me? 

Im emotionally exhausted and at this point it gives me more anxiety. Ive been holed up in my room / car for the last 48 because i just feel unconfident that no matter what I do- its just...like is this even a relationship if he cant understand my needs ?

811,"Good afternoon fellow redditors,

So I have a tough situation I'm going to do my best to clearly explain, so here we go –

I had to move recently b/c my roommate was a psycho (another craigslist crazy) so I was desperate to find a place and during the process, I found a place I loved. I told the owner of the property management company I wanted to take the place, I applied and kept in good contact with the owner of the company. I was really pursuing this, but the owner of the company said, ""Oh, I hadn't heard from you so I rented it."" But I was hitting him up literally every day. So that fell through, and I was really upset b/c I really liked the place. Then I found another place, I went and looked at it, and liked that one as well, so I said I would take it. They told me to go get an electric account in my name for the residence, but my manager at work said I should wait until I definitely had the place before I put the power bill in my name. At this point, I was living with my sister and had one day before I had to be out, or I'd be living in my car. I kept trying to get a rental application for the place, but they wouldn't send me one, and then they told me that place had been rented to someone else with better credit, so that fell out from under me as well. (All the while, the places I was applying for were getting more and more expensive.) I had to move by the next day, and started to absolutely freak out, but then they said they had another place that I could check out. So I didn't get out of work until 7pm, but had to check the place out before I committed to it. Basically, because of the situation I was in when I went to look at the place, even if I didn't like it, I was going to have to take it. Fortunately, it worked out and I really liked the place. The rental application had already been filled out at this point, and I moved in the next day. However, when I looked at the listing on the internet, I'm 99% sure the ad said ""Heat included!"" which is a major plus. But when I went to sign the lease, they told me heat was electric, and I would be responsible for it on my power bill. So that was incredibly disappointing and misleading. I talked to one of the other new residents about this when I first moved in, and she said the same thing (heat included.) So this was really upsetting, but I didn't have a pic any longer of the original listing since I rented it, and the listing had been taken down. Anyway, I moved in, and there were a bunch of deficiencies.

Refrigerator not plugged in - I haven't lived too many places where the refrigerator needed to be plugged in, so I didn't know how to do it. The only way I could think of was to open the door and pull the refrigerator out. I stopped tho, b/c I was worried about breaking the door off. I even tried shaking and moving it, but it wouldn't move. I didn't wanna break it, so I gave up and let the property management company know. After multiple reminders, and after about 25-30 days of waiting, they finally fixed it. I got a text, ""Oh, that's not fixed yet? OMG!"" But they didn't check in with me or anything, and I ended up eating fast food for the whole time, since I couldn't keep anything cool in the fridge. Additionally, when the contractor pulled the refrigerator out to plug it in, he ripped my linoleum floor and it's an eyesore b/c it's the first thing I see when I walk into my apartment. I told the property manager, and she said she'll mark it as ""Move in"". So uh, that sounds like it's my fault. WTF

Fire hazard – My dad is a master electrician, and he said \[while looking around my apartment\] at one point, someone hooked up a timer for the water heater which was a good idea, but it was shoddy with a ground wire exposed and isn't safe at all the way it is; It could cause a fire at any time.

Sink – I had a drip in my sink that I let one of the contractors know about. I thought it was great that instead of fixing the leak, he just changed out the faucet. However, I don't remember testing the sink, then the weather got really cold, and now my sink is running like my pipes are frozen, but the weather has warmed up a lot and there's still almost no water flow. The pipes may be broken, I'm not sure.

The people in this company are obviously incredibly negligent. I let the contractor know about the sink not working. About a week ago when I apprised him of the situation via text he said, ""Is tomorrow ok to come look at it?"" I haven't heard from him since, and the sink is not fixed. I let the property manager know about all the deficiencies a week ago INCLUDING the fire hazard (which should merit immediate attention), with no response whatsoever. I've been super patient, but now I'm becoming super agitated, and this is a horrible first impression, when I haven't even lived there for 2 months yet. I'm so pissed off, guys. What can I do? If I pursue code enforcement and make them fix the problems b/c the unit isn't to code, they'll be mad and then they won't fix the rip in the linoleum floor, which is obviously not related to safety. If I wait and wait and let them get away with this, they're gonna think I have no backbone, and try to take advantage of me even more. I tend to be very direct and I'm an I-don't-beat-around-the-bush-type, so I tend to upset people easily. People don't take too kindly to a direct approach, so I'm trying to be very delicate in this situation, and approach with tact.

Legal action? Should I just move out, skip out on the lease and just simply tell them that I don't feel safe there, and they're showing a complete dereliction of their duties? I'm so disgusted, and completely stressed out. Long story short, my old roommate tried to murder me. He came at me with a hammer and a knife, screaming. I thought things would be so nice in a new place of my own, but the stress continues. I'm absolutely at my wit's end, and I don't feel like I have many options.

I'm not sure if I need legal advice per se, b/c I'm not sure I need to take legal action. But I'd be interested in your thoughts as to how to handle the situation.

Thanks so much.",04Feb2020,1

Before you say anything, i'm not the loser/FA type (no offense to anybody at all). I really don't care what girls, or anyone for that matter thinks, and have no problem approaching a girl or starting a conversation with her. 

My only saving grace has been that i somewhat excel in the looks department, and get a lot of stares blah blah etc. from girls. THE PROBLEM comes in when i mention, that despite the fact that girls show interest me, i am not allowed to go out with any of them, date them, kiss them, etc.

I usually don't care what anybody thinks as mentioned, but recently i've been having doubts and it's taken a toll on my self-esteem. First off, i'm turning 18 soon, and never even had one best friend to share moments with. 

I will be going to college next year, and i'm afraid i won't be able to fit in solely because of the reason that i'm somewhat different than most. Different upbringing, different culture, have had no social life, etc.

As for what applies to relationships, as aforementioned, i have had many opportunities, and will probably (at least i hope so) have them in the future as well. But i always get somewhat self-conscious of the fact that i'll have to reveal to the girl that i will share my first kiss with, that i have had no social life, nor have i ever fooled around with a girl, and that deters me from making the move and actually dating someone.

Any advice on finally actually fitting in as a social fucking human being in the midst of people instead of being helicoptered by family members, making friends, and explaining to a future girlfriend that i didn't have a say in the fact that i'm still a virgin?

827,"First semester of freshman year, I was taking a 101 class which was a large lecture style class of 300 people where I sat in the front row. My professor seemed to know who I was and we spoke more frequently as I had some additional needs in my class for ADD. Throughout the course of the semester everything seemed fine, however as time progressed there were some strange comments made that i just brushed aside. For example he would mention to me after class that he noticed that the guy next to me was flirting with me. He then would have his TAs watch to see if he flirted with me additional times. Another time he mentioned that he noticed I was a weak girl… and he also bought me something small for my disability which I thought was very nice at that point but now i'm not sure if it is strange. Moving a little further on in the semester after taking my final he said if you need anything ever just let me know and I was thinking that nice. So later in the following semester I was thinking about changing my major to the subject he taught because his class had been interesting and my current classes were stressing me out, so I went to go meet with him as his class was the only one I had taken in that subject. When I met with him he completely avoids talking about anything to do my potential switching of majors. He proceeded to ask if I would be staying with my boyfriend over the summer, and when I said I would continue to see him he my boyfriend was just seeing me as a friend with benefits. I thought him mentioning my personal life like this was inappropriate, even though he was a casual professor. He then told me that I should “seriously call him over the summer”, and asked why we had never gone for a walk together yet. He then proceeded to say that we should go for a walk “away from all the people”. At that point I became nervous so I said my parents were waiting for me (it was move out day) and I started to leave. As I was leaving, I saw this funny picture someone in my class had given him, and he said “yes but I dont have my eyes on him my eyes are on you.” and when he said that I left very quickly because I felt weird. Fast forward to this year I hardly saw him at all until this semester when I began to see him frequently. He now teaches his class right after one of my classes, and frequently comes up to talk to me as I leave my class. The strangest comment he made to me the other day is when he came up to me as I was walking into the student center and he said “hey I was thinking about you all weekend.” I found this very strange.

828,"TL;DR at the bottom

My friend (F) had her first sexual relationship with an ex-drug dealer. They’ve been an on-and-off relationship for almost a year. The thing is, this is her first relationship EVER, and it’s like a ‘friends with benefits’ sort of thing whenever they aren’t ‘together’. In the beginning, they went on plenty of dates but he didn’t want to make it official because he wanted to fuck other girls (which he did). Normally, I wouldn’t be this worried but she has completely changed. She has this ‘no care’ attitude, she completely blows off her friends. She has a tendency to bottle her feelings up as well (which she has done in the past), so she’s not the most stable person either.
Last month, she had a pregnancy scare and yet she continues to do unprotected sex with this guy. Also, she’s a minor (15) and he’s 17, almost 18. Me, along with another one of her close friends, want to report him but we’re worried that if we do she’ll get suicidal. She’s a really fragile person and there is no doubt in my mind that she’d cut herself. She distances herself from her friends and only really confides in him. Oh, and her parents don’t know. 
I think i’ve said everything, so please help!! I’m really desperate at this point.

TL;DR My friend (a minor) is in an emotionally manipulative relationship (and she has not past experience) He’s 17, soon to turn 18 and we want to report him but are worried she’ll turn suicidal (she’s  unstable) Help!",04Feb2020,1

Hi, I’m a teen girl, half Chinese half Indian. Living in a racist state and in middle school. Recently I’ve been paying more attention to my ethnicity, I gradually learned to become proud of it, as a kid I was bullied so bad for being asian even now I’m made fun of only for being chinese.. but also my darker Indian skin.. I have more Chinese features (everyone around me is white btw) I have a lot of trouble accepting myself now, although I’m the center of all asian jokes, I have been called a number of racial slurs for my brown skin tone. Since everyone around me is just white blonde hair blue eyed, Ive gotten 2 or 3 people calling me black (I’m not even close to it, I have very Chinese features, light  brown skin, Chinese last name, straight (but thick) hair) they know I’m not black, but they call me that because I am the 1 and only person with a darker complexion. I have a lot of trouble, and if I’m being honest I feel envious of light skinned asian girls, I wish I were them. I would be accepted by at least the asian community. What hurts the most is when I visit Asia, (China, Japan, Taiwan, etc) people look at me as a complete outsider and like I’m gross for having darker skin. It makes me feel like I’m not asian at all. (In Asia, dark skin is frowned upon) I hate when people comment on my skin tone, it makes me feel inferior and makes me confused about my ethnicity. I will never fit into any community. I just want to be full Chinese. When people call me blasian it hurts too.. I’m so sorry for saying that, I cry every single day please I really want someone to help me, someone reply to this. I feel so left out I just want to be full chinese.",04Feb2020,1

I go to therapy and I’m on meds, so I’m doing all that stuff right. I’m $5000 in credit card debt.

Her father left her, both her husbands left multiple times (still married to the second), both her daughters (my sisters) left her for her first husband (our father, who was physically and verbally abusive, also sexually abusive to my sisters which was an extra slap in the face). Grandparents always called her a whore, even though she was a virgin to her husband. She has a brother but he got all the attention from her mother. She even says they were raised like separate children.

I give these details because she is a bit paranoid of losing me, and I sacrifice a lot of freedom to work with her pain. She’s a wonderfully strong and loyal woman who loves her family, so I’m not saying that she’s an awful person.

850,"Hi guys, first post here.

I am a 35 year old stage 4 cancer patient. My cancer is pretty rare (Appendix Cancer) and I've been fighting it for 6 years now.

I could bore you with all the horrible shit I've been through due to this awful disease, but I will keep it short.

I live in the US and the first and only kind of clinical trial for my specific cancer in the entire world is in Australia. Luckily, my husband and I were able to drum up some funding last year, and made it to Australia for 3 weeks while I was on the trial (April 2019). The best part is... the trial WORKED. It reduced my largest tumor by 50%... the first thing that has ever worked on my super-resistant cancer.

Fast forward to this year, where my tumors have not only grown back, but are larger and all adhered together into one large lump inside my abdomen. We need to go back to Australia ASAP before I run out of time. The thing is, the trial has been approved here in the US, but I have been waiting since last January for the FDA to allow it to become up and running. I can't wait forever. And my husband and I are still trying to pay off debt from our trip last year (couldn't raise enough to cover everything).

So I have several aquaintances, but am not a huge social butterfly. I've blasted my GFM on my facebook, but the donations are slow. We're trying to raise enough this time to cover EVERYTHING so we don't end up in debt again, but I'm afraid we won't make it. I've even reached out to a local newstation, but no dice.

Does anyone have ideas for ways to get more donations? I HATE asking others for money like a fucking beggar but this is my LIFE we're talking about. I'm only 35. I want a longer life. And the only thing standing between me and that is money. :(

Thanks for reading.",04Feb2020,1

IOP is intended for people with like…addictions and eating disorders and shit. i’m just depressed from living at home. but my mom says i’m “f***ing lazy”. my therapist and her attacked me today over saving my homework for last minute. they think i’m a nut case. they think i can’t do anything right and if i don’t do my homework right when it’s assigned i’m not going to be successful. i studied with my boyfriend the other night and without even knowing how it went they both told me that it wasn’t a proper study habit and i wasn’t going to do well. my mom told my therapist she’s “so f***ing done” with me that she wants me to “move into the old people community” with my grandparents. my parents went from loving my boyfriend to now not liking him and today my therapist tried to encourage them to like him even less. he’s literally the only good thing in my life right now. then my mom told me she watched us make out on our ring camera the other night and instead of being a depressed teen with no passion she wants me to start doing more normal things like that and like putting makeup on so i look pretty for my boyfriend. i don’t get anything that comes out of her mouth, she’s so contradictory. all i know is i’m going to community college right now so I could prove to my parents i could do well and go back to my four year next semester and i’m doing my best and they think i’m already back into my “old habits that caused me to fail and get taken out of school last semester”

i have no hope for my future anymore because i can’t do a single thing right for my parents. they expect me to be perfect and do my college assignments the night they’re assigned. they want me to start packing up the house for our move two months from now. i get in trouble for everything including going to see my boyfriend and doing anything causes me anxiety because i don’t know how my mom will react; if she’s going to judge me and tell me i made a horrible decision or tell me that i have homework and shouldn’t have gone out or if she’s going to sit me down and talk to me about how i give it up too fast or…god i just wanna be back at school or somewhere far away from them. i can’t even tell my parents how badly i want to leave because they’ll tell me how ungrateful i am for how much they pay for for me. college, horses, my phone. but what difference does it make if i can’t be a functioning adult?

Then my sister got married and so other sister moved out. Since then, she has been sleeping on my couch until she finds her own place. She is not on my lease and I have a one bedroom apartment.

She has severe anxiety, so doing things like meeting with people about apartments is hard for her. She is also very indecisive and wants to travel and hates the idea of being stuck somewhere, which might be part of why she’s dragging her feet.

We were best friends in kindergarten and first grade, but then she moved to a different school. She moved back in 7th grade, but I didn't talk to her until freshman year.

881,"It  has been decided that I need to go to residential treatment. We have found a place that we believe will be a great fit, and I've heard really awesome things about it. The issue is- while our insurance covers most  of it, upon calling the main admissions leader for the facility and  having him look everything over, he said that we would still have to pay our deductible + the out of pocket maximum, and then insurance would cover the rest. He said that it would cost $6000 dollars in total $3000  deductible, $3000 O.O.P Max. I really don't want my parents to have to pay that much. I'm wondering if there is any way we can lower the cost.  We don't just have $6000 lying around. My parents just had to pay about  $10,000 in total for my sister's funeral and memorial stone a few months ago, so we really don't have a bunch of extra spending room.

Is there any way to lower the cost so that we wouldn't have to pay the $6000? Any advice? Thank you!",04Feb2020,1

884,"So I’m 16f and confused in my sexuality, and also very stressed and upset over this situation, as a friend of mine properly kissed me, and she has a boyfriend. 

If I was a guy, and she had kissed another guy, i don’t think she would have done it. I feel that because she’s ‘straight’ (or bi and closeted ?? ?) that she views kissing girls as not a big deal and doesn’t count as cheating. However I feel awful. I know that kissing someone else is wrong and I feel terrible for her bf. Is it cheating?

The whole thing kind of made me feel sick. It  was unexpected (well apart from the fact she flirts with me all the time) and I was just in shock and kind of felt like I  HAD TO kiss her back. I didn’t enjoy it at all. I’ve kissed in total 2 girls properly, and both times i’ve had this experience where I feel so grossed out and have to stop myself from ?? gagging? whilst kissing them bc I hate it so much. I don’t know why. I know it’s ok to like girls too, i just don’t seem to enjoy actually doing stuff with them. anyways. she kinda pulled me in all of a sudden and started making out with me, pushing me back into the wall. I eventually pulled away and said i had to go (after much hesitation from her bc she ‘wanted me to skip classes bc she missed me’) n it took me so long to get her to let go of my hand n shit. 

She came back to my class halfway through (she had a 2hr break) and was waiting outside for me and she told me to come over to where she was and she pecked me again on the lips for like 5 seconds and was like ‘i love you’. bruh. At first I felt all those familiar “ew i hate this i wanna throw up that was horrible’ feeling (despite being somewhat attracted to her) but then I immediately felt horrible for letting her do that. I felt so terrible straight away for her bf. It’s not a cool thing to do and I don’t think it matters that I’m another girl. It’s cheating plain and simple right? even if she technically isn’t into it right?

I see her tomorrow and Usually in my class on wednesdays she’s usually so touchy feely holding hands and shit w me, and at this point i’m so uncomfortable now. Not bc I don’t like it but bc i don’t think it’s cool considering she has a bf? isn’t she like basically cheating on him by doing this?

Idk how to act tomorrow but I also don’t wanna make it awkward. but like I cant hide how grossed out I feel. again, not over her being another girl or anything but over not enjoying any of it in general. How should I deal with this situation? I feel sick. i feel like a bad person.",04Feb2020,1
885,"This is a throwaway account. I am a 22 F and my boyfriend is a 27 M. We are thinking about buying a house together but he has a lot more money than me.

He believes this means it is 100% his house and if something happens I just need to call it quits and move out. He said if we were married it would be different but since we’re not it’s his, not ours.

893,"I just turned 23 last week. I'm so lost guys, always has been since i was a kid. I never knew what i wanna do when i grow up. I wanted to be a vet but then again i hated school since first grade, only liked it because i was a class clown and people were fun + i dated most beautiful girls at school.

Well time has passed, people even graduated from colleges.. some still are. Basically everyone from my old primary school has got themselves into something. BUT NOT ME :( shit people drive cool cars and get paid ok, i don't have shit.

&amp;#x200B;

And i also got kicked out of house, i am meeting a social worker later today and will try to find me a governmental apartment.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried being a cleaner for 2 months, i quit because i got depressed because i didn't like it at all. I did okay for the first 3-4 weeks but then i just got so bored i got depressed, lazy, unmotivated and i just poker faced stared my boss yelling at me until i told her i wanna quit. I tried working on warehouse, good salary, shitty job and i got tired of all that lifting and packing and shit..

&amp;#x200B;

I also got myself into a graveyard grass cutter, i was riding a cool machine and that was soooo relaxing job and super easy ( just had to focus no to touch tombstones, very risky but i managed it somehow ). But i got shit tired after 3-4 weeks and i got so depressed ( i always tried my best and i never showed this to anyone, i always smiled and was nice to everyone, i made people laugh too ) but when i worked alone, shit i fell asleep on grass few times because i just couldn't work anymore, because i just didn't like the job in the first place, even though it was good salary and easy job.

&amp;#x200B;

I also tried being a cleaner for local neighborhoods ( walking around with a stick and picking up trash ) but that was when i was 16 and i hated it too. 

&amp;#x200B;

Shit i have tried so many education and courses too.. visited career psychology and done so many quizzes, research and tests, THERE IS NO FUCKING JOB I WOULD LIKE.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not lazy, i'm super hard worker and usually people always like me, but shit man i just--- fucking can't work in a job anymore i don't enjoy or like. I would rather just use government for free money or something rather than doing something that affects my mental health.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have any mental conditions or anything, super healthy and good looking guy, but i am just lost in this world. But i always outshined everyone if i did something i truly enjoy and like, but i just hate every job i've seen so far. And the worst part is.. i am shit scared of many jobs too. I got a security guard card but i never worked on security, because i already forgot everything i have learned + i don't see myself suitable for that job. I don't trust anyone and i am shit scared if i fuck up in a security and i get blamed on ( happened many times here ).

896,"My [17M] now ex-girlfriend Hailey [16F] left me a few days ago. She was my first gf. We dated for about 2 months. She left for no real reason except that she was ""unhappy with her life."" She's had depression issues and I did my best to help her. She loved me and I loved her dearly. But it just ended so abruptly with no warning signs. I thought it would last forever, but it didn't. The first couple days I cried, but I'm slowly coming to terms with it. 

I posted about it on my snapchat storyand I got lots of support from my friends at school. But this one girl from my Algebra 2 class, Faith, asked me if I was okay at first. I said I wasn't rn, but I'm slowly recovering. That night she sent me a heart emoji. I asked her about it and she said, ""I was showing my feelings for you, you are a really nice guy."" She's also started sitting closer to me in class and we get into conversations more often.

It kinda seems that she might have a thing for me and idk what to do because I'm still struggling to come to terms with my break-up with Hailey that killed a part of my soul. I don't really love Faith, even if she would be considered to be hotter. Our personalities, however, match well. I'd like to start talking to Faith but I don't feel ready to date yet. 

I'm planning on talking to her more seriously and asking her out on a date eventually, but I need to know how to deal with the fact that I'm still obsessed with my ex and that I'm already planning to talk to another girl right after breaking-up.

897,"So my friend with whom I never text and we barely see each other but have been roomates for 2 years (not anymore cause she moved to another city) sometimes asks me to hang out with her friends but doesn't organize it and I don't know where and when until the last minute. Well, not really. I arrive like an hour after everybody.
I send her texts but she's socializing with her friends and doesn't think of me or check her phone. This happens every time. I think we're not friends anymore, but she still asks me to hang outs, when all I've been worring about for months  has been whether we are even friends anymore.

So she asked me to a get-together this week and I didn't really feel like going because her friends haven't really warmed up to the outsider and accepted me and one of them I've friendzoned so he avoids me. 
So. I didn't want to go but still, I've been waiting the whole day to see if she would even remember me. And she didn't. So I've told her that she should've texted me and she got offended and told me I should've texted her and ask what's the situation like, otherwise I'll be waiting until tomorrow. 

I knew she was right but I was deeply hurt, again, cause I haven't even crossed her mind and now we got into a missunderstanding and kind of a debate because of my ego. I am hurt because she doesn't understand my point of view. She never does. Everything has to be her way, always. Like this one time we were trying to decide which movie to watch and she didn't want to watch the one I've recommended because of its title which she didn't like (?) and we ended up watching something she liked. 

I'm not sure I want to hang out with her anymore because we get into these stupid situations and I don't think I like her character and how she's treating me. I even doubt she likes me.

After she told me about it, she made me promise to her that I would never do that, and I did.
I've been feeling terrible mentally these past few days. I love my mom, but I feel like I can't tell her about it because she’ll just make it about her or blame herself.

915,"TL;DR Cowoker and I know each other and are close. Don't wanna take a chance at misreading signs so planning on sending a present anonymously. How do? Good idea?

&amp;#x200B;

Long version: So I've known this coworker for about a year. We've gotten to talk a few times, occasionally on a personal level, and recently a deeper conversation where we seemed to have a moment.

I have feelings for them but seeing as we're coworkers, I'm too afraid to ask them out, in case I'm misreading signals. They've also talked openly with me and some other coworkers about their relationships. So far it hasn't been great news for them, usually talking about I don't like this or that about them, they don't understand me, etc, then sometimes jumping to ask how I'm doing in the hunt for a relationship. As far as I've heard, they seem to have broken up with their last significant other. At the very least they don't talk about them so I figured now's a good time to do something.

My plan so far: buy something for them on Valentine's day to be delivered anonymously to the office. Lucky, or maybe unlucky, for me is I won't be in the office and on vacation with my folks so hopefully they won't think it's from me. If I was in office, I do have a terrible poker face.

I know what I'm getting them but is there a way I can do this better? Should I do it at all?

I'm the only person she's told this much information to, including other friends, counselors, parents, etc. About a month ago she started cutting again, not regularly but every 2 weeks or so. I'm frustrated that she hides from her problems and tries to ignore them, relying of outside help. Yesterday I made a bad decision and I reached out to one of her previous bullies to try and understand what happened. I didn't gain any information from the bully, the only real result was that she got angry, had a panic attack, and refused to talk to me. I didn't learn until today that she tried to kill herself twice last night. She resumed talking to me today, but she's still angry and I know that I've broken her trust.

919,"My brother and his current girlfriend have been together for a couple of years now. In the beginning I had no opinions. Over time my opinion has grown negative, and she only continues to give me reasons to despise her. Right now she is driving me insane.

Now, I must say now that she had a rough childhood. Absent parents, abusive family and never finished high school. She claims that the trauma she went through (starting from a very young age) left her with borderline personality disorder. She claims it was diagnosed when she was a child. I am in no way saying that she does not have an illness. There is definately something not right there. However, me being me, I went to a library and picked up some psychology books and later watched some videos explaining the disorder. I'm not fully convinced that this is what she has, but at the same time I'm not a psychologist. I'm just a seeker of knowledge who tends to exhaust her immediate resources quickly.

My problems with her start with my brother. He has PTSD and, although he manages it far better than some, it still affects him. Due to the PTSD he has difficulty sleeping, cannot handle loud noises or loud talking for long and generally has days that are worse than others. She knows this. She always talks shit about my brother. How he doesn't always stick to plans or schedules they make, how he sometimes ignores her (usually when he is first waking up or when he's in his head again), how he doesn't communicate and how he tends to be generally emotionally unavailable... What do you expect from somebody who has seen literal war? He's battling something she could never imagine seeing. Compared to when he first came back home he has improved, but it is still difficult for him. I've tried to explain this to her, and she usually ignores me or says ""okay but that doesn't excuse/explain..."" No. Shut up. You don't get to say what does and doesn't excuse his behavior when you don't even know what he was like prior to PTSD. That shit changes people. Not only all of this, but she is lazy as hell. My brother will do her chores for her and supports her knowing she will never strive to better herself.

Another thing. She never finished high school. I can't speak too much on this since I didn't finish high school, but I did get my GED. I have told her that GED classes are not like high school (I would argue it was better, since I had a better time learning) and that I would help her through it. I would help her study whenever she needed it. She refuses. She constantly says ""You don't NEED a high school education. It is preferred but not NEEDED."" All I can think of here is spoiled and entitled. This has led me to believe she sees my brother as a source of food and shelter, with some extra benefits. It disgusts me.

Lastly, the way she talks to me. Oh my... The number of times I have wanted to smack the disrespect out of her. I have been avoiding drama with her, only telling her what I'm thinking when she's on one of her rants and asks, but I'm starting to think cussing her out is a good option. She speaks to me like she has some sort of authority. Like ""Do this thing now because I don't want to"" or ""I'm not saying your stupid but you are"" type attitude. We are both adults here. I have no clue what makes her think talking to me like this is okay. If she wouldn't dare talk to my dad like that then she damn well should know not to talk to me like that. The only thing stopping me from tossing her stuff out and changing the locks is my brother.

I don't know how to confront her about my problems with her calmly. I live at home to help my parents and my brother plans to get a home for him and his girlfriend by the end of the year, but I don't think I have the patience to wait that long.",04Feb2020,1
921,"As the title suggests I am dealing with a bully where I work. I work a really fun job but I have lost the love it in the last year or so due to another person who has started about a year ago. He is older, alot more quick witted than me which doesn't bother me but always seems to have to belittle me Infront of my colleagues. This doesn't happen Infront of my bosses and when he is on his own he is really pleasent to talk too. I thought this bullshit would of ended after secondary school lol. 

Today he decided to mock me and tell me 'not to lie to him' (we are the same job, he is not above me) because he didn't think I had done a sufficient job at cleaning. I told him I had done it and would go over it again after we got into a mini argument where he told me to fuck off once I did it again. 

I'm going to go talk to my managers tomorrow about him but was wondering if anyone else who has dealt with it got any advice. It's a small business with around 6 employees so I am worried about the ripple effect it might cause if I start more drama.",04Feb2020,1
922,"I’m 30 F and my brother is 28 M. He has a lot of mental problems now and I have this overwhelming guilt because a couple of years ago I got flashbacks of us “experimenting” when we were kids. I definitely think it was my idea because he was a quiet kid and barely spoke. I remember my cousin who was 3/4 years older than us was involved too but she had a slight disability.

Ever since I remembered it I feel like a horrible person. My brother hasn’t mentioned anything to me and I doubt he remembers because he blocked out a lot of his childhood but I feel disgusted by myself. At the time I was probably about 6-8 years old. I don’t think we did anything other than dry humping with clothes off but I still feel terrible. I’ve thought about going to therapy but I’m worried it will pull other memories I have suppressed.

Shortly before I remembered this stuff, I had a memory of being alone with my dad down a lane and being told to keep secrets. I really don’t know if any abuse happened. My dad and his brother, both separately and together would take me on “walks” down this lane to a little creek because we lived in the countryside. My dad was very abusive physically, sexually and emotionally to my mom (who got sole custody of us in the end) I have some memories of my childhood when he was around but I blocked out a lot of the traumatic ones (based on things I’ve heard from my family) my dad was very protective of me and would have me sleep in the bed with him while making my mom sleep on the floor, he never gave my brother much attention but in every picture he’s close with me. I know just because I had memories of being asked to keep a secret it doesn’t mean abuse, but something about the whole situation doesn’t sit right with me.


I don’t know what kind of advice I’m asking for. I feel horrible and I don’t want these situations to control my life. But I’m afraid therapy will make me relive things I’m trying to get over. If anyone has any advice whatsoever.. I appreciate it",04Feb2020,1

931,"I (25F) am in a 3 person department. My manager (36F- lets call her Bonnie) has been there the longest, and then me with about 4 years in, and then we have a newer employee (34F- we’ll call her Megan). While Megan is closer in age to Bonnie, you would never guess it. She very much acts like she’s in her low twenties- very much comparable in personality to a typical college grad just starting off in full-time employment.

Generally- I like Megan quite a lot. She and I get along well, and have common interests. I did most of Megan’s 8 month training so we got close. However, I’ve noticed she’s quite unstable. Ever since she finished training and started taking her own projects, it’s gone downhill. She’s very hard on herself, she seems to have lost her ability to retain new information at this point (keeps asking me the same questions daily. I try to be patient but it gets frustrating). She has anxiety and depression issues, and has a very hard time managing it. She’s on medication, and I know she’s trying her best. But it can be unbearable sometimes. She will apologize 50+ times a day for the most minor of things. She will criticize herself and her work over and over and I respect wanting to improve- but talking shit on yourself all day doesn’t help you get any better. 

Bonnie tends to coddle Megan and is very patient with her and these traits of hers. She is constantly reassuring Megan. However, I’ve come to realize I truly do not have it in me to deal with it. I think part of this is because I have a lot of my issues, myself. I have depression. I have general anxiety. I am stating to believe I could have BPD. But I internalize it all. I don’t vocalize my issues. I just keep it bottled up during the day, and when I get home I usually curl up and cry. It is very hard for me to manage my emotions and to keep myself together during the day. It takes all of my energy to keep it together. So, I truly don’t have it in me to give someone reassurance all day, even when I am often put in situations where that would be the typical response. I do not have it in me to say “don’t be sorry, you didn’t do anything wrong” 50x a day. I don’t have it in me to say “you’re not slow or bad at your job, you’re fine” 20x a day. I do not have it in me to talk someone down when my mental health needs my focus. Here and there, I can do it. But it’s an all day every day affair.

932,"       This isn’t the account of the person writing this but that doesn’t matter, advice is still needed. 

       So I’m a girl and I’m in this complicated situation where three guys all have a crush on me. It started In 5th grade one of my friends M said they liked me and it spread across the school but nothing came if that. Then my second friend moved in and apparently liked me too but didn’t do anything because he found out they the first friend liked me. The third Friend joined the group and also liked me but didn’t do anything because of friend 1. In the summer of 2019 me, friend 1, and friend 3 were playing truth or dare and during a I asked Friend 1 if he had a wish what would it be and he said I wish For you to like me and I said what if I told you that wish was true and Friend 2 got sad and that’s we’re he revealed he liked me. My feelings were complicated form the beginning, I kind of liked the second friend in the beginning but didn’t do anything because everyone knew the first Friend liked me. My feelings now are just as confusing and I don’t know how to figure them out. The three friends made a pact (kept secret form me but second friend clued me in on it) that if anyone of them dated me, they wouldn’t get mad. But that’s not healthy, it’s not good to suppress feelings. The second friend tried to end this but that didn’t go well and the firsts friend blamed themselves on all of this even though it’s not his fault at all. The first friend hasn’t even gone through anything, he’s not very emotionally stable, the second friend went/ is still going through a REALLY long divorce that’s been lasting 3-4 years. The third friend went through the craziest shit that can’t be explained in one sentence or five paragraphs. The third friend is pretty stable about this situation and does like me but has another crush that they like a little less than me but still like them. The second friend is stable but doesn’t have much to fall back on, I’m his most supportive friend (his words not mine). If any of you have gone through something like this, or have advice I would like some help.

Hi, I'm 17 and have struggled with depression and anxiety for quite a while, currently i only have very few online friends and one irl friend. I used to have this friend who I had been very close to since I was in kindergaten and at 14 we stopped talking over a fight because of our parents not getting along. It was mostly me breaking down from my mom's pressure and finally backing away from her. At the time my mom complimented me saying that now I would find real friends but I haven't found anyone with who I've had a good connection with and I always feel out of place whevener i talk to my one irl friend. She seems to have moved on since she already has a lot of friends and seems happy but I've seen her like some posts about lost friendships and stuff that may be related to our situation she wasn't always the best person either but neither was I. I'm scared of reaching out to her and have her talk badly of me since i'ts been three years since we've talked and it might sound very creepy of me to still think about it and I'm also very scared of being humiliated. Should I reach out? If yes what should I say to not sound like a desperate creepy stalker?

Like she’ll voice her opinions in the most inappropriate ways, like calling something you are wearing cause you think it’s cute “ugly” or “gay”!

We have since welcomed another girl kinda into like our friend group you could say and since May of 2019 all three of us have been close and good, besides my first friends ignorance! I’m not α very boy crazy person, I’ve liked boys but never really go for them and I recently got α boyfriend and we’ve been dating since October. So I’ve been adapting to the dating lifestyle and juggling friends and α boyfriend. It’s been hard but I have been doing it. But my friends don’t like my effort I guess and they have told me two times now as a “joke” that they are disowning me as a friend. We had another girl in the friend group who like a year prior got α boyfriend and stopped hanging with us slowly because she got α boyfriend but I’ve always respected that cause I get it but my friends now have started calling me by that girls name because I don’t hang with them “enough”! My thing is, is that I’m not like that girl because i have tried so hard to make time for them and still sit with them at lunch and text them constantly but that girl doesn’t talk to us at all! Also I’ve started to realize that the girl who stopped hanging with us makes time for all her new friends and constantly hangs out with them so I feel like it’s just my first friends fault because she doesn’t want to be around her.

I don’t know what to do cause they’ll talk crap about me and the friend we welcomed into the group has been so kind to me and she never directly is mean to me she kinda just agrees with my friend when she is mean to me, so I’m kinda stuck because I do love both of them cause they are both my best friends but I’ve lost respect for my first friend and am starting to lose it for my second friend.

944,"This will be a little long but I want to make sure all the facts are there for you. Me and my gf have been naked with each other twice.

The first time I fingered her and then she gave me a handjob until I came. We both wiped it off with paper towels (no soap/water) and then cuddled for 10-20 minutes. I then fingered her again. Is it possible some sperm was still living and impregnated her?

The second instance was one week later in a tight space (car). I fingered her, possibly with some precum on my fingers. She then gave me a handjob and I came. Maybe some of the cum perfectly landed on her vagina? I don’t know.

A week after the second instance (two weeks after the first), her period was due. I believe that these instances could very well have been during ovulation. However, it came three days later and lasted 5 days. She said it was heavy in the beginning. Is there any way this wasn’t a period and was implantation bleeding?

We have since done sexual things 3 times but I made sure one of us had clothes on while performing sexual acts on the other and wiped off all cum and used clorox wipes on hands after before fingering again. However, it has been a month since that last “period” (might not be) I mentioned previously. I asked her if she’s on her period but she said probably next week even though it’s been a month? She probably knows herself more then me but that doesn’t really make sense? I looked it up: the average cycle is 28 days and it’s been like 30 so far.

I say especially because I find it much easier to read people that I don't know personally as my heart won't get in the way of my judgement. It's really kind of a bone-chilling talent I posses considering that I'm almost never wrong. (Given if I see/interact with that person again or not.) 

So..with that said, let me start with this story. Also, if you're going to comment questioning the validity, then just don't bother, in fact—I'll tell you now, this is NOT science fiction. This is a true series of events. 

Okay, *now* let's start. A bit about me.. I have three children (i'm 26 years old.) I consider myself a younger looking, cute female based on what people tell me. Let me put it this way, people that come to the door ask if my ""Mother's home."" Many people give me very judgmental looks when I have my kids with me at the store because I literally look 18. 

With that in mind.. I just moved to a smallish town above Seattle (way above) and I started up a gym membership here. For the reason of taking care of 3 kids during the day, I have to go to the gym at night when my husband is home. 

About a week in I went to the gym really late, at around midnight. While I was there, I noticed this guy that kept looking at me and sort of coincidentally being around me often. I noticed he was an abnormally large ""buff"" kind of guy. He was huge, i'm talking like 6'4 maybe and  just a beef stick, really. He was a really handsome guy. Okay, i'm married..and I also like to think that I have morals so I, you know.. I snubbed him. I didn't really give him the time of day even though I'm sure he expected me to. I'm not super fit, right. Like he was. I remember my husband said to have a""F off demeanor"" with guys like that so that's what I did. As soon as he saw that I was acting snobbish, it was like he was trying harder. Eventually I got on the elliptical and was sort of stuck in one spot. He mustered up enough nerve to walk right in front of me and dead locked eyes with me so he could get a read me I guess. His eyes were wide like a dear in the headlights. It wasn't like he was communicating something with me, but instead just purely *reading* me.  I gave him the same look back.

Now, like I said I'm an INFJ and if you are as well, you'll know exactly what I mean when I say I just *knew* what happened in that moment. This guy put a ""mark"" on me. I could see him decide right there that he was going to get me. This sounds ridiculous i'm sure, but just keep reading. I'm almost never wrong with my intuition. 

Now, I knew that I absolutely could not walk out by myself so I heading for the locker room ( and of course, he headed for the men's. ) So I literally sat for about 25 minutes and watched youtube videos just to make sure he would leave first. When I walked out, he was no where in sight until literally right before I walked out he just appeared behind me. (waiting for me perhaps?) So I walked slowly until we had distance and I kept my eyes on him the entire time. He did not like that. He climbed into his SUV and lowered his head and stared at me with this evil looking, angry stare. 

Then he drove off.

This is where I really question my intelligence. I figured he just left. I ignored the little voice in my head  that said he will probably park off and see which road I turned down. 

I just started driving home.

After a couple turns I was glaring music and being unaware until I realized this car was tailgating me. Right on my tail so I could only see the lights. I told myself I just won't go home if he keeps following, in case it was big boy. So I turned into my neighborhood but he didn't turn in. Now, here is where I'm stupid. I realize now just how small this town is. All of the neighborhoods are dead-end cold-e-sacs. All he needed to know what which one I was in. I park outside the house..smh. Keep in mind I didn't realize all this *yet.*

Okay, fast forward about 3 days later. (Haven't seen the guy at the gym and completely wrote it off.) So, it's about 6am and my husband's alarm goes off. I never wake up with him..but for some reason I wake up exhausted. He leaves for work. So now I am up with restless leg syndrome. I'm so tired but I literally cannot go back to sleep, to the point where i'm praying ""God, why can't I sleep, i'm so tired.) 

I feel this little voice inside me say ""go lock your front door"" I ignore the little feeling inside and continue trying to fall asleep. 

Okay— I will *never* forget this feeling when this next part happened. 

The entire house is silent. Not even the heater was on. I hear the front door handle turn downstairs and I hear ""creeeek"" ....someone just opened my front door so quietly and carefully. 

 My heart just SANK! I immediately creep up quietly and look at my daughters bedrooms. The baby was in my bed. Both of my girls FAST asleep in their beds. 

Someone was IN MY HOUSE. I walk quietly in one of my daughter's bedrooms and look out the window. There is some little grey car right in front of my house. Parked at some weird angle. I slam the blinds down to open them and wave my hands, then I started stomping on my floor to let the guy know I was awake and I start talking loudly. Keep in mind I thought this was just a robbery. I started locking my other daughters and my own bedroom to lock them in. I run back over to the window and see that the car had raced off. I keep looking out the window and my eye could not believe it...

A very large, tall, buff looking guy covering his face emerges from under the window and starts walking away quickly from my house. The car LEFT him when it saw me. I have never felt so homicidal towards another person before.  I wanted to shoot that man. 

I immediately call my husband and i'm just so mad at him. ""WHY DIDN'T YOU LOCK THE DOOR WHEN YOU LEFT?!"" I was just so upset. 

I didn't call the cops, I had no description of the car really except it was gray. I had no plate and I could not prove it was the guy from the gym. I didn't see his face, only his build which was the same. I thought the cops wouldn't be able to do anything. Instead I bought pepper spray and other security stuff. (Not cameras though.)

Now, my husband at first did NOT believe me but 3 months later he saw the car himself parked in front of the house and he started walking towards it and they raced off. He says it was a ford but didn't get the plate. 

Another month goes by and my brother in law was over, he comes in the house and goes some big guy was in front of your house acting really weird and left when I looked at him. (also in the morning while my husband was at work.) He was on foot though.

That was 2 weeks ago. I know the guy is still around. I can't sleep anymore. I'm afraid to go outside. I go to the gym still though but never too late...I have never seen this guy at the gym again. I'm gong to buy security cameras and a gun...but I've never shot a a gun and I don't really think I could get to it in time out of a safe. (I mean I have kids, I wouldn't leave it under my pillow.) I think I have PTSD. I have fantasies of just giving him what  he wants so I can live at peace again. How messed up is that? I don't know what to do.",04Feb2020,1

In this time my friends have looped back around to outside the house and are now standing outside it. The dad then arrives home and is obviously pissed. He starts shouting at them and chases them off his property and through the estate. In this time he also calls the police who show up to my friends house to complain.

954,"Frankly, I don’t know what happened but ever since the clock hit 12:00am that first day of January, my life has taken a toll. A few months back, I (19F) was pretty much depressed and in need of a lot of sex (ironic because I am still a virgin/ haven’t even had my first kiss yet) or at least some type of romantic affection. 

Come to find out, this semester, I am completely different. 

Before, whenever I walked into any of my classes, the first thing I would do was check guys out. This was even before my grandmother’s passing (which triggered my “depression”) so it was something I would do out of nature. I was also very well interested in going on dates, and idealizing what my first relationship would look like. Basically, throughout 19 years of my life, I’ve been a slightly horny hopeless romantic. 

Yet, this semester, I haven’t even looked at any of the guys. Whenever anyone talks to me about the possibility of having a boyfriend, I become severely uninterested and things that turned me on before, don’t do so anymore. I’m unsure if I’m like this because I am too used to being alone that suddenly changing that seems impossible, or if there is another underlying issue. 

My 20’s are approaching and I confess I feel free in a way, but I’m beginning to believe I am actually going to die alone because of this lack of desire and I can’t help but worry.

Is this normal? Am I becoming slightly “asexual”?",04Feb2020,1

Then her granddaughter (8-10 yo, not sure) was over. Steve Harvey is on the TV. She says ""Yeah yeah you fucking N-"". ""Keep on saying that shit with your big fat N- lips."" I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I'm getting so frustrated, especially because my dad allows this shit.

so, my friends on discord were talking about getting custom vans (where you get to design your own shoe) and I made one that I thought was neat. I said ""it's only 95$"" (considering that's probably cheap for a custom shoe that looked that nice) and they all started saying how 95 was a lot of money, I felt bad and tried to change the subject.   


after this, I looked back at all the other times they've done this, and I felt bad because I spent $166 on youtooz, of favourite twitch streamers. They started talking about working class, and overall made me feel pretty ""spoiled"" that I have a weekly allowance of 100.

958,"So I have found myself in a bit of a situation here. I will try to list all details that I can. From late December of 2018 to early January, I was living in a rented house with three other roommates. My friend would come over frequently to hang out. At some point during the summer, he purchased a drum kit and asked if he could store it at my house because having it at his apartment would cause noise complaints. I said this was fine and the drum kit was placed in a room right beside the one in which i slept (the basement). Come this January, I decided to move out and relocate to upstate New York from Georgia. My reason for doing this was because the lease was finishing up from the house, and my girlfriend and I agreed to move here to stay with her family. We got a moving truck and began packing everything. Over the course of about 2 days, we had everything loaded into the truck and we made our way to New York. I let my friend know that the drumkit (along with 2 other belongings) have all been left in the side-room. Upon coming to my previous house, none of my roommates would answer his calls or let him in. The next day, he gets ahold of one of my friends (we’ll refer to him as James). He said that when i left, the basement was empty and all that was left was a mop bucket. The friend who had the drum kit (Donald) would be told he can come back later and look for it. Donald did this and found nothing in the house. He talked to Mike (one of the other roommates) and he said the basement was empty; though this conversation was brief and over the phone. The last roommate (Greg) talked to Donald and recited the same line. So at this point, one by one all of my previous roommates are accusing me of taking my friends drumkit. Donald and I have been in frequent contact discussing this matter, but I don’t know what else to do. I did not move, sell, or dispose of any of his belongings. I even urged him to file a police report numerous times and he now has done so. Not only do i have 4 witnesses, 1 who was with me when i left and saw the drums/belongings in the house, and the rest who helped me move all of my belongings into my new house, but i also have video recording of both the empty room right before I left with all of his belongings in tact. Not to mention that James helped me move the last piece of furniture into our moving truck and would’ve seen a drum kit in there if i altered it’s location. This whole ordeal has been extremely fleshed out from my end. I have co-operated with Donald with no hesitation because I want to find out who ACTUALLY took his drumkit, who is being dishonest, and to clear my name and be done with this. At this point, I just would like any sort of advice any of you could offer. I apologize if this post is vague, but there are a lot of key facets to this issue that I could better answer if specifically asked (ie. for dates, photos, whereabouts, statements). I want this to be concluded in order for my friend to get justice, and for me to be able to move on with my life and not have this burden the entirety of every moment from here on out.

965,"Hi all.
Im a female, 26 from Australia. Family are saying that Im young, but I feel like Im at a crossroads in my life. No savings, and I havent really broken out in my traditional career as a teacher.

Since I was 18, Ive been travelling the world. In November last year after a thorough vetting process, Ive been offered an opportunity to work as a tour guide in Europe. My family are saying Id be crazy not to take it, but I am really stuck.

I also have dreams of entrepeneurship and having my children in my late 20's. I feel like at this point in time, I pick the tour guide dream or the enterpeneurship dream. 

Starting my own business would mean I would have to generate some income at home through teaching this year, then I start working on it. Working on it after having a baby is not something I want to do as I want the child to have a stable envionment financially. Its a goal for my 20's, or never.

Tour guiding sounds amazing, and my mums really disappointed Im even considering not taking it. She cried last night because she said she was a young mother (she was 20 and 22 with my sister and I) and she never got the opportunity to do anything like this. I said financially, it pays really poorly and wouldnt give me the opportunity to establish a business when I get home. She said its not about the money, and Ill regret it when Im older because shes lived her life and knows this. My thinking is, if I can get this business going, Ill have the money to pursue travel that I wont have if I was to take the tour guide job.

So reddit, do I;
a) Take the tour guide job and meet people and see places from around the world (taking the experience over money)
or
b) Stay at home, get a normal job, save and pursue business dream before I plan to have children (in the next couple of years).",04Feb2020,1

Everything I want in life, I can acquire with hard work. Good health, good looks, positive attitude, successful career, good grades in school etc. I want these things so bad, but I don’t have them and I’m afraid I never will. 

My whole life, I have severely lacked will power and have been super impatient. Every time I change myself and say “no longer will I do things that don’t better myself”, I go back to my old ways. 

My physical health is not the best. I’ve been slightly overweight my whole life and last year I decided to do something about it. Up until today, I lost 30 lbs. It should have not taken that long, but it did because I’d eat clean and then be back to eating shit again. Back and forth. I’m never consistent. 

Because of the way this problem has been affecting my mental health, I have not been the brightest person. I try and I try, but I never stick to changes to make myself a better person. 

My grades have always suffered. I’ve always been a B/C’s student. Mostly because I would never do my homework and wouldn’t study. I knew I needed to, but everytime I would, I would find myself extremely bored and distracted to the point where I just wouldn’t do it. Every semester, I would tell myself that this is going to change and I’m going to work harder and study, but I never stick to it.. 

I know the answer is easy: “Just do it” but for whatever reason, I can’t get myself to stick to new routines and habits. I have the mindset and I want to be successful, but I just can’t ever get myself to stay on it.

When I got those I started to uncontrollably shake, I couldn't stop, Now almost 24 hours later I'm still shaking a little. I got to school this morning and I literally couldn't focus, I felt like I wanted to barf, and I just had to go home. So I did. But running away from this isn't helping me. So I really need help.

I’m going to be officiating my best friends wedding and need some leads as far as getting information, so it’s extremely important I don’t fuck this up because I am so honored to get to do this for him.

My friend is getting married in Montgomery County in Pennsylvania. From the bit of research I have done, it is looking like I need to be associated with a religious organization or hold some place as a judge, etc. I am Catholic and don’t live in the state and honestly don’t practice consistently, but my friend and his fiancé are atheists which is complicating a bit of the research for me as to the extent of what is needed.

I don’t want to become a priest and don’t necessarily understand what constitutes a minister in the state of PA. I have seen some of the websites that allow you to pay a small fee and claim to ordain you, however I’m not here to take chances. Preferably, I would like the outcome here to be me able to perform a ceremony that counts in the eyes of the law and on par with their beliefs since it is unlikely we will be having Christian vows. 

So I guess to start my questions are what are my legitimate options to start the ball rolling?

Secondly, what government offices could I maybe reach out to in order to validate any of this information? 

Anyone whose had a wedding in the state that could help as well I would love to hear from.

I believed her it’s just that I missed her. 

I asked her out for valentines day which she said she’s hanging out with her mom and best friend and said probably not. I was a sad and she said your being annoying. She hates when I ask her out and she can’t or don’t want to go and I’m sad. But OF Course Ima be sad I love her and miss her. 

She texted me an hour ago saying she thinks it’ll be better if we are friends. And told me she’s sorry if she ever hurt me before. We been talking for 4-5 month. Told her I’m glad I met her and I still love her and wish her the best and I’ll always be here for her. But previous to her the girl I talked to left me completely I told her this and she said she would never do that. 

Well I guess now it’s official we are just friends. I won’t touch her anymore or do cute stuff as much. It will probably sink in later or something and hurt me way more but I don’t feel devastated by it. I asked her why did she feel uninterested.

984,"A good friend of mine and I shared a bed at the end of a drunken night. There were no feelings between she and I. She also had a boyfriend at the time (who I knew well).

When I woke up the next morning, I had a vague memory of groping her up top beneath her shirt. I immediately felt a sense of dread and disgust at having done so. However, I foolishly did not address it that next morning; I admit I was more petrified at the thought of having a discussion about it.

This incident occurred almost three years ago, during which time I have dated enough people to learn that I have a tendency to be very handsy while asleep, drunk or not. This leads me to be even more terrified that I may have touched my friend elsewhere in the earlier incident.

Because it's been so long, I am unsure of how to address this issue. This friend and I remained cordial for a while after the incident as if nothing were wrong, but like many other friendships from college, it faded out, and we never discussed it.

I would like to offer my apologies to her so she knows how disgusted I am at what I did in my drunken state, and so she knows it was not something I did with a full state of consciousness. However, I understand that some of my motivation is to alleviate my own guilt at having groped my friend. On the other hand, this incident was over three years ago, and it feels selfish to bring it up and potentially reopen an old wound.

Should I reopen a conversation with her or not?

tl;dr: Drunkenly groped friend three years ago, never discussed it with her. Friendship drifted apart. Would bringing it up and apologizing be selfish or appropriate?",04Feb2020,1

I ws really drunk that night I dont think I would have had sex with him if I were sober. my question is do u think he thinks Im a slut? cuz yeah I was easy but I was also very drunk. im just wondering if he's going to look at me differently now? he texted me the night after saying he had fun but was he just being nice?

986,"I’ve been wanting to go to the gym for a few years. I’ve told myself today is the day. I’m off work and have been patiently waiting all day to hopefully go. I was just told that this is the busiest hour at the gym and mornings are better. I have pretty bad anxiety. So I’m just nervous. I’m not super over weight. But I don’t know what to do. I just want to climb steps for an hour. But I don’t want to be judged and I don’t want them to be full. I’m not sure what I’d do if I walked in and the stair steppers were full. I’ve been wanting to do those for 2 days. Just contemplating how I’ll walk in, give them my ticket (3 day pass that was gifted to me) and decide where to go. Should I bring clothes? I just need advice. I’m trying to help with my anxiety and shed about 15 lbs.

989,"I dont even know where to begin. I was going to post on r/relationship_advice, but I didnt like the rules requiring details about location and age and such.

The problem is our relationship isn't healthy. Its full of fighting, accusations, and just distrust. Im not sure if Im happy in it anymore. This girl and I have been together for almost a year now and from the beginning shes hated my family out of jealousy. Because of that she tries to separate me from them. My family isnt exactly the easiest to like, but Id at least like her to try and this has been the cause of many fights over the months. She has tried to work on it and has improved but almost every time I mention having to watch my little siblings or help out around the house it turns into a fight and she just has to insult my family in any way she can, especially my mother. I get along great with her family, and they really like me and in my opinion a good relationship with the family is just as important as a good relationship with the person youre dating. Am I wrong?

But this is only one part of why we arent healthy. She also hates my friends, which I understand more. Early in our relationship I broke up with her for like a day before getting back together. Kinda typical teenage stuff but I told her I talked to my guy friends about it and that they recommended it but I set up the situation in a way to get them to tell me to end things because of personal fears of commitment and relationships. My gf has helped get over that since but blames them for it and it starts fights that Im even in a group chat with them on snapchat. 

In the chat its just us few guys, and its mostly just an advice thing. We talk to each other about problems and just kinda be guys in it. 

One day a few months ago she got in a fight with her mom and texted me she was ""literally going to kill herself"" then didn't answer me for a few hours. She had already self harmed in the past and she had even gone as far as putting a gun to her head. She hasnt self harmed in a long time and she has gotten much better about thinking about it since she met me but I was terrified and left at school with that text. I live an hour away so I felt there was nothing I could do. The guys in the group chat were the only reason I was able to stay even remotely calm. A few hours later she texts me explaining that her mom had taken her phone and she didnt mean it and I told her how worrried I was everything. The point here is that the guys helped me through it.

Well another day there was a bad joke in the chat about sex and I found it offensive and it bothered me but Im sure it was a joke cause Ive known these guys for years. Well I brought it up with my gf and she went off and I understand. Shes had very bad experiences in the past, shes a woman, and I can see how it was very offensive for her. And I left because of that. Didnt talk to them for months and I didnt really even tell them why or anything. I just left the guys Ive known all through middle school, all through highschool. Pretty much known them for most of my life. One of them also vapes so that was another reason she wanted me to avoid them. Even though he respects that I dont do anything of the sort and doesnt do it around me

I didnt really think much of it. I just figured I would lose touch with them anyways and it wouldnt matter. Well she gave up friends for me too cause this isnt a one sided situation.

 I admit I wanted her to stop talking to one of her friends too. Just one though. A guy. My reasons, I feel, are good though. This guy goes to school with her. Ive always seen him as a threat to me and I was very jealous of him I admit. Him and my girlfriend liked each other just a few months before meeting me. But she decided to just be friends.

 So while they were just friends he asked her to have sex, then called her a bad friend for saying no, slapped her butt, and even supported her self harm. Hes been the reason Ive started many fights. She says once her and I started talking she didnt have any feelings for him but I kept hearing about how great of a friend he was and how he was always taking her out to dinner and she was always going to his house to hang out. Then when we got together they didnt do it as often but still hung out. And I was jealous. 

I didn't like him at all. And then after a few months of being together, he asked her to go out bowling with him and another girl and they could all drink and take turns driving home. Under age. She said no cause she doesnt do anything like that but I lost it at the fact he even asked her to do something like that, especially knowing shes dating someone. And after that I didnt want her having anything to do with him. And Ive started fights with her for months over him and she finally stopped hanging out with him. She used to go to his truck to get away from people and she was just with him all the time. Also she told me that she was going to the movies with a friend and then the guy she said she doesnt talk to anymore ""happened"" to be there. She didnt even tell me he was there, I found out by him a the day after at a birthday party when he came up and talked to her about the movie. Thats my part

Shes very easily scared and cant be home alone. Shes very paranoid and just cant sleep of no one is home. So one time her when her parents got stuck out of town and her sister was at a friends house, she asked me if it was okay to stay at the guys house. And I let her because she is genuinely that scared and I dont believe shed cheat since shes been cheated on and used several times in the past.

Im also very easily wound up and I go off on her all the time over small things. Ive been trying really hard to control my temper and have only improved a little. 

Well the latest fight (today) was about my friends and her friend. My friends added me back in the group chat and I don't want to leave again, at least not without saying something. And so she said that if I stay in the group chat, she gets to talk to that guy again. She admitted to saying that to manipulate me. 

So to some up everything since this was unnecessarily long; shes controlling and manipulative but I do very much love and care about her and dont want anything to happen to her, and Im also very controlling and short tempered and well just a jerk. We always have a great time together no matter what we're doing but we fight a lot over text cause we only see each other on weekends. I want to be with her but I want things to change. I have talked to her about all this

990,"Me and my girlfriend have been dating since junior year of high school, I’m now a junior in college. This’ll be 4 years in March. 


I feel like breaking up with my girlfriend. I’m not really sure why I feel like doing so. Maybe it’s because of how she’s been lately, so lazy and not trying to better herself. But that doesn’t feel like it. Maybe it’s because I just don’t want to deal with a relationship anymore, this feels like a partial reason. I still feel like I love her, but when I think of her it’s just kind of “blegh” I don’t get all excited or happy. Whenever we text throughout the day it’s just because “that’s what we do” not because I miss her or have anything to actually tell her. I don’t know what I want. I wish I did. I don’t want to hurt her, I’d feel horrible for breaking up with her especially when we aren’t fighting, or having a rough time, or anything. It seems like it is so random of a time to want to break up with her. Maybe it’s just because I’m bored in our relationship or maybe I want to experience more. I don’t know what I want. I wish I had someone to talk to this about.",04Feb2020,1
991,Not necessarily bullies but people that just hurt others for their enjoyment . And I don't see how this is really funny. I'm a very passive guy and I don't resort to violence unless I have to .

I don't know whatt to do it but I'm really tempted to . I don't want to get detention though that's why he does it to me because he knows if I fight back I'll be suspended.

992,"I am leaving my full time job (Job A - Sales Call center) for another (Job B) starting Thursday due to Job A not holding up to their end of the deal for my CRM. I was supposed to get ""a significant raise"" for absorbing the position of Senior Developer along with maintaining the infrastructure and Help Desk responsibilities.  


Once I put in my notice, they started freaking out and made some really nice counter offers. I declined but have agreed to work out a part-time deal where they would be my first client for my CRM. Its all very exciting but overwhelming. I will still be developing the integrations and overseeing the data flow of any new campaign, as well as be a reference or point of contact for my on-site replacement. However, I have no idea on how much to charge for these new responsibilities.

&amp;#x200B;

I will be working 40 hours at Job B, then doing development for my CRM and Job A on my off hours. I'm thinking I should do something like $1.5k / month, which includes X amount of hours and hosting the CRM, anything beyond the X hours is at $50/hr for remote and $75/hr for on-site. Is that a reasonable amount? I have no idea where to start on billing, please help.",04Feb2020,1
993,"English has always been my best subject in school and I've never gotten lower than an A. This is my third year in high school, and I've had this same English teacher all three years. In previous years, he's always given me As in the high 90s. This time, however, I got a 75% on my report card, which is an extremely low B. My work hasn't changed and I've still been trying really hard this year, and I've put in a lot of effort. He even gave me an E for work habits (the highest you can get), so I don't understand why my grade is so low? His feedback towards me in the class has always been positive, and the only thing I could think of is if I missed an assignment, but I feel like he would've mentioned it to me if I was. He's always been my favourite teacher by far and is very kind, so I'm not sure why he gave me a low grade",04Feb2020,2
