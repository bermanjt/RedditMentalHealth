1,"Hello all, im 20 years old so it's pretty clear that i have little to no real life advice. I plan on moving out of my family home into an apartment this year but most apartments require decent credit score and I have 0 clue as to how that works. I know credit/debit cards play a factor but im not entirely sure how. So my guestion to all of you is how do safely check my credit score and what can i do to increase it?

2,"So, I posted this on r/legaladvice too, but I figured I'd try for regular advice as well.

So, I'm currently a student at a Pennsylvania public high school. We've had problems with vaping in our bathrooms since about 2017. Our school has increasingly monitored the bathrooms, which is reasonable. However, lately they've been locking the bathrooms.

We have 3 traditional sets of restrooms (male and female) on the upper floor, and 2 on the lower floor, each with 3 stalls. Two of the upstairs bathrooms are staff bathrooms, and one downstairs is, leaving two bathrooms for roughly 1,300 students. We also have a single-stall nurse's bathroom, and a gender-neutral bathroom with two stalls. Sometimes the bathrooms will lock at different times, and usually both of the traditional student bathrooms are locked, leaving only the nurse and gender-neutral bathroom. Three toilets for 1,300 students. I hope I'm still making sense.

It's getting ridiculous, and I'm not sure of any action I can take, if at all. If this isn't illegal, what action should I take?",08Feb2020,1
3," Hello. I don't want to tell which artist she is obsessed with so i will call this artist *pop star*.

  I have a little problem with my friend. Besides her problem with herself, etc she is really obsessed with a *pop star*.  She saying things like: 

""*This pop star* is my friend"", 

 ""*Pop star* is everything to me"",  

""Sometimes only *pop star* can help me with my problems"", 

 ""Only *pop star* understands me in everything"",  

""sometimes i feel like I'm *pop star*"", 

 ""*pop star* have showed me why i shouldn't cut myself (btw. she used to go to the therapist. She ignores it and still saying than this *pop star* help her with everything), 

 ""I watched film with *pop star*, and it enjoyed it. It's feels like a really good conversation about our problems. I always were talking to her and then she open and talked to me about yourself"". 

 And I'm really worried. Even if i point her all of her problems and i add to it her obsession she thinks than i hate her cuz she is ""so close"" with *pop star* and it's nothing wrong with her. And she think she don't need help with her problems and obsession.  She also thinks that she is the perfect fan, and all of the fandom doesn't understand this pop star like she does cuz only she have relationship like this with pop star.  Maybe I'm old school but for me it's seems like something not normal and i think she need special help. 

My friend is 22 yo female. Yup, it's not 12 yo girl who is growing up. 

 Please, advise me. I don't know what to do.",08Feb2020,1
4,"Here's some background. My sister is 2 years older than me. She is now dating someone who I had sex with multiple times shortly after high school, (we all went to school together). He liked me A LOT and wanted something more, but I let him down easy and crept away. Now it's been about 8 or 9 years since and I just found out they are dating... I just feel really weird about it. She obviously doesnt know or I dont think she would be in a relationship with him. So my question is, should I tell her? But shes so happy. He is a really nice guy I dont think he'd every try to hurt her. But he hasn't told her? Does that mean hes lying to her? Should I just leave it alone and let them be happy? I would never try and ruin anything for my sister, she deserves to be happy with how her life has gone. I just feel weird. Like how am I supposed to be when they come over?? She almost brought him a week ago before I knew exactly who she was dating. That would have been insane. I'll just be like in my head, ""I've seen your bfs dick and I feel awkward."" She knows we were friends but we kept everything a secret. I had an on and off relationship at the time. I feel like she should know but I have no clue how she'd react.",08Feb2020,1
5,"My father over the years has had a lot of arguments with his family members about petty stuff. When all of this reached a tipping point he stopped speaking with them. The thing is before all of this us and our extended family were quite close. My uncles were my fathers best friends and vice versa. Now that he broke contact he spiraled into depression. He got quite lonely and then he started burning bridges left and right. He lashed out at the remaining family he still was in contact with and now all he has left is us (me, my brothers, my sister and my mom) and some church friends. Ofcourse now he has no one to take his emotions out on so he turned on us. Now my mom has also gotten really depressed as my aunts were also her friends and he is pushing each one of his childeren further away. We wanted to help him, to reconcile with our uncles, but he wouldn't listen and had an almost childlike temper tantrum.

He spends most of his time on social media posting depressing quotes and images and barely talks with us during the day and when he does it is a snide remark. Almost everyone has given up on him, but I don't want to. I know he can be helped, but I don't know how. I think he may have an ilness or something or maybe a mental disorder. I think he has ADHD, because I have it aswell (apparently if you have it there is an 80% chance one of your parents has it.) So how can I help the most stubborn man alive?",08Feb2020,1
6,"So I’m flying Tokyo to London this March and I have a two hour layover in Shanghai. I have no idea ofc how effectively the Coronavirus will be handled by then, but I do know I always catch a cold or bug after a plane ride so really nervous about that. And, even if I don’t catch anything, won’t I be quarantined in London? I don’t have many days there and I’d rather not spend them locked up. 

So basically I’m asking 

1) how seriously should I try and switch flights (I already found out I’ll get no refund for my current flight and I’ll have to book through another airline, I’m not really wealthy at all but then again can’t put a price on health/time)

2) what’s the likelihood I would be quarantined in London if it’s a layover and not actual travel time in China

3) best tips for avoiding getting sick after a stint at the airport (already loaded up on face masks, hand sanitizer, sanitizing wipes, water bottle, and immune supplements)

I hope this doesn’t read as xenophobic or bigotted, it’s definitely not China itself I’m trying to avoid, just the virus

8,"Six months into us talking I found out he had a girlfriend that he’s been with since middle school. this boy and I met a year ago, quickly became best friends, lots of chemistry felt like I met the guy version of myself, a few months later we kissed and then started hanging out a lot more and he ended up taking my virginity. I am very comfortable around him I can be myself and it’s nothing but laughs and great conversation when we’re around each other, don’t even have to talk sometimes that’s how comfortable we are! 

At the time I was a senior, I graduated, he is two grades behind me bc of things that happened in his life but we’re the same age still young &amp; I get that. 

When the girlfriend found out about me she reached out, I am a genuine person and she was a good actor, she made it seem as though she was done with him because I guess I was just one of the many girls that he’s cheated on her with. I was okay with being done with him after everything and I was fine with being her friend even though we met through him, you never know how friendships could come about you know. 

Me and him stopped talking and me and her started talking more until I seen that she was being posted by him so I asked her if they got back together and they had. I was furious, not at the fact that they had gotten back together because I’m sure that’s just what they do and I was just caught in the middle of their pattern but I was mad at the fact that she lied to me and had me open up to her thinking I had someone to go through this with. After a few weeks he ended up texting me and I didn’t forgive him but in a way I was trying to move past the situation, so I was fine with talking to him because I thought that that would help me in a way. 
It didn’t we argued about her all the time until I couldn’t take it anymore. I couldn’t handle the fact that he had a whole other person to kiss on and touch and talk to about everything the way he talked to me. Turns out they don’t see each other or talk, so the relationship is just to say that they’re in a relationship basically. Me and the girlfriend share a birthday month. Before my birthday him and I hadn’t talked for two months because his is two months before mine and that was the last conversation we had. He wished me a happy birthday and after that the texting and flirting picked back up and we had sex again, I now know about the girlfriend and I know they don’t talk but she’s still a thing and he talks like she isn’t and keeps saying that’s he’s going to breakup with her soon but he still hasn’t and I don’t know what to do. I do believe that people come into your life for a reason and I do know that I’m young (18F) I also believe that what’s yours will come back to you I just can’t seem to end whatever we have going on right now because i know it’s wrong but in a way I don’t care because he doesn’t but why doesn’t he care? + now I hate the girlfriend why lie to me when you don’t know a thing about me and i was just as hurt as her? We still to this day talk everyday but the girlfriend doesn’t come up anymore because he knows I don’t like her and there’s really nothing to talk about when it comes to her because they don’t even talk themselves. Do I just rip the bandaid off and ask him about his relationship or do I just leave him alone because in a way I feel like I’m a side but the “main” isn’t a thing so I’m confused. 

SN: I typed this really fast if you read it all thank you and if it doesn’t make sense I’m sorry :( I’m really lost rn and I know I like him a lot and I do trust him now as odd as it sounds bc he tells me everything now that he’s past the “lying” maybe he is my person and it’s a phase and I’ll have to move on first just to reunite with him I don’t know but it hurts :( what do I do",08Feb2020,1

10,"Hello,

So not sure how long this post will be but I need some advice.

Just to get the backstory; I (34 M) just got married to my wife (33 F) about 6 months ago. I am a Vietnamese man who is born in America but I still have the Viet traditions ingrained in my blood. My mom (74 F) is very traditional, to the point it's becoming unbearing. After getting married we moved in with her, not because we didn't have a choice, we both make good money, but because I didn't want to let her live alone. She's old and my parents got divorced when I was a couple years old. I have this sense of obligation to her because she took care of me and paid for many things, so I want to essentially pay her back. We pay all the bills of the house including the property tax, she lives in a pretty expensive house. I asked my wife before being married if it was okay to live with my mom. She said that's fine.

My mom has been complaining and complaining about my wife every day and it's so obvious that my mom hates my wife that even my wife can feel it. My mom nitpicks on every little thing just to get mad at my wife. A lot of it has to do with very traditional thinking, like not greeting here or something stupid like that or if she’s cooking she has to ask my mom if she would also like some also. My mom is essentially trying to use her as a maid like the traditional sense, she has to listen to my mom and help anything she needs help with

Most recently my mom complained that my wife is not using the fridge correctly, like not taking the vegetables out of the grocery bag and forgetting food in the fridge (my mom always has expired food in there too though and it’s not the first time she complained about it).  So my wife decided to buy a separate fridge and put it in the garage for her to use to avoid any complaints, my mom complained about that too saying my wife is trying to start something, she is saying my wife has been trying to start something every day. My wife hasn’t really done anything, it’s my mom always trying to start something.

My wife tries to avoid all these things but every time she does my mom gets mad at that too. For instance, my wife doesn’t want my mom cooking for her so she cooks her own food because my mom will use that to say “look I cook for you so you better do what I say” (my mom got offended by the fact my wife doesn’t want to eat her food)

I have gotten in many arguments defending my wife to my mom, she claims I changed (which I didn’t), I’m just tired of arguing with my mom, in the past 6 months or so I have had at least 4 big arguments with my mom about my wife. All 4 times my mom stopped talking to us for a few days, which honestly I didn’t really care. My own relationship with my wife is perfect, but my mom is causing a rift.

I have thought about moving out and just leaving my mom to fend for herself, but I have this guilt over me.  I prefer my wife and mom get a long, but that's not happening.  If my mom continues to be the way she is, I'll need to leave for my wife and mine relationship.  I will not let my mom ruin it.

 Am I in the wrong? What should I do?",08Feb2020,1

13,"Any helpful advice on how to deal with a very toxic, unstable friend that I am actually concerned about how to free myself from because she has now acquired personal info on me that I never gave her..?? 

History: 
-	- I’ve known her for over 20 years, thankfully we live about a thousand miles apart. 

-	- Many years ago while I worked 2 jobs and went to night school, she became infuriated that I was never at home to take her relentless calls. She blew up at me and left horrible messages, using situations I had gone through in life that I had shared with her, against me. I changed my number and decided to end the friendship. When she was no longer able to call me, she began sending postcards (because I wouldn’t have opened a letter) saying more awful things about me, for the postman and anyone else whom brought the mail in, to read.

-	-After a year or two lull, she began sending cards and letters apologizing. Thid went on for another year or so before I responded. I was still very hurt  but I am a forgiving and person and I always try to see the good in people. I got back in touch with her, but this time I did not give her any number to call, or by this time now text, obsessively. By this point I was settling down and moving to another state, getting married and starting a family. I chose not to give her my new address, as we were in touch via e-mail now And I preferred not giving her anymore N personal info. 

-	- As the years went on, I e-mailed her very infrequently as I had a busy life with work and parenting. Meanwhile, she was still living in her parents basement, no job and no life beyond obsessing about her latest haircut or dye job that she felt was botched (she’s been banned from more salons than I can even count).  I don’t have time to reply to the doze s of emails that she sends me on a daily basis, so I make a point to contact her once a month or two and I always gently remind her that my life is very busy and I don’t always have time. I have felt for many years now that the friendship has become forced and obligatory for me, but I have really tried my best to be there for her because I know that she doesn’t have anybody else.
 
-	-Recently, she started bringing up talks of religion. I feel that is a very personal topic, so I kept my answers short and sweet, and ended the conversation suggesting that she go to her local church and talk to a priest for clarity and guidance. In response, she flooded my inbox with one article after another, such as: “Get these movies and decorative items OUT of your house NOW if you don’t want to go to helll!!” and “watxh these shows/movies or do these things and you’ll be condemned for all eternity!” Followed up by questions like “should I get rid of the doll my nana gave me when I was 5, because it’s a sin to own it?!!!????!!!” 
-	We are not spring chickens. This is a middle aged woman behaving this way, and the obligation to be there for her and be supportive has grown too heavy upon my shoulders. 

And just when I thought it couldn’t get any worse….

-	-I bring my regular mail in today from the mailbox and I find a LETTER from HER. I never gave her my address where I live now. This made me open my inbox and sifted through the dozens of emails to see what fresh hell this could possibly be. One of her more recent emails revealed that she had grown ‘concerned' having not heard from me since the holidays.  Then she casually tells me that she “looked up my address"" and decided to write me. As if that wasn’t creepy enough, she then proceeds to causally share that she also was “checking out satellite images of my house/property"", and asking questions about the cars in my driveway and my garage door as though this is a completely normal thing to do when someone never even gave you their home address. She ALSO informed me that she was “trying to figure out how to track down people I know, and my husband"" as well. This is extremely embarrassing..

It has never been uncommon for me to go a month or two without contact, so this was really crossing a line in my eyes. I feel not only violated, creeped out and upset, but i feel angry. I even tried in depth looking things up to see how much of my personal information would show up , and I could not find anything, so i can only guess that she actually PAID some sort to provide this information. (*Update: I figured out how she did it, and made contact to have the info removed, however it doesnt change that the damage is already DONE- she has my personal info). 

In light of my wanting to free myself of the pressure to continue being a friend to her that I cannot be, I now feel this sense of hopelessness that I will EVER be able to shake her loose considering the lengths she has gone to in order to gain my personal information and even trying to track down people in my life whom do not know her, to involve them. 

This is not a woman in a mindset that understands that I am a busy working mother, let alone if I tried to be honest and up front that she has crossed lines and I just don’t want to continue contact. She is a grown woman but with the mind of an adolescent and judging from the past, I’m well aware that ticking her off will lead to outbursts and ‘retaliation'. Im even concerned about her dragging my friends, family, or husband into things and that is not fair to anyone, nor is that comfortable for me. Do I need this in my life? Absolutely not. I don’t know what to do. 

It almost feels as though she wants to send this message my way that she can find me and she can drag people in my life Into it if she wants, and just make my life hell. She already now has my home address that I NEVER gave her or had ANY intentions to!!!! I’m certain she would also have gotten my number had I not just very recently changed it for unrelated reasons (THANKS modern technology!!).

 I’m just at a loss here.. I don’t want to continue this forced friendship, I know the consequences of being straight with her, and if I just cease contact, I now know she has a more personal way to continue harassing me and others that I am close with.. and she will never stop. Has anyone here had a similar issue????? How do you break free???? CAN you break free?????",08Feb2020,1
14,"I'm really struggling to stay focused on my homework and studying for exams in my collage classes (both online and face to face). Anytime I get on the internet to work on my assignments, I get sidetracked by Reddit, YouTube, Wikipedia, and just web-surfing in general etc. Damn, the internet is a black hole. I still mostly get my work done on time (more often then not, on the day that it's due), but it is really having an effect on my academic performance.

It got to the point that I complete forgot about the final exam of one of my last semester classes. By the grace of the heavens, my professor of that class really liked me, and gave me a second chance.

15,"Background info. My family is Muslim and pretty devoted and involved in the community.

When I was 18 I was in an abusive relationship that I hid from my family since all that was against their beliefs. He gave me two options, to move in with him or he’ll tell my family. So I moved in. I ran away from home and cut contact and stopped practicing Islam. He ended up calling them and telling them we’re going to get married (I didn’t even know this).

The police got involved and I was able to leave the relationship but didn’t go back because I didn’t want to be forced into practicing again. A friends family helped me out and they are lovely Christian so I converted. They still don’t know this

My mother was the only one who would contact me and she’d say really bad stuff like, “ it would be easier if you were dead so we wouldn’t have to live with this shame”. So I told her to stop calling me unless she had something more positive to say.

It’s be over two years since that conversation and none of my siblings or parents have reached out. I’m terrified of reaching out to them because if they reject me then it would ruin the hope of something working out one day. They don’t know I’m involved in the Christian community and that my life is going amazing and there’s not a day that passes where I don’t think about them.

17,"I(19F) decided that I was going to move out by the end of the year. My sisters and my mom had a talk about me, saying how it’s hard out there and you’re just making things difficult. First off I’d like to say that these aren’t my real family but a foster family that adopted me so they don’t know how I was a child. I said being on my own would make me happy and they said I’ve never been happy(thinking I was born with depression when I just developed). They think I don’t know that it’s hard out there which I do know it can be, but I’d rather be happy. They tell me about Financial stuff which I completely understand. I honestly want to move in April. 
They all day they care about me be honest I don’t see. They keep saying how they have experience and they know how hard things are, saying that I’m just gonna end up right back at home, saying that my friends won’t be there to help me if things get tough. 
It’s going to a point where I don’t even trust myself anymore, I guess this is why I’m turning for strangers on the Internet. I want to live my life, but I’m scared to take the risk. I need some advice. Thank you.",08Feb2020,1

I’ve been thinking of breaking up with my girlfriend for a little bit of time but I can never bring myself to do it, because I got issues form an ex gf and the timing is always horrible, with GCSEs coming up, I don’t want to make her preoccupied with me over the course of the GCSEs and fail or even after that because I don’t want to ruin her summer holidays over me, I thought I should just rip the bandage of and get it over with but the other person won’t let me be with her because: 1, as I said she’s one of her best friends and will still take her side even though we are very close and 2, she already has a boyfriend.

22,"Hi, I'm a M (24) who VERY recently got out of a 4 year relationship. We were renting an apartment together and going to college. Last Sunday things ended for good I believe and I immediately packed my things and left as I dont believe I could live there and handle it emotionally while not being together. The lease and rent situation is being handled but now I'm in a dilemma. I had to drop my classes (community college) when I moved out earlier this week as to not disrupt my GPA. I planned on transferring to a 4 year to complete my degree. I now have 3 options and could use some unbiased help weighing them.

Option 1 is staying with my family rent free while I figure everything out. Can't renroll this semester as the schools here have already passed that date. Friends live here but nothing ever goes on and I'd likely become depressed.

Option 2 is move back to the area I just left in a different apartment very quickly and re-enroll in my classes. My school and teachers have already approved of this. The downside is likely living in the same complex as my ex whom I love dearly. I also have no friends here as the move to the area was so she could go to university nearby. I'd be completely isolated and alone, hours from friends and family.

Option 3 is move cross country to California and live with my brother and attempt to attend community college there as soon as possible before enrolling in a 4 year university once I meet the requirements. Upside is I'd put a massive amount of space between my ex and I, making the breakup very permanent. I'd likely be happier in my brother's company and in a new fresh environment. Downsides are cost and I have nonfucking clue how to even begin with the college situation.

Any and all advice is very welcome.",08Feb2020,1

28,"So I registered with this company where I cleared all the steps. 

The role is to be a nanny and look after children to which I would be working 9 hours a week and get paid £9 per hour. 

I’m on a gap year but I also volunteer at 2 places. So I did the maths and worked out that I would be getting more than £300 a month. Except I have read reviews where the company takes money from the pay. So I don’t know if that affects £9 or £12/13. So I would be receiving less money. 

Now the dilemma is that, I also have just arranged an interview which happened all of a sudden because I felt like I wanted to work 2 jobs because I don’t do much apart from stay at home, so I could be more productive.

I did the maths for this one and worked out that if I work 16/21 hours a week I would get £525/689 a month and I don’t know if money goes away from this for tax or all. 

I just feel as though with the fact that I stay home and I would need more money to buy groceries/basic necessities and help around the house. Along with other spendings for going out with friends since they seem to pay for me and I don’t like it. So I want to be able to treat them well.

29,"Hi All,

First post ever so please bare with me! And its a bit complicated so I apologize about the length.

Me (24F) and my boyfriend (29M) have been together for over a year and a half. We live about 2.5 hours away from my parents house. We have our own places but sleep together every night (alternate who's place we stay at), and my parents know this.

The first time we stayed at my parents overnight I still lived at home (I had just graduated college and had moved back home for 6 months before moving to the same town as my boyfriend) and they gave us the option of sleeping together in my bedroom or sleeping separate. I think my mom's words were ""you can both sleep in here or I made up the bed in the guestroom, its up to you guys"". Of course we chose to sleep together for comfort since my boyfriend didn't really know my family that well and felt very out of place at my parents. The second time he visited, my grandma and aunt also staying at the house that weekend. After he had already gotten to my parent's house and in my room getting ready for my friend's wedding we were attending, my mom came in and in front of my boyfriend said it felt a bit awkward to have us sleeping in the same room since extended family was over and asked us to sleep separate. This was a bit confusing to us since it hadn't seemed like a problem the first time, granted other people were staying at the house this time. We left for the wedding and decided to get a hotel for the night as my boyfriend felt very uncomfortable sleeping separate. He struggles with falling asleep at night even when he is at his pwn place, so add being at my parents and not having me next to him, it was safe to say he probably wouldn't get any sleep that night. 

My mom and I went to therapy (for other reasons) and this came up in one of our sessions. My mom explained that they just felt uncomfortable and apologized for going back and forth as she could see how that would be confusing, but she and my dad felt uncomfortable with it and for now would like us to sleep separate, but we could revisit the issue later into our relationship (we had probably been dating for about 4/5 months at that point and I was 23). She said she was a bit disappointed about how my boyfriend handled the situation, she thinks he should respect their wishes and sleep separate and not go get a hotel since we couldn't have our way. I tried to explain to her that is was a comfort thing and he kind of felt unwelcome after that. 

It was awhile before we did another overnight visit at my parents (I had now moved out, gotten my own place, and lived in the same town as my boyfriend). But before we got there my mom and I texted about the sleep arrangements and pretty much my mom implied that she and my dad were over feeling uncomfortable and we could sleep in the same room. So for many visits after that we have slept in the same room, just two weekends ago we were there and slept together with no issues. Now we are going back this weekend to see my cousins who have flown in from out of state. My mom mentioned that my aunt and Grandma would be at the house this weekend as well and asked if we would be ok sleeping apart for one night as it would be ""uncomfortable/awkward with family here"". (At this point we have been dating for over 1.5 years) I highly doubt my grandma and aunt would give a fly shit what the sleeping arrangement was for my boyfriend and I. And I am a bit annoyed that this issue is coming up again. I think my mom is more worried about what other people would think of her as a parent for letting us sleep together (my grandpa and aunt are from my dad's family not hers)? Since there wasn't an issue the past couple times (but no extended family was there)...

We are thinking of getting a hotel room again, but am I wrong for that? Should I be upset with my boyfriend for not just doing what my parents ask? My mom thinks my boyfriend's reaction is wrong and my boyfriend thinks my mom's reaction is wrong... I think a hotel is a good idea because it will make everyone happy, but I also know my mom will be upset and see it as us wanting it our way or the highway. How should I tell her that we will be getting a hotel room in the most respectful adult way? 

Also: my dad is very quiet and reserved when it comes to issues between my mom and I (smart man!) so there is no way to know what his opinion is on this matter. And my parents are not religious so there isn't a religious belief reason as to way they would want us to sleep apart. One last thing to add, I have two older brothers, one has never had a girlfriend and the other is married, but while they were dating this issue never came up because she lived close and could always just go home to sleep. So my parents don't have much past experience to help.",08Feb2020,1
31,"Not sure if this is the right place, but I don’t feel comfortable releasing this information to my family- I’m so unsure what to do. 

Background:

Late last year my mom passed away suddenly in her sleep. She left behind a home to which she had just recently purchased with her fiancé(let’s call him Dave) in early 2019, a large life insurance policy, and a cemetery plot that was suppose to be for her but she made the decision to be cremated instead. 

She had a will and Dave (we have a healthy relationship) was listed as the executor of the will and he was left with the house in his name( in his will, I am listed as the recipient of the house if he were to pass- however Dave has three kids of his own and they are splitting his life 
insurance policy).  I was listed in the will as the recipient of the cemetery plot. The life insurance policy was never listed in the will. 

I come to discover that I am listed as the beneficiary of her bank accounts as well as the life insurance policy. 

I recently received the check for the policy and now Dave is asking if we are splitting the money in respect of my moms wishes( which was never verbalized to me). My only concern with splitting the life insurance is that if someone were to happen to him, I would be SOL in regards to the fund that were intended for me. Perhaps I’m overthinking this entire situation. 

I’m also in the process of applying to a four year university, one of them is close in proximity to the house that they just purchased( my moms intention was for me to live/help her out while going to school- which I was game for). 

I want to do the right thing, without this money ruining a very valued relationship with Dave( I view him as my dad). 

Thanks in advance.",08Feb2020,1
33,Here are some tips https://youtu.be/Cr8vChPDy4w,08Feb2020,1
35,"I attend a social group thing at my local church once per week. It's one of my only social outlets and I really enjoy it. I've been going for a few months now. There is this guy though, the first person there I became acquainted with, who is making me uncomfortable. He's somewhere between acquaintance and friend - we know each other, but not that well. 

It's seemed like he's been flirting, maybe? I'm not accustomed to it and am kind of blind to the cues, but a lot of things in retrospect feel like flirting. Eg: Putting his arm around me and pulling me into him when we shared a Bible one time, frequently nudging me to get my attention during the service part and literally doing nothing but smiling at me when I acknowledge it, asking like several times each service/meetup thing if I want to go to this or that restaurant with him or he just so happens to have two tickets to the next group event maybe I'd like to go with him, and so on.

There's nothing wrong with flirting, and if I was positive that's what it was and wasn't uncomfortable around him, I'd just let him know I'm not interested, also the age gap is a bit too much for me (I'm 18 and he is at least 24, based on knowing he's been out of college and at his current job for at least two and a half years, also a conversation where he said ""when I was 23""). It's just that he sometimes says or does things that give me this uneasy feeling in my gut, and I don't know if I'm overreacting or not. I don't want to hurt his feelings, but the way I'd convey my disinterest depends on whether or not I'm justified in feeling uneasy.

He seems to agree with me on everything. Literally everything, and he does so really quickly, to the extent it seems disingenuous. Every TV show I like, oh yeah! He's seen that! He loves it!...But he can only name one character. That YouTube channel I watch? That's his *favorite* channel! But he's just blanking on what they make videos on (logistics and economics). He's a bit awkward, so I thought maybe he was just doing it to make friends or something, but it gives me that feeling of something being not quite right whenever he does it. He also makes odd comments that I don't really know what to feel about, because they are so strange. One day he just said, ""You're really tall for a girl."" I basically responded, ""Um not really tall, but sort of I guess,"" and his response was, ""No, no! That's good because I'm tall."" And there have been a few similar instances. 

And every single time I've gone, he's spent more and more time with me and less with any of his other friends. Now, he doesn't seem to have many close friends that attend, but for the last two times he's barely spoken to anyone other than me. Not more than two words. Even if I'm talking to someone else. He just stands of to the side of wherever I am, staring at me. I assume waiting for me to notice him? I always invite him into the conversation and introduce him to everyone - I don't want to be rude - but he basically says 'hi' to everyone else and then tries to pull me away to talk with just him. 

Now this, this is the part where I feel I'm most biased because of some external factors and past experience, so I could be totally misinterpreting things here or interpreting them correctly but making them larger than they really are in my head. 

First I'll give background: I don't like to be touched. I have an issue with the way my brain receives signals from my nerves that makes it really painful when people touch me. I'm totally fine with a casual, gentle, *loose* hug to say hello or goodbye, but, otherwise, I don't like anyone touching me. The other reason I don't like to be touched was because of harassment I dealt with in high school. There was a guy who would touch me in ways that weren't vulgar (like he didn't grope me, except maybe once but that's a different story) but were certainly uncomfortable, like the way romantic partners might touch - tucking my hair behind my ear, rubbing my cheek, rubbing up and down my back, etc - while saying really vile things like ""I'm going to rape you."" So touches that remind me of the way that guy touched me immediately make me really nervous and uncomfortable, because, even though I know it's someone else, I'm just waiting to hear those kinds of threats or vile ""compliments"" because that's what I associate with that kind of touch.

The guy at church is touchy. He's always nudging me or putting his hand on my back to guide me to where he wants to sit or something like that. It's not that he's doing overt, over-the-top touching. It's just the frequency of it that bothers me, and sometimes where he touches me - lingering touches on my lower back make me really uncomfortable for reasons shared above. And this isn't touching, but I feel like he always sits too close to me. Like personal bubble. If we sit on a sofa, he'll sit on the same cushion as me, despite no one else being on the couch, or at the tables, he'll pull his chair unnecessarily close to mine. I get that the tables can get crowded, but no one else has their chair touching the chair of the person beside them.

Does this seem like flirting or awkwardness? And what can I do to let him know he's making me uncomfortable without hurting his feelings? The harassment and stuff isn't something I'm comfortable sharing in a non-anonymous way.",08Feb2020,1

38,"Hi. Alittle backstory, my one of my friends recently invited me over and I've also housesat for her. Prior to coming over, I knew she had a dog but she talked so little about her cat that I was surprised to find one when I came over. Her friends all joked that she hates her cat. I thought it was kind of funny at first because she seems like a really sweet person.

Her dogs a bigger dog. Very energetic. Not terribly well trained but decently well taken care of. The dogs food and water is refreshed daily. Has a basket full of toys. Cage with a bed. When I housesat, there was a handwritten note almost a full page about her dogs daily schedule and how to take care of it. 

Her cat. It seems like an older cat. I'm not sure what age, but doesn't ever seem to have a lot of energy. Maybe geriatric. Declawed. Food is piled into a dish and the bag is on the ground in another room unsealed. She seems to stay in one place all day. When I pet her and touch a certain place on her back she hisses. The dog nips at her often. If I pay any attention to the cat, the dog starts barking and goes to bite her. No toys. She just looks... so miserable. I don't know how else to describe it. I get the sense that my friend is just waiting for her cat to die.

I don't know if this is an over-reaction, or if I'm maybe over-analyzing. I love dogs and cats. I lost my cat not too long ago and my dog shortly afterwards. I've had both dogs and cats, I've had both at the same time before. It wasn't like this. 

I kind of think less of my friend for it. She's moving soon and I really want to offer to take her cat off her hands. Should I just leave it be? I'm not sure it's any of my business.",08Feb2020,1

46,"I'm freaking out. I'm a 28 year old who was taken out of school in the 4th grade and raised by people who sheltered me into complete uselessness. I have no social skills, crippling ADHD, possibly on the spectrum, extreme anxiety, minor agoraphobia, and numerous other small mental health issues.

With all that out of the way, recently my family's financial situation went belly-up and I'm being forced to find a job. Not only am I absolutely fucking terrified of actually interacting with randoms, but I literally have no idea what to actually do. After a solid month of trying, I've been hired at a Wawa (convenience store with gas station) as a gas attendant (in New Jersey people aren't allowed to pump their own gas. Don't ask me.)

I don't know how to be normal. I just don't. The only other actual, real job I had, I was fired in literally to days because it ""wasn't the right fit,"" even though I performed my job perfectly. I know it's due to my behavior or appearance (extremely fat, looks like a neckbeard.) There's nothing I can do about my appearance in the time between now and tomorrow when I go in to give them my information, but maybe somebody here can give me some advice for how to interact with people like a functional adult.

Do I call everyone sir/ma'am? Do I offer any opinions at all or do I just shut up and follow orders to the letter? Will I be allowed to use my phone to verify that I'm making correct change, since I don't think gas attendants get a cash register that does that, and as I said, I was taken out of school in the 4th grade? I have an app for it that I can get correct change in like 10 seconds but I'm afraid that if a manager sees my phone in my hand I'll be immediately fired no matter what my excuse is.

I'm extremely overwhelmed, afraid, and desperate. If I don't get and keep this job, my family will almost certainly lose our internet, phones, and probably even electricity and our car. My aunt's on disability and my mother is on social security, we can pay rent reliably, but we can't pay half our bills and have literally nothing for ourselves. However, on paper, we make too much for any kind of other assistance. Me succeeding here is the single line between a decent life and living literally in the dark indefinitely.

I'm so scared. Please tell me how to act normal. I recently got Medicaid and a therapist but I've only seen her three times and I'm still a complete wreck. I need to keep this job because nobody else nearby will hire me and driving scares the hell out of me.

I know, I'm a complete mess, I need serious help, but I think this subreddit is my only hope to at least try to get me through this in the single night I have until I go. Thank you.",08Feb2020,1
47,"So I’ve been working second shift at this job since this past summer, the job itself has been hell and so these are my last few days here. But my last few days here are sadly with people that never do their job.
As I’ve mentioned, I work second shift, which is the busiest shift to ever work on. I am relieved by the third shift which usually comes in at 11pm, who literally do nothing and sleep on the job. Most people that work this shift are very nice but there’s this asshole that always comes in on the weekends who refuses to take out the trash and makes up excuses as to why she shouldn’t.
She kept insisting it was my job to take out the trash because it was the end of the night and therefore it was my job. Now mind you this means I would be taking out third shift first shift and my shift trash. Trash that would be sitting there for more than a day. Which are some reasons she refuses to do so. One other reason she refuses to take out the trash is because she says it’s dangerous, so she’d rather an exhausted small co-worker do it.
Now personally I didn’t mind taking out the trash because I like the office clean, however I was doing it to be nice and not because it was required. So whenever she would come into the office and Eye the garbage cans expectantly and continuously ask why I’m not taking out the trash I got very frustrated. Brought this silly issue up with my program manager because this staff member mentioned that it was specifically my job, and the program manager sent out an email explicitly stating that third shift needs to take out the trash.
However, she doesn’t care and keeps making excuses and will force second shift to take it out somehow.

My first method of pettiness was to empty the main trash, but then fill up the new one. However, because no one else empties the trash, it’s just left over for me. One night she even took out the entire garbage bag, which had very little trash, and wasted it by shoving it into the packed full one on my way out.

If I say no to taking out the trash, she will either A. Keep me at the office and waste my time far past when I clocked out. Or
B. Keep the trash full and then blame me

65,"Hi friends. So. There’s this boy (sophomore) that I (junior) very much like. We walk with each other after chemistry class and flirt* a lot, and I was pretty confident he liked me... until today. His current english teacher was my teacher last year, and I’ve remained very close with her, so I’ll eat lunch during her class (which he is in) some days. He’s even taken to coming up to me or sitting near me while I’m in there. Anyways, I’ve been trying to get his snapchat for a while, and this morning on our post-chemistry walk we even talked about how I didn’t have it yet, and I jokingly said he was never gonna give it to me. Well, flash forward to lunch. I walk into the english teacher’s room and tell her I still haven’t gotten his snapchat yet. So, she decides to take matters into her own hands. She wrote “snap or nah?” on a card, and called him up to the desk to take it. In front of everyone. Then she sent me out of the room. I came back in, visibly mortified, especially since I saw him read the card and say “I can’t deal with this right now.” He was super sick and in a bad mood, so I’m hoping that was all it equated to. He did end up writing his snap down, at the very least. Point of the story is, what the hell do I do now? Do I act like nothing happened? Add him on snap from the card? Say something about it? Am I freaking out for no reason? Could this have possibly turned him off of me? PLEASE HELP
*Also, if anyone would like some examples of the flirting so I can justify why I think he likes me, I’ll provide.

My other classmates make me feel like shit (not on purpose) because they complain about getting grades like 90’s while I’m getting 80’s.

anyways, I dont know about their personal drama (don’t need to know it’s none of my business.) I’m guessing there has been some violence or something because my mother freaked out when she learned he hit my brother to the point he cried. (I wasn’t in the house.)

She went to her lawyer/the judge &amp; they decided to get the law involved &amp; now my mother &amp; siblings are under a “protective order” until court.

I’m an adult so I’m not under the order, so none of the rules apply to me. So when they had to leave my stepdads house I could have stayed, but I didn’t want to be the middle man.

So now I’m conflicted.
Should I stay behind for longer now &amp; help my mom until she’s in a more stable environment with the kids, Then leave?
Or should I just cancel the previous encounter &amp; just find a closer place to live &amp; let them live with me?

85," 

Ok, so recently my boyfriend and I have moved in with my Grandma, she is having a lot of surgeries and she needed some extra help for a little bit. I don't mind staying here to help her and my boyfriend didn't mind relocating either, we were actually looking into moving away from where we were living anyways and since we don't have to pay an arm and a leg for rent this situation has actually benefitted both of us, that is of course why I remembered why I moved away in the first place.

Over 1 year ago I moved to a larger city for a program offered for young women who have been through some shit and wanted help with the trauma. I moved in on my 18th birthday and lived there. I worked through a lot of my mental health issues and got to the core of my problems. My grandma knew why I was there and she would visit me and we had a good time. She knew I was taking medication as part of my treatments. Now, when anytime I would go home to visit she would tell everyone my business, anyone who came over. People I didn't even know. This would obviously put me ina mood especially since she 'edits' the information. She's older so I don't know if she forgets and fills in what she thinks is correct or if she just does it to sound better. Regardless it pisses me off. When i asked her to stop she make shitty comments like ""Someone didn't take their meds today,"" i hate that sentence oh my god. This would make me so mad that I couldn't even look at her. She would always say things about my weight or my eating habits, my sex life, my mental health, my finances, things I just don't like for her to talk about. When she asked me to move home I talked to her and i was honest, I told her I couldn't live with her if she kept doing things like that. I told her we couldnt argue and I asked her not to tell everyone about my private life. She apologized and assured me that she'd work on it. Well fast forward to these last new days, my nana will start on me about whatever; this morning it was my weight.( We went to the dr a week ago and he told both of us to not eat fried foods, watch our salt, and no smoking. ) Today i was eating a slice of pound cake with some strawberries she takes it upon herself to say ""Well (myname) that isnt a part of your new diet."" with a cigarette in her mouth. I get upset and reply, ""well grandmother neither is smoking"" She gets upset, i remind her that the dr told her to not smoke (especially since shes had 2 heart attacks and the reasons for her surgeries are due to smoking) Later when i was planning dinner I ask my boyfriend if we should make beans and rice with our dinner tonight or if he thought tacos were enough. My grandmother comes in and starts asking why I am bitching. I was just talking to my boyfriend about dinner and she turns it into a big thing ""Oh, ""myname"" always has to get her away"" calling me selfish when i was trying to plan out what I was making everyone for dinner. I knew everyone's fat ass would want more food. I mean that just how she is. She has to make something out of nothing always. She always makes snide remarks towards me, I am never up to par with her standards. Only 3 hours ago she told me that this girl from this movie sounded a lot like me, in the character description it said ""an extremely insecure young woman.."" I stopped there because wtf?

later today I was making tacos and found mold on the pack I bought. I threw them away and got pissed because I went to a special store to get these damn tortillas just to be let down. I wasn't like dramatically upset but i took a photo and i told my boyfriend i was going back tomorrow to show them this and probably pull a Karen. I went to get the keys to get some new corn tortillas and he was like ""why dont you just eat these"" Now, I hate flour tortillas idk why. I think the texture is nasty and they taste like old people bread and he knows this. Well then my nana comes in as i am about to leave saying ""oh no, what is (myname) bitching about now."" I already knew she was about to jump in on me so i just left the room. I'm sitting in the dining room and i hear her AND MY BOYFRIEND talking mad shit. Hes talking about how overdramatic I am and giving examples to my grandmother and shes talking back to him and they just were dogging me. I was not even that upset over the tortillas i just knew my grandma was going to start something and i just couldnt deal with her at the moment so i walked away. He goes into details about my day with her and indulges in the shit chat. I feel super hurt. I never talk shit about him to her, maybe to my girlfriends but never my grandmother because she will bring the old shit up 3 years later. I told my boyfriend when he came to talk to me that i am upset with him and that him talking about me wasn't cool. I explained to him that We should have eachothers backs and if he has a problem with me to talk to me privately not talk about me to my grandma. Now shes coming in the room getting on me for getting on him and its a whole thing. I am pissed at both of them. None of this should of happened. wtf do i do? How do i handle this because i am out of ideas.",08Feb2020,1
86,"So this happened almost 2 years ago this month, it was my first time having sex and at the time it really fucked me up, I’m kinda over it and fine about it now and my current boyfriend is absolutely amazing, but here’s what happened:

Basically from the start the relationship was initiated to be sexual, before he even asked me out he was trying to get his hands in my pants. I was younger and never had a boyfriend and was just excited to finally have someone that’s interested in me and possibly a boyfriend. Not even a week later he was begging me for sex through text and then he came round and we were doing stuff and he kept asking to have sex with me despite me repeatedly saying no. I was kinda pressured into it as he was saying “you’ve gotta do it at some point” “come on it’s not that bad” “once it’s done it’s done”. To me I wanted to lose my virginity to someone ‘special’ and who loved me. Anyway after about 10 mins of him bugging me I gave in and said yes. I immediately regretted it and that night once he left I had a huge panic attack. We broke up a week or two later as he was really verbally abusive and told me he only wanted to see me if I was sucking his dick and used to comment on my appearance etc.

This fucked me up so bad for so long and I couldn’t have sex again for months. Two years on and I’ve just got a new boyfriend and we had sex for the first time a few days ago, immediately afterwards I was paranoid and kinda down and I felt as though he’s gonna leave me or change and not want me anymore and I know it’s because of that asshole who I lost my v to. 

So sorry for the long post but I really don’t know what to class this as! A bad first time and sexual experience, rape, abuse? I don’t know, and I really don’t mean to offend anyone who is a rape victim and if you are I really hope you find peace and love. I’m just not sure what to class it as, I feel guilty and I try not to blame myself as at the end of the day he didn’t pin me down and force me as I did say YES but it’s not what I wanted, I was pressured.
It’s tricky, thanks in advance x",08Feb2020,1

He finally replied and told me “he doesn’t want to associate with me anymore”. My question is, is that the same thing as saying that he doesn’t want to be friends? 

I asked him twice if that meant he doesn’t want to be friends anymore and he didn’t respond. I asked if he hates me and he didn’t respond.

92,"Apologies in advance for the novella.

This   friend, N., (28F) and I (27F) met a few years back in our first year  of  graduate school (current ages). First, a bit of background. N has a   kid, and her mom moved out to homeschool the kid (friend was   homeschooled herself). She considers herself responsible since she has  to be for her kid. By her own admission, she has really  awful self  esteem, and has told me that that's the reason exes have  given her for  dumping her in the past. Like most people, I can  sympathize with having  self esteem issues. She also has quite a bit of test anxiety. However,  she refuses to see a therapist because she views  it as a sign of  weakness and ""that's what friends like \[me, OP\] are for, anyway."" On  myself, I'm pretty shy and very tired all the time for no  reason  (seeing a dr about it). I tend to not reach out to people as much  as I  should or could. Said friend can be very charming, so I kind of  let her  get togethers be my social crutch. I also sometimes have  suicidal  ideation; I don't tell people about it while I have it bc I  know that I  get it when I feel trapped in a stressful situation and need  to make  some changes that are also very stressful.

The first time I saw her, I got a weird vibe, but figured that maybe it  was  a combo of implicit bias and some halo effect since she immediately   took to Guy 1 who everyone strongly suspects may have NPD. I thought  they were a couple at first, but she had a bf, so apparently they were  just friends.

We're  in a male dominated field and the only two non-men in our cohort. Her and I become  really good friends and we work extremely well together our first year.  She's surprised herself since she never had any close woman friendships  before because other girls were always mean to her for no  reason (cue  red flag). Her friendship with G1 implodes. 

She  tells everyone that she has her masters and that she's really good in a   particular subfield and they should come to her with questions, but  confesses to me that she doesn't actually have her masters because she   failed the comprehensive exam for that subfield. I don't recall if   anyone else is in the room, so I may be the only person that knows this (running theme).  She also plans to work over the not this but next  summer as comp review leader.

To  be honest, at this point, I'm not sure that I'm going to survive my  first year. Giving myself alternatives is my primary coping strategy for  dealing with stress. I talk to my husband about what those alternatives   could be, should this not work out. This helps take the edge off the   stress. He ultimately quits his PhD; he currently works in industry and   feels better for it.

Towards  the  end of our second semester, she asks if I'd like to have a DL fling  with her. I'm married, but my husband is ok with me seeing women (he's  of the attitude that life's short and he's not getting a sex change; no  interest in unicorn hunting or anything like that). I make it clear that   I'm more interested in actually having a gf. We talk about it, but  decide to defer until our comps are over (end of summer; we have two).   About midway through summer, we decide it wouldn't be for the best. In   hindsight, I realize that our relationship had a quasi-romantic   undertone to it anyhow.

A couple  guys were talking about those restaurants where you eat off people's  bodies. She makes a comment in front of them about how she'd  like to  eat off my naked body. I felt very embarrassed by this and froze. I know  we had talked about a DL fling, but had my husband made  that comment,  it wouldn't have changed anything in my mind. 

Comps  come around. Shortly before, she breaks up with her boyfriend as she's   stressed and is finding him annoying. I pass both of the comps, she passes neither. 

We go into our second year. She has a short fling with a guy in an older  cohort. She  then has another fling with another guy in the older cohort,  even  though he has a long distance gf and they're supposed to be monogamous.  She falls in love with this one. I let her know that he sounds like he's  being a real asshole to both the gf and her (imho, gf  moreso). This  conversation happens over the course of several days, but it was, in  essence, me telling her it was a bad idea. She's  banking that he breaks  up with the gf and at some point mentions that the women in a different  dept say that she's prettier than the gf. He  doesn't break up with gf  and dumps N instead.

Shortly after, N hits on my husband. My husband will tell you that he's pretty  oblivious, and even he noticed she was going hard. It makes us both  uncomfortable, and I have a conversation with her to let her know and   that she needs to knock it off.  She tells me it's bc she's jealous of  our relationship.

N becomes  suicidal. We talk about it; I share my struggles with her and  that I  found that it amounts to feeling stuck. She admits she thought it  wouldn't work out. She couldn't pass the comps, so if she couldn't be   smart, she'd be sexually desirable. If she couldn't have that, then she  had nothing else and was worthless. The only thing keeping her alive is  her kid. I take a couple days to make a list of things that may help and   go talk to her. Among those things is seeing a therapist who can help  her come up with better coping strategies and thinking what life outside  of grad school can look like and talking with another friend who did   leave the program (all the while emphasizing that I mean this as   something to have in her back pocket that isn't suicide; as stated, this  is how I cope).

Next round of  comps come around. She passes the one she has in her head that she's not  good at. She comes up to our office and starts rifling  through her  comp binder during the other. I get a little chatty, and  then the  interrupts me to let me know that the other one is going on and she  needs to focus. These comps are not open note. I didn't say anything,  but she fails anyway.

Spring break  rolls around; husband and I are invited to a trip, organized by cohort  the year below us. N is the messenger. We already have plans, but make  very clear to the friend that we would be interested in  next year.  Friend says, yeah, next year! This is stated multiple times, usually in  form of N says something fun that happened, I say, that  sounds like  fun, can't wait for next year! Stick a pin in that.

Shortly   after, I end up needing knee surgery and spend half of the summer   recovering. She makes a big deal about how she's going to come visit me   regularly. I let her know to call a day in advance since bathing postop   was pretty cumbersome and I needed some time. After a couple weeks of   not hearing from her, she calls me saying she's in the area and had  some  time to come by since a different, L, flaked one her. The answer  was  no, but she does call in advance and comes over at a different  date.

Third year, she starts  telling me things like how she's such a good liar, and how she loves  knowing personal details about people since it gives her power over  them. Of course, all this shit happens when it's just her and I alone in  our office.

Last attempt at  comps, it's just her and G1 trying to pass. Afterwards, she claims to  her peers that G1 cheated on the exam. The comp isn't proctored like it  needs to be. A third guy was in there doing a different exam and  focusing on himself. I ask him if he saw anything strange with G1 and he  says yes. Another woman (a good friend of mine, in fact) came in 15  minutes from the end to pick up the exam. I ask her, and she says she  noticed G1 quickly put his stuff up as she came in. A third friend, K,  who left the program already, weighs in to help. Once it looks like  someone could look into it, N pulls me aside and tells me that she  cheated.

Spring break rolls  around, she's organizing the trip, and doesn't invite me. The others ask  if I'm going, and I tell them that N hasn't said anything about  inviting me. They said of course me and my husband are invited. I let my  friend know that I'd like it go. She acts surprised and says, ""Oh, I  thought you wouldn't be interested! Well, yeah, you can join. It'll make  it a little cheaper for everyone."" Friend H points out there won't be  enough parking. Her strategy is to not say anything to the rest of the  group and just try to get there first so she doesn't have to pay. She  also starts trying to push the four of us in the know to share cars when  they don't want to and talking behind the fourth person's back if they  leave the room about how they don't really \*need\* their car. I have  little patience for this and let everyone know that there's a problem  with parking and some nonsense going on. I offer try to offer solutions,  one of which is we just split everything (and say I'm personally for  this as are others). Some are for this, but then one guy, who also  happens to be loaded, announces that he'll just pay for his own parking  and anyone else can pay for the privilege of bringing their own vehicle  if they want. There's a whole thing of trying to condense cars.

A  month later, N throws a party, ostensibly for my birthday. She gets me a  gift (that game The Mind) for the first time, which I accept even  though bringing new nonconsumables into my house makes me mildly anxious  and she knows this. During the party, there's arguing over the rules.  I'm not really one to care about rules, so I say that we just do the  part where we count and ignore the rest of the scorekeeping. N  interrupts and say she knows how I need to feel important, but that's  not how the game works. Then she starts explaining how the game works  and we start playing. I'm too tired to argue, but I found this a very  strange thing for her to say in hindsight.

A  few weeks later, I volunteer to help run the non-men group for  graduates. N is on to be secretary. I'm really looking forward to this  since I'm really into promoting diversity and all that jazz. Folks  indicate that they're up for making things happen in a more bottom up  approach, so I start designing a consensus building thing to facilitate  to get everyone's input on what they want to see. N also is going to be  president of a couple other orgs. A week later, I hear her announce to a  table next to me that she's going to be president of the non-men org as  well. She then comes over to me a couple minutes later and I mention  that I was pretty sure that she wasn't going to be president of it. She  then tries to say, ""oh, well, I thought we were going to decide after  the consensus thing."" She later tells people that I'm going to be the  president so she doesn't have to be since she'll be so busy with her  other orgs.

Towards  the end of  third year, I begin to have suicidal thoughts. I don't tell  anyone  about this, because I know it's usually a sign that I feel  trapped  somehow. Over this past summer, while out of town, I accept the  realization that I feel trapped in my relationship with her. I decide   that when I come back, I'll keep conversations brief but maintain   professional courtesy. I have no doubts that our relationship was bad  and there were a fuckton of boundary issues on both ends. I feel as  though communicating with  her isn't worth the pain of opening up and  that such a conversation is  only possible if both parties have some  basic respect for the other,  which I feel she has demonstrated multiple  times that she doesn't have for me, and possibly other people in  general. 

We bump into each other  in the hallway, I keep it short and explain that I'm kind of busy at the  moment. There's a small getogether  in the lounge some days later, and  we nod. Another friend of mine see  me and waves over for a hug and I go  to her. The third time, I'm walking  with another colleague who takes  the same bus I do around the same  time. The colleague's office is next  to N's and she asks for both of us  to come over and chat. I look at my  watch and say that it's probably  best that I go ahead and get to work.  After this, she begins to avoid me  and I find a letter from her in my  box some time  later. I walk home (\~45 min) with it in mind that I will  decide whether  to read it during the walk and execute that decision  once I get home.  After speculating about what could be in the letter, I  decide that there  could be nothing in it that would be helpful for me,  and so dispose of  it that evening without reading. We haven't spoken  since.

Some few folks have been acting a little weird around me, since then. They're, like, weirdly quiet sometimes.

I  know our relationship was pretty toxic; this isn't my question. That said, I can't shake the feeling that I handled this the wrong way or  that maybe I've really been the toxic one. I've  never dealt with this  much friend drama before and have no disinterested  parties to bounce this off of. Given how we have both treated each  other, did I handle this the wrong way? Did I owe her something? I just feel hurt, angry, and confused.",08Feb2020,1

97,"I bought a car from a smaller dealership and they didn’t tell me anything was wrong with the car when I bought it. I knew it was used but was told there was nothing major wrong with it. I got a loan from a credit union for the car. (One that the dealership used). My warranty was 3 months and literally a week after the 3 months was up, the car just died. Made a super loud noise and just wouldn’t start, wouldn’t move. Nothing. I called to have it towed to a shop and the shop told me that the engine was cracked and would need replaced but because of the make and model of the car that it would cost be about $6-7000 to replace it. Obviously I don’t have that kind of money and I surely am not going to pay more than I paid for the car originally to fix something 3 months in. I called the dealership as well and they basically told me that they couldn’t do anything because it was outside of the warranty and they told me they would see if there was anything else they could do and I never heard back from them. Now fast forward about a month and I finally got another car and obviously I couldn’t afford to pay for 2 car loans on top of all of my other bills. I call the credit union and tell them the situation. They don’t care. All they care about is their money. I stopped paying the loan and told them I was going to stop because it’s ridiculous and I shouldn’t have to pay on a car that broke down after 3 months. (Was stupid of me, I know)  Fast forward to today.. I get a letter in the mail from a local attorney company saying that this credit union is now suing me for 4,500 more than the original loan I paid on the car and that I would be getting a summons in the mail soon for court. My question is.. has anyone ever had something similar to this happen? What did you do? What should be my next move?

I’m 18 and recently my brother, We’ll call him James and his wife were visiting for christmas and his wife and I have never been very close but we were actually hanging out a lot and getting really close over this trip. Something that’s important is that the way I was raised and my family is that we never ever spoke about our feelings basically at all and if you did you had to go to your room for hours until you stopped being emotional. This has obviously fucked me and my siblings up and because of this we are NOT close at all we don’t talk about our lives or feelings with each other. My brothers wife got super drunk and basically she told me that James was raped as a teenager by our other brother, Greg. I was completely shocked when she told me this and I really didn’t know what to do. Greg has borderline personality disorder and I know that a huge cause of this is sexual abuse as a child and I know a lot of people who are abused as children grow up to abuse other. and I guess i’m just feel very overwhelmed by this. I’m not quite sure what to do because it seems like Greg has been abused as a child and that’s why he hurt my other brother James but there’s absolutely 0 excuse for any of it and I just don’t know what to do. I’m scared talking to my brother James would destroy his relationship with his wife but I don’t know how to continue seeing or having a relationship with Greg knowing he hurt someone.

I've never been in a relationship, and my attempts to start one with a girl I befriended a while back after being paired for an assignment in my class really just amounted to her only messaging me when she found herself in need of help with anything academics-related. She quite clearly wasn't even interested in being regular friends with me (seeing as she has ghosted me since the last time I gave in and helped her with her classes). Some might say I'm fairly introverted, but really I just cringe imagining myself trying to initiate and hold an interesting conversation with someone. I really want to be invited to parties, or chill outside with a group of friends.

Backstory:

October 1th my bd,I was celebrating it in an hookah bar that all my friends and me love.

October 25th my other friend does the same,only this time when i got drunk i broke a light switch in the bathroom.Not only that i did it minutes before i had to leave.I was supposed to meet up with my gf as planned.Nobody saw it being broken by me.I told my very close friends what happened. My best friend(the friend) cleaned up the mess and right at that moment i get a call from my gf and i leave(planned it with her).Later on someone snitches me and the owners are furious over something worth barely a dollar. The friend pays it for me,dms me and says he solved everything and that i dont need to pay him back.I thank him.Meanwhile people were really angry because they thought i ran away. I was drunk and the damage was paid.I didnt come to that place until december,I come in with my friends and one of the owners comes furious at me,grabs me by my shoulder and tells me to leave immediately.I was leaving and he says"" you are going to make crap and not apologize now leave"".I had nightmares about this scenario and it hurts me.Outside i text  my friends who are in there and cant leave bcz they already paid,I come back and say i just came back to apologize thats it,didnt even get to finish and the owner with a smile says too late now.

This was 2 months ago,Main story:

My best friend I know since 3 y/o,we went through everything and i love him a lot.He helped me a lot and i tried to do the same.I cant imagine my life without him.He is celebrating his 18th bd without me.And the way i received this info hurt me. A friend of ours was coming home with me after a training and i asked him.Is ""the friend"" celebrating his birthday,he didnt invite me and i dont think he wouldnt do that?He told me that he is celebrating it in that bar,he asked owners to let me be there for 1 night but they told him no and that I'm banned.But beside all of this if i was him i would do the same,him and the owners are great friends because he comes there after school,all of his other friends go to that place too.He would get a nice large place for everyone,with discounts on alcohol etc.Best birthday for him to have EVER. I  planned out a gift for him which i started collecting money for.I wanted to buy him a new set of headphones.We have a tight group of friends.His birthday is always first in the year and on his 16th birthday we wanted to buy him headphones but nobody cared to collect money and buy it.He was hurt and i felt bad about it.I regret not buying a gift at the time.I think that this would be an awesome gift as he does game a lot.I wanted to give it to him on his actual bd but idk if he has plans with his gf.Im lost right now on what to do and how to do this plan and how to overcome this sadness after everything.",08Feb2020,1
112,"Oh boy Where do I start. I’m 18 and living with my parents. I’ve had mental health struggle in the past but I had though I had gotten through the worst of it. Things have been tough lately. Ever since my grandmother had her dementia advanced due to a hospital accident I’ve just been feeling like all the adults in my life have needed me to be there for them. I feel like I’m not ready for this responsibility. My sister has an eating disorder and messes with dinner every night. If one thing goes wrong she lashes out. Each time she does this I refuse to eat dinner. It’s not that the food is bad but it’s always this health shit. Pretty much everything in my life is controlled now I can’t even choose what I eat. I go to a school for kids with mental health problems and earlier this year I pissed off a kid so much he made plans to get someone to “teach me a lesson” on the bus ride home. Ever since then I’ve been jumpy around everyone and everything. Sometimes it feels as if the walls are screaming at me. I just go into my head and I’m afraid One day I might never come back out again. I try to talk about it with my parents but my dad always looks like he’s about to cry when I bring this shit up and it’s just too hard to see him like that.

However she only ever talks about how ugly and fat she thinks she is, how she’ll never get a boyfriend, and that even if she did she isn’t mentally stable enough for one (all her words.) Any conversation will end with her saying that even if completely unrelated. I want to be there for her and help her but she doesn’t actually want to put any work in to get better. I feel awful saying this but just talking to her feels like I’m being held back from getting better myself.

Lately she’s become quite toxic and I don’t know what to do.

#STORYTIME#

I’m at lunch talking to my friend “L” about joining the theater troupe (she’s also in theater). Then the bad friend “A” says “I’m gonna try out to!” 

Now this wouldn’t bother me so much if she didn’t do everything I did, flirt with my crush, cause me to panic over meaningless shit, etc. So I dyed my hair and a month later she dyes her hair the SAME EXACT color!

She constantly reminds me that she’s the leader and that I’m just there to go along with whatever she does. Yet, she blindly follows me.

I can’t tell her she CAN’T join theater because that would make me look like a bitch, but I really wanted theater to be my thing! She already joined band after I said I was thinking about joining band. (I ended up not being in band).

118,"Now of course I don’t mean this in a bad way. I’m not talking about cutting my family out of my life permanently or ignoring them. It’s just, growing up, I always texted my parents about where I’m going and everything, and she always wanted to know where I was too to keep me safe. We always had dinners together if possible and most of our socialization was done with each other.

But I’m 22 now, and just finishing college. I feel a little smothered, and think maybe the over-sharing I do about my personal life and over-socialization I have with them is kinda keeping in a shell. Like a butterfly stuck in its cocoon because it doesn’t want to leave the familiarity of home and go out into the work. Of course, I understand that spending time with the family isn’t a bad thing. I have friends in school and socialize outside of family as often as I can too.

But do you maybe think that maybe having too much interaction with my family is making me kinda stuck in this transitionary period of my life? I feel like I’m not where I should be in my life, and my parents probably share the same sentiment. However, it also seems like they are trying to hold on to me, to keep whatever remains of their son with them, and in return I’d have to admit it almost seems like I’m afraid to let go too, just because this has kinda been how it always was for me.

So would you think that I should start “breaking free” from my family? Stop letting my parents know where I’m going 24/7, and sometimes if I’m out and doing my own thing, ignoring their texts (I know it sounds bad but come on, if you happen to be on a spontaneous date with a girl you’d probably ignore them right?)

124,"Hey Reddit this is my first ever post after lurking around for a month. I wish it wasn't a cruddy one but this dilemma has stomped on my brain all night. And i don't know what i should do but here i go anyway...

I have this friend, lets call her June.
I've known June since highschool.
We have been living together as roomates for almost 3 years and have known eachother for 5. 
I am in love with her but unfortunately she dosen't feel the same way about me. A little while after i told her that i loved her we had to move into a smaller place and we had to share a bed. We had no other choice. Our other roomate got their own room and we slept in her double bed. She would hug me and lay her head on my chest. Which i enjoyed of course. But after awhile she stopped doing it and then would only do it sometimes. It was confusing me and we had an argument about it. I told her that it was confusing me and she said that she does it because it comforts her but she feels bad because she knows about the way i feel. Everything was alright after that and night-time came and i had a few to many drinks and went to bed a bit earlier than usual. I woke up and she was asleep with her head on my chest and had her hand on my face... the next day i said nothing about it. Then night time came. We were in bed and she rolled over so she was half laying on top of me and started kissing my neck. So i put my hand on the back of her head and turned my head to face her and we made out for like 5 minutes and then went to sleep. The next morning i wake up and it's like nothing ever happened. So i waited for 2 days and then sent her a message saying ""if you don't like somone then don't kiss them"" and she told me she couldn't remember doing it. And that caused an even bigger argument. Anyway. That's pretty much it.

125,"This past week and a half has just been really shitty and I’ve been feeling almost like I have to fight these immense negative thoughts that seem to be eating me. I almost feel like I’m going through a break up without the break up if that makes sense, and I’ve been razor focused on working out and staying to myself. I haven’t really felt like talking to anybody or felt like myself, and I think maybe people can sense that bc I feel like my interactions have been different.

I’ve just been wanting to isolate myself, and my appetite hasn’t been the same, I haven’t been sleeping, but I’ve been pretty productive and have been doing my hw and going to the gym consistently. There’s a feeling of content but at the same time misery, but I don’t know if this is bc I’m depressed or I’m just not doing what I need to do. My routine this week has been go to college, do 2-3 hours of hw, smoke weed and go to the gym, and just watch YouTube videos or think about life for the rest of the day. 

And I was just set off by this girl being short with me, and I don’t know if it sounds stuck up but I’ve never had a girl be sort of rude like that to me in my life (it kind of hurts too bc I went on a date with her awhile back). This kind of crumbled my ego, and I’ve been doubting myself and who I think am since this has happened, and I hate that such small/dumb interactions have such an influence on me.

From there, essentially I’ve been like fuck everybody, bc trying to fit in hasn’t really amounted to nothing. My mindset last semester was to chase pussy, get more friends, talk to more people, and it’s worked to a degree but i just feel like it’s bullshit.

My mindset now is I’m going to be on my own path and if you want to come along then I’ll be glad to have you in my life, but I’m not going to change and bend anymore. My upmost goal right now is to reach my athletic potential and just get noticeably fit and toned.

But I know he’s flirtatious with all the younger female neighbors and have caught him leering at me behind the bushes that separate our homes. Anyway, due to unfortunate circumstances I began to talk to him more. He would make excuses to call me and always asked me to meet him instead of just telling me what he needed over the phone. He had asked me to come in for coffee etc.. I always declined. He did some seasonal work for me and when I had to pay him, I would meet him. I made sure he never came in and he did remark that he has only honorable intentions and wouldn’t try anything etc... and he didn’t. After about a year and half I allowed him to come in. First time he was respectful. Then yesterday he came over because I needed to ask him a favor. I made the mistake of giving him a slight hug, he is Italian and I know they are very into that. I meant it in a friendship way, but I admit I made a huge mistake. He kept hugging me, then sat down very close to me and started carassing and kissing my hand, rubbing my leg and trying to kiss me seemingly on the cheek (I kept turning my head). I tried pulling away and he said you don't want to be touched and I said no and to stop. He kept saying inappropriate things, like I love you, which he once said over the phone and I was like wtf (after which he clarified he only had good intentions and that’s just how he talks). Anyway, I was kind of stunned, he stopped for a bit, and I just told him what I needed. He stayed seated even though I was dying for him to leave. I wish I had asked him to go, instead I kept saying well that's it. Finally he said you want me to leave and I'm like yeah. As I was walking him to the door he asked me for a hug and I was like no yet he kept harassing me. He then told me he doesn’t think I like men. Then he tells me he doesn’t judge. Honestly, it was surreal because even with red flags, I never thought this guy was as big of a manipulative scumb@g as he turned out to be. I wish I had told him to go f himself, but I am someone who doesn't react in the moment well. Anyway, I was appalled by his behavior and will never have him in my home again. This this is in his 80s and I'm in my 30s. He has grandkids my age. He's known me for a long time. I am disgusted by him and upset with myself that I didn't kick him out tell him off. 

He actually knows a former family friend of mine who behaved in a similar manner. So much of this episode bothers. One thing I started thinking about is that maybe I’m doing something wrong. I have gone to an older accountant who asked me out in the middle of discussing taxes! Another guy fixing my ceiling started making advances and called me after the job was done. They are all older, foreign born men. I don’t think I'm giving off any vibe. I'm nice to them, but I defintely don't flirt at all. All they seem to know to set them off is that I'm single. Maybe they think I'm desperate. I don’t know. A part of me actually feels insulted that these old men would think I would seriously date/sleep with them. Has anyone else had these experiences?",08Feb2020,1
130,"So today, my mom told me (M16) to get a life because I play too much airsoft, spend too much money on it (it is well over $1000 in the past 6 months)  and don't have any friends. What triggered it is when I accidentally played an airsoft video over the TV while I was in my room and she went off on me. Yet here's the thing:

It's MY hard earned money I'm spending

I'm an avid mountain biker, placed top 20 in my highschool league  out of 120

I'm a high level competitive swimmer (today I had my highschool state championship, placed top 10 and top 20 in my event) and qualified for a high level regional meet (multiple states).

133,"I’m gonna start off by saying this is long, but there will be a TL:DR at the end. (For the record I am male)

This gets repetitive so I’m going to refer to said friend as PF (problematic friend)

Okay, so me and PF have been best friends for just over a year and a half and we met at college. Last year I didn’t really click with anyone else in our class so I hung out with her all the time and that’s how our friendship started, however a lot has changed this year since we started in September.

So this year, I made a whole bunch of new friends and I finally had more than one friend and started hanging out with them slightly less but still a good amount than how much I hung out with PF. (I was staying hers almost every weekend which began to put a strain on our friendship) but it all kicked off in November when I was speaking to one of my new friends, and PF turned round out of the blue and said “shut the fuck up you’re being so loud” 

Now, she wasn’t being loud and I told her to chill and it wasn’t a big deal. She kept quiet and for the rest of class it was fine. But this caused a separation between her and my new friends. Since then, she has talked shit about them constantly, dislikes them for no reason, and hates seeing me hang out with them.

It got to the point where complained if I hung out with them for more than 5 minutes because I was “abandoning her” and all this crap, so to make her happy and my life easier I told her that during school hours, I would only hang out with them at our breaks. This was fine for a bit and it worked out, even if it was at the expense of my own happiness and my own friendships. 

As me and my new friends grew closer she got more and more jealous. She talked shit almost every day and I told my new friends and they had a huge fight.

She apologised - kinda (more on that later) and all was good. Except she kept doing it, and kept apologising. Over and over and over. Her apologies however are completely meaningless.

whenever I tried and go hang out with the new friends, PF would cry, complain and tell me I couldn’t and that if I did I would yet again be abandoning her and leaving her by herself. I complied and stopped hanging out aside for a few chats in class - which also pissed her off.

So, Christmas came around and my new friends wanted a new slate for the new year after the break and told PF that if she would drop the whole thing then they could get along and everyone could be friends. She agreed. I’m sure you can tell where this is going.

Again, she was back at her shit. By this point me and my new friends were close and I began hanging with them again and she started to talk shit again and again. Over and over she was given chances to make amends. Now she is left with no friends aside from me.

Every time I talked to one of them, PF would shoot me dirty looks, every time I laughed at their jokes she would complain and sulk and say “it’s unfair that you laugh harder at their jokes than you do at mine” to which I said “I guess it’s because they appeal to my sense of humour more” which ENRAGED her. To this day, whenever I laugh at one of PF’s jokes she pulls some crap like “wow I thought I wasn’t funny” or “I’m not funny enough” or some crap.

She would tell me I can’t hang out with them and that she felt left out of everything. I reminded her that I spend all of class time with her and spend every 3rd weekend at her house. And that I am allowed to talk to other people wether she likes it or not.

She complained and said “it used to be just us idk why you’re changing” and again I reminded her that it’s because last year I didn’t click with anyone else. She cried for two hours because she took that as “I only hung out with her because there was nobody else” which wasn’t the case AT ALL.

She is a compulsive liar. She lies about everything from what she had for dinner to where she got a piece of clothing, manipulates me, all her apologies are self centred and have a “but”. “I’m sorry but “ “I know I’m in the wrong BUT” And she always manages to make everyone the bad guy and victimise herself.

She talks shit, she cries at everything I do from talking to other people to making a small comment that she blows out of proportion, and she tries to control me and who I hang out with.

Last week I told her that she’s on her last chance. I said I was done keeping her happy at my own expense at that from that point onward, I would begin to talk and hang with my mates whenever I felt like it because I was done walking on eggshells and having my mental health be in the drain because of the constant stress of being around her. If she does it one more time our friendship is done.

It’s mostly stopped but I still see her sulking and crying and shit when she thinks I’m not looking and sometimes I really wanna have a mental breakdown because the constant shit I have to deal with. It isn’t fair on me or my friends anymore. But at the same time I don’t wanna stop being her friend because I genuinely care about her and our friendship but I don’t know how to get her to stop being a crazy, selfish, possessive, jealous bitch.

Please help me. I don’t know what to say or how to approach it anymore without her crying.

TLDR: my best friend tries to control me and who I hang out with and constantly talks shit about my friends behind their back and I’m at a loss what to do.",08Feb2020,1

136,"I just hooked up with a man who I've been friends with on Snapchat for almost a year. We matched on Tinder and it never went anywhere, but we remained friends and talked rarely until a couple of weeks ago. He never posted any girls and I never bothered to look for his other social media accounts if he had any. He made it seem like he was single and that he never even hooks up with anyone.

I didn't see that he has a girlfriend until after we had sex, he turned the light on and I saw he forgot to hide the picture of them on his nightstand, and on the way home he received a notification and his phone background was a picture of her. I didn't say anything, I acted like I didn't notice. When I got home, I searched his name on Facebook and found a result, a picture that his girl tagged him in, and found that they are still together. I used to know the girl many years ago.

I really don't know what to do. I feel really bad for her, I know that if I were in her position I would want to be told.

Can't BS it either; it's a national government laboratory internship. I mean, I wouldn't BS it regardless because I unfortunately have morals and I get nervous when lying.

I'm 21 and have only had one job, the one I'm currently at. I've only been there for about 1 month and I only work 8 hours a week there, so I don't think that would be good...

I had one professor (I'm in CC) I liked last semester, but he probably doesn't remember me, but I did sit right in front of him when he lectured... However, he's really nice and I got a 98% in his class. The class is called Data Structures and Algorithms, which has to do with my Computer Science internship, which is great.

I've had a girlfriend for 5 years? Don't think that matters. Don't want to use family members or anything silly, cause it's a super thorough government job.

Due to the nature of this class, we are student teaching in an intellectual disability classroom for this unit. I have been more specifically working with a kid named Will (fake name of course). We're both high schoolers, however his disorder puts him more at a first grade level in general (social situations included). I am worried I may be getting too personal with him, in that I believe he can not properly understand the relationship I should have with him.

141,"I met my best friend a few years ago due to a random roommate match at my apartment complex. We quickly became best friends, doing everything together. After our lease was up, we decided to move out and get a house together with some of her friends. This was in May, throughout the summer I had some extreme health issues arise, I also got engaged. Immediately I got my best friend some gifts and asked her to be my MOH, she excitedly accepted. Though, those things combined pushed me toward moving in with my fiancé so he could help with my medical issues, as I needed intensive assistance (which she knew). I told my best friend that I needed to move and immediately got the cold shoulder. I found someone she knew and liked to sublet my room, and I moved out. A day later she texted me saying she didn’t think we were close enough for her to be my MOH. Since then, we haven’t talked much, and whatever we have said has been short and only whatever is needed. This all happened in August. 

Tonight, she sent me a text saying: 

Hey girly. I just want to apologize for the way I cut off our friendship. At the time I felt so betrayed with you moving out and I was being selfish and reacted without thinking. 

I can’t lie. I miss her. She was my best friend, we literally did EVERYTHING together, but she dropped me so fast I’m nervous to be friends again. And it’s not as easy as getting coffee and making up because I moved 2 hours away to get better medical help.

I never aware when she asked my mail password and stupid me, I gave her my password.

She prevented me to do master degree and threatened me to leave if I did, fortunately I chose to do master degree and she didn't leave me moreover she also did master degree in the same university but different major so that she can watches me!

She always restricts my friendship and not allowing me to hang out with my other friends.

But I never aware of those signs.

Finally I am done when I hang out with all graduate friends and she really scolded me for it.

Now I told her I want to break up and something I have never imagined before, she threatens suicide if I leave!

I don't know what to do. I have told her close friend to call police and ambulance if she did it and also her dorm friend if something happens to her. Her parents already knew that we have been break up.

I am really afraid and feeling guilty if she really kill herself because it will be my fault. Should I stay with her so that she won't kill herself?

I am really frightened until the point I am  scared when there is an inbox coming in my phone, can't eat properly, wake up in the mid of the night, can't focus study and the worst part is I have thought that it is better for me to die rather than someone else to die caused of me.

I have block all her social media except one so that I could know if she do something strange again to herself. This is to prevent me from feeling guilty. And I cant move far away from her because I have one year left in my grad study.

If she really do it, is it my fault and sure I can't live with being fault and guilty for the rest of my life. Should I stay to safe her but I really can't be in this relationship any longer and I prefer to die rather than being with her for the rest of my life.

145,"so in second period my friend, let's call her M, asked a Mutual friend, E, ""are you coming to target tonight?"" because my friends like to randomly walk to the target near our school after school. so I said, ""Oh you're going to target?"" and so she said, ""oh yeah, you can come if you want."" so I was thought I would because why not right? So no one told me where we would meet so I asked a mutual friend and she said they were meeting out front because they were taking someone's car, so I waited for them outside, and M wouldn't answer her phone, so I got a ride from my mom. (she had to bring me my purse) nothing really happened, I kept texting M, and I have always known she is bad at communicating. finally, she said, oh yeah I was walking with S (friend I knew she was going with) I'm at her house now. (house was in the neighborhood) So I thought, oh E must not have gone. Finally, M said, We are at five guys. so I walked over to five guys. When I walked in I saw a SUPER large group. I went over to say Hi to M and my friend A. But this girl H looked at me and said, ""ugg what is she doing here?"" I have never gotten along with H so I just ignored it. So we all walked to Target, I was hanging with A and E, and M and S and another kid went off, so A said she wanted snacks, so we got snacks and went into the toy aisle, and we went to the ice cream aisle to get ice cream, we were having fun, when H, who might I add was hanging out with the many other friends who were there, and I was just following A. so H came up to me and said, ""So I organized this event, and you are really putting everyone's mood down so can you just leave."" what the FRICK? She literally called it an ""Event"" it was Target! My mom dropped me off, and I live 15 min away! I was planning to stay till 6 when I was going to walk to the school with the rest of them to go to a school dance! where I was going to get a ride home at 8! you can't just ask me to leave! SO I was just kind of upset, I was feeling kind of awkward. but I stayed. another guy said that I did just invite myself, but another guy ALSO invited himself and they had no sort of reaction! before we left target she told me to leave AGAIN! so at this point, I was trying to hold back tears because no one was really standing up for me, and everyone was kind of whispering, so I went outside with M, tried to make jokes about that if I was outside my tears would freeze, and other jokes, we went to party city, and H kept looking at me like with murder looks and I was feeling really uncomfortable, so M and A told me to call my mom to pick me up, so I did and I was trying to hold in tears for a while so I almost full on broke down when my mom called me after I texted her to pick me up. so when we left, apparently most of the people left and it was only M, S, H, and 2 others. So I was almost breaking down, again, and I tried to catch up with the other group cuz they said they were going to Panera, and I was really hungry because I didn't get any five guys, so I was okay with that. when we got there only like 3 went to Panera because the rest wasn't feeling it, so they went to the library, I was still super hungry, but one of the girls to go in was H, and I didn't want to go in without M, so I told that to her, but one of my really good friends C heard, and I think she was just fed up with all of this drama, so she said, just go get food, and I was also upset so I didn't really want to leave, and I kinda said something, but she Almost yelled at me to get out. That's when I completely lost it, because C was my really good friend and I didn't realize she was that angry. she went upstairs in the Library (we were in the part that was basically the stairwell and not really the library so we didn't disturb anyone) but she went upstairs, M and S were really nice and comforted me because I was sad, and said that H was acting inappropriately, and said that they are sorry this all happened, and E was really nice and so were 2 other guys. they all made me feel way better while my mom came to pick me up. 

So a little bit about H, we never really got along. we are in the same math class, and she has always been very rude. she never does assignments, when she didn't do a project worth 70% of her grade, she said middle school grades don't matter, she doesn't stand during the pledge because it says ""under God."" yeah, she's that did.

But I know that none of my friends will stop being friends with them. My BEST friend does not like her, but it's all of my other friends. She has always been this rude and disrespectful, and I don't get why anyone likes her. What am I supposed to do? I have tried to just ignore her, and my friends have to her to ignore me but for some reason, she just couldn't even though we never even talked!

I don't want to be friends with her anymore, but I feel like I can't leave her.

I don't want to be friends with her anymore because she can never keep secrets. Jessica also tells me everything about what her boyfriend is texting her. I feel like she might be secretly screen recording my texts with her too. She's a hypocrite. Jessica isn't supportive of me. She has called my hobbies disgusting and told me I've looked ugly before. She thinks it's ok to be mean whenever she wants. Jessica told me that she's not going to be nice to the people we were tutoring that day because she was tired. She's confusing. She once invited me to a concert when she knew she couldn't go the whole time. It's like she's purposely trying to drive up my excitement and crash it down.

To give you some background, Jessica is depressed and is cutting. I have tried to get her to a counselor at school but she refuses to go no matter what I do. I am getting closer though.

I feel like I can't leave her because I feel like she's going to cut herself or starve herself. She's cut herself before because she was worrying about her boyfriend, but that's for another day.

Recently, my friends and I (excluding Jessica) made an emotional support group. We just talk about our problems and give advice to each other. There, I talked about Jessica. I told them that Jessica is mean to me and that I can't leave her because for sure she is going to hurt herself even more. I'm scared  that she will kill herself if I leave. One of my friends, who is also friends with Jessica, invited her to come to the group. Jessica told her that she would go. i talked about Jessica under a different name, but I know that Jessica will realize it's her that I'm talking about. I'm scared that Jessica will lash out on me or hurt herself even more. I feel like my friends will bring what I said up again because we didn't have a lot of time to finish and give advice to me.

I play the violin and over the past 6 months i’ve been practicing a whole lot more and really improving and i’ve fallen even more in love with classical music. 

The violin has such a beautiful sound to it but lately every time i listen to any musical song or piece at all it just sounds bad and gives me a headache. 

I don’t know what’s wrong with me. music is the only thing that’s kept me going for so many years and i feel like i’m losing the only thing i love. 

Has anyone else been experiencing this and if so have you found a way to fix it? music is sososo important to me and i literally can’t live without it but i’m starting to lose it and it’s really scary. please help :)",08Feb2020,1

165,"This is going to be long, sorry about that in advance. 

I have to move back in with my mom next week for about a month until the apartment my boyfriend and I signed for is ready for us to move in. Now, my mom used to be extremely mentally and physically abusive to me. She still is- mostly mentally. 

For some context, I moved in with my boyfriend 8 hours away and everything was okay but a lot of unexpected things happened and the area we live in actually kind of went downhill and we could no longer get good enough jobs to support ourselves. His work cut his pay and my boss actually fired me for no reason. So we've been living with his toxic ass parents which arguably is WORSE than the shit my mom put me through as a kid. 

Here's the problem: I don't know how to cope with living away from my very lovely and normal boyfriend and back into the house where I have so many poor memories with a narcissistic parent. We don't have a normal relationship and I feel weird staying in the house with her.

On top of that we can't tell his dad/step mom because the dad is absolutely insane. He's seriously like Hitler. He's a control freak narc that would do ANYTHING to stop this from happening. He's NOT above breaking our things or keying my boyfriends car. He has broken other family members things before during arguments (not to mention thrown food on furniture and literally pissing on things..). 

He will throw these insane tantrums over the smallest things. I'm honestly scared and I feel guilty I have to leave my boyfriend to deal with this alone. What can he do to prepare himself? We were planning on packing EVERYTHING except what he uses every day into boxes so that he can get a U Haul here and have everything ready to just throw in before the parents get home from work. That seems nearly impossible though. He has to hook his car up to be towed as well. Idk I'm having super bad anxiety over this but there's no opportunities for us in this area anymore so we HAVE to do this. His mom can't help him either as she lives in Germany but she supports our decision and hasn't told the dad.",08Feb2020,1

It has gotten much better, however the kitchen remains to be a contentious issue, it is always filthy, like dishes always in the sink, garbage piles, food left out, none of it is mine. I can’t cook in a dirty kitchen, and it is actually really upsetting to be in there, especially because growing up if I even left anything out from cooking/eating for more then a few hours(it has once been a week that dishes were left) I would be beat by my father, so seeing all this mess sends me into a spiral of fear. I also really suffer with some disordered eating habits, so this just fuels me not eat because I can cook, and the area where food is, is disgusting. I hate confrontation, however it is constantly bringing me so much distress, when I see it. I have texted, and told them multiple times to please keep the kitchen clean.

Earlier today at school instead of calling me by my name to get my attention he just said, ""Hey, you"". I got kind of worried because it made me realize that I've never actually heard him say my name. Any time he addresses me, it's always ""Hey"" or ""Hey you"", he doesn't even give me a nickname. I was trying to be low-key about it and I was joking around with him at school today and I asked him what my name was and he took a while... It took him at least a couple minutes and he still didn't know. He had to ask his sister what my name was... I was caught off guard and I asked him seriously if he couldn't remember my name and he told me that he didn't. We've had sex and he still doesn't remember... I don't know what to do... Is this grounds for a break up? I feel like an object right now, like I'm not even important enough to him for him to make an effort to remember my name. How can you not remember the name of your own girlfriend of a month and a half whom you've had sex with multiple times, but you can remember all of her friends' names?

I wanted to I don’t even know, just fuck one of them? Not rape obviously. But. And those were my intentions and idk I feel I gave off those vibes....? Maybe? Maybe not? To her? Maybe. She was adjusting her top when I was talking to her BUT I’m not a creep I don’t think I was even staring but well ya, and also when the dad would bring up the girls I feel I’d give off a weird vibe idk idk idk I can pick up vibes but idk if other people can, with me, understand...?

I said ,to be exact”heey wanna go watch birds of prey....or no” u know kinda giving her an option. And like as she gave a response I again gave her an option to back out. Well in the end she says yes. But now later, same day, the dad invites me to eat, at the table, with the wife and it was DEAD silent for almost the whole time. Super uncomfortable, I’d say.

172,"M26 here. A bit of backstory here:

My brother and I never got the chance to meet each other growing up. Typical dad slept with multiple woman story, thereby we grew up in separate households. I was raised by my grandparents on my mother’s side and he was raised by his mother in another state. I am not close to anyone on my dad’s side, in fact I’ve only ever met my grandparents on his side. My dad and I haven’t spoken ever in life. When I was a teenager I found my brother and we have spoken VERY sparsely over the years. The usual happy holidays and birthday but really never more than that. He has reconciled with my dad, whereas I have never had the desire to do so. I harbor no ill will towards him, but to be perfectly frank, I grew up incredibly happy with my grandparents and my grandpa more than aptly filled the role of a father. In a couple of conversations my brother has brought up the idea of forgiving my dad, and I’ve let him know that I’ve forgiven the man, but I have absolutely zero desire to try and create a relationship with the man for the aforementioned reasons. 

However, recently I have moved to another state, and it happens to be the one my brother is in. He figured this out via Facebook and has asked to meet me. NOW, I am more than happy to meet my brother (in fact I’d love to) but I have a few concerns and questions. First, I want to set the expectation up front that I don’t want to be pressed into meeting my dad now or ever and I am wondering if that is fair? Second, how the heck do I go about doing this? I’d like to meet in a setting that encourages conversation but that isn’t incredibly awkward for the first meeting, and I love some suggestions on that. Lastly, I’m wondering if there is a good chance to even create a lasting relationship. As I said, he doesn’t know my mothers side at all, and I don’t know my dad’s side at all. I feel like we’ve missed so much time and I’m wondering if this is even a good idea?

She’s great at Christmas gifts, for example, and in her friend group she frequently plans and organizes parties and things like that. I wouldn’t enjoy any of those things; just a simple happy birthday and maybe going to dinner would’ve been great. I know she knows when it is, because a few weeks ago she mentioned she would be out of town for it on a work trip, and then later told me she had rescheduled. And here’s a kicker; she also forgot last year. We are pretty close, but for some reason this whole thing makes me feel so awkward and I don’t know how to bring it up.",08Feb2020,1

He continues to lose account after account. Our last account is only doing well because I have finally had enough training to forge this last new relationship. They won’t even want to talk to him on the phone anymore, but he is getting the commission!! It angers me. 

Fast forward... we got a new sales person and they have been there less than a week and are aghast at the laziness and straight up self-righteousness of this individual. We have been able to form an alliance and we want to phase the manager out. Truth is, he won’t fight hard because of his shear laziness, but we don’t want to push too hard. We want him to quit of his own accord.  

We plan to continue to work hard, but the dynamic is tricky. I report directly to him. They do not. 

How do we get him to leave. He adds nothing to the office. He refuses to be part of a team. He is purely the definition of what I think other countries think of us in the US.

181,"Not physically, mentally. I've gone through a lot in my life, most notably some sexual abuse from when I was 5 and ending when I was 14. My brother is abusive towards me, constantly lying and manipulating me and my feelings to his liking.

I don't want to go too much into those things. I want to focus on my main concern.

My Mother got sick when I was quite young. She's disabled, can't wash or feed herself, and needs constant care. My dad became her carer, and ended up getting so busy that he neglected me and my siblings. Money is always tight because they can't work.

We ended up getting homeschooled because we couldn't afford the bus fare and my Mum used to be the driver. Because of the neglect we were barely educated. We weren't washed, our meals were incredibly unhealthy, teeth weren't brushed, nowadays dad keeps trying to underfeed me, and we got no love and affection. I remember one thing specifically. My dad approached me and told me some doctors were coming to visit. He said, and I quote, ""try to act like normal kids. Play together, and don't show them your rooms"". That's sad to look back on now.

This part was just venting. This next part is related to the title.


My dad's neglect manifested in other ways. We live in a tiny, mold ridden cottage in the middle of nowhere. There were no other kids around, it was very lonely.

It's kind of a Rapunzel situation. I left my home only once a year. Occasionally 3 times a year. I could only play in the garden and the big field, but most days that was off limits. Being the youngest, I always went with my brothers. 

That doesn't happen anymore. I stopped going outside when I was about 11. If you killed me right now, the life that flashed before my eyes would be of me, sat in the same room alone for years on end.



I've grown up to be a very weak, cowardly person. My dad made it seem like going past the limits of the field was the most dangerous thing in the world, and that still has its impact. I am too much of a coward to leave the house without my siblings, and I hate it. I'm too scared to do anything alone.

I'm going to college this year, and I told myself; ""I'm not going to make any friends. I'll be a burden to them. I'm too weak, and too mentally ill to let anyone care about me. I have to stay alone"".

I stand by that, I don't want any friends at all. After years of solitude you get used to it. However, as you can tell, I'm stuck in a state of self pity.


I'm tired of it. Tired of not being able to leave home by myself without fear. Tired of pitying myself and crying myself to sleep. Tired of playing victim and lingering on my sexual abuse. Tired of always being weak, sensitive and emotional.

I need to be tough. Weakness is ingrained in me, it feels like. But I know I can unlearn it. I have no one else to blame but myself for the way I've become. I need to be stronger or I'll spend my whole life afraid, and wallowing in self pity.

Please, I need any advice on how to toughen up. I'm getting desperate here. I'm tired of people pitying me. I can't become like my scumbag brother.

I'm sorry if my writings bad. I wrote this while I was emotional and I'm not going to spell check it.

Also, I apologize a lot, I'm not decisive, and always act submissive in social situations. That should change to.

Thank you. (I'm bad at ending these)",08Feb2020,1

It's pretty obvious when someone is attracted to you and he just did what was normal. Similarly, this isn't just in my head. I know when someone is interested as opposed to otherwise. 

We conversed about life, future plans, and books. I don't know if I should just drop it or possibly add him on facebook or something. It would be interesting to see if this leads anywhere.

He seems a little better but the violent aspect never changes. Today he asked for permission to go out, and my parents said no, because he was almost all day out with his girlfriend. Because of that, he said that he was not going to go to some activity my parents wanted, and went into his room to hit the wall and throw things while he grunts.
My parents try to give him less permission than me because for that behavior, but he doesn't change. I'm worried because I thought he was getting better, but he seems so immature, and worries me if he is ever going to hurt himself really bad or someone of us.

193,"
We have been together for 8 months so far and I love her dearly. We never have any arguments but there are a few issues that I need to mention.

1) She's raised by a single parent and her last relationship did not end well. Therefore she has a lot of anxiety because of it (she acknowledges it). I do my best to comfort her but sometimes when we go out in public ( I am a social person), she starts crying randomly. Again, I do my very best to comfort her. I get drained when this happens. I have a feeling that she is not fully healed from her past.

2) Her family understands english but to a minimum (have a hard time interacting with my family). Ive tried my best with interacting in their language. Family is an important part of relationships to me, but when both families are in a social setting, there's rarely any communication because of the language barrier (english vs spanish).

3) I feel like she's holding me back in way (i.e. we don't do a lot of social activities because I am worried that she will have a panic attack or cry- it has happened before). Also she does not support my dreams of becoming a navy, specifically navy doctor. She plans of a future family is different from mine (i.e. place to live in the future and amount of kids she wants).

I love this girl but I feel all of this is weighing heavy on my mind. Are these fixable situations? I have a hard time debating on whether I should stay or go? She acknowledged some of these problems such as her anxiety before, and she is going to get therapy (she has before). Should I stay until after the therapy to see how she is?

I forgave every insult he used against me and my sexuality, and decided to move forward.
Anyway, he recently started being mean again, because in our group chat I said that I went to a store, and he said: “lol who cares?”
I told him to respect me, then he said that he didn’t want me getting mad again, I just told him that I wanted respect. Anyway, he ended up dm’ing me, and told me that he respected me, I brought up his past as my bully, and told him that if he wanted my respect, he should also respect me. Long story short, he told me to “go fuck myself”, in all caps, then proceeded to block me. I had to reach out to my friends on the group chat, to tell him that I just wanted to talk. I feel so sad and angry: he gets to insult me and do me wrong, over and over, and to everyone I just seem like this overreacting feminist (because I argue with them about politics) and to everyone my bully is an angel.

He has me take herbal and vitamin supplements which make me sick and blames my bad attention (which I've had for many years) on diabetes (diagnosed not even 2 years ago). My therapist told him I'd probably benefit from ADD medication but my dad wants to do his own research on all the new medications for it.

206,"Advice?

This past summer, everyday I grinded my ass off playing basketball, practicing, everything. I wanted to play for my high school team. I have good handles, a decent shot, and great passing skills, and somewhat athletic (I’m a point guard/ shooting guard rarely). I had previously played on my middle school team and played in a rec league my freshmen year( I’m a sophomore now). I loved basketball though, and would play it any time I could. When tryouts came this year, I made the team. I was feeling good I made the team and was excited for the season. The first game came, and I did not play a minute. At this time I was struggling with confidence issues. It’s almost like I was scared to play and would pass the ball whenever I got it. The next game I didn’t play either. The game after that I played, for 1 minute in the fourth and didn’t do anything special. Next few games I played maybe 2-3 minutes in each. Hit an occasional 3, ran plays as a point guard in the small time I got. Obviously right now I feel like I’m very good at basketball, and the person who starts over me is just a little bit better, but he’s more friends with the coach. The past few games I’ve either not played or played 2 minutes. This is very frustrating that I don’t get to play when I promise you, I grind almost every day with ball handling. So my handles are really good. However I’m still struggling a bit with mental issues like passing the ball when I get it and not creating my own shot or driving unless I’m open. I’m one of the very few players who don’t play or minimally do. Do I keep practicing or let the season finish (really soon) and just not try out for the school team but play AAU?advice?",08Feb2020,1

I felt rejected but I was afraid if I admitted it, people would take his side, so I posted that he said he hated it because of grammar mistakes and that he was racist and told me to give up my male students which didn't exactly happen. 

I also posted and tagged him on Facebook saying he loves Adolf Hitler and that he broke up with me be of grammar mistakes. 

Today I started talking to him again because I was lonely and I felt sort of bad for what I said. I am afraid to turn into an abusive person. I find myself correcting HIM on his Polish since he spells stuff wrong a lot and making sarcastic remarks to him. Before we made up i wrote him stuff like his mum must be ashamed of him and that I only liked him because I was drunk when we met.

However he has been very apologetic and said he wasn't mad about my post. He also says stuff like he will repay me for hurting me and that he will do anything I ask and that I can abuse him if I want. He has told me he has low self esteem and no friends.

I (17 M) have a sister (18 F) who’s in college and has started attending parting more often.

Ever since he brought this cat home she has been pissing on my bed. Now his solution was to just keep my bedroom door closed but the issue is my cats liter box is in my room. So I can’t lock him out.

So now I’ve had to deal with piss on my sheets and my carpet is all ripped up. So we bought another liter box to keep outside of my room. Which now makes three liter boxes. Our apartment I kid you not smells like a disgusting unwashed petco building. It’s gross.

227,"I (21F) have never really had a good relationship with my SO’s (20M) father. This time, my relationship with his dad is strained because of our decision to not move to his city after college graduation this year.

Me and SO have always wanted to move somewhere away from family after graduation, and even agreed not to apply to jobs in our hometown. Our reasoning is that our family’s aren’t great at granting personal space, and we would be treated like children again if we moved back home. Recently, his dad “suggested” that we move to the city that he just moved to a couple months ago and work and live there. The thing is, his dad is super controlling. He likes to be in charge of everything and isn’t used to his children making decisions without him (even when they’re over 18 and grown). I told my SO that I do not want to move to a new state with his family, since he had proven himself to be controlling and overly opinionated about our lives. He agreed with me, and has been telling his dad everytime he asked that we do not want to move there after graduation. His dad has gotten really upset at him, and everytime SO doesn’t give him the answer that he wants he lectures him for over an hour.

To add on to this, recently his dad said some derogatory comments at dinner about black women (I am a black woman) that rubbed me the wrong way. I didn’t say anything at that moment, I waited until afterwards to vent to my SO and his sibling (also a black woman) about it. I told them that it really upset me, and that next time something like that happened I wouldn’t let it slide and I would confront their dad about it. They both agreed that I was right to feel that way. Apparently, SO’s sister went and told her dad everything I said about him (fake, right? She vents to me all the time about stuff and I’ve never once betrayed her like that) and he was super upset. He called SO and yelled at him about “letting your girlfriend disrespect me and badmouth me in front of my children” and how he’s not gonna walk on eggshells around me. He also denied that he said any such comments, then continued to say that IF HE DID, that I shouldn’t be so sensitive (so, gaslighting). He then went on to say that I’m the reason we don’t want to live in the same city as him, and accused me of “running” his son’s life. SO has defended me this whole time, saying that I have a right to be offended by his comments, and that we make our life decisions as a team, with neither of us deciding things for the other.

This whole situation has caused a bunch of tension in his family, and I feel really bad. He has texted his sister asking her why she went and told her dad everything, to which she again went and told her dad she was being “attacked” by showing him their text conversation. SO and his dad haven’t spoken in a while, which is unusual. We’ve heard that his dad has been talking about the situation with immediate and extended family, saying that SO was making a mistake by taking a job offer in another city(with super good benefits) instead of moving close to his dad. We’ve heard he’s also spoken about taking away SOs car, although he hasn’t threatened him directly. They’ve all been gossiping about him and treating him like he’s done something horrible. My SO feels so torn down and upset that his family is treating him this way.

Is there any way we can make this situation better? Should I apologize to his dad for saying I would confront him? Should we just move to the city like he wants us to? Or should we continue to plan our own lives, and either attempt to reach out and make things better, or go about our lives until they come around?",08Feb2020,1

230,"English isn't my first language so beware of errors.


Watched both seasons of Sex Education. Really loved Otis and Maeve dynamic. Through that I started to feel the need to break out of my little bubble and go enjoy life and have romantic story of my own.

Then life brought my mind back to earth. I'm almost 20 years old. High school ends in 4 months. Had 2 big crushes in my life. Never had the guts to tell them how I felt (my bravery wouldn't matter anyway because my life was thrown between home, school and church) and now I don't even know where are they in the big world + for the better good of my heart I needed to move on. 

My class is the most divided class I've ever met. People are divided in the groups + 26 man and 3 tomboys (yeah yeah I know... I choose to get educated in IT printing class, believe me I regret that to this day)

I dont know many people, dont have courage to meet new ones. Don't drink alcohol so most of the parties are unavailable for me.

Then there came thoughts about me don't caring about my health, me being fit, still don't having driving license, don't knowing what should I do with my life, where to go? What to do? Plus I've got huuge problems with mt adult life (was always raised to be the follower and the one who should just stay in line, dont risk, never folloe dreams) for example, I changed my hairdresser after 6 months of complaining about the old one only because I was too afraid of CHANGE.

Through freaking Netflix tv series I realised how lost in life I am at the moment. How I am shallow of my former self. To the full on depression I only lack suicide thoughts which thank Jesus didn't appear.

And I don't change anything to make it better. I try some stuff but no matter how big or small the progress is I feel the same burning inside my heart/soul and I don't know because of what Im feeling so shit. The only thing I know it's for sure linked to my problems (all of them or maybe one)

I live a normal life. Go to school, comeback, play games, do homework, go to sleep at freaking 4AM and sleep only 3 hours. I smile when something  makes my heart warm, I laugh when I experience something funny. Only during nights I got ""woke"" and realised how fooked I really am. Don't understand why to be honest. When I woke those feelings fade.

So I realise now how sad of the person I am. Smile on the outside and never fading sadness on the inside.

And nobody can help me. Got some amazing mates/friends but they made memes out of my depression long before actual depression showed up. And it stayed that way for years. Now they're usually sarcastic/ironic while I've got bad days.
My mom don't know how to help me either. My dad doesn't really gives a shit as long as Im alive. Siblings are too young to help in any way.

Never felt so alone in my entire life.

I'm crying writing this because it's really hard to open up to strangers and I'm not sure I can keep up longer. Not even sure everything I wrote before makes a lot of sense.

233,"I’m a college student in the US. No one except a few close friends even know I’m not a virgin. Two weeks ago, I had sex with someone I met on an app. We had been on a few dates and he was easily the best guy I’ve ever dated. But he had some personal issues to work out that, through no fault of his own, made it necessary for us to end things a few days after we had sex. 

We were very careful. I’m not on birth control, but I was on my period, and he used a condom that I know for a fact didn’t break or slip. He also pulled out. Seemed like chances were zero that I could have gotten pregnant. 

But I think somehow one of those little swimmers got through. It’s been a little less than two weeks now, and I’ve got so many symptoms consistent with pregnancy. I’m tired all the time, my stomach is perpetually upset, and I’m hyper-sensitive to smells. I thought it was probably just my imagination. I googled some more pregnancy symptoms just to see what I should be on the lookout for. 

Then, today, while using the bathroom, I noticed in horror that I was bleeding, a full *two weeks* before my period was due. But it wasn’t like period blood. My period blood is usually red and contains pieces of uterine lining. This blood was brown, very light and liquid with no uterine lining. Spotting, if you will. This was one of the symptoms I’d read about. 

The pregnancy test from Walgreens was negative, but also it’s way too soon for it to be accurate, according to the instructions. I can’t get the thought out of my head that I’m pregnant. 

What the fuck will I do if I am?! I’d need to contact the guy... how the hell do you tell someone they’re going to be a father?!? I’d have to decide what to do - I could never get an abortion because I know the “what if” would plague me for the rest of my life. I always imagined if I got pregnant I’d raise that kid, but that was assuming I wouldn’t still be living in a college dorm! And I like the idea of adoption but I don’t know how I could ever trust a stranger enough to adopt someone I gave birth to.

I’m so freaked out right now and it’s too early to accurately take a test and put my mind at ease. I feel so lost. Help.",08Feb2020,1

Now that she's gone to college, she feels that she has free reign over her life and lifestyle and feels that she can do whatever she wants. One of my dear friends recently messaged me on Facebook to say that her daughter saw photos uploaded (that I am somehow not able to see) of K getting intimate with another woman. I am completely supportive of gay and trans people but I don't believe K was doing this for the right reasons.  

During the holidays my daughter came back and I confronted her at the dinner table about what I had been told by my friend. She got very angry and upset and told me she was planning on transitioning and that she has a ""new name"" other than the one I gave her. Needless to say I was shocked and appalled that she would do this without confronting me. After that I have not contacted her since she returned to college. Through her bitterness she has tried reaching out to me but I am having none of it.

She remains in contact my family although I have suggested they cut contact until she ends this problem she has caused. I am planning on ending her contract. She has attempted to pull my husband's heartstrings and tried to guilt him since she claims having phone contact is important to her. but I know in my own heart that this is false and cannot see myself helping until she admits that she was wrong and stops trying to slap me in the face with embarrassment. 

My husband (and my children to an extent) are somewhat furious with me (they don't see through her like I do) and have told me I am risking losing my daughter although it's her that is risking losing a mother and the financial support I provide. I have been to my local church who have shockingly tried to warn me against my stance. Well her plan worked because now she has caused irreversible damage between me and my husband and I feel like I can't forgive her for that either. 

I just need some sane advice to help me through these tumultuous times. I know I'm right but I need to hear what others may have to say about this. She changed her name to a man's name simply to spite me for goodness sake. A phone contract isn't the end of the world now is it.

Thank you very much for reading and hopefully I get some sane responses. If it helps she was vaccinated in early 2001 which I accredit this to.",08Feb2020,1

236,"So I live with my mom, and she has always been very religious and conservative (even homophobic and this kind of things).

246,"I've heard about child labor and chocolate a while back but didn't think too much of it then, I figured maybe it was an isolated incident with one company. 

Today I found out that many major chocolate companies indirectly work with farms in West Africa that may use child labor. 

I love chocolate and not eating chocolate until this is fixed would suck, which may take decades.

So does buying chocolate from major chocolate companies means you're a bad person that supports child labor?

Is it possible to condemn child labor while buying chocolate from major companies that may indirectly use child labor?

I'm too cheap to buy expensive chocolate from child labor free chocolate companies, so I'd rather not have any chocolate if my only option was either buying it from more expensive smaller companies that don't use child labor.

247,"A little backstory. My dad [60sM] is actually my grandfather. He and his wife adopted me when I was 7, after my mom committed suicide. My biological father hasn't been in the picture since I was 3, except for a brief period where I lived with him as an adult and realized he's an irredeemable methhead.

My biological mom had Bipolar, and it's hereditary, so I have it too. This caused a lot of issues with my parents when the symptoms started showing up around the time I turned 12. The timeline is a little fuzzy for me, but if you've ever dealt with someone with untreated Bipolar, you know it gets ugly. We had screaming matches, some physical fights, and we never really connected as parent and son. My whole life, and even to this day, I feel like I never really had parents since I never had a meaningful, solid relationship with someone I could call a parent.

I wasn't kicked out, but I felt the need to move out when I was 17. I felt this was for my own good, and I wasn't thinking about how this effected my parents. If anything, maybe I felt like they'd be better off without me in their life.

Back in March 2019, when I was 21, I was hospitalized and ended up getting a lot better. When I called my dad from the hospital to tell him about my progress he actually choked up. This was the first moment I comprehended that he really loves me, and I've felt guilty about the way I treated him as a kid ever since. He's been giving me financial support since a while after I moved out. I was homeless, but he's the reason I lived in my car instead of on the streets. He's the reason I had the money for food, gym memberships for the shower, clothes, and the like.

I've never been good with being friends with people out of my age group, especially older people. I want to be friends with my dad. I'll be honest, we will probably never really be father and son, but I would like to be friends, and I think he would like that too. But I don't know how to get past the barrier of awkwardness between us, and even if I were to articulate how I feel to him, I don't know what comes next. 

I want to start by sending him a letter with a lot of words apologizing, and some stuff about my life. My hobbies, interests, and stuff. I feel like he never got to see those parts of me since our interactions were always clouded by my mental health and my bad behavior. After that, I don't know. I don't even know if the letter is a good idea.

We live very far from each other, and we don't share any social media. All our interactions will be through text and calls unless one of us visits the other. I know how to apologize, but I just don't know what to do afterwards. As far as I know, we don't share any interests. If we weren't relatives, we wouldn't make any attempt to interact at all. If we found some things in common it would be great, but if not I'm not sure we could be friends and I don't know what to do about that. We still talk to each other every once in a while, mostly about major life stuff. I tell him when I move or get a new job or something. He sent me money, and I'm proud to say I don't need that any more. There's just no basis for us to interact beyond that, and it feels bad.

tl;dr: My dad and I had a terrible relationship growing up, and I want to apologize and be friends, but I'm not sure if it's possible.",08Feb2020,1

My grandfather passed away about a year ago, leaving behind a 2001 Ford Explorer with only 75k miles. However, it has extreme rust problems and a bunch of other quirks. So that's one option, but idk if it could survive the trip to Florida.

I could also trade in/sell the Explorer. Idk what I could get for it, $350, $500. Idk. I could put it towards something safer.

Let's say I decide to sell. Do I buy in Mass and take a roadtrip to FL or do I take my chances and wait until I get to florida to buy?

254,"I met this girl about 4 weeks ago on Tinder and we’ve been meeting up about once or twice a week since then. Maybe 6 total dates 

The thing is I’ve come to the realisation I don’t really like her.

She also keeps mentioning how her ex did this, he did that etc whenever something happens. Which I can’t stand.

My two very good friends, we'll call them ""Max"" and ""CJ"", have essentially ""broken up.""

However, CJ is pissed and tells max it's no wonder his dad left him when he was a kid, and makes fun of his appearance. CJ thinks it's Max's fault since max is constantly teasing CJ, despite the fact that as friends, we all make fun of each other, but CJ's justification is that max always ""harasses"" him. 
Another reason that CJ is mad at max is because he's been spending more of his time with his new girlfriend (who is a friends to all of us) and not with us. Everyone in my friend group believes its Max's full right to spend a few months with his girlfriend after spending years with us.

Keep in mind that CJ has multiple recordings of us, including max and myself, saying embarrassing things and teases us about it. CJ is clearly in the wrong and overreacting here. What should I tell CJ to convince him to apologise to Max? CJ firmly believes he is in the clear and has done nothing wrong, even though he made fun of Max's divorced parents and apperance.",08Feb2020,1

I MAY ADD, REMOVE OR CHANGE PARTS LATER IN EDITS TO MAKE IT MORE CLEAR

OK so during my final year of Computer Science after the first semester I got severely depressed. I had passed 1 module really well but the other one was falling behind. After speaking to my mum at 4am really down and crying (I go to uni really far away) she told me she would book a doctors appointment in the mourning to speak to them and that everything will be OK.

The doctor recommended since I lived alone, wasn't eating or sleeping well or even leaving my studio flat daily that I take an interruption to study to rest at home and get mentally better.

Fast forward to the start of the new university year, it's the last year they will be running the version of the course I was on and had already studied for a semester. So before I was 100% I went back thinking I can already start on the coursework as I have studied it before at a nice pace and it should all be fine. However multiple events happened all at the same time big deadline, sister got burgled while inside her shared flat alone and a lot of other things made me nosedive back into severe depression. This time I felt so weak that some days I didn't get out of bed until 9-10 pm at night. I would only leave my studio flat to buy pre cooked food from the nearby supermarket and then sleep again.

Spoke to the doctor over the phone this time to say my depression was back but a lot worse. We both agreed it would be best if I went home so I wouldn't be alone, to start on antidepressants and do relaxing things to reduce and remove stress essentially working on getting mentally well.

Before I came home I had asked my mum if my sister was to still move out as planned, if I could have her bedroom (the smallest) as well as mine (the largest). This was because when living alone in my studio flat which is the kitchen, lounge, desk and bed all in one room but with a tiny room that's for the shower, sink and toilet. It was very depressing working in the room I sleep in and sleeping in the room I work in. I essentially couldn't switch off from all the stresses of my course as well as personal projects im working on that I would love to turn into a business one day.

Since the room was going spare she agreed and I planned for the bedroom to be nice and simple. A single bed, draws and a wardrobe and the walls kept neutral. So that if I was ever to move out it would simply be a case of packing my cloths and bedding and then all my stuff from that room was cleared.

The larger room would be my office. I have a lot of collectables from over the years, computers, computing/networking/electronics equipment and a few things for hobbies (i.e an instrument and lego). I had planned a large computer desk so I can be programming on 3 screens which saves SOOOO much time. It also gives me space to run my Raspberry PI servers, move the home network to the room, setup my 3D printer, mini aircon unit (under the floorboards are the pipes from the boiler, with just my PC on the room gets very hot. and draws under the desks to store everything else. The collectables were going to go in this nice white block modular cabinet in the alcove at the back of the room. Oh and a plant or 2 :). The room I designed, looked forward too and started to gather the stuff for was going to be absolutely perfect to bring around gaming friends, play games, work, tech projects, stream the works it was something I was really looking forward to and it was OK with my mother at the time.

So I finally over the space of weeks pack up my studio flat ready for my uncle with a van to drive it and myself home. My mum was hoping the contents of the van would go straight into a storage unit however it couldn't as I had no time physically to sort out what I needed to carry on with my university dissertation at home. So for now the boxes were in the living room. (September time)

The stress of pushing myself with no energy to pack everything and to move out of the studio that I was in for an average of 23 hours and 55 minutes a day completely wiped me. I told my mum I would move the boxes and soon as possible but that I just had to sleep. Each day I woke up after hours and hours of sleep it felt like I hadn't slept at all. Though I haven't experienced one to me it felt like waking up from an achoma each day I was so physically and mentally drained upon waking up. On bad days I would just sleep for the whole day, on OK days I would be able to get and and really only have a bath and grab something to eat. On a good day I was able to get up, have a bath and do 1 small chore on my mental list of things I need to do.

My first priority was to clear my boxes from the lounge as it isn't fair that my mum has to put up with them. That was my intention but then I found out that her shop really needed a transnational website. I had always said I would do one when I had finished university but I overheard that it was really important to get one up as soon as possible and make it transnational. So the boxes stayed for a bit while I was making the website for the shop, I let mum know what I was doing so she knew I wasn't just playing video games or watching netflix. After a few weeks I had fully made this website with admin controls to make it so my mum could add remove price products herself. Afterwards a few other house maintenance things needed to be done. The fridge freezer was making this constant loud mooing noise that kept me awake, so I had to take it apart to fix it over a day (saves mum £200). The pressure valve broke on the hot water tank. I had to find that out myself by trying to find where the running water noise was coming from. I had to explain it to my mum so that she could explain it with the landlord. That took them weeks to come out and fix it, this slowed me down because I was worrying if a kid came along and blocked the small overflow pipe outside easily accessible and visible at night. It would cause the house to flood. When the water bill came in, we were billed £300 instead of the normal £30!!!

I  also replaced the light sockets, light switches, removed the old broken bed, built mums new bed, setup and configured her new TV and fire stick, built ikea furniture for her room, laid new carpet. So everything was working as it should again and not be a safety/fire hazard. I was finally able to move the boxes from the lounge, I wanted to do them earlier however each day in my mind I said I could move the boxes which makes the room tidier or I could fix this broken important thing. Im very OCD and paranoid and the depression amplifies these things so making things work in the house again and updating old not safe things reduces the total stress I have. (Their were also a lot of other things I did like regular doctors appointments, bank, dentist etc) which was very difficult when I could barely complete 1 small task on good days.

After Christmas time when my mothers shop was less busy and the busy holiday season was over she had more time to pay attention at home. She knew how bad my depression was, she says she understands it by having to put up with her own depressed mother when she was younger. I also thought she knew that it can take a very long time to recover. I was just getting to the point of doing 2 tasks a day. Their was a few TV parts on the lounge floor for a few days as I was repairing the back lighting of the TV. If I had 1 more day then they would have been removed as that was my task for tomorrow. (Essentially up until this point I had slowly been getting better since being put up to a higher dose) it was the first day I was able to achieve 2 tasks I told her when she came in how I had done 2 things. Now I wasn't expecting a medal or a congratulations for this, I understand how doing 2 small things is a simple and easy thing for other people to do, however this isn't the case for me when im suffering from depression this bad. What happened after I told my mum what I achieved was in a cold and calm voice. How my room is a mess, you haven't washed, you haven't cleared the lounge of the TV parts, this is my house, you follow my rules and if you don't like it, I can return your rent money and you can find a flat somewhere to live. I was crushed, destroyed, bought to tears. I had been trying so hard each day just to not sink lower into this abyss and was at a point where I was being more productive, of which made me happier and with less things on my list reduced my stress. But she destroyed all my progress that had taken me months, in just a few seconds.

I  got up to go to my room but not before she said how I should grow up and stop crying I just wanted to get away from the situation. She came into my room a minute later about to start with it again but before she did I just broke I burst into tears saying how hard I had been trying from days where I achieved nothing except for maybe sitting up in bed for 5 minutes to getting up and doing some tasks I needed to do. I literally laid out everything I was feeling how Iv'e been trying my best and prioritising what I do task wise for her benefit. I would love to have un boxed and tided my room as my first task. But fixing things that needed to be replaced saved you hundreds of pounds. I focused on the website for your business I did so many things that I hadn't gotten to anything I wanted to do from tidying my room to meeting up with friends I hadn't seen since I left for university 5 years ago. Since I left for uni I have had friends give birth, get married, get their own house, have their 2nd child and even a friend who died. I have only left the house in the past 5 months one time for something I wanted to do, which was go into the nearby town just to prove to my mum I wasn't being lazy, Im just lacking so much in energy, both physical and mental that when I do have some, I want to get something in the house done that reduces both yours and my stress.

After I explained everything I thought for sure she understood what I was going through. I thought now that I told her I would hear small, daily little comments that to me sound negative like ""So you haven't done anything today then?"". I was hoping after a day or two of being left alone I would spring back to where I was before, but that didn't happen.

The next day when my mum got back from work I was on the phone. I had been waiting for a parcel that every day they failed to deliver so I was on the phone to them to sort it out. When I was finished I went upstairs to bed, my thinking was if I can go to sleep now, nothing negative can happen between me and my mum and then tomorrow I can do tasks again. She called me down saying ""NAME, can you come down here please"". This has always stressed me out as I don't know if im in trouble or not. So for the first time I said ""Umm, if you don't mind can you tell me what for or come here as that really stresses me out and im trying to recover after everything that happened yesterday"".

However she came into my room and started saying things again which really stressed me out, caused me to panic etc. She first said ""You have 5 minutes to move the TV parts downstairs or I will put them in a box and move them myself"". Instantly going through my head is 1, I cannot move them im feeling so low from yesterday as well as the poor sleep from the nightmares and being put on the spot like that I just had no energy to do it. 2, If she was to put the £40 inverter board or any other sensitive part that I was going to put on ebay to part fund a new TV replacement her handling of it and putting it into whatever box could break it via static. (She isn't techy) So to me I took her ultimatum/threat as in 5 minutes, im going to break £100 of stuff. I tried to explain to her how I physically couldn't im so low from yesterday, I explained to you how the depression is affecting me. She just repeated again what she just said and walked away. I called out ""Mum!"" a few times to try and stop her walking away so I could explain again how I can't do it, and you will break it. If you can give me 2 days. 1 day to got over being low and upset again which you have just caused and the 2nd day to move the parts. She then said how ""Iv'e booked you an appointment to go see the doctor next Wednesday if you don't go then Ill get a professional to come here"". I told her how I can't deal with sudden changed (I believe and I told her 5+ years ago I might have mild Asperger's the sudden change thing has always been hard for me) and that I will go but the week after and can you please stop having ago at me like this and giving ultimatums, your not helping me get better your making me worse. (I wanted to go the Wednesday after as at the doctors request I had made the first plans since I had been home 5 months to go out and meet a friend, we had planned to meet that day. However my mum said ""You will go with me to the doctors next Wednesday, or I will get a professional to come here, If you do not then Ill tell \[LISTS ALL MY RELATIVES\], about whats going on because your not well and you need help"". She then agreed to leave my TV parts alone until we had seen the doctor. (Im quite a reserved person, being threatened that she would tell all my relatives what im going through without my consent without a care in the world made me even more upset)

So not only has for 2 days in a row my mum has crushed me, even when I google along the lines of ""Telling someone you know has depression to grow up"" by people is considered cruel. But now she wants to be in the room when I speak to the doctor. Which isn't helping since I can't fully discuss my problems because 1, your causing some of the problems and 2, in the past she has caused me to be humiliated in front in front of my class, my summer club which led to me isolating myself on Saturdays  since I didn't want to go to my ex friend's house after she told him something medically embarrassing and he told my whole class. Then I stayed at home all summer holidays from then until I was a late teen because she told a member of the summer club this truly embarrassing thing to get a laugh for 5 seconds. Who later told another member of staff with 20 kids present and it went to everyone like wildfire and I got a new nickname that got chanted to me.

So now she is in my doctors appointment with me (At the time of writing this, she also came into the next one). I know I could have said to the doctor I refuse her entry but Im living with her and currently it seems my mood is mirroring hers so to keep her happy I accepted it. My mum says how it's been months, he isn't getting better, I want him to see a therapist etc etc. After the doctor asking us questions and us answering she said how she was happy that im making progress but would have liked to have been a bit further along. She asked for my permission in contacting this counselling service which I was happy to do as I want to get over this depression and to come back next week. Before leaving my mum then said to the doctor how she wanted access to my medical (it was like history/records not 100% sure now) and the doctor said you would have to talk to reception about it and they would need my consent.

Im not happy at this point because in the past my mum has embarrassed me with my medical problems. I fear a repeat of it, I did agree to giving her access as I thought since she can then find out if Im attending my appointments, that im doing what the doctor recommends etc then she wouldn't come into my further appointments (But she did anyway for the next one, haven't had another yet).

At this point it started to get better at home. I think it was because a lot of her fears had been put to rest as well as she can see the next steps I will be making to getting better, like with counselling coming up. Because of this each day I was able to get something done daily again. I was able to setup our new internet, transfer over our phone contracts, clear the coffee table etc. Slowly getting everything I need to get done, done, so that I can focus on more creative things like Hama beads and music to I hope speed my recovery.

The next doctors appointment was nothing special, just to let her know how the week had been but my mum was also their so I felt like their were things I couldn't say. Oh and so she could ask for a Menopause test.

So that's where my depression currently is, it's very bad but on medication, in contact with my doctor and im doing everything I can to keep it from getting any worse. My first phone call to the counselling place is in about 2 weeks time.

The problem I have now is my light at the end of the tunnel should we say. The thing iv'e been dying to get working on but I have all these other priorities first is to make my office. It may sound strange but to me it was a really big thing. Almost like if you were given your very own tree house. I was going to repaint it, carpet, nice wide desk, large display case, plants, air con the whole works. My intention for the room was for it to be a really comfortable stress free environment to enable me to work from home if my job entailed it. But also so I could work on coding my apps, games, tools as well as tinkering with my Arduinos, raspberry PI's etc. It would also mean I could move all the networking gear that I would soon need from the lounge to the office. Then when Im not working it would be a great room to play games and stream in, something I really want to do but all my energy right now is being spent on chores.

The other day however my mum had ago at me saying you have more computer stuff then other people do. Other people don't have 2 rooms. The large room (My to be office) will be your bedroom and office. The small room will be a guest bedroom for if I want someone to stay over or if your sister visits.

This has literally flipped everything I was working towards upside down and has so many consequences for me I get stressed out thinking about it. I keep saying to my self am I being fussy or privileged etc. But to me I was promised this over a year ago, on the condition that I could only have both IF my sister was to move out (which she did) and I would have to return the small room if she wanted to move back in (Which she doesn't). So this means and my mum is adamant that I have to have a single bed and drawers in the room so I can sleep and store my cloths. Though it's the biggest room I dabble in lots of fields of computer science. I have servers that not only run a few of my cheap friends Minecraft servers, but also my own socket servers ive written that run on them. I dabble in networking making sure my network is secure as possible as well as segregating different parts of the network on VLAN's, setting up the DMZ for my servers and more. I work with electronics so using breadboards, IC chips and sensors etc. So I also use Raspberry PI's and Arduous, the last thing I made was an IOT home environment monitor which records the rooms (Temperature, humidity, CO2, Hazardous gasses, light level, motion) with an SD card to store data if the network is down, internet access so the data can be stored securely in the cloud for the user to see and the user can be notified of an issue like a fire. Also has a TRI-colour LED for error codes and a buzzer to act as an alarm in case of high gasses or smoke. 3D printer to print out needed parts for my electronic products and a soldering iron to fix it together.

This isn't just a hobby I truly use these skills in order to make new and useful things. I write the code for it. I print the parts for it and I have the network to test it. I want to make this sort of thing my job I know what I have is a lot. Im not just a programmer so having access to this stuff for me is vital for where I want to go career wise.

Now because of the Bed and Drawers being added it will make the room incredible claustrophobic. I had this in my studio flat at uni and it was just depressing and it was like I couldn't get away from work since I would also have my downtime and be sleeping in the same room. So im going to have to move things. Firstly I bought the slimmest console table I could find. I assembled it and put it behind this cabinet unit in the living room, the cabinet sticks out 28cm now from where it was. This gives me the table behind the cabinet to setup the network. (Router, Access Point, UPS, Bitdefender, PI) I don't use an all in one hub as I find theirs a lot of settings I need to change which just arnt possible on default ISP routers and dont feature IFTTT yet. Mum was not happy that I had bought this table, built it and put it behind the cabinet. I didn't tell her because the whole reason I had to do it is because I can no longer have it in the office because I have to fit a bed and drawers in their now. She doesn't want it in her room so where else can it go? It will also mean no AC. This will mean my servers will get hotter and  will make more noise from the fans trying to keep it cool. This might mean if my room gets to hot I have to open the door and the whole house will here the roaring of server fans. I host a few webservers and databases for friends. However because they store information like user's names and contact info I have to take extra steps to physically protect the servers. I was going to have a smart lock on the inside of the door so it cannot be seen on the outside. So that the room can be locked in the event I am not home but a friend of my mum or sister is. I know from when me sister asked for a lock on her bedroom door before it was a no. Im sure a lock on the office would be fine but now im sleeping in their she wont be happy now. I may have to say to my friends to find other hosts but I really don't want to as I get access to benefits that they offer (1 friend is in the US and can send me tech before it's in the UK like Google AIY v2. Other friend can buy me stuff online with his card and address when their's something limited edition that is 1 per household/customer) Not to mention the fact it would be good on my CV the fact that I host websites on my home network that get thousands of hits a day. Then if I need to plug something directly into the router for whatever reason I would have to bring it downstairs and work on it in the lounge.

Iv'e tried to explain to her that I cant simply add a bed or drawers without their being knock on affects.  I could understand if my sister wanted to move back in. I could understand if she wanted to rent the room out. But she doesn't she just wants it to be spare for if my sister visits for a week or if she wants a guest over. In which I said in those events I would sleep on my office floor in a sleeping bag. To anyone non techy I know this may all sound petty but this is my career! I don't want to be working for a company all my life, I have a company registered id like to make it into something one day. I want to be able to host my friends web servers for them something I couldn't afford to do when I wanted to practise server side scripting, I want to work on electronic projects like my disability aid, I want to be able to have all the tech I deal with in one room, so I can simply turn the light off and lock the door and unwind after working all day.

The most upsetting part is that my mum said I could have the 2 rooms, I think she may have even been the one to suggest it. I asked before I moved all the way home and she said it was OK, I agreed verbally to the amount of rent I paid thinking it would be for 2 rooms. No one is using the small room, which all I want it for is the bed to sleep and some of the drawers for my cloths, I dont want to paint it or have anything of mine except for maybe an alarm clock.

It was also going to be a nice place for me to finish my dissertation, that's all I need now for my degree, all my other modules have been finished and im predicted a 1st.

FINAL THOUGHTS -

I know my mum loves me she has been a great mum I cant fault her.

I know that living with me when im this low and so unproductive is causing her stress and anger. Every day I have the energy to do a task it's literally in order of what will affect her the most in a good way.   
 \- E.g. fixing fridge &gt; seeing a friend

I know most people don't have two rooms. However everyone I know that works in a few different fields in computer science DOES have two rooms, or a space dedicated for the hardware.

\- Uni Friend 1 (C) = Had computer setup in living room, brother joined the navy, computer is now in brothers old room

\- School Friend 1 (N) = Moved out into his own house, uses 2 rooms.

\- Uni Friend 2 (A) = Lives with her boyfriend has bedroom and uses some of the living room.

\- Online Friend 1 (K) = Has a room for office at home for tech and has a bedroom.

\- Online Friend 2 (V) = Has a room for office at home for tech and has a bedroom.

I asked my mum if I could setup my computer in the lounge where the decorative coffee table is. She said no I don't want your stuff in the living room. Yet theirs a wooden cabinet filled with her own documents and stuff and a 3 meter by 1.5 meter rabbit cage which that alone is much larger than the space I would need for my computer. So mum has her own room, she got rabbits and made a massive cage for them in the lounge, whole cabinet in the lounge yet she wont let me have anything their and I cant have the room I was promised and If anything wont fit in the room im to bin it...

This whole thing is horrible, Im trying my absolute best to get better, then to jump back on with uni work to see if I can get my degree before the deadline. I understand why my mum would be stressed and upset with me. Im trying to get better as soon as I can. But her telling me off for being depressed is slowing it down. Then with the room I know a lot of people dont have 2, but im doing advanced stuff in computer science and I need the equipment which takes up space. Other friends have spare rooms, a dining room a garage they can use. Im making the best I can out of the situation. If she didn't want me having 2 rooms, then she could have said no the first time I asked and not promised that I could. Because then I could of had the option to move in with friends at university before all my stuff was driven to the other end of the country.

QUESTIONS

What are your thoughts after reading this?  I can understand if you think im in the wrong.

Moving out, should I? Knowing that I will be away from the doc that knows me and living by myself while depressed and have all the stress of moving.

What would you do if you were in my shoes?

What advice would you give me?",08Feb2020,1
257,"Greetings and thank you for reading!  


TL;DR: Basically the title.  


So my cousin who is male and will be 15 years old in a few months, has been sleeping with his grandmother for atleast about two years or more now, as far as I know.  


As far as I know, they are not sleeping with eachother as in having sex.  


He just sleeps with her in her bed every saturday.  


Well he is getting a bit old for that I think. He just started to grow a little moustache, a little beard and is getting more and more interested in sexuality by the day.   


We just started hanging out a bit and I have noticed he is interested in more mature women. Once he told me that a passerby women looking fairly above fifty and not even close to being sexy - she was rather ugly really, hot. 

???

I begin to realise that this slumberpartys are somehow having an effect on him.  


He is going to middle school / high school - whatever you call it in September.  


Well I have been teasing him about it to see if he will do something about it, like asking him if he is still going to sleep with her while in middle-high school and or in the university-faculty-college.  


I know he likes and is interested in his female friend of about same age, so I sometimes teased him and asked if they are going to sleep together in grandma's bed to see if he figures it out that this is wierd/wrong. Sick in my opinion.  
I feel that this is very unappropriate.

He does seem a tendency to have a submissive character. He usually never rebels or opposes with his parents and grandparents. From what I've seen and heard and felt, I could mention is that he does look up to me tho'.   


The grandma will probably not change and I do not have any contact with her due to her being one of the most toxic and evil and manipulative females I had ever encountered.  


What would you advise me? And what would you advise him if you could talk to him?  


I would like to show him this post, whilst I feel that he would be mad if I do.  


P.S: How does this not smell somewhat like a Michael Jackson case?",08Feb2020,1

261,"i'm sorry if this has been asked before!

so recently i had participated in an academic team, in which we compete against other high schools in the area for science, math, literature, etc.

 we just had the awards ceremony, and i had won a lot of medals. in fact only one other person on my team had gotten one medal. i really don't mean to brag here because i'm still in shock over it, and i really think that my teammates deserved many of the medals instead? 

so for us to get these medals we needed to score well on tests that we were given which was mainly multiple choice. i actually mainly used my gut and educated guesses along with vague prior knowledge instead of actually formally sitting down and studying. i did study, but barely. and i'm really guilty about that, because i feel like some of my teammates actually studied really hard only to get nothing. 

i just don't know how to deal with this because while i'm extremely grateful, being completely honest it feels wrong to me? and everyone is congratulating me but i worry that they're secretly holding it against me. has anyone ever experienced something similar?

268,"i’ve been invited to go to a deb as a guest for my friends at school. 

i live in australia and it’s a little different to other debutante balls. 

our high school doesn’t host it, it’s all ran privately through a large group of friends. anyway, i’m apparently going which means, i have to buy a dress. my only problem is, i really don’t want to pay that much for a dress i’ll only wear once. 

i don’t know if it has to be floor length. i know it DEFINITELY shouldn’t be white but i otherwise have no idea what else to go with. 

i also will probably go to the after party so then would the dress i buy for this deb be something i can party in? i’m not gonna be dancing like an animal but i’d like to be able to move around a little and be comfortable. 

i tried on two dresses today, one burgundy which shoes a bit of cleavage (not too hard with my cup size) and had a medium sized slit in it. i thought it was too long for my liking, but it didn’t reach the ground. maybe past my calf? i tried on a shorter (above knee) blue dress which showed WAY too much cleavage and just didn’t look nice on my body type. it would suit someone skinny and not as curvy as me.

I get compliments on my personality all the time IRL so that's not the issue either. 

The last thing I can think of to try is going through a series of 3 revision jaw surgeries over the next 2 years. I had jaw surgery for a bite misalignment when I was younger but the outcome wasn't perfect. I get rated 5-6/10 on Photofeeler now. I could definitely become better looking if I went through all that and the outcome was good, but there are enormous risks.

I read one post by an Indian guy on the dating subreddit who said he gets told he is handsome regularly and compared to Bollywood actors, but he still also can't get any matches/likes online. I am concerned that if that is the case, I might go through all that surgery/torture and then continue to get rejected solely due to my race. I mean, I can't become better looking than a Bollywood star.

I have been told by numerous women on Reddit that they will only swipe right on white/black/hispanic men. My sister only dates white men. One of my best female friends is Chinese and only dates white men. So from what I can see this is pretty common.

What do you think? How much of an automatic left-swipe is being Indian to most women? How good looking do you think you'd have to be as an Indian guy to not immediately be left-swiped by most women?

I will be reaching an underwear model physique in the next 6 months at this rate, but so far it's made no difference. After that I have absolutely no more ideas on things I can improve except the surgery, so I need to start making a decision on what I'm going to do next.

275,"I am in China in the middle of all this coronavirus situation and I have a Foster dog called Paco. Because I have Paco I was not planing on traveling for Chinese new year, that are our vacations, so a co-worker and a new ""friend"" asked me if I could take care of their pets. 

Both asked me to care for them for 3 weeks, but actually the ""friend"" from Canada told me the actual dates and turns out it was four weeks,  (like 3 weeks and 5 days, so actually 4) which make me angry because her pet is a puppy and she told me she was house trained which later discovered she was not, and also didn't even bring enough food for the puppy. 

The co-worker has two cats but they are not staying with me, they are at her house and they have some automatic feeders so I just go there every three days to make sure they are OK and refill the food. 

Then this coronavirus thing happened and both decided to take more time to come back, both with no actual date to come back and they just say ""sorry"" but expect me to take care of their pets until God knows when. 

Now, Paco, my fostered, is a well trained calm dog so I actually have aa peaceful calm time with him. The puppy... is a puppy, and I have my own thing and can't just keep going after her and cleaning all day long! that's why I got and adult dog to foster, I don't have time for a puppy!!!! 

The cats are OK, it only takes me 20 minutes to go over there and do what I need to, but is still a bother to have to do it for an undefined amount of time... 

Now, here is the thing. When they asked me to pet sit I was OK with that, it was ONLY going to be 3 weeks, and my co-worker pet sit for me Paco before (even though I gave her aaaaall the food and things needed and came back exactly when I said I would) and the ""friend"" told me hey, I will pay you, which I just said, nah, you just pet sit Paco another time.  

The biggest issue is with the puppy, she told me it was house trained, so I thought,  is fine, I just take her out with Paco, but nooooo, she never goes outside, we go for walks and after 5 minutes of us coming back she pees in the house, which I have to clean. Now, I have back problems huge horrible joint problems and I can't be cleaning so often. I even have someone to help me clean every week because of that. When is only me and Paco the house doesn't really get dirty, just the normal dust, but this puppy is too active and likes to make a mess quite often. 

Now I saw the ""friend"" posting on Facebook that she is not coming back until Canada's government says there is no risk of coronavirus, which can take freaking months!!! and of course she hasn't told me anything about it personally nor make other plans for her puppy. which makes me very angry, first the 4 weeks love, then the house trained lie and now this. 

She is a person I met just now and I really like her as a person, she us cheerful and nice, but I feel like being taken advantage now. She didn't even left me enough food so I need to go get it for her puppy, which is kind of difficult because the supermarkets close to me don't really have lots of pet food... She offered (like weeks before) to bring me some candy from home and I asked to bring me some medicine that of course I will pay her (that don't even know if she got them) so now I kind of feel guilty to say something about the puppy. She is not bad, just a lot of work and I can not keep doing it for another undefined amount of time. 

That's why I don't have pets, I foster because if I want to travel, I can not do so freely because I have a little animal that depends on me at home. And they are traveling a lot, which, how can you not be aware from the beginning!!!! 

So I don't know what to do, is not like I can urge them to come back, nor I will throw the puppy away,  and granted, is not like they are preventing me from travel but come on, if there is the need for me to go somewhere I can ask some friend to loom after Paco for some days, but two dogs and two cats??!!!!  that's just not right.

278,"I’ve never really used reddit that much, but I feel like I have nobody else to talk to so here it goes. I’m currently in my last year of high school at 17 years old and I feel like I don’t have any options left in life. I’ve been dealing with depression and ADHD since around the 6-7th grade (official diagnosis made and medication prescribed in 9th). Throughout that time period I would ask my parents if I could see a doctor or get a therapist, and while they always agreed to find somebody for me to talk to, I never ended up with one. I tried to accept my issues and just push through them, but even after receiving treatment I still definitely wasn’t “okay”. Throughout high school I gradually got worse and worse but wouldn’t admit it to myself (until now), and instead just try to keep doing homework, keep studying for tests, etc. (Both my parents have doctoral level degrees so I’ve grown up being constantly pushed to achieve the highest possible grades, take all honors and AP classes, you know the deal). It wasn’t until junior year when shit really hit the fan and I was introduced into the not so wonderful world of alcohol. I quickly learned how alcohol is so addictive because after feeling everything melt away once I couldn’t stop. For a while I was drinking pretty much every night, after school, before bed, whenever I could basically. At this point I had stopped taking my medications because they had stopped working properly so I was beginning to experience delusional thoughts again. I slowly began to convince myself that the few friends that I had would be better off without me, that nobody loved me, all of the things that had been preventing me from committing suicide. Finally, I got to the point where my suicidal thoughts were outweighing my sane ones, and I decided that I was going to kill myself. I told my parents that I was going on a walk one night (typical behavior for me), and took myself down to a nearby bridge over some 150ish foot ravine. I was there for about 10 minutes when my best friend randomly drove by me with one of my less known friends (she was really good friends with him) and he obviously stopped the car and came and tried to talk me out of jumping, but when I wouldn’t let him get near me he called the police. At this point I had kind of given up jumping so I sat down with my back against the bridge wall (there were 4 cop cars and I didn’t want to get tackled or taken in), and when they talked to me and tried to take me in I weaseled my way out of it (most patients that are released from a mental holding are up to 100x more likely to kill themselves within the first month out, which my suicidal father can attest to). After I convinced the cops that I didn’t need to be taken in (they escorted me back to my house a couple blocks away), I told my parents what happened. Still don’t have a therapist though. After this incident I went to the good doctor and got some fancy new medications that made me feel nothing at all which is apparently better than feeling shitty (or so I’m told), and I did get slightly better. Throughout summer I made an effort to socialize and stay active, do the things that I like, basically anything that could help, and I did get better. Once school began this year I was extremely stressed for a while, college apps, AP classes, you know the deal, but I was always looking towards the point where all of my applications were in and I could relax. I’m SUPPOSED to be at this point now since I’ve submitted all of my college applications and have already been accepted to a couple with scholarships, but my life continues to be one big clusterfuck. 

Now that I’ve got over the problems that have and do directly affect me, I can begin to explain everything else. Earlier in life I attended a nice private school and came home to a happy family that was fairly well off, and I was genuinely happy. Everything was going great until my father decided to take a little solo hike out in the middle of nowhere. After 8 hours pat the time he was supposed to be home, without any calls or texts, me and my brother were both in my mother’s bed worried as hell (I was somewhere in early grade school, my brother might have been in kindergarten or first grade). My mom finally got a call, and the next morning we went to go to the hospital to see my father. He had fallen down a ravine by himself (40 feet), and landed on his back and head. Collapsed lung, 3 fractured ribs, concussion, shattered pelvis, broken elbow, broken leg. He had been trying to get out for 5 hours before he laid down to die after making a goodbye video to us (very emotional and depressing), and at the time he had but didn’t know he had addison’s disease, meaning that his body wasn’t producing adrenaline. He says he fell asleep at the bottom and woke up at the top, but that’s besides the point; he lived and we were all happy. Except we weren’t. My father is easily more depressed than I am, and has been suicidal every day since he was 9. Although he has repeatedly said he didn’t try to commit suicide, which wouldn’t make any sense if he did because he did make it out of the ravine and hike back down two miles to his car to drive around and get cell service to call us and 911, my mother still thinks that he did try to kill himself. My mother broke after this, and she hasn’t been the same since. What was supposed to be a one month break from work turned into an apparent lifetime break, and she now sits upstairs reading all day every day. My father is the sole breadwinner of the house now, something that was hard while he paid for both my brother and me to go to a private elementary and middle school, and now my brothers private high school (I went to public high school to lessen the burden). We are easily not sustaining enough money to keep living currently, and no matter how many times my dad has tried to get my mother to return to work, she won’t. My dad is working constantly trying to bring in enough money to support 4 people, pay for my brothers school, put money into college savings for me, and make sure my mother is happy, but it’s not working, and soon we will probably have to sell our house. Throughout all of this my mom still doesn’t do anything, not even cleaning, and because of this the house often gets disgusting (I’ve got 4 AP classes and my brother is in his first year of high school and participating in various sports). Every time I try to clean or sort or make the house less fucked up I get yelled at for “doing it wrong”, and she says that she will “get to it”. 

At this point I am so relieved to be close to graduating and getting the hell out of here, but I don’t think that I can. I can’t leave my brother alone in this mess, and both my mom and my dad are suffering for different reasons. Most nights I end up crying myself to sleep while asking god (not religious just a way to vent my anger) why I can’t be happy, and then I have to wake up and help friends with school work and work through my own workloads. I want to kill myself so bad, but I know that I can’t and that I won’t because of what it would do to my family, so I am in a constant state of misery. I’ve stopped eating much and typically have one or two meals every two days. I can feel my depression getting worse but I really don’t give a shit at this point, I just don’t know what Im supposed to do. I don’t know how Im supposed to go to college and leave my brother here alone, or how I’m supposed to not go to college and throw my future away. I don’t know how I’ve become a middleman between my parents and have ended up consoling both of them on numerous occasions for countless reasons, and I definitely don’t know how I’m expected to keep living. I feel disconnected from all of my friends at this point, and although I haven’t touched alcohol since junior year, it’s looking mighty tempting right now. I know that everybody will probably say “don’t drink” and all of that stuff but what’s the point in not drinking if I don’t care where I go or what I do? I’ve lost all sense of myself and of who I used to be, and the endless, repeating days of getting home from school and grinding out school work till I go to sleep is finally getting to me. I just want to be happy and to be able to play video games and relax and hang out with friends and have fun and love life like I used to, but after almost 8 years of searching, I still haven’t found a solution. I just want to be happy.",08Feb2020,1
279,"About three years back I had a crush on this girl
I couldn't get her out of my mind. At the time we were in separate schools and since we were mostly in contact through social media I really wanted to find a way to approach her. Many times I would briefly see her school parties (we were both invited through mutual friends) nothing much happened we built a friendly relationship with each other. We texted almost every day and through seeing her at the parties I slowly started developing feelings. About a year later I was seeing that the situation wasn't going anywhere unless I made a ""good"" move
I was really liked by almost all of her friends and by high school I managed to end up in the same school as her. Fast forward a few months later we started being very close one day she came over to my house and we made out and stuff. *she was telling all her friends that she didn't see me in that way* but it happened either way.(there were many instances where she showed attraction and even her friends noticed, she just wouldn't admit it for some reason) 
Now I won't go into any more details but there were some complications and we started spending less time together. I revealed my feelings but nothing good came out of it.
Now whevener I see her I'm stiff and my confidence around her is very low. Now she constantly makes out with other guys and It breaks my heart  that I can't achieve one of the thing I wanted the most. Every time I try to move on she comes back into my life and I enter the same loop over and over again. Whenever I see her as much as I want to deny the feelings they keep coming back. I feel worthless. I just can't move on. All I would want is for her to evaluate me for once. I've tried being there for her and give her everything that I could offer. I don't know what I'm supposed to do or how.",08Feb2020,1

So there would always be at nights out with our group but on on nights out we don’t usually talk and just go and do our own thing, on this night out I didn’t get into the bar at first and I texted her saying I didn’t get in, her response was “you haven’t  spoken to me all night” keep in mind over tried on other nights to speak with her but she always gave me nothing, I got into the bar and when I went to talk to her she told me to “get fucked” I saw her a week a later and she was still mad so I just let her cool down. I saw her again today and went to speak to her and she is still mad and I don’t understand why, why is she doing this I don’t understand.",08Feb2020,1

they are also good at checking up on people and asking and giving help when needed but again even when i’m clearly in a bad mood they just laugh it off like i’m playing a bit or something... i usually love to joke around so when i’m upset my whole demeanor changes, but they refuse to aw knowledge it. what can i do for someone to hear me?",08Feb2020,1

People keep telling me “You just have to find the right liquor! Try this it’s sweet! Try this it’s smooth! Try this it’s got wonderful fruity notes!” It doesn’t matter what, it all tastes bad. The only time I’ve been able to drink without feeling like I drank poison is when I drank a vanilla milkshake with what I suspect was less than half a shot of vodka in it.

286,Long story short. Was walking my three dogs (2 male Rottweilers and 1 Male GSD) off the lead through the park a few nights ago. Saw a pitbull in the distance so I tossed a ball for it. Do this regularly and they either ignore it or play for a bit. This one ran at me and started biting my leg pretty hard. I kicked it a bunch and stomped on it as it was clear it was going to continue coming at me. My dogs saw and my rotties came over and ripped it apart. My GSD didn’t attack. I tried to stop them but They’re around 50 kilos and very strong so it took a while to get them under control. The pitbull was clearly dead so I didn’t bother trying to help it. It’s head and throat were in pieces along with it’s belly so it was a lost cause. My dogs never usually aggressive but they are protective. They’ve never bitten anyone or any other dog before. They’re all snipped and well trained. I managed to find the owner of the dog after a few minutes and I explained what happened and he didn’t seem upset more annoyed than anything. Pit bulls are illegal in my country and it’s pretty clear the guy knew that. He wasn’t a very nice guy and i think he was drunk. I called the police and they came and spoke to us both. I did my best to explain that my dogs were being protective but it didn’t help that they were covered in blood and fur and on edge. I was allowed to take them home but they told me I’m not allowed to take them out again currently and someone may come round to take them but I’ll be notified beforehand if that happens. Is there anything I can do to help the situation? Haven’t ever been in this situation before.,08Feb2020,1
287,"To make a long and even embarrassing story short, I eat my hair. I have been for almost 10 years. I started around the age of 9. Every so often I will get a tiny bald spot and change the area where I pluck. My hair has always had weird short hairs all over because of this. I’ll have a little bundle of 3 inch long hairs behind my ear because I started picking there. The worst area is the right side of the crown on my head. I am very self conscious of that area. I believe it is noticeably thinner than the rest of my hair, but I have never gotten a comment. I am very conscious of how I do pluck it, trying to pay attention to hairs that are shorter and not a long one. I believe I have slowed down since I was younger but I still can’t stop. I’ve been trying since I realized it WAS an eating disorder. It has gotten so bad again now that I started college. When I get anxious that’s when I really want to start. It’s like my hand is magnetized to my scalp. I sometimes will just sit there on my phone plucking and biting for an hour til I realize what I’m doing. I get so frustrated with myself because I literally have muscle memory from how I search through my hair. My fingers will literally go into position anytime I raise my hand to my hair. I’ll be trying to fix my hair and my hands get into a pinching position with my thumb, pointer, and middle finger. As a result, my hands get cramps everyday. This one is kinda humiliating, but I will have little hairs stuck in my teeth, and will have a bunch in the sink after I brush my teeth. My enamel on my front teeth are worn bad (and that doesn’t help with me grinding my teeth in my sleep). Since my anxiety is worse than ever, I find myself starting to pluck in public. I have never done this because, why would I. But it’s unintentional. My mom is planning on setting me up for an appointment with a doctor to see if I can get help for my anxiety. I’ve been wondering if it’s a smart thing to tell the doctor about this situation. I want to tell because first of all it drives me literally insane every single day, and I know there are health issues linked to eating your hair. Like literally getting hair balls lodged into you digestive tract. This requires surgical removal. This worries me bc I’ve always had problems w digestion and it makes my question if this is the reason. But what I’m really worried about is being taken to a psych ward or an eating disorder ward. I really do not like people worrying about me, and not to mention I don’t want friends and family to find out I’ve been eating my hair for half my life. I don’t like the idea of them pitying me or thinking there’s something wrong with me. But anyways, that was not short lmao, but thanks if you have read. Any advice from someone with an eating disorder them self??? Have a nice night y’all.",08Feb2020,1

290,"I'm 23, my last relationship was 4 years ago. Looking back now I realize every single relationship I've been in has been because they approached me. So I never really got past the approach because it never really happened that way. Mix that with some unfortunate events which I never tell anyone in person about, but essentially...I was raped by an ex and then publicly humiliated in high school because she said I raped her, almost everyone but my friends took her side. It was a very rough time, I received many death threats which the memory still affects me to this day. I'm embarrassed even talking about it because I feel like everyone will just see me as a sympathy hungering liar, but I feel confident enough to open up now anonymously after those years.

When thinking about asking someone out or complimenting them even when they seem interested I freeze up everytime. I believe this is now because of my past experience I feel like the world is just going to see me as a creep if I try to initiate conversation or compliment someone because that's what people thought of me as.

So I gotta build up confidence and I need to get past these demons and walls of self doubt I've built around myself. Any advice or direction for me to get back out there and enjoy the relationship life again?",08Feb2020,1
291,"2 wks ago I made a pedi appt online at my nail place. Originally made the appt for 5:15pm yesterday (Thurs). Then I realized that wouldn't work, so I canceled and rescheduled for 10am Saturday (tomorrow) morning. I got text confirmation the first appt was canceled &amp; of the new appt time. I did not save the texts. Realized tonight I didn't get a reminder text for my appt tomorrow, so I logged in to confirm the appointment.  

It shows the appt for 5:15pm yesterday did not cancel in their system, so it looks as if I no showed, and my appointment for tomorrow morning has been canceled (from their side). I had one missed call yesterday at 5:01pm but no voicemail.  I just looked up the number &amp; it was the nail place - but again, they didn't leave a message.  So now it's 11:30pm the night before and I have no appointment in the morning. I don't get why, if they saw two appts 2 days apart for the exact same service with the exact same tech from the exact same customer, why not ask me (leave a freakin voicemail, I was at work ffs) which appointment I meant to keep, because obviously I'm not getting a deluxe pedicure twice 2 days apart.  I looked for openings tomorrow and they're almost booked solid. A couple of openings in the late afternoon, which I don't want - I wanted the 10am time for a reason, I've already got plans the rest of the day.  Something similar to this has happened once before, I made an appt then turned around and rescheduled it for earlier.  It didn't cancel on their end but they caught it while I was there in the salon and canceled it - even tho I'd gotten a cancelation text, they didn't see it as canceled on their side.  Also, I want to mention their cancelation policy is 24 hrs notice.  Less than 24 hrs and no shows are charged the full amount + 20% gratuity for the tech.  I checked my account and haven't been charged (yet?)

So do I show up tomorrow morning at the time my appt was supposed to be and play dumb, or show up at 10am and ask why they canceled my appt without notifying me.  I thought about trying to call before they open to ask what's going on but idk if they answer before opening tbh.  I'm not looking to act crazy or make a scene, this is a nice place, I really like it, and want to keep going there if possible.  But this is some bs right now and I'm a little hot at the moment.  If it comes down to it and they do try to charge me for a no show appointment, I should be able to dispute it with my bank, right?",08Feb2020,1

296," 

Okay, this might sound dumb but hear me out. I've had this crush for a female friend for 2 years and a half now, and I've given up into the idea that we could be something else, she just doesn't see me as something else, she was clear enough 2.5 years ago when we first met when I asked her out and she said no, that she only saw me as a friend.

Okay, I'm okay with that. Fast forward we've been both very supportive of each other. She had been dating a guy for 2 years (they started dating like 5 months after she turned me down) and broke up recently cus the d\*ckhead cheated on her. We were texting and she said that she's never received a love letter from anyone, and I thought that I could give her a love-ish letter on Valentine's day.

I want to be very clear that I'm not trying to flirt in any way, she really seemed down when she told me that none of her previous boyfriends ever made an effort to make something special to her. This conversation started because I was telling her about a time 6 years ago in which I gave an ex-girlfriend flowers and sang to her while she cried her eyes out because she was so touched.

I'd like to give her something this valentine, I mean we already have a reservation in some restaurant, but I do not know if giving her a rose and a letter telling how much I appreciate her being in my life and that she has taught me many things, telling her how grateful I am for her support, for being there for me, telling her how I really think she's so smart, pretty, funny and so on, but without being romantic, (without mentioning that I still have a crush on her) would be too much.

Would giving a rose and a letter to someone that, eventhough I have a crush on, I do not want to flirt with? I want her to feel happy during Valentine's, I really believe she deserves a letter and something special during this day, but I do not want her to misintepret things either, I do not want to make her feel uncomfortable, but she really deserves something special.

TL;DR: Should I give a letter and a flower to my crush, eventhough my goal isn't something romantic, rather than making her feel special? I do not want to annoy her or embarrass her or anything...",08Feb2020,1

299,"Well for starters I have this friend, who I would probably consider to be my best friend, and our relationship has always been a little weird. (We’re both female btw) Like we’re always a little awkward with each other and I just chalked it up to that fact the we are both introverts although I do try to be the outgoing one when I’m with her so that it’ll be less weird. I know that she trusts me and considers me a friend since she says that she trusts me, she always says I’m her best friend, she tells me about her problems, and she talks normal around me but if there’s someone else her voice get very quiet. Now I know that I don’t  actually know if that’s true since it’s just words and I can’t read her mind but I think it’s true, maybe my trust issues are making me second guess that it’s true. Anyways, we’ve been friends for awhile now and it has always been a little weird but this one time we got high and ended up downloading a bunch of truth or dare games. One of them happened to be sexual which we kind of just read for fun and laughed about but somewhere along the way she started, i think jokingly, trying to do them. Which you know is fine I guess, I mean we’re both young (she’s about two years older than me) and I don’t discriminate or anything so I’d be down for the experience but even high me was feeling hella awkward. So, I kinda just laughed it off, other things happened that night but it wasn’t really anything. Anyways, we hung out a few more time and everything was fine, I mean it was still awkward but it was fine (I wasn’t staying the night or anything though). Now it’s been awhile since that night, not too long maybe a couple of months, and I started staying the night and getting high the last few nights and do you know that feeling that you get when you know exactly what someone is getting at but you are both shy awkward beans? Yeah well basically we got high and then played some games and for some reason it would always come back to sexual things. It felt like we both wanted to give /something/ a try but neither of us wanted to initiate it. So after this continuously happening for two nights, on the third night we got high and played a game or two and then we were chilling on the bed playing never have I ever and a bunch of personal sexual questions kept coming from her so after a couple of rounds I started do such questions. Somehow, after a bunch of questions, it was really early in the morning like 1:00am or something and we were trying to find something to do and while we were doing this, we were playing with each others hand. I was starting to fall asleep but she was keeping up with the /hand play/ and if I started to not move my hand from me starting to fall asleep, she would be like are you ok or what do you wanna do. Long story short she was guiding my hand down to her crotch and just kinda pushing it more and more into herself. At this point I’m wide ass fucking awake other than I was still hella high. I kinda lifted my hand and she would try to subtilely turn my hand palm down and onto her crotch. I did try to lift my hand and turn it back around to kinda gauge her reaction and she would just turn my hand back around and put it back on her. Now honestly I’m fine with this, I’m amazed at the development but I wasn’t disgusted or anything. Now at this point I’m basically rubbing her crotch, now I’m not stupid and I understood what she was doing so I went with it and started rubbing without her guiding, she would run her hand up my arm and back down to my hand and kinda push my hand more but I knew what to do. Lmfao anyways she ended up pulling her pants down and I fingered her. It was the same awkwardness after and I was just trying to process what just happened so I got into a sleeping position on my side of the bed and that was pretty much it. Now the thing I need advice on is, I left I bit earlier than I normally do which she woke up when I was leaving so I told her what I was doing. Anyways, a couple hours later I texted her and basically said sorry for leaving so early and she left me on read so I was like, meh yeah I guess I probably wouldn’t reply to that too cause there’s just nothing really to say. So sometime the next day I got bored and decided to text her. This time all I said was hey and it’s about 2-3 days later and she never even opened it. I want to talk to her because she really is my best friend but I have no idea how to approach her. 

I honestly don’t know if I even want to talk about what happened with her since we’re both awkward weirdos but I do know that I don’t want to lose her as a friend. 

TLDR: My best friend had me finger her, which I did, and now she ghosted me! How do I get her to start talking to me again?",08Feb2020,1
301,"I'll finally admit it. I'm not okay.

I'm 18/M and all I do is drink and feel like shit 24/7. I've tried seeing a therapist and that really didn't work. I've tried exercising more and forcing myself to do stuff and that had no effect. I've tried socializing more and that didn't work either.

Most of my problems started after I broke up with my ex gf. I honestly think it was the worst decision I ever made. Her family and I never got along so I figured I'd let her go because I was older and things were only going to get more dramatic between her brother and I. Over the summer I told her how I felt and she told me that her new boyfriend was soooo much better than me and that he did more for her in the 1st 2 weeks of their relationship than I did in a year. I'm still crushed.

After I heard that I went crazy on self-improvement. I went to the gym all the time and I started investing my money but I still wasn't happy. I've spent the last year and a half in misery. I feel like I'm living in a perpetual headache. I'm extremely depressed. I didn't want to admit it but I seriously think I'm depressed. I drink heavily most weekends and its the only thing that gets me through the week.

I'm now super self-conscious about my height and looks. I'm afraid that I'll never meet another girl again because I'm a short guy (5'3-5''4). I've honestly contemplated suicide and I'm not proud of it. My dad works for a local college so I can get free tuition for a number of schools so that's really the only thing keeping me alive. I leave for uni in Aug. and I really hope I can meet someone there. I know MGTOW is a really big thing these days but I really do want to meet a girl. I don't want to spend my life alone and miserable because I'm short. I've posted on Reddit a few times and people flat out told me it'll be extremely difficult to meet women post high school due to my height and that I should settle for whoever gives me the time of day. Of course, this makes me feel worse.

Most nights I just drink and cry alot. I don't feel like I have a future worth living for. I know I should be glad that I don't have cancer or a missing limb but I can't shake this feeling of doom. Anyone have any advice? Am I really screwed? What is wrong with me?",08Feb2020,1

And one of those pics had her ID. Now he's blackmailing me to show more pics of her or else he'll tell everyone in my family( he got family members name through facebook) and that how i shared her pics with him. He's demanding more pics in return to keep quiet but i don't want to because my infatuation aside she's still my cousin who i love dearly. I want advice on a way out of all this. Please help me.

303,"So context:

Me, My boyfriend and his friend (we'll call him steve) were all hanging out a while ago and waiting for our other friends to show up to play some Dungeons and Dragons. My boyfriend had to go pick up one of his other friends so I was hanging out with Steve.

Me and Steve are like decent friends like we share the same interests and can talk about the drama that happens within the friend group and laugh. This night Steve was on a dating app he recently downloaded and me being a bisexual lady (who also enjoys trying to match make with people) decided to kind of watch and see what kind of girls were out there and how well they'd fit with Steve.

Eventually Steve was Swipping past a lot of women and for like no reason I could see, so I asked why. He kind of started talking about how they were 'liars' and 'tried to trick men into caring for their kids' or something around that line. I was slightly taken aback because that's obviously not the case (he showed me their photos and they had their kids with them) and he seemed like really angry.

Me of course trying to keep an open mind about people started making the case that they could be nice girls and they just happen to have kids and it's not like they were hiding that fact completely just didn't mark it on their profile somehow? He started going off that they were irresponsible and 'loose' for getting knocked up and were probably trying to baby trap their last boyfriend. This like actually made me a bit mad and said ""no birth control is 100% effective, shit happens and women like sex too."" and he was like ""well they should have been extra cautious then."" I stopped talking then because I was uncomfortable. and kind of forgot about this for awhile.

About a week later we are talking again and He bring up the dating app again and how he's still having trouble talking to women. (side note, steve is really bitter and cynical about all people saying that they just want to fuck you over ect.) So I ask him if he's being friendly and he says something along the lines of ""as friendly as I can be"" and then the conversation spirals to how women from 'X' town are all cheating, drug addicts and gold diggers. Again I excuse myself from that conversation because i'm not comfortable with that.

Eventually it kind of ate away at me and I was talking with my boyfriend and his sister (both good friends of steve) about how weird he is towards women and how it's kind of incel-like and pretty bitter if not sexist. Of course they both kind of just defended him and said he can be an okay guy and how he's just lonely and mentally ill.

I kind of feel like an asshole for questioning if this dude is sexist or if he's just bitter and my boyfriend's other friend said i was being a bit judgemental because i don't have the same experience with women as he does. So am I being an asshole or is this like actually kind of weird? Also any advice would be nice as well :&gt;

TL;DR: my boyfriend's friend said some stuff about a bunch of women being liars or cheaters or gold diggers and I feel like he is being sexist.",08Feb2020,1
304,"A little background: Used to have serious depression back in highschool. I remember I was so depressed I contemplated suicide. I felt lonely and like I had no body. My self esteem was low. I didn't shower at all, and did not take care of my grooming. It was bad. It was a dark place. But than I met a girl and found my best friend and they made life so much better. To this day they have no idea what type of horror they saved me from. Especially my best friend. After highschool I broke up with that chick and she hooked up with my with one of my other friends, and that hurt. It hurt a whole lot actually. However I got better because my best friend moved to NY with me and for the next year I spent with him and enjoying the finer things in life. After that though, I had to make some choices because, well I wasn't the smart guy in highschool. In fact I was below average. I was, well, a idiot. So college wasn't an option for me. So with not very options on what I wanted to do with my life, I joined the military. I knew that with hard work I could make a career out of that and I do plan to this day. So after enlisting and going on to boot I was separated from my friend and went off to boot. I did pretty well in boot and after that was done I went and took leave to visit my friend. That was great because I haven't seen him in so long. But that only last a week because I didn't have much leave built up so I left for my first duty station which happened to be on the other side of the untied states. Now, I fully understood the commitment I made the my service and to this country and wouldn't take it back for the world but man, it sure is lonely.

So here I am. Alone. I have no one here and I can feel myself being pulled back into that dark place. I let go of myself once again and it cab feel the depression coming back. And tho I am surrounded by people I can call family, I feel more alone than ever. I made multiple fake social media accounts just so I can stalk my ex and which her and the guy I once call a friend happy. She didn't get hurt. She lives her best life. And my friend is married now. He has his wife and his life to take care of. I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm just being a bitch about it, but this is how I feel. I cry at night and I barely live my barracks and go anywhere.

Does anyone know what I can do about this. I hate feeling like this, and I don't want to go back to that dark place. Not again. Not ever again. I don't want to become a 40 year old virgin with no body to love and be loved by. With no one to call friend. I don't want that. Help me.",08Feb2020,1
306,"I know by the title that it’s a no brainer. Of course I made the right decision and I feel deep down that I made the right decision.

But, it’s been so much drama. My family wants me to come back and reconcile with my dad who has been abusive to me and the whole family. For some reason, they all forgot about what he did to all of us but not me. It ate at me for years. Even though the hitting and the yellings have decreased, they sometimes creeped up. I also had to deal with all that trauma. I felt like my whole life I was in a cage and I needed to get away but I couldn’t, until now.

Now, here I am, in a different state living with my aunt and my aunt and grandma keep telling me to ask for forgiveness from him even though I haven’t done anything wrong. They’re afraid he may pass away due to the stress I’ve caused him. I had to get away. 

At university, my mental health deteriorated and it left me broken. I wasn’t the same person I was before. Suicidal thoughts were daily. During my last two weeks of school, the suicide thoughts were all the damn time. Every time I didn’t distract myself, those were the first thing that popped in my mind. I was so afraid I would kill myself. Because of that, I decided to take the semester off, knowing full well my family would be against it. In the end, they were against it. After a huge fight I left home because I was afraid of my dad coming home and hitting me. I came home the same night because my cousin convinced me and I was afraid for my mom. After that, I came to my aunt’s home.

Here, I’ve been slowly getting better. Eater better, exercising, seeking therapy from a psychiatrist and a psychologist. I’m also getting a job to get me out of the house. 

I’ve realized I’ve skipped a few things. A week ago, my dad texted me a few pretty hostile messages which basically said to cut him out and forget about him. I told I respect whatever he wants. Then, a few days after that, he texted me saying sorry and he apologized for being a terrible father but I’m not sure if he just said that or actually meant it.

Now, here I am. Getting constantly prodded at to go back home by my grandma while my aunt says I should stay here for a little bit but apologize to my dad even though I haven’t done anything. I did however, apologize for causing him stress. 

But this constant prodding is getting to me. I’m not sure if I am doing the right thing. Everyone keeps telling me to go back to college but right now, I’m not ready. I’m so scared to go back. Me and my psychologist have decided to focus more on the here and now (he did say to research what I want to do in college because I was there because my parents forced me to go and wanted me to become a doctor). Even though he said I did the right thing, did I? Did I mess up? 

I don’t expect anyone to read this. I post here a lot. A lot of it redundant but I’m just so lost right so if you do give advice, thank you.",08Feb2020,1

308,"I am sort of a ""health nut"" and I like to buy a lot of food supplements (which are really herbs, spices, etc), and even fruits, vegetables, berries, etc.

Now, if you do a google search, for a certain herb or spice and the words ""health benefits"", it will state that certain chemicals that scientists have discovered are suppose to benefit you in certain ways.  Either help with memory lost, cancer, etc.   I am not talking about vitamins but other chemicals that scientists supposedly found in the herb, spice or food.   For example, people originally took white willow bark for pain, then scientists discovered the chemical in it that was relieving pain  (this is how they invented aspirin).

I know that if you heat certain chemicals to too high a temperature it will break down the chemical, so you will not get the health benefits any longer.   My question and where I'm trying to get advice, is does anyone know if freezing breaks down chemicals so you wouldn't get the health benefits?",08Feb2020,1
309,"Title says it all, for the past 3 weeks or so I have been pulling at a little more hair than usual only when I shower. Each time I wash or pull a little I pull out maybe 3-5 hair strands that are small. My hair has get a little thin and dryer but that might just be in my head. I did look up some stuff in fear and it said that 4-8 strands per pull is still normal but not for me

It doesn’t pull out as much when my hair is dry, only when it’s wet and I have been showering a lot more which is probably drying my scalp out. 

I don’t know what to do. Stress and other stuff isn’t helping my situation. And I can’t tell if this is normal or not

310,"I'm a African American 25f who has only had one boyfriend when I was eighteen. We only lasted for few months because he was on a work exchange program for a few months. Since then, no luck. To preface, I live in the South and I have no idea if it has to do with my race, however I'm told that I'm pretty, have a great personality and am very warm. I used to have issues being emotionally vulnerable, but I worked on that and all overall my platonic relationships have significantly deepened. I'm social and go out a lot, but am rarely met with reciprocated interest.
Recent example: I chatted up a guy I had a class with a couple semesters ago who I frequently run into on campus. We share mutual interests because we're both art majors (him lit, me theatre) and I found our conversations always captivating. He's somewhat cute, but what drew me in was his personality. I used to go based off just looks, but learned that's a recipe for disaster. 

Anyway, I decided to give him my number and he texts me. We have a great conversation but then the next day when I text him he responds with shorts answers or doesn't answer at all. I read that as disinterest but I'm so confused because it was going so well. I feel like this is common theme for me. A person and I connect, we open up to each other slowly but once it starts to show any indication of serious, he bails. However, I did have luck while traveling in Europe this summer - I met a few guys who seemed genuinely interested - but due to the circumstances and time, they didn't pursue for long because we had to part ways. I think in Europe I had a lot more prospects in comparison to the U.S. because even though, yes, there are still racists in Europe, a lot more people seem to be open to interracial dating.


So I feel like I put myself out there a lot socially and emotionally, however no one rarely reciprocates interest. I don't want to turn 30 in five years and still not have a boyfriend. Relationships don't define me, but it's heart-crushing that I've gone this far in my life and there has been barely any blips of interest towards me. It really really hurts. I ask myself what is so wrong with me that no one wants to commit to? Life is so unfair. What can I do to improve my chances?",08Feb2020,1
312,"I've been to both cities several times and I love both. I'm 21, about to graduate, and am strongly considering applying for jobs out of state in one of these cities. 

Los Angeles is more relaxing than NY by far, and so much warmer, which is a huge plus to me. However, I don't like how sprawling the city is. Then again, if I pick a neighborhood I really like, I guess I won't have to be driving around too much all day...

New York is incredible. I love it there, the people and the food! Wow. I also am romanticizing it a bit but this is somewhere I need to live while I'm young. I feel the same way about LA though. Biggest drawback to NY to me is how insanely competitive the job market seems.

315,"I had a classmate with family issues who used to cope with drugs. He had an overdose and ended up in hospital for being wounded badly in a street fight. Ended in rehab. Since he was allowed phone calls three times a week he occasionally phoned me. He told me he had a crush on the therapist who was apparently drop-dead gorgeous, nice and most importantly, cared about him. Months ago he used to have feelings for me when I gave him advice (we're both guys, he's bisexual and had a gay crush on me) but I expected that to pass. It eventually did and he switched his attention to the therapist. I think he's like that because he never really received much love in his life. Okay, I don't see any harm in that. Let him crush on the smoking hot therapist, whatever, anyone but me. And I'm glad he had something to occupy himself with that wasn't hedonism.

Then one day he came to me telling me he wanted to give up and commit suicide. The addiction was too strong to break, his family issues still existed (he had no visits from his parents) and the peers he met there gave him death threats because they had an argument which turned them against him. He refused to tell me what that was about but I since know he had a temper he likely offended some people and from what he said, I infer he got into a minor fight (he was still in crutches, but who knows).

I sometimes get tired of giving him advice since he was awfully stubborn and more often than not wouldn't care about what I say. He sometimes used me for ranting about his feelings, I'm fine with that but if he had to tell me everything that was wrong with his life he should at least allow me to help him fix it, especially when I actually do know how not to fuck everything up. I care about him, I really do, and I feel bad for everything he had to go through. But I just need him to know that suicide isn't the only option and listening to others' suggestions would do him good.",08Feb2020,1
316,"Here is my situation. I have two roommates, me and one of them get along like best buds and the other one and I butt heads sometimes. I lived with these 2 roommates last year and the one who I don't get along with as well (lets call him Steve) did pull some shit that made me and the other roommate(lets call Ron) did not like. We were contemplating on whether or not we could live with the kid another year but we were already locked in so we had to do it. Steve was much better the first semester of this year and everything seemed good, it seemed like he changed and was less self-centered than before. However, when he came back from Christmas break its like things changed or something. Everything was all good at first, everyone getting along, until one day when he was throwing some things out before these cleaners came. He accidentally threw out a container of some workout stuff of mine that was pretty much full and wouldn't take responsibility for what he had done. He started saying the cleaners did it, which made no sense, and then proceeded to bring up shit from the past that he had given me and therefore didn't have to pay me back for it. I was kinda taken back when he said that cause he was acting like I had never done one thing or given one thing to him. He eventually paid me back but said that I could forget about him ever doing anything for me again because ""I didn't appreciate all that he has done for me."" This was the first pretty major argument we have had this school year but it gets worse. Flash forward a few weeks later and I think all is good, there is still some tension in the air but nothing major. The other night he was making some brownies and I was with him and watching and he said I could have some when he was done and that they are for the whole apartment. I went to sleep before they were finished by grabbed one the next day. He came in my room and asked if I had one and I said yes and he asked me how it was and I said good and he walked out and it seemed like a friendly conversation. 5 hours go by and all 3 of us are deciding on what to order for food and out of nowhere he says to me, ""you know what's fucked up, you ate one of my brownies and didn't even ask. I said are you kidding me? you literally told me I could have some when you were making them. To which he replies yeah but you still have to ask which I thought was kinda silly but whatever I just let the argument go. Not even a minute goes by and he says that im unappreciative for everything he has ever done for me and that I'm one of the most unappreciative people that he knows (which is just not true and I find this ironic coming from him) and I said dude are you kidding me, all this over a single brownie? I started saying he was acting like a baby and a toddler and he then backed out of the deal all 3 of us had for the food and started sulking. He then proceeded to say some more pretty messed up things like how a friendship is give and take and that I don't give him anything of use and eventually he walked away because he said we weren't getting anywhere with this argument even though he brought it up. Idk what to do guys, it seemed like he wanted to argue last night or something and today he has ignored me all day and honestly I'm considering moving out by next fall(college). Last year Steve would even say that he would wanna punch me and that he wants to slam me for no reason. We're all pretty muscular dudes so I'm not worried about Steve trying to attack me or something but it's just not something you say to your roommate, especially when I haven't even wronged him. Ron and I both think he's acting ridiculous but Ron doesn't really want to talk with me about Steve's behavior because he said it wasn't his argument or situation. Ron is a great friend and roommate but I honestly don't know if I can live with Steve for 2 more years of college.

324,"Kinda long. TD:LR at bottom.

My roommate is manipulative, narcissistic, completely and utterly spoiled and has never really been an 'adult'. She has never had any sort of bill in her name  (parents either give her the money for bills or she pays me) and she tries to find loopholes in everything. She's been late in paying rent constantly, argued with me about the prices of bills, makes everything my fault etc. If something doesn't benefit her, she will have nothing to do with it. The worst kind of person. She is very unhappy and lonely.

This is her senior year of college. Her boyfriend of two years kicked her out with no notice. She moved in with me, I realized she wasn't all she said she was, I was going to muscle through it. She made promises, they fell through. She said things, they were lies. 

Exactly 7 days ago I had a very traumatic experience happen and told her I was moving out and would be off the lease in 30 days. I paid for this entire month so there was time to find a roommate. Shit then hit the fan.

She could not believe that she had 'so little time' to find a roommate. The apartment complex management accepted my removal and 30 days is what they require. I told her I'd put some adds out to help out. She wanted help paying for March if there was no roommate yet. I told her that would not be happening as I'm out Feb 29. 

I am currently without a place to live as well because of the awful experience I had, I have had no time to find a real apartment. I am between my parents house and my boyfriends house who BOTH live in different cities which are different than the one I had been living in with her recently. 

Tomorrow I am completely removing all of my furniture and I told her (and management) that I'd be out by that date. I told her that the wifi and electricity are in my name so they will be canceled and it is up to her to get new accounts. It is also now up to her to either stay and get new accounts or break the lease and leave. Breaking the lease is almost $2000. I even offered to pay half of what my half would be for February. It's kinda confusing but I'd only owe a tiny part. So she is really kind of getting screwed.

She has asked that I leave the utilities on and she'll pay me back later. She has had an awful year, how dare I leave her with no notice and no one to fill my spot. But,  I don't trust her at all, she would never pay me back, so I said no. I will never be returning to that city (theres no need for me to) so I wouldn't be able to get what she owes me (she refuses to use online payment sources, must all be cash). 

**Here's what I need advice on**: I KNOW I am really causing a lot of distress with such short notice. I KNOW this is really screwing up her already bad year. I NEVER meant for any of this to happen and I really do feel really bad about all of it. I am coming across to her as a heartless bitch but only because if I do not talk to her in a firm, straight forward way, she tries to walk all over me. I have learned that.

**I want to write her a letter saying exactly that**. That I truly never meant for this chaos to happen, that the situation is awful and I really hope she finds a great job and has a happy life. Would that even be worth it? I am *so* not a mean person. I am TERRIBLY empathetic which is a curse. The event that happened (i was being stalked ok, he was watching me through my bedroom window and I caught him) is a totally REAL reason to leave an apartment before the lease is up.

Would writing a letter come across as a really bad thing? Worthless? I'm wasting my time? Or do you think she'd understand that I'm really sorry?

I will be blocking her Sunday because she has made my life hell. But I also made her life hell by taking off so fast. 

**TD:LR  -&gt;** Terribly, awful roommate is very very upset I'm moving out on extremely short notice. I'd like to write a letter saying I'm really sorry and I didn't mean to make this such an awful experience. Wasting my time or nah?",08Feb2020,1
325,"So my brother is 9 years old. He’s the youngest of us of three. When compared to the rest of the family, his behavior is far more theatric and energetic. He often puts regular phrases into, I guess, hip-hop melodies. He rarely acts serious. To add, he plays around often. I don’t know how to further describe his behavior, but I hope you can get what I’m trying to say. I assume this is all a normal part of childhood. However, the problem lies with the fact that my family is vexed by him so easily. It’s to the point which he can’t apparently express himself without annoying one person. My family is very obvious about it too. For example, if he sits a mere few feet from my sister, she will nearly yell at him, even hit him, in hopes he will move. He often never obeys, though. My mom would also try to resolve the conflict, though she also begins blaming my brother. With this outward hate towards him, he has become more open about his own hatred. (Though, it hasn’t reached the point which there is perpetual yelling and such).

I suspect he is lonely at most times, and he seems to thinking near suicidal thoughts. If my sister provokes him enough, his common response his quietly cursing her out, while telling her, or anyone near, how he thinks about killing himself (he has in the past began hurting himself if exposed to overwhelming hate). He also seems to be very isolated with himself, and appears to just wants to escape what he describes to be hell. Other things to mention his how our father has a short temper, so you can imagine how he reacts to my brother (he also blames him often for mere is mistakes, as he is quick to assume), my sister and I never really interact with him to play games and other things (though that’s how it is with the family), and this is how it has been for the majority of his childhood.

Unfortunately, I have only begun to realize how cruel we have been to him. It now I ask how we may start treating him well. I know the answer is obvious,  but applying these methods seem so awkward to do because any actual desire to play with each other, or anything fun or shows actual affection (hugging, saying I love you) is so unorthodox within the family. We all isolate ourselves from each other, and family activities are always awkward. There are more problems I would like to post about, but this is the main one I seek to resolve.",08Feb2020,1
326,"So started this new job this week, and I worked the closing shift and didn't get out of work till 12am. It is now almost 2am and I'm having a tough time falling asleep or feeling tired.

Well we finally got down to schedule our date and I figured it was time to inform my family that I had been talking to someone and was going to head up and meet them. Well I was reciprocated with extreme warnings and backlash telling me not to do this, I should meet someone that goes to the same college as me, I shouldn’t date online. I’ve already fact checked as much as I could on this woman, I’m sure she’s done the same with me. My family’s main concern is that she has “emotional baggage” she’s gone through some traumatic life experiences and She’s extremely open to talking about them. I’m just not sure how to handle my families criticism, I understand their concern but at the same time, I like talking to this girl and I could see us being together despite her “emotional baggage”.

330,"First, a bit of context: my husband and I are superintendents of a “luxury” apartment building. The building is still fairly new, only built 2 years ago, suites are modern and open-concept, rents are on the higher side and majority of the tenants are young to middle-aged professionals. We love living here and working here, we have great rapport with most of our tenants and complaints are minimal. 

We recently had a new tenant move in who was pretty high-maintenance from the first time we met her at the viewing. During her move-in inspection, she was displeased with the cleanliness of the suite. The suite itself was clean when the previous tenants moved out but this unit had sat empty for several months before she moved in so of course, dust had settled on some surfaces, the water in the toilets had turned brown and left some residue, etc. 

She asked us to clean the whole suite again, to which we explained we wouldn’t usually do that because the suite passed the move-out inspection from the previous tenants and that these were very minor things that were not due to a lack of responsibility on our part. She insisted that because she is paying such high rent, she shouldn’t have to lift a finger to clean anything when she moves in. We referred her to our superior at the building management company and suggested that she ask if he could arrange to get a cleaner in there for her because this is not part of our general duties. 

Our manager then contacted us the next day and basically ordered us to do the cleaning, saying that it IS our job to do this. I sent him a screenshot of our employment contract which showed it definitely was not, but that if we chose to do this extra work, we are allowed to bill for our time spent. He still insisted we do it and that it wouldn’t take long and essentially asked us for this favour. I still wanted to push back because honestly, I don’t like him very much to begin with but my husband told me to just let it go and just do this one small thing to keep the peace (he’s much nicer than I am). 

So I clean the suite earlier this week, not in its entirety like she wanted but took care of the dust, wiped and disinfected all the kitchen surfaces and cabinets/drawers (inside and out), some scuffs on the walls, scrubbed the toilets, etc. Today, she tells my husband that she was not happy with the job I did and pointed out as an example that I didn’t dust the top of the hot water tank and says “that was very passive aggressive of her.” 

Also, I accidentally parked in her spot yesterday because when I got home, the car on the one side of us parked too close over to my side so I just quickly pulled into her spot, thinking I was heading out again later anyway so no big deal. I ended up not having to go out later and forgot about the fact I was in the wrong spot. She tells my husband that she was very upset I did that and again, how passive-aggressive of me. My husband didn’t know what to say because he didn’t even know I parked there, let alone the reason, until I got home later today to explain to him. 

It’s true, I do not like this woman so far but I’m not trying to pull little stunts such as not dusting her hot water tank or parking in her spot to “passively aggressively” get back at her! I have better things to do with my life. 

Lastly, she says she doesn’t “really want to deal with us (my husband and I)” because she “has a lot on her plate and it’s too much” and “she’s an artist so her brain works differently” (these are real quotes according to my husband) so going forward, we should communicate solely through her daughter. 

Despite her daughter-communication request, I think it’s only proper to go and speak to her in person and try to sort things out. However, I don’t even know how to begin and how to remain professional. I don’t usually have a problem communicating in a professional manner (my other day job is paralegal) but this is just such a weird situation that I’ve never encountered and I just get so angry even thinking about her that I don’t know if I can keep my composure. 

I want to firmly tell her the suite was clean enough while not shooting myself in the foot by coming off as having lower standards. I also want to explain the parking situation but don’t want to seem like I’m asking for her forgiveness because I don’t care to have it. And as much as I’d love to never talk to her again, I just need to tell her she doesn’t have to feel like she can’t talk to us, because this is our job and we’re here to help. I don’t want to come off as seeking her approval because I’m not but I don’t want someone thinking my husband and I (but more so me, apparently) are out to get them and consequently, complaining about us to the management company in the future. 

Sorry for the long post, but any advice on what I should say to her/how to say it??",08Feb2020,1
331,"TL;DR: I feel extremely insecure most days because I feel like I'm constantly missing out on experiences I should be having as a young person. How do I get pass this feeling.

So I [M22] feel extremely insecure most days because I was homeschooled my whole life and never got to experience the things my girlfriend and friends did and it makes me feel very isolated. My girlfriend and my best friend went to raves and concerts while I was in the house playing video games and reading books. They went to festivals that really meant something to their lives while I've spent most of my life in the house. Now that I'm older I really would like some of those experiences(parties, festivals, raves, sex, drugs, concerts) but I feel like the direction I'm headed in life won't really offer those things. I'm getting ready to graduate from college and start applying to PhD programs and am spending my life extremely focused on that goal, but the feeling of missing out on life is eating away at me. How do I stop feeling this way? Or how do I get those experiences? Also, is it worth it to even want to pursue them?",08Feb2020,1

A little bit of context. I'm a 31 year old, single woman who just got laid off from her job again. The last three years I've been working as a contractor/consultant in the ad tech industry, and while there is high pay, there is also high risk. The last company I worked for shut down, and the recent company shut down my entire division. Besides this, for the last 4 years, I've also been trying to move from my home country by applying to jobs(i get interviewed and reach the last rounds, but never ended up getting an offer). If you ask me why I want to move, it's because of a variety of reasons-arranged marriage pressure, I don't talk to my family anymore and me feeling like a misfit in my society. Now that I'm without a job(which I don't really enjoy that much anyway), I'm wondering if I should just take up something to study abroad. I've been looking up courses and I've narrowed it down to a few. What worries me is this. What if after I take the education loan and move to a new country, I have to move back to my home country. What if things don't work out, and I come back home penniless. These thoughts scare me, but at the same time, I feel like this might be the right move for me( I don't have a family that depends on me, and have nothing here that weighs me down)

336,"Hello, I really need some help. I’m looking for honest helpful advice please no judgment.
I live in California 
My partner (not married) , our 3 children and I ( family of 5) currently have medical. We had qualified because at the time neither my partner and I were working and my partners parents were helping us out financially (they were giving us about $500 monthly and we’re covering all other expenses gas, electric etc and they allowed us to graciously live in one of their homes (they own multiple properties) ( I know they have been soo gracious for everything that they have and continue to do for my family) ( please no negativity, I feel like such a horrible person for being a freeloader I just need advice) . My partner just got a job ( I’m a stay at home mom at the moment) and his first paycheck came out to  $600 every two weeks. His parents had established a trust fund (I believe that is what it is) many years ago and  that he would start getting paid from it he turns 30. ( I’m not entirely sure what you would call it but money had been  put into investment funds (prior to him turning 30) and (now that he turned 30)every month, money is being directly deposited into his savings account. It varies (this is only the second month money has been deposited into his savings account) the first month he received about $5,000 and the second he received $7,000. My questions is what do we do about the Medical. I want to make sure I do everything we are supposed to do, and report what we are supposed to. I don’t want to get in trouble. Will medical charge us for past coverage? We had zero copay before but now that our final situation has recently changed, what should I do?",08Feb2020,1

339,"So here’s the backstory behind the current situation I’m facing: I was on and off again friends for a while with this one guy in my year, we had stayed as friends for almost two years as he was apparently “waiting for me” (his actual words) to come around and be friends with him again after I had hit a very rough patch with another friend and needed some kind of support I guess...Anyway, he would treat me and my other friends like garbage emotionally abusing and manipulating us and generally being narcissistic when it came to anything that came out of his mouth. Like his voice was the voice of god. I finally got sick of feeling like I was stupid and scared all the time in his presence and finally cut things off. I advised him that if he didn’t want this to happen again with anyone in the future, he would have to change how he treated people. He got angry. And his angry is the kind where it’s borderline unhinged (It’s frightening to say the least. He’s known to bring a knife to school (shown it to me before) and has suggested he knows how to make an Arsenal first weapons and explosives.) For some time he made an underclassmen friend we both share,  deliver creepy things to me, including poems that he wrote that would make me feel violated and disgusting, but it stopped after said mutual told him not to do that and when I had gone to the associate principal of the school and told him I was feeling rather uneasy around him. (He now isn’t allowed to talk to me under any circumstances.)

Anyway, here’s the actual problem I face: I had lent him books of mine that my father had bought me which are from a small company that had had a booth at a convention two years ago, as before I wanted to learn the basics of DND/Pathfinder. I have a bad memory and only remembered he still had the books recently. I asked my friend for one favor which was to ask him to return the books. When they did ask him, he began to go into an explosive rage, stating he no longer had them. (I assume he’s either lying to get me to fall for a trap or actually sold them) My family has decided they want to go to his house and demand them back or the money that the books cost. I’m scared of what I should do because I know he’s not all there mentally and I feel like he’s going to harm my family, friends, or  even come after me. Does anyone have any sort of advice I could get as to what to do, like should I confront him personally, or let my family handle it? Would it be considered as theft?

340,"So for context, every year my school's orchestra chooses members for a leadership role. This year my batch has 22 people and 14-16 leadership positions according to each year's total strength. On average about 12-14 of us will get the leadership position per year as some have overlapping roles. Conductor, chairperson, logistics ic are part of the executive committee but sectional leader isint. 

I am aiming for sectional leader as well as conductor. So far my teacher says that I'm the most ""prospective"" conductor as no one else has tried to conduct other than me. I'm also aiming for section leader and my current section leader seems to also be headed in that direction, she's been hinting at me being section leader like asking me to lead the violins during sectional practice. 

Everyone in my section(violin) knows this and my good friend is saying im too greedy and selfish in aiming for two roles. My current sl said that he's too immature amd doesn't really show the potential to lead and he has quite a reputation for being very daring, eg climbing through windows, skipping cca sessions etc. 

He says that he can't get sectional leader or chairperson so he wants conductor, but seeing as how most of my teachers and some of my seniors already have me in their minds he's kind of left with logistics ic. But logistics ic is only open to 3 people which will be fought over for very strongly by those who are not chairpersons or conductors as its the only other executive committee role. 

Am I being too selfish/greedy? It does feel like he's a bit toxic wanting me to give up a role for him but I also feel that he has a point and leadership positions are very important for the next two years. What do I do?",08Feb2020,1

I have very little experience smoking in comparison to her who'd been smoking since around 14 or 15, so I was nervous if I could keep up. Well those nerves combined with insecurities that a very recent ex gave me made me have somewhat of a bad high. I feel like I covered it up well, but I still ended up needing a friend to pick me up that night and I kept apologizing for the whole night and everything I did (I know it's a cringe fest). She told me not to worry or keep apologizing and that ""we would work on that."" We ended the night with a hug that caught my stoned and stupid ass off guard, so I'm pretty sure I fucked it up and had to readjust in the middle. She went for the front hug and I went for the side (I can't handle myself lol). After parting, she texted me in a somewhat joking manner since I had given her my number that night. The past few days I've been dwelling on what happened and it just makes me so miserable and I feel like I'm incapable of interacting with people. She seems cool with me, but I can't bring myself to respond to her because I just inwardly cringe everytime with remembering the night. She also admitted to being a bad texter which may explain the short responses and time lapses not to mention people have lives and I get that, but I can't help but feel maybe there's a reason for it. I haven't talked to her since that night. Today she posted some stuff about people being only interested in sex and just dipping on her and I can't help but feel bad since I just pretty much ghosted her.

I just don't want to feel like the weird idiot who's trying to hard and can't take a hint and end up bothering her. Sorry I'm an insecure dipshit and this is hella long.

348,"My sister was recently groped by my ""best friend"", he and I have been close for maybe 2 years now. He lives in the same suburb as I do, and we visit each other often. Around the end of last year he took an interest to my sister. I should mention my sister is very mentally ill, and emotionally unstable, she is prone to panic attacks, and often get emotionally overwhelmed by small things. It originally started off pretty innocentally.

But it quickly esculated into the first incident  (yes, this has happened a few times), the first case was a very simple misunderstanding, my sister made some moves on him, and he returned them, they back and fowarthed until they ended up cuddling and he tried to finger her, she quickly asked him to stop and he did.

The second incident happened not too long afterards, it was New Years, and we had been drinking, it was originally one drink each, whiskey mixed with coke, mostly coke. But he soon gave himself more, getting drunk very quickly. He then proceeded to grope my sister, I tried to tell him to stop, as did she. In the end she had to force him off her, and leave area. Me and one of my other friends stopped him from going near her for the rest of the night.

The third incident happened the other night, me and my sister were at his house doing some weed, I do cannibus on occasion to take the sting of my mental illnesses away, it also tends to calm down my senses (I was diagnosed with depression at a young age, as well as autism and anxiety) I had done ONE cone, and greened out. I typically can do a few, but this stuff was strong. While I was blacked out, he groped and pinned down my sister, and masturbated in front of her. He kept going until he passed out, in which she promptly left. It was 1am by the time he fell asleep. In the few moments I was awake, I saw him doing things to her, so I KNOW at least some of this happened.

I feel like I should also note that he works as a lifeguard at a local pool, and has a blue card (works with kids). I genuinely have no clue what to do. The police in my area are very unreliable by my expirence. My mum has made it clear that he is no longer welcomed in our home. How do I go about this?",08Feb2020,1

350,"Okay so...

Basically I have this huge project for my data class. It’s supposed to be worth 30% of our mark and my teacher announced that we’d be doing it later in the year (she told us this on the second day of class). Later that day I was putting stuff in my car when an acquaintance of mine comes running up to me. I thought maybe she’d ask for a ride home so I stopped what I was doing and started to talk to her. She started off with a normal conversation then out of nowhere she asked me if I’d like to be her partner for this project. 

Now, this little friend of mine isn’t very close with me. Like I said, I really only see her as an acquaintance.  It’s basically one of those cases where she thinks we’re a lot closer than we actually are but she probably wouldn’t even know my birthday if you asked her. 

So this took me so off guard and I panicked. To be honest I didn’t know what to say because I normally have a hard time saying “no” to people. Instead of just saying that I’d rather work alone or that I need to talk to ____ first, I said “sure but it’s a long time from now so...” and she took that answer as a yes.

I really don’t have anything against her. She’s super nice to me and we’ve known each other for a couple years but there are a couple reasons why I don’t want to work with her 

- she’s not very good at math 

- I have other friends in the class who I think would make better partners 

- I know for a fact that she’ll be depending on me to look over and probably do all the work 

- communication with her is hard! She doesn’t have a phone so I’d only ever be able to talk to her about the work at school or if we’re together 

Is there a way I can back out of being her partner without being an asshole? I don’t know how to tell her. She doesn’t really know anyone in the class except me so I don’t know how she’d react to me saying I don’t want to work with her anymore especially after she interpreted what I said to be a yes.",08Feb2020,1
351,"I live in an old NYC co-op apartment, and I can hear pretty much everything from upstairs. I have very strange upstair neighbors. Recently I started to pay more attention to the nosies, and I'm beginning to worry that my upstair neighbors are up to some horrific things.

I'll do my best to explain what's going. So, I can tell there is a man and a woman living upstairs, and I almost only hear them late at night, in the early AMs. I don't hear them during the day at all, no movement or noises. Recently (for maybe a few months) I've been paying more attention to the nosies, and I realized there are often noises of dog or dogs. Sometimes it's a dog running around, tapping its paws on the floor. Sometimes there are barking and cries. These noises only happen at night when the couple is active. Most of the times I don't hear any dog nosies at all, only the couple's activities, their annoying loud conversations, and heavy footsteps. The dog nosies are very inconsistent, and in a way that makes me think the couple don't actually live with a pet dog. I was confused for a while, but didnt think too much of it until last night. 

Last night around 3 or 4AM, I started hearing loud cries from dog or puppies. I can't tell if it's just one dog or multiple. The sounds are very weird, and don't sound like the nosies that happy pet dogs make. Almost like whimpering howls of a scared dog. These nosies are coming from directly above my bedroom. I can hear the couple talking and that they are very actively doing things, which is strange because it's so late. I couldn't sleep and I listened for hours and I wondered with confusion and annoyance. Then some time during the early mornings I heard upstair footsteps moving towards their apartment door, and then I heard the couple said ""thank you!"" loudly to whoever was at their door and the then the door was shut. I did not hear any nosies of dogs since, and something clicked in my head. Are they slaughtering dogs in their apartment, and then selling the meat to clients? I hope to god that I am wrong, and that it's just my over imagination, but I am so convinced. What should I do?

Some extra info: I have lived in this apartment for almost 3 years now, and since the moment I moved in, I've been bothered by the nosies from upstairs. Sometimes there would be days of calm and silence though. I have never went up and confronted them because I have social anxiety and suffer from long periods of agoraphobia. I recently lost my job and have been homebound a lot, so I am extra alert to every movement at night, especially when I'm in bed struggling to sleep. Also, i can tell from their loud conversations and fights that the couple are Koreans. I don't speak Korean, but I can tell it is Korean because i live in a neighborhood with lots of Korean people. Korea has a tradition of eat dog meats, and I am genuinely scared now. I hope I am wrong.",08Feb2020,1

357,"My boyfriend (we’re both around 18) was raised in his formative years by his grandmother, who has been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s and in the last few years and been placed in a nursing home within the last year. He lives with his mom and stepdad now, but he still considers his grandmother his real mom. 

He’s taken it hard, of course, but he doesn’t show it often. They had to move some of her stuff out of her old house and he got some of the things he wanted, and he was very upset about moving stuff out, as I would be in the situation as well. He can’t even visit her because the nursing home is quarantined due to the flu season. He was already upset since she hadn’t been doing too well prior to this, so it’s kinda hitting him all at once

I want to be able to be there for him. He’s not usually one to show when he’s upset, but he’s been upset a lot lately. How can I help him out and show that I’m there without acting like I know exactly how he feels (because I’ve never been in that situation even though I’m very empathetic toward it) without showing pity? I don’t want to belittle his feelings in any way, or seem like I’m trying to say “I know how you feel” when I don’t, and the LAST thing in the world he wants is pity. 
When he expresses how much he dislikes what’s happening, or how much he misses her, or anything I don’t have an answer to what can I say? What would help him out? He’s upset that she won’t be able to recognize his family and future kids, and see who he grows into. I just want opinions as to what helps you, or what you think would be helpful, in that situation without pitying.

I’m trying to be there for him to talk to and be with if he needs me, and I make sure he knows I am. I try to tell him, verbally and with actions, how much I love him and how much I want to be there for him. He’s really appreciative and says I’ve helped a lot so far, but I know it’s only going to get worse. How can I help, or how can I be there for someone in pain without showing pity?",08Feb2020,1
358,"A few years ago, I struggled a lot with being able to talk to people and make connections. I had one or two very close friends but no one else basically knew I existed and even the smallest interaction with others going wrong was enough to bring me to tears or even start hyperventilating. As I got older, things switch around some and talking to people got a lot easier. I’m not sure why or how, but now that I’m in college I feel like I can talk to anyone and I just don’t feel embarrassed about things anymore. The problem is now I’ve made so many superficial friends that I talk to only sometimes, and it feels like no one actually knows me anymore. I feel like all of these people I’ve met know different versions of me, and it’s hard to tell which is the right one or if there even is one anymore. Living life like this is just very unfulfilling because every compliment I get or relationship I form makes me feel like I’ve fooled them into liking me by becoming what I think they want. I have a long-term boyfriend and I regularly wonder if I’ve fooled him too. I don’t know how to understand myself or how to deal with my lack of deeper connections with other people, because i feel like it all comes from me being so unsure of myself.

362,"So I am in a bit of a rough situation.

Some background. Me and this person were extremely close for several years. We spent nearly every day together, dated for almost two years, and I genuinely thought this was someone who at the very least I'd be dating for much longer, if not someone to marry. I deeply loved and cherished this person, and while we certainly had our issues, we also worked through them and took our space when we needed it. 

In the last 7 months, I had to leave and couldn't talk. She considered it ghosting, but I spent almost every day wanting to talk to her. I missed her more than anything and finally I got a chance to get time, so I flew from Boston to Florida to see her, to apologize for the lack of communication and not talking in person. 

She looked amazing and was almost the same as I had remembered, but there was some serious tension. I spent a few days visiting, and stayed in Florida for some work before flying back. A week after I came back, with plans to be down in Florida permanently in the summer already for work and to finish my schooling, she texted to talk.

She wanted to cut ties completely. She decided that after the time she had moved on and didn't want to pursue even a friendship, which is what I was after instead of a romantic relationship. She broke it rather harshly and was very blunt about stuff. It was a rough time.

Ever since then, whenever I see her name anywhere, or get any notifications about her, or see her playing some game we used to play together, I've been getting this horrible feeling in my gut. This empty black hole kinda feeling. I am worried how it's affecting me, but I feel like I do not have an outlet because I can't go to her and tell her how I feel. I've already tried to once, and she blew me off and made it clear that we didn't ever need to speak again.

371,"Today I got caught cheating on my exam.
I am not sure how to proceed. I have not yet heard back from my school or professor regarding it. 

This is by no means, an excuse but this is what my mind set was when I decided I should cheat: 

I got sick with the flu a week and a half ago, as I tried to recover, I got sick with something else. I'm currently still sick and having on and off fevers. I felt so frustrated with my self that my body couldn't stay strong enough to let me do my best. 
This was extra frustrating because 2 quarters ago, I had a real medical scare over a 2 1/2 period involving active rectal bleeding and a respiratory infection that caused me to fall behind in a class and ultimately I failed. Which led me to have to change majors. When appealing to stay in my initial major, my medical reason was overlooked by the Dean because I had passed my online classes but only failed that one in person class (Organic Chemistry). This made me feel like it was my fault. My fault, that I couldn't keep my body healthy enough to just keep going.  

That same feeling came right back when I couldn't find the energy to study for this exam. I gave in and I cheated. I didn't want to fail something again because I couldn't stay healthy.

Again this is no excuse, I know I did something horrible to not only my educational career but to my professor who I have detrimentally disappointed. 

I printed my notes on small sheets of paper and had it with me, during my test. I got the idea from a friend of a friend and I agree I was desperate and just was not thinking straight. 

I have never cheated before and I feel not only horrible about myself but also to my professor. I know I have disrespected him for my selfish reasons. 

I take my exams separately from my peers due to sever carpal tunnel that disallows me to write for long periods of time. The proctor saw that I had small pieces of paper on me, and had to take in the paper notes and my exam. I was told my professor would be notified of my unauthorized material.  

I can't believe I was stupid enough to try and cheat. 
I want to email my professor and genuinely apologize to him for disrespecting him and try to explain to him what happened before it comes from the office where I take my exams. But after reading some situations, it doesn't seem like I should? But my heart feels like I should be the first one to own up to my actions. 

I am not sure if I should contact my professor first and apologize to him for what I had done? Or if I should wait and see what will happen. 

I don't consider myself a slacker. (Maybe I should now, now that I've tried to cheat) I am a transfer student who has worked alongside school which led me to take longer than others my age. Still working alongside school now that I am at a 4 year university to pay off school expenses. I am not the smartest student but I try to put my best efforts into my work. I had a lapse in my judgement and I am beating myself up over it. So please, I know that the best way to go about things was to not cheat at all, but that is no longer a possibility as I have commited the crime. And I am extremely remorseful. I don't want to make excuses, but I wanted to tell my thought process and background. So I can get advice about how to proceed and still be able to continue with my life. 

I had gone down a rabbit hole of what happens with academic misconduct and how to recover or if it was possible. 
My first thought is probably the worst situation, which is that I will get expelled and have no chance of getting a degree or getting a good job in the future. As well as a loss of my integrity from everyone I meet as soon as they see my record.

 I am currently in the UC system.

What are the possibilities of things that could occur? 
What is the best way for me to take responsibility? 
How can I approach the repercussions of my actions to ensure I can still move forward with my life and still obtain a career? 

P.S. to any teachers and professors: I want to apologize for my heinous actions. I may not know you but to all the people who dedicate their lives to teaching. I am sorry. This is the biggest slap in the face I could have given to a group of people I admire and respect. I was succumbed by my emotions and selfishness, and did not use logic. I should not have cheated, I knew that. That is why I got caught. I understand tha  must hate for trying to find a shortcut to learning.",08Feb2020,1

Obviously I'm using a throwaway account for this, and I'll respond the best I possibly can to comments until I forget the password that my Mac pulled out of its ass.  This story also gets really graphic language-wise.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a college student, and I've always been called a loving and chill person.  Just letting you know now, I'm butch, and the school was willing to room me with another butch to make it less awkward for the both of us, but my family (who doesn't accept me at all and hates me, but we'll get into that later) insisted I stay with girly girls.  The dorms are separated by a living room, a bathroom, and two bedrooms, each with two beds in them.  The two roommates that I didn't have to share a room with are fine, and I love them very much.

&amp;#x200B;

**Discordshy was different.**

&amp;#x200B;

No, I didn't make a different name up for this.  Her name was literally Discordshy; she changed it to the MLP name.  I'll call her DS in the story, though.  She was sitting on the bed when I got there: a large, caucasian girl with a face that only a mother could love and wild, frizzy curls that stuck out like dry spaghetti in a styrofoam ball.  Not an afro...just, like, *outwards*.

&amp;#x200B;

We didn't hit it off.  She didn't talk to me for almost a week, and I didn't know if she hated me or was shy.  She would talk to our other dormmates though, which was why I was a bit confused as to why it was just me.

&amp;#x200B;

The first thing she said to me was in the middle of the night when I was doing my homework, when she said, ""I like to masturbate at night.""  I'm asexual, so this is how this conversation basically went:

&amp;#x200B;

Me: What?

Her: I masturbate at night.

Me: Oh, uh... Cool.

Her: Yeah.

&amp;#x200B;

She went quiet and turned over and went to bed.  I was a bit perturbed by this, not by the subject matter (don't be a prude in the comments, everyone other than babies and Carrie White's tried something at least once whether by themselves or with other people), but by the bluntness.  Why would she just... *Tell me* that?  There was no reason, and I had never spoken a word to her.

&amp;#x200B;

About half a week after this, we have four disturbing events that I can never shake out of my head:

&amp;#x200B;

(1)

Her: Tell me about when you were in the drumline.

Me: Well, I was the front snare for most of my time there.

Her: How did you get everything there?

Me: We'd throw it all in the trailer.  We'd also have to put the front ensemble stuff in there too.

Her: What's that?

Me: Like xylophones and shit.

Her: I wanna hogtie you, put you in the trailer, and rape you.

&amp;#x200B;

(2)

Her: We should push our beds together to make one big one.

Me: That's kinda creepy, DS.

Her: We can be closer, though.

&amp;#x200B;

(3)

Her: I used to have a cat.

Me: Used to?  What happened?

Her: I stabbed him.

&amp;#x200B;

(4)

Her: I've wanted to murder my parents for a long time.

&amp;#x200B;

I think at this point in the story, I should say that there are (obviously) two beds, and each bed is on the opposite wall from each other.  Her bed was about ten feet away from mine, and mine was to the left in the room.  I would sleep with my back to her, because I have two helix piercings in my right ear and, you know, I don't really wanna rip that shit out with a pillow.

&amp;#x200B;

She would make weird sounds at night, and that's how I knew she was asleep.  It was little ""ugh"" and ""mmm"" noises, and occasionally she would have, like, panic attacks in her sleep?  It was wild, but that's not the point.  The point is, that night, she wasn't asleep.  She already made me nervous, but I could sleep around her at this point in the timeline.

&amp;#x200B;

This night, I felt a weight at the foot of my bed.  It creaked when she sat down, but I felt her staring at me for what felt like forever.  Then I felt her hand run up the side of my thigh.  She touched me in places I won't discuss, but I think you understand.  At some point, I felt something soft and wet run down my foot, and she proceeded to lick them for, like, an hour.  Keep in mind, this entire time, she thought I was asleep.

&amp;#x200B;

It was about two hours before she returned to her bed.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't sleep for four nights after that, and my dormmates could tell.  Obviously I couldn't tell them because if they told the school, she would kill me in my sleep.  Everything I did after she did this seemed to revolve around her next move, and I couldn't confide in anybody at all.  Every single night she would threaten to kill herself if I ever reported her to the authorities, and I truly believed that, if she was going down, I was going with her.  Every night she would close and lock our door to make sure our other dormmates couldn't get in the room if I cried for help.

&amp;#x200B;

My confidence had just been raised before college after a long bout of bullying in grade school, and now I felt like I was in seventh grade again.  Instead of laughing alongside my friends on the way to class, I walked by myself as quiet as possible.  Sometimes I would run to make sure she wasn't following me.  I know that's very paranoid of me, but I couldn't help it.

&amp;#x200B;

My life was auto-piloted by my fight or flight response for five long months.

&amp;#x200B;

Nobody in my family knows.  I couldn't and still can't bring myself to tell them that I was harmed.  They didn't even want me to go to school in the first place, and they would take me out of it as soon as they possibly could.

&amp;#x200B;

The authorities and the school don't know.  I can't tell them about it because DS would kill herself and it would be all my fault.

&amp;#x200B;

I couldn't go to therapy because, according to my family, ""a freak like you doesn't just need therapy, you need a mental hospital and some pills to get you in a dress and make you like boys.""

&amp;#x200B;

I had to confide in my roommates.  I trusted them enough to tell them, and up to the second week of her living in the dorm, we were sitting in a local hole in the wall Mexican restaurant.  I hadn't eaten for a while, because my brain had tricked me into thinking that DS had slipped poison in my food.  I'll call one of the roommates M (a sweet, tiny Asian girl who loves pink and BTS) and the other one H (a goth pagan girl who is sweet as can be).

&amp;#x200B;

M: You look sleepy.

Me: What else is new?

H: You literally are grey.  What's been going on?

&amp;#x200B;

I couldn't tell them everything, so I had to come up with just the first part of the story.

&amp;#x200B;

Me: DS talks about touching herself at night.

&amp;#x200B;

They thought this was disgusting, and while I tried to play it down, it took everything not to cry and tell them.  I had to tell someone everything and I had nobody.

&amp;#x200B;

One night, DS got up and grabbed my x-acto knife off of my dresser.  I screamed and she ran to lock the door, but luckily H was able to barge her way in and stop DS.

&amp;#x200B;

We never saw her again.

&amp;#x200B;

After this, I was obviously rattled.  I started to see a therapist after telling my mom and dad that I was stressed over homework.  I had to get an ESA after my first appointment.  After getting my kitty, I was able to sleep again, because I knew she would protect me (especially after I was sleeping and H tried to pet her and she clawed the shit out of her for getting near me).  After losing 70 pounds from not eating, I was able to eat once again after a while.  Things were looking up.

&amp;#x200B;

The only thing *not* looking up was the memories.  Ever since she had kicked out of school, the trauma got worse.  You would think it would get better, but that just wasn't the case.  As the days passed, I would have panic attacks at night that would get longer.  My new roommate, we'll call her C, moved in, and I adore her.  We're really good friends, but recently, these emotions DS caused have been worsening.

&amp;#x200B;

I have really short bouts of sobbing uncontrollably.  Just the other week I was sitting in my design class and suddenly I started to cry, and it only lasted about three seconds before it was over.

&amp;#x200B;

Cut to this past week.  C brought a boy she met from Tinder over to the dorm, and I was locked out of the room all night long while they, uh, had fun.  While this was happening, I relived everything.  It was like it was happening again.  I had a panic attack while on the couch, and C got extremely mad, saying I ruin every relationship she's ever had in some way.  I don't mean to, and I thought they were asleep last night, but I couldn't control what happened.  If I could have stopped it, I would have saved her the trouble of trying to explain my brief past to this boy, and it would have saved me from draining all of my emotional energy.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been awake for three days.  I haven't eaten for two.

&amp;#x200B;

If you really want more of my backstory please refer to \[this monstrosity\]\[[https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/d8aucq/its\_all\_scheduled\_going\_to\_rehab\_for\_40\_days/](https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/d8aucq/its_all_scheduled_going_to_rehab_for_40_days/)\] that I conjured up while on opiates, adderall and alcohol. I don't do any of those anymore, and treatment was very helpful in many areas of my life. I am immeasurably thankful that I took the leap of faith and went ALTHOUGH, I'm still left with the glaring fact that everyone in my life who isn't a completely useless piece of defecting meat has passed precalculus in highschool and moved on to actual University, and in most cases by age 20. Right now, I'm basically at an impasse;;;;;;I have the potential opportunity to join the electrical union and make motherfucking BANK fairly quickly without having to learn anything new, as I do this shit for fun. I'm just waiting to take the actual test some months from now, which consists of extremely basic material that even a useless retard like me could take without studying. 

Thing is, I'm currently only enrolled in one single class while at home and unemployed, on food stamps, donating plasma, and just over a month after getting back home from South Florida. I got dropped from precalc because of a payment complication that wasn't necessarily my fault, but wasn't caught on time either. So that leaves me with just this one easy class. I'm worried that when I start my career as an electrician's apprentice, I wont have time to do precalc and thus, my dreams of following in my eccentric engineer grandfather's footsteps will be squashed, the thought of which sends me into an absolute spiral. 

Like, I'm currently 78% done with an Associates in Applied Science for Electronics Engineering Technology, which is actually quite different from actual Electrical Engineering. There's not much overlap, but I still need to pass precalc in order to get to the actual calculus in order to get a single inch into actual schooling. This applied technology shit is a fucking joke. We're literally allowed to have our notes out for tests and I learned all of this shit while learning how to build my own guitar pedals and modify the amps of the bands I kicked myself out of while being crazy.

I'm starting to think that someone like me just isn't fit for real academic pursuits and I'll always be a slave to surface level bullshit technician soldering and janky industrial wiring jobs that require little to no actual intellectual thought, and the fact that I absolutely love doing that kind of work makes it all too apparent that I'm right. 

Basically, I want to take precalc while I work a big boy job, then all the calculus and engineering courses on my own damn time all the while I get that six figure trade money and tell everyone to suck my dick after I get my bachelors well into my 30's. I'm just wondering if it'd even be possible given that a lot of those physics courses, by many accounts, seem to double as a full time job in and of themselves. Suffering from PTSD, addiction and possible bi-polar disorder has derailed me in my various pursuits over the last 7 years over and over to the point where I'm just ready to throw in the towel and graduate to heroin like a real man with the hopes of just OD'ing shortly thereafter. I wish I didn't think like this, and I know that I won't ever actually do it, but the way I'm wired just kind of leads me to these places. 

Sorry for the mellowdrama...I hope that someone here can read between the lines, see where I'm coming from, and give me something of substance that I can actually take something away from. I just really need to illustrate my thoughts as honest as I can even if they sound like they're coming from an edgy 17 year old Hot Topic employee's Livejournal.

390,"Hey everyone, just wanting to know what I should do in this situation. Basically this girl I moved in with, told me on the day I moved in that she had cervical cancer. A series of events lead me to finding out the truth (she doesn’t have cancer, or reproductive problems at all). She made my life a living hell but very VERY subtly from July-November last year. 
By subtly I just mean I didn’t realise her behaviour was deceitful &amp; manipulative at the time.

Anyway, because of a mountain of things both in my personal life &amp; to do with her, I gave in my notice to move out, left a month later &amp; never spoke to her again. 

I then started getting messages from a guy she was seeing (who’s mother has cervical cancer) saying she wanted to kill herself because she felt alone after i *abandoned* her. 

Backstory: The biggest reason I moved out was because my ex passed away very unexpectedly. He was murdered &amp; after a week or two she kinda manipulated me into going clubbing in the area he was killed - because she started chemo the following week or some utter bullshit like that. I ended up going &amp; having the worst possible time i’ve ever had out clubbing. 
I wasn’t coping and didn’t feel safe in my own house so decided moving would be the best thing for me.  I told her that and she was fine with it. So to hear this from him and knowing she’s told a couple of others that I abandoned her in her time of need is really getting under my skin.

About a week later a different flatmate was venting to me about how stressed she was trying to help the girl. So i told her that she was getting absolutely used &amp; abused for her money, and saying that all of this was fake &amp; showed her proof. She was shocked (they’d been best friends for a few years) &amp; also handed in her notice to move out.

 When that happened the lying cancer girl went through messages between me and the other flatmate (from the flatmates phone) about us talking about how much of a scam it is and to stop paying for things &amp; going out of her way to help her when she doesn’t need it. I angrily threw in that she was a toxic and manipulative bitch but I was very flustered at the time. She deleted all social media for about a month after this happened and didn’t speak to either of us.

My problem now is that I’ve had a weird influx of messages from people thanking me for taking the girl to chemo &amp; looking after her... obviously since she never had it I haven’t responded because I don’t feel like telling everyone she’s lying about chemo just yet or at all (i’m conflicted) . But there are also people that she’s telling that I’ve ruined her life &amp; I abandoned her at the time she needed me most for my own selfish gain.  These were also my friends who haven’t even given me the chance to explain my side to them &amp; what is actually happening - I’ve just been blocked without communication.  

I just feel like no one knows the truth &amp; I can’t stand up for myself. I really want to message her and confront her about it all and saying I know about her lying about x, y, &amp; z. It’s not just the cancer she’s lied about but it’s the one lie she’s taken so so so so fucking far. She says things in passing like ‘ xxxx raped me one night’ but forgets her own lie &amp; will say I never said that’ like a week later.

I’ve come a long way since then with things going on in my life &amp; Im finally in a good headspace, just to have this come up again. In my head I think it’d be a good idea purely to have this drama finished &amp; be done with so I feel like I can fully move on from that period of my life. But i’m also hesitant because I’m scared that I’ll ruin the progress of personal growth i’ve already made.

This is a rambly post &amp; I’m happy to clarify any details but would I be in my right mind to message her? Or should I just let it go &amp; treat me ignoring her as closure?

395,"Hi everyone, first time poster on the subreddit. Was looking for some advice regarding a friend. Lets start with the context (hopefully with minimal identifying details!).

Met her during my literature PhD so have known her for a few years. Friend has always been the girl who is bad for texting back but in a pretty innocent way. She would be there if you needed her and was always up to hang out whether in a chilled way or out on the town. Made a little group of 5 friends with her and 3 other girls and we would hang out as a group a lot and we even went travelling to lots of great places.

Almost 2 years ago she met a guy and to be clear he is great and I think they are a great match. Of course at first she was busy with him in the honeymoon stage but things evened out and went back to normal. Recently however they moved in together and things have changed. I've tried to compartmentalize these things in a few points:

- She finished her PhD in the last few months and when she finished we did everything with her to celebrate, taking her picture with her thesis, going out to party when she passed her viva. However maybe 2 months later another friend finished her masters in History and she didn't show up that day to celebrate her thesis submission and didn't even recognize it in our whats app group, no congrats or anything just radio silence. The friend was left a bit upset by that as she did a lot for her to celebrate her finishing. She didn't even come out for the celebrations just skipped it altogether. I feel like it was a pretty bad move to be honest.

- It is a struggle to get her to hang out. We have always had girly nights and they are a lot of fun but she definitely seems like she couldn't be bothered. Other times it seems like she wont do it if the BF isn't going to be there. We recently planned a get together after not having done it in a while and her first question was could her BF come too, when nobody else would be bringing the boyfriend along. It just rubbed the wrong way like she can't do anything without him or that she doesn't even want to hang out.

- The BF's friends have also barely seen him apparently he spent less than an hour hanging out with them around Christmas while my friend was down with his family for Christmas (she is from abroad btw). So for some reason he is also not seeing his friends as much.

- She used to be the girl coming to us every week saying there's this dancing class or new museum that she wanted to see and you would always see her interested in events on facebook. That has all but disappeared.

We thought maybe they were trying to save up but she would also not show up to things that don't cost anything (like hanging out at a friends house). Of course I'd hate to think they both just hate all their friends and want to shut them all out. I worry she has become too comfortable and is not putting effort into her friendships which is just going to cause bad feelings and us to eventually stop calling her to hang out since she always just says no. Our friends group doesn't want to lose her to domestic life completely, we just want to hang out occasionally and not feel like shes trying to run away home from us.

We all have boyfriends (me for several years more than all my friends) and some even live with theirs but we never have neglected everyone else because of them, we have managed to keep a good friend/boyfriend balance as a group until now. I don't know if she has always been like this because we didn't know her when she was with her last boyfriend.

Are we being reasonable? I need some honesty here and any suggestions for remedying it?

TL;DR - Friend is neglecting friendships and has been very hard to get a hold of since moving in with her boyfriend, what should we do?",08Feb2020,1

400,"This is basically a rant. If you want to read it to give your opinion, you are very welcome. I'm writing this while panicking over my future. If you have experience in anything I'm mentioning, I'd love to hear what advice you can give me.

I can't choose what to do with my future. I'm soon to be 20, and I've had a gap year working in a restaurant, which I hate, following my previous studies. I have a passion for art, however recently I haven't been very motivated to do any projects on my spare time. That's probably because I haven't had anyone or anything pushing me. I'm thinking I want to study graphic design or illustration or something like that. I want to do something where I can train and use my creativity. When I'm producing something and putting something into the world I feel like I'm in the right place, and I don't know anything else that makes me feel like this (I actually cried while watching the creativity documentary on Netflix because it was so moving for me, lol). However, I don't know if the design-art area is the right one to start out your career in, since I'm afraid there won't be any good jobs. I wish I could find something that's more secure but still be in the creative and aesthetic art field.

I've thought about programming and IT. But it's not anything I'm particularly familiar with, all I know is it's well paid and there's high demand of IT-engineers. I'm thinking I could build from that. I could maybe start doing websites or something, or I could get a foot into the video game industry (don't know how, but studying programming does sound like a good place to start). 

I would love working with video games or movies. What I really want to do, is to participate in telling a story. That's what I love about art. How am I going to get there? Should I just take a leap and apply to art school? What can I do with my degree then? I don't want to get stuck on some dead end waitressing job because my art degree can't give me any jobs.

401,"I know i ask reddit about this subject a lot. It's a mixture of not knowing what to do and having no one to talk to about this subject. This most likely will be the last. So here we go. 

What should i do? 

My girlfriend stays in a college dorm not far from me. We don't talk much anymore. I still send texts but she's often busy to reply. Which makes me overthink. We talked for a short period of time  and deemed we are out of the honeymoon phase. She always tells me that she's just been really busy and stressed the past month. I usually get told this when i bring up that I'm concerned about our relationship. Specially after i didn't get a hug when she left to go home. I told her its the little things that make me utterly think something is wrong. But she thinks everything between us is just fine. Which makes me think that i just need to chill and stop overreacting. Realize things won't be how they once were in the honeymoon phase. 

Sometimes i think to myself maybe she would be better off without me. Maybe without me in the picture she can 100% focus on her college studies. Maybe...i won't cause stress for her. As I'm probably becoming a obstacle. But she would always tell me that's all false. She once told me that im what's best for her. My heart tells me she truly wants to be with me still. But my brain tells me different things. Granted this is my first serious relationship. (6 months and growing).

I don't want to turn my back on her. I do love her a lot. And i still want her to be a huge part of my future. She has my promise that i wouldn't leave her and that i would always be hers. That promise was made by a promise ring. Some people may think im crazy for doing that. But it felt right. And she absolutely loved it. So that's why it hurts so much at the idea of a change in the relationship. I don't want to lose her. And maybe i have nothing to fear. Maybe it's all just me overreacting and overthinking.

402,"So yeah I like someone but the thing is I don't know what to do in my current situation. 

We just started talking like a week back I think? But this was all on Facebook. I also just got broken up last December and had a closure early January. Alright so here's the thing, I tried asking her out for a simple dinner and to actually start talking in person because we've been talking on Facebook without proper introduction. Then she humbly said no and that she had plans for that night. 

That's fine for me but right then she said that she doesn't usually accept invitations like that. That she doesn't see the point of it. Well, I got confused. She explained and the gist is that, it's not really her priority right now. We're both in college. And that if she really likes someone and let someone court her, it'd be at least after graduation. So from there, I had a little ball of hope. But I'm still kinda reluctant about it. I don't really know if that's a sign that I should not pursue her, or was that just a front. 

Another thing that she told me about herself is that she didn't formally accept any suitors back in high school. Although there some who tried to and made effort, she was just thankful as she said. There was someone who she let to court her, for 6 years. For 6 years and in the end she said that they did not end up together at all. So technically, she's had no boyfriend since birth.

Alright back to the topic. I kind of want to believe her and put myself to commit for 2 years of waiting. But I also think that it's just a front, because I think she actually knows that I've just broken up with my past relationship and she just wants me to pause for a while. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR

I like this girl. I've just broken up on my past relationship a month ago, pretty new. I think she knows that and is making fronts for me to pause for a while until she tries to accept. But she also said that she doesn't accept suitors right now, because it's not her top priority since we're in college.

I feel like I've been shut out for a long time, but I also know we are short staffed and will need everyone available for the next few months.

Here's my thing; should I just go in and accept it, or should I do something else? Would it be petty to try and schedule it for another day? Either earlier or later? I'm thinking it wouldn't change anything but it would be my way of asserting dominance over the situation, and something as petty as that could be amusing. When I do respond to the e-mail, should I CC our HR? And Director? I'm just curious because I feel like it would be a way of telling her she's not as powerful or important as she thinks she is. Finally, would it be inappropriate to insist I have everything documented and recorded? Because I feel like that would be rather useful. I have no intention of suing or anything, but again just asserting some power would be useful.

Likewise, I'm thinking I would show up to work overdressed for it. Full suit and tie. I'm curious if anything thinks this would be a good idea or if I should just quietly accept it. If I know I'm leaving anyway, what difference does it make? Its just a pissing match at that point, but at least I can make a point I suppose.",08Feb2020,1

408,"I apologise in advance for how long this is going to be. But bare with me, this is 4 months worth of stuff that I need to condense down into words.

I work in a bar. 

Just before Christmas, the landlord (A and S) went through a relationship breakdown, which resulted in them leaving the pub. We had a weeks turmoil while A removed all his property out and us as staff continued to keep the bar open. I struggled a lot with this, having worked for them for 4 years and calling them family. An average week under A+S was about 30+ hours of work - it was great fun and we felt like a team. Prior to the Christmas incident, I was promoted to Assistant Manager. 

At the beginning of December, a temporary manager was put in place by the company that owns us. Said temporary manager was travelling from Swindon most days (a good hour and a half drive without traffic). For the first few days, he was fantastic. Then slowly his interest in the pub seemed to dwindle. Some days he would show up for only an hour, then leave. 

For almost two weeks, I was the soul member of staff there late at nights (21F...) - which turns out is actually not legal as I do not hold a sale license for alcohol and no one was present on site. Likewise, during these two weeks the temporary manager lost the keys to the doors, as such I was only able to temporarily bolt them, not secure them each night. We are lucky we didn't have a break in. 

During his time as 'manager', this temporary guy belittled and abused each of the staff. He was rude to our faces and behind our backs. He threatened via text message when he didn't get his way (threatening to remove my promotion for example, threatening to fire us if caught drinking behind the bar etc). 

Let's not forget, he smoked in the cellar. Which is illegal. 

He would also make the staff do the worst of the tasks. Clearing out piles of rotting garbage from the courtyard without gloves in the pitch black. Having bar staff scrub the cellar to hide his smoking evidence. Having the bar staff litter pick outside when they were solo staff and there were customers inside... (Yeah he wasn't the brightest I'm pretty sure)

The temporary manager was due to leave on the 7th January. I went off sick on the 1st due to mental health issues caused by him - I took a lot of his rants and abuse due to being AM. I was back to work on the 7th, for the change over. 

Now comes our new manager, R. 

I'd heard a lot of rumours about R before she even got here. She is fairly well known in the area as pub folk talk and tend to gossip a lot. I somewhat knew what to expect. 

But what we got was worse. 

Instantly, she started 'culling' the staff. 

With no reason, and not even a message to them, she would cut all hours for the week. One guy phoned and text her twice, she ignored him. She even refused to speak to him in person when he came in wanting to chat. He left pretty quickly. 

One member of staff hasn't been given any shifts in 3 weeks. R says it's because she can't get in contact with her. All staff phone numbers are on the notes board in the back room. All staff are in the Facebook chat. All staff contact details are on the computer system due to our contracts. 

But now for the icing on the cake. 

On Thursday night, the new rota for this coming week was out up. I took a photo and sent it to our (old) Facebook chat. This chat was what we had used up until a few weeks ago for staff related things. We now use WhatsApp... Except half the staff aren't on the WhatsApp group because it won't allow us to be added for some reason. I put it there for the sake of those who wouldn't be able to see it on WhatsApp and still needed to know their shifts. 

To cut a long story short, all of my hours for next week have been taken away from me as a punishment. 

And I am fuming. 

First they took my promotion the moment they walked in and dropped me back down to 0 hours contract, (my hours dropped from 30+ to around 15 a week), now they've dropped me to nothing just because I wanted to make sure that their staff showed up to work. 

The entire situation is making me ill again. I don't want to just up and leave, I had been trying to find another job to go straight into but not had an luck just yet, but it seems that I'm going to have to just leave. 

But I don't want to go quietly. I need some advice on what I can do. Is there anyone I can report things to? 

I have considered going down the whistleblowing route for the company, but I'm unsure as we are such a small team they might know who submitted the complaint. If anyone can advise me on where I stand and what I can try and do, that would be amazing.",08Feb2020,1

TL;DR: My co-workers treat me like shit and make me cry either at work or at home but the money I make is too much to quit. I'm torn between keeping my job and quitting, but if I quit I'll leave my best friend alone with the douchebag head chef. What do I do?

I (F16) have been having issues at my workplace. I've worked there for 9 months now. I work in a restaurant in the kitchen, and I make the appetizers, help with the main course and I also help with the desserts. The pressure is HUGE, especially since the head chef and I are the only cooks.  We're a small restaurant in a small town, but we do get quite busy usually.

Now the problems started from the beginning, but got way worse in January: we got a new menu and I had to learn everything all over again. The head chef got annoyed with how 'slow' I worked and the way I worked in general. He's gotten angry at me almost every evening and completely humiliates me in front of the customers (It's an open kitchen).

Even the servers don't like me, and the hostess talks shit behind my back. I managed to persuade my friend into getting a job here because of the nice shift times and the salary: €5.94 for a 16 year old is A LOT, the minimum wage for 16 here is like €3,15 I think. The money is really the reason why I'm staying.

I usually excuse myself to go to the bathroom and cry for a while, and yesterday I even went home crying because it was my mum's birthday and the bitch head chef wouldn't let me go home early; by the time I was home, the party was over. I'm going to college next year and I wanted to start with a clean slate and get a new job, but I'm starting to think it might be better to quit before GSCE's.

I don't want to leave behind my friends with the bitch ass employees there, but I also don't want to cut my payments in half when I get another job. Finding work in the small town I live that pays THAT well isn't easy. What the hell do I do?",08Feb2020,1

It’s been my dream to go to college abroad. The problem is my dad says he won’t pay for higher education since i am lucky enough to have public uni and we don’t have to pay a dime to go; we don’t even have grade requirements, we only need to have passed certain subjects in hs. 

But i know for a fact that in some countries there r Plenty requirements And it’s expensive to study. So i feel confused, am i being ungrateful? Is it bad that i don’t want to make my life here? Am i being greedy?

416,"I did mushrooms with a friend, and he went into full psychosis. I later realised his antidepressants were probably the cause of him completely losing his mind. My guess is he got what is called serotonin syndrome. He was completely crazy, didnt know where he was, was asking the same questions over and over. Punched my other friend for no reason then acted like it was no big deal. Ate my weed after I didn't let him smoke it, ate my face cream. Jacked off, everyone left the room at this point but he started while everyone was still there. Was trying to tear his fingers off. Just overall was completely crazy. He said a lot of things that seemed out of order. At one point he says ""I really shouldn't have done that, raped that little girl, I raped her"" something like that. I really hope that was some nonsense but I just really dont know. His mom ended up having to come get him. He was lucid enough to know everyone's names, and never made anything up, just said stuff, out of place I guess, so I just cant imagine the one thing he makes up is about this. According to him his girlfriend was raped, pretty recently, and I'm hoping that mabye he was talking about that  and was just too fucked up and said that, but honestly I dont know my guts telling me he did it. I just dont know what to do, I'm gonna talk to him about it Tommorrow morning, but I'm sure as hell gonna get a no from him whether he did it or not.

419,"So ever so often my father comes down with this, from what it seems, very intense stomach pain, vomiting, nausea, some hiccups, etc. He catches it at least 2-4 times a year and I hate to say this but he is very aggravating and annoying with how he reacts to it. A lot of times it will come after he does something where he drinks a lot of beer or other alcohol in one sitting, this time I think it might’ve been the Super Bowl. He drinks at least 1 beer everyday besides that and he smokes weed. I can see it coming after he drinks too much or he eats something that upsets his stomach which are things he can totally prevent and he should know by now what causes this and that is another thing that is very annoying. 
Anyways, when he is sick, him and I live in a 1 bedroom apt, I have the room and he sleeps in the living room. He will bundle up in his blankets and roll around on the floor banging into things and moan, groan and grunt so loudly for hours, all day and wont stop. I can not sleep later  at night (11pm-2am) if he is doing this. When I leave for anything, work, gym, to even grab the mail he will go lay down in my bed and roll around in it and knock and kick my shit over. Also he’s getting his germs and whatever he has  shit all over my bed which is awesome because I have become sick from him doing this before and he still does it. It is so frustrating. Yesterday, I was making a pizza in the oven, and he is making a huge deal about it because I guess a closed oven transfers enough heat in 15 minutes to cause an entire apartment to feel 10-20 degrees warmer, Im sorry but I was standing next to the oven the entire time and it doesn’t. He then whines and complains over and over saying things like, “Oh my god is it fucking done yet oh my god” or “Jesus dude why did you do that, why did you do that, why”, and I stand there and I look at him like are you fucking serious right now. I totally get he may actually be in pain but shut the fuck up there is absolutely no way that you feel 10000x worse just because I had a pizza in the oven for 15 minutes. 
He also thinks his only medicine is weed, only weed, nothing else. I understand it helps with nausea, whatever. I offer to get him anti acid and I even offer him melatonin to put him to sleep, anything to try and help. On top of him only using weed he neglects himself by not drinking nearly enough water. I have even witnessed him literally drinking a beer while he was in the middle of being sick. I have not been able to take my father seriously since I was like 16-17 and this is one of the reasons why. I understand people get sick but he has only been getting sick like this, no common cold, nothing that is just sniffling and coughing, only whatever this is and he doesn’t ever consider what it might be that is causing this. Maybe it is too much alcohol and beer in one night, maybe it could be something we eat on occasion, I just really wish he would take care of himself better like a grown man should and he doesn’t. This is one of the many problems I have with him but I just want to ask you guys how I should deal with this? Some nights I will just leave and stay the night at a friends house. Whenever I try to give him advice on what he shouldn’t do anymore he never takes it because he thinks weed is the only way to deal with anything. I am moving out soon so I guess that would be the ultimate end to everything but I just wanted to get this off my shoulders because this is how I feel every time this happens. Sorry if I seem like a total ass because he is my dad but a lot of you wouldn’t understand the respect I have lost for him since I started to grow up and become an adult that realized that his dad is a bum and has done absolutely nothing to do better for himself or his kid.

420,"In these past 2 years I met guys who are either creepy or just wanna use me. 


First I met this man who I thought had good intentions but nope. He said some of the grossest things I have ever heard to date and thank god I stopped talking to him before things got any worse. I felt so dumb to even talk to him and worst part was always thinking I was gonna run into him somewhere.  After many months, I got over it but I still get the chills when I see his look alike.

Next, I met this guy and he stalked me like crazy. We met in college last year and I really thought I found the one. But damn he knew every detail about me. Knew where I lived, which elementary and high school I went to. And worst part he only wanted to hangout at night so something was definitely up in his head. I felt so creeped out and I was so so scared to be on campus by myself for the longest time. There were times when I would take the long way around just so I wouldn't pass him. I had never felt like this before and just the thought of him stalking me killed me every day to the point where I skipped so many classes of this class we had together. 



After that I finally moved on and met this guy who's basically head over heels for me. He really likes me and many have told me so but I'm so scared to even let things get any further because I don't think my heart can take it anymore. I wanna trust him but I just can't and I don't wanna hurt him.

Since I didn't wanna pursue things with him, I met this guy online but of course I got played. He talked to me for like 2 months and honestly I thought ok maybe for once someone isn't gonna break me but nope. He got back together with his ex and just blocked me like ok...

I just feel like I can't trust men anymore. I feel so stupid for falling for these guys and letting him affect me so much.

I have just started high school. At my highschool we had an orientation day(Oday)

During my O day they told us what our homerooms were and we did a full day of highscool.

My homeroom was perfect. All the boys in my class were nice and all the girls were nice too. I had my best friend in my class and I was really excited because, in your first year of highscool you are in all the same classes as your homeroom and some classes you merge with another homeroom.

When I got to my first day they had moved me in to a different homeroom. Which was fine but I was with no one in my friend group. 

I was with one girl(J) who I am close with which was fine. But when we merge with another homeroom part of her friend group is with her so sometimes I can’t sit with them or something like. One of the girls is her best friend and J is a good friend she doesn’t do it on purpose or anything it’s sort of one of those things you do unintentionally.

Pretty much my friends and I are sort of distant already because of the long break we hadn’t seen each other or talked that much in a while.

So only seeing them 45mins-1 hour a day(45 min lunch and 15 min recess) sort of makes me sad and some days I get really nervous because I sort of have to work some things out for myself without a friend and J doesn’t feel confused about some things.

433,"Hello all, I'm a 27 year old CPA who currently works as a financial analyst for a bank in a low cost of living state. I have no children. I'm considering three options. 

1. Stay where I'm at
2. Take the LSAT and take law classes in the evenings
3. Take the Foreign Service Exam and become a Foreign Service officer.

To give background that I feel is pertinent (feel free to ask additional questions as well please) 

I did well in school (3.9) and have a BS in Economics w/ minors in Liberal Arts, Accounting, and Finance. I also have a Master of Accounting and the CPA certification. I also have certifications with Microsoft Office, Computer Repair, and Network Administration

Currently I own a rental property that makes me $16,380 a year, before expenses, likely closer to $10k after. At my job I make $68K a year and I often take side jobs on that on average net me about an additional $8-9K a year. 

My Rental Property is worth $30K and is owned free and clear my primary residence is worth $195K and I owe $170K on it. I have $22K in target date mutual funds. I have $80k in student loan debt and rising as I am currently at $0 require payments and in the 2nd year of the 20 year REPAYE program (20 years of payment controlled for income level and the remaining balance is wiped after the 20th year as I understand it. I'm pretty confident that is correct but if someone more knowledgeable understands it otherwise please let me know. 

I spent a little over two years in Public Accounting at the Big 4 before getting burned out and taking my job with the bank for a pay bump although I know my income growth will be slower going forward from here although I'll be getting a promotion by the end of 2020 that'll bump me roughly 7k. 

The reason I'm considering options 2 and 3 is because they're closer to what I envisioned myself doing when I was younger. I grew up really poor and went into the CPA because it was accessible to me and the state university I could afford had a really good program I could afford. 

In regards to option 2, I took the LSAT without studying two years ago and got a 155. I did really well on the first two sections but logic games wrecked me and I literally just put C as every answer. for 5 months of study program and the test itself the cost would be $1,500 not to mention the time and pressure of going to law school night classes for four years while working might kill me. I'd like be 32-33 years old by the time I finished if I finished. I have JD friends who could likely get me jobs starting $100-$120K after the four years are up tho I could probably be at around $85-90K I figure by then where I'm at, this is assuming I compliment my existing CPA by focusing my class load on tax law as much as possible. 

In regards to option 3, I think taking the economic career path as a foreign service officer would be really cool and sexy due to traveling the world on assignments. However, I know realistically a lot of those assignments might be to shit tier countries and the pay would be consistent with where I am already if not a slight downgrade. I took foreign service exam practice test and demolished them. My only weak point was admittedly fucking up the English comprehension section a bit do to poor understanding of semi-colons, however, I'm confident I could quickly study up on that and close that knowledge gap. 

I've just recently started making post on reddit and honestly I'm a dirt bag on here but in the real world I really love helping people and genuinely feel good about doing the right thing. (I actually considered criminal law to be a PD for this reason, however, I don't think I could bear the dual pay decrease and cost and time of four years of law school in tandem.) 

I might be asking for the moon here but I'd love for people to ask questions and help me make a decision regarding these three paths, especially if someone has any understanding or knowledge on any aspect of anything I mentioned in this post.

437,"Heres what happened at the end of my (11am-5pm) shift:

It was pouring rain, and the bus i had to catch left at 5:10. Every manager but one was in a meeting upstairs. I call him and tell him im leaving closest to exactly 5pm to walk to the bus stop, which is 9 min away. He says “ok, just call the boss man let him know, dont walk in on the meeting”.

I do just this, in addition to wrapping up anything he needed to know before i left. i had post-it notes for my replacement, to help her complete any tasks i was unable to do during the meeting. As i hang up, my replacement clocks in and gets comfy, i got my stuff and im clocking out at exactly 5pm. 

My boss comes down and immediately comes up to me (already clocked out) trying to talk? He kept saying, like, “Hmmm do the buses run all day? why do you need to catch this one now? etc etc”. 

As you may know, you either *miss* the bus or you CATCH the bus. All my duties were fulfilled and i was off the clock. i answered a few questions but i was LITERALLY going out the door homie, i did NOT wanna be stuck in the rain. 

After stopping at a pizza shop to wait on the second bus, i miss a call from work and get a voicemail. i call back and my boss confirms that he just left a VM terminating my job. 

Ive never had a no call no show, no late without call or good reason, no write ups ever. i would stay after, even help with training off the clock. 

The place is run by a personal owner, so no HR; however, im looking into and contacting agencies that help the EMPLOYEE and not the big businesses.

Im in VA so technically they dont need a reason. HOWEVER the voicemail discloses that me catching the bus and informing them (as he said, demanding, even though it was after my shift and the next worker was fully working?) was “odd” and the reason we’ll “part ways”. 

Along with the voicemail i have a texts from the manager who told me to call him, confirming that it was indeed, in his opinion as well, wrongful. 

TLDR: tried to catch a bus in the pouring rain, after successfully completing a shift, and clocking out. My boss attempted to stop me but couldn’t because i neeeeeded to catch the bus? i got a voicemail 30 min later firing me, claiming this bus scenario is the reason (i have no prior write ups or anything). help.",08Feb2020,1

443,"I'm 14 and have worked in a rather large Mcdonalds in Australia for about 6 months now. I haven't had any trouble with getting shifts (you get a weekly roster given out to you online over the employee app) until recently, where i haven't been rostered for a shift for about a month. 

The Mcdonalds I work at has no email address, and the email address of the manager isn't on the website either. There's a phone number to call, but employees pick up the phone, and (from experience) are told not to give the phone to the manager that's on shift as they don't want to be bothered by calls.

I could go in, but it's a 40 minute commute, and the store manager (person in charge of rosters) is almost guaranteed not to be there (I've only seen her once in the 6 months I've worked there).

The jobs pretty bad and I can't think of a way to contact the store manager without directly going in. I'm wondering whether I should just look for a new job, or keep going in until I see the manager. Thoughts on this? Thanks and have a great day/ night :)",08Feb2020,1

446,"This is a very long story but if anyone has the time I would really appreciate some advice. I joined this school in 7th grade and I made two friends we’ll call robert and sam, yes I wasn’t very popular, but we were all good friends. Eventually in 10th grade a new member joined lets call him john. I remember feeling down for a while during that time, I told my 3 friends that I was feeling depressed, it wasn’t clinical depression it was just a word to express how I was feeling, robert and sam didn’t know how to respond and to be honest I don’t blame them, but john decided to go and tell a bunch of people that I was saying that I have depression and that I was faking it. I was obviously hurt because I really was not happy and to top it all off it was personal and I didn’t want anyone to know about it. Another thing that he did on the same year was mention my girlfriend who cheated on me and said “your girlfriend cheated on you because you couldn’t satisfy her” attempting to “roast” me when in reality it was too personal and just a plain dick move.

Now it’s 11th grade and three people joined and robert left, for the sake of this story they aren’t very important except for one of them, we’ll call him carl. Carl would easily get pissed off over a few jokes and some minor inconveniences but he’d get over them soon, but his biggest issue is the fact that he tries to play every side at once which makes an issue ten times worse. John got mad because we were interrupting his game, he pretty much called us all out and attempted to make us look like assholes, maybe we did take it too far but eventually we all forgot about it after john called me and tried to resolve the issue. He still didn’t apologize about the comments he made in 10th grade.

Now it’s my senior year and three major things happened and this is where I need advice, two people called eric and mohammed joined. We all had an issue with this random person and we all needed to confront him, when the day came I started the confrontation and they all ran except for mohammed, I got really mad because they just threw me under the bus and surprise surprise john still tried to justify himself, he pretty much said that I would’ve ran as well even though I confronted her without them, all I needed was a break from them. Eventually the next day eric came up to me and tried to make a few jokes and I really wasn’t in the mood so I told him to fuck off, John came up to me laughing while talking to me and tried to apologize, it was obvious that he didn’t really mean his apology and I was pissed at him the most so I didn’t accept his “apology”, later I knew that they made a group just to talk shit about me on the same day the incident happened, john told the entire group to not apologize to me and that “I’d come back”, but fortunately they didn’t listen and they eventually apologized. He tries to make himself look good by saying that he tried to apologize even though it was later proved that carl told him to and that it was one of the fakest apologies ever. All was well and I was still not talking to john, eventually carl and eric stopped sitting with us and started sitting with john, I didn’t fully mind but what annoyed me was that the guys were just downright ignoring me especially when I try to plan a hangout. Two days ago a guy who visits our group from time to time asked me if I was going to go out with them, I was confused because I didn’t get invited at all, I realized that the guys planned a hangout without me after I haven’t even seen them for months. I said fuck you to eric and carl and just walked away I didn’t sit with them at lunch, carl kept giving me the stink eye instead of coming up to me to talk and today eric unfollowed me on instagram to show that he doesn’t want anything to do with me anymore, what should I do I am open to all criticism but just as long as it helps.",08Feb2020,1

I have always had trust issues in my life and social problems, and I decided to share my biggest secret to my boyfriend, I told him about my gender Dysphoria, he said he didn't care and that he loves me no matter what, he gave me some advices and said he wouldn't tell anyone.
He lives with 4 friends in a house and they are like family to him.
After 2 months of dating he told me that he felt like he wasn't helping so much with my gender dysphoria and he felt the need to do more for me, so he decided to share my secret with his friends and ask for their advices. When he told me, I was shocked for a few seconds, then I said that it was fine and he gave me their advices.
After a while I decided to rethink about it, and now I know that I am actually not fine, he told me he wouldn't tell anyone, he didn't even apologized, I feel sad, I feel lost and I feel betrayed.

464,"I recently reached out to a '*friend* ' who, through my therapy process, realised wasn't good for me. She reminded me of past unhealthy mother dynamics (my mother was and remains mentally unwell). 

After moving abroad 6yrs ago, I promised to tell her when I was back in the home country first time. I messaged: 

'Hey, how are you? It looks like I'm going to be in (name of city) soon. I know it's a stretch (she's not based in exactarea), but on the off chance you're close for work or other at that time, I'll be there! xx'

She replied: 'Heya, I am fantastic thank you. I have no idea where I will be around April but hey who knows. Good luck with (city name)!'

I felt like it was passive aggressive but maybe I'm reading it wrong. I mean she is the one who was like we NEED to catch up all these years. 

Finally I reflected and decided to remove her from my business network (not block), and woke to this message:

'I'm not too sure why you are offended and blocking/removing me every way possible? Bit unfair don't you agree?' \[It seems she's assumed that me getting off social media is all about her and i've blocked her. Instead, she hasn't asked where I've gone or if i'm taking a break- just assumed the worst on all fronts\]

For context, this is typical of her. She can be passive aggressive to you, but you can never do it back. It's very narcy behaviour and gives a 'i'm monitoring you!' vibe. I hate it, always have. And worst part is you can never tell her things like this, she gets too defensive and vitriolic. Once, after a sexual assault happened to me, this 'friend' has called me a 'victim victim victim'. Because I couldn't 'get over' it. Well excuse me, it had been less than 1 year that it happened, i pursued therapy, was employed, and was severely struggling. In that time, I did not have the gaul or confidence to tell her to f off. I just accepted it...

He wants me to use his bag which he's never cleaned and which he's put used clothes and swimtrunks and for this trip he wants me to use that same bag and he'll place some of his stuffs there so he can pack with a smaller bag while I'm carrying the large one. The things he want to put aren't exactly clean either. Slippers and his leg braces which collects a lot of sweat and maybe virus from the air since he's going to use it everyday. And he insists on not bagging the brace since it takes up space. 

I'm reallly concerned both because of the dirtiness and the fact there's a virus going around that's really contagious. 
Is this normal behaviour or very controlling? My mom and I tried to argue but he got mad and says we're both snobs.

This gets to me each time but now I'm more upset he won't even listen even though there's multiple cases of coronavirus to where we're going. I find it likely he'll infect me if he gets infected because of his unsanitary ways. (Like picking at food with his fingers or utensils and leaving the one's he touched to us and not washing hands frequently I suspect even after peeing.)

So, am I that asshole for insisting we each use separate bags and being just too paranoid? I mean my dad is paying for the trip and maybe I'll just suck it up and hopefully not get infected although my inner neat freak is screaming.

I have tried to text the best friend about it (it was his sister) but he has ignored the message. I have friends, and a very loving family, but I feel so fucking guilty, as when I begin to think about it I go into a really dark place.

2) Computer Programmer

I'll start off with the fact that I have the time, money (not rich, but it gets the job done), and privilege to pursue any of them.  I'm a high school graduate and my main motivation to apply for these fields are because I wanna make games. Whether it's through mobile apps, or gaming platforms, that is my intent. I researched on a lot of computer science fields and those 2 stood out as what I'm looking for, but I am confused on how they both work. 

Comparing both jobs to each other, I find this analogy to be, more or less, similar: 

A computer programmer is a soldier in the army that works to follow and execute orders made by their generals. They use the tools that they're given with the plans that they are informed on, to do the legwork and complete their mission. 

Meanwhile

An application Software Developer tends to be the general in this case that is creating the plans for the needs of the military to achieve success. They lay the groundwork for what needs to be done in the mission, they revise the plan with intelligence to make sure there aren't any flaws and missteps, and to achieve the best outcomes possible for their idea. 

I could be, dead in my tracks, wrong about all of this so please let me know if so, but that's how I view it on a surface level. 

Judging by that analogy, I'd imagine it's obvious that the software developer seems like a promotion for the programmer, but yet the certificates for them can start on the same level. I could choose one or the other right away, and so I am confused on what I'm not getting right. 

There also is the fact on the web I visited that the current demand for software developers is higher than of computer programmers. That also counts for wages being higher.

The only explanation I can find for this is that the pressure is going to be much higher for a software developer because you will be held to a higher standard and people will depend on you much more. 

That is not something that I am hesitant to try but I do have this voice at the back of my head that's telling me I need to start small, A.K.A. programmer. My end goal is to be able to work for a game company that creates games on the console generation and the PC platform. 

So circling back on what I wanted to get out of this post, what is the right course of action to do? What can help explain how those 2 jobs work in real life and provide a better understanding of how I should approach this? And of course I'd appreciate any advice you'd give as well as any corrections that need correcting in my post. 

For the research I made, I got it from this website that's separated into 2 pages for those 2 jobs in case you wanna have a look yourself.

477,"Hiya there. 

To give you some background info: I was born in a non-EU country, in which I've also lived my entire life. Obviously I hold a passport and citizenship of that country. However, for ancestral reasons I was able to obtain yet another citizenship, that of an EU country.

 If I were to go study abroad (specifically, in an EU country), what will be my tuition fee status? Do I count as an EU student just because of my dual citizenship, or do European universities take into account only your ""main"" nationality (in my case, the non-eu one)?

Thank you for your help in advance :)",08Feb2020,1
478,"Hi guys,

To be quite frank, I feel like I have tried almost everything. I've even visited a clinical psychologist, which only helped to temporarily alleviate the problem. 

My issue:

I think about her every single day. I truly do still love her and want to be with her, even if this sounds crazy. It really felt to me that there was something more to our connection, even though of course we had our faults. I feel like me being young (we started dating when we were 18) and stupid caused the relationship to end and if I had been more ""normal"" I would've still been healthy and happy today. It also seems to me like no girls will ever be the same. So I guess my issue is that I get these urges to try and connect with her and fix things,a longing for her. It sometimes feels even like the universe wants us to be together (on our birthday, same day, I was talking to my friend over the phone and then she came to my friend). Or there's all of these things that seems to feel like signs. Of course, I don't really believe in signs. It just feels so supernatural at times. Even though it's objectively wrong, no other girl seems as beautiful.

Background:

We dated for a year when we were 18. We lost our virginities to each other. She was my first real girlfriend (other one was more of an online friend). I saw her almost everyday (I normally picked her up from school and then we chilled at my house). We talked permanently, from the moment we got up till the moment we went to bed. We planned on spending our lives together. I know we were young and what not, but to me it felt so intense and real. I still have her drawings and some polaroids, if I look back it's difficult to capture the emotion that I experience. During the relationship I was super controlling (I didn't allow her to hug other guys, couldn't go out without me) and I was insecure about her past (she has had three other boyfriends or something like that). It caused so much unnecessary and stupid conflict. I manipulated her into giving me what I wanted (saying yes to ridiculous demands - e.g. no hugging other guys). For about a month I made her cry every single night and in the beginning, it was deliberate. I got addicted to the control. Eventually I realized how fucked up everything was and I tried to be only good and right my wrongs. I tried for about three months, but she had nothing left to give. The pain was too much for her and on the 14th of December, after I refused to go to an event with her and her friends - she really wanted me to go, but I would've hated it - she called it quits. No amount of begging and trying would work this time. From that day onwards I have missed her every single day and if I don't control it I am in tears at night. 

Any advice :)?",08Feb2020,1

484,"My housemates cousin has been made homeless by her parents since coming out as trans. I wasnt asked i was told that due to her running out of sofa surfing options she would be coming up north to live with us. We have a small box room so they will bave their own space. I would have liked to be proper consulted but i understand that it would need to happen anyway. I know i wouldn't let my family member be homeless. Shes being picked up on tuesday so its all happening very fast. 

The main reason why im hesitant and also need advice is that she is quite severely autistic. I've been told that i need to have some proper boundries in place before she comes so that it can be as smooth as it possibly can. I have worked with autistic young people before and i understand how to work with them in a professional setting but im unsure how that all translates into my personal space 

Anyone got any tips or suggestions with dealing with this but also any specific boundries i need to think of? Already thought of no walking into my bedroom but thats all I've come up with.",08Feb2020,1
485,"So this is kinda a one of attempt at reddit. I only have a vague idea of how it works and I've never really thought about it but my partner uses it and i thought why not. I don't know if maybe i just need to vent or if i'm hoping for some sort of response but, i don't have anything to lose from it so if you care to read through this, thank you.

Every now and then a particular person that i haven't seen or had contact with in years keeps keeping back into my thoughts and it's gotten to the point where it almost feels like a disease or a curse....yet one that i almost don't want to be rid of. I'll try and keep the story time as condensed as i can but, maybe it'll do me good to get my feelings out.

From about as early as i (M23 just fyi) can remember i've known this girl (yes it's all about a girl, which makes me feel super dramatic but meh) that i went to pre-school with. For the most part growing up there wasn't anything remarkable between us. We ended up at the same school 1 year apart, bumped into each other occasionally and just always said hi and went on our way. Naturally we also wound up in highschool together as well. Of course being older that's when things hit me. Going through mid to late high school was far and above the WORST years of my life. It is by far my life time low, i was seriously depressed and went through multiple suicide attempts, but that's a whole other story on it's own. None the less we were still a year apart so i didn't see her for the first year of hs, but then came the day. What they say about it is true. Just walking along with my head down, looked up for no particular reason and BOOM. Time really does stop. Your heart sinks into your chest. Suddenly she had become the most beautiful person i had ever seen in my whole life. Everything around me just melted away for a second and there was nothing but her. Looking back i hope i just didn't stand there for way too long looking like an awkward dumbass. Pretty sure i managed to not stop and just keep walking XD None the less turns out some of my friends were friends with her so we kinda got back in touch a little bit. She turned out to be the most amazing person. Super sweet, super badass, creative, and gorgeous. Now of course i had never even dreamed of trying to actually be in a relationship. I thought there was no way she would think about me like that EVER. I was awkward, no confidence, going through that phase as a teen boy where you just don't take care of yourself like a normal human being so i was probably a little gross really (i remember my hair always being greasy af) Looking back on it i'm almost glad i never tried because i don't think i could have made it work. I had no idea how to be a boyfriend. No idea how to be a good, loving and supportive partner. I'd like to think i've changed a lot since then and i'm at least a half decent guy to be around....part of me also tells me i'm already thinking too highly of myself XD

For the most part we had a pretty normal sorta friendship. We never got close. To this day i'm not particularly good at making friends. My time in school going through depression made me a severe introvert, not in the way of being bad at socialising, just in a way where i've become self sufficient and don't need to be around people, for the most part i stay very happy and very healthy on my own. Long story short in about 9th grade (i think) i find out she's moving school, and later she moved further away within the state. I had a lot of emotional ups and downs about her. I tried to tell myself it was just a stupid hs crush and things would change. It really was, and still is different though. I can't deny the fact that i fell head over dumbass heels with this young woman.

Anyway back to the point i ended up leaving highschool right after 11th grade. Simply became depressed enough and went through enough that i put my foot down and told my parents that this was it. If i had stayed it very well may have killed me. Was also going through an abusive long distance relationship (my first and otherwise only relationship) at the time that had just ended....very...VERY...messily. Again, a whole other story. Fast forward what has now been 6 years. I met another young lady online that went so so right this time. We now live together, have 2 adorable little kittens together, have gone through a crazy few years making things work but we won a battle that was never in our favour to be together. I feel amazing and have changed so much as a person. I feel healthy and strong. I have a job at a place that i love and care about with amazing people.

My dreams are what hit me the hardest. Every now and then, maybe every few months, i'll dream of her again. The dreams have changed in the ways we react when we see each other. Most of the time it's joy. Reuniting. It almost feels like she knows how i feel. But of course then i wake up. The feeling is...i'm not even sure if i can describe it. But it's powerful. I love her. I know i do. Now don't get me wrong, i love my partner so very dearly. We've gone through so much and we've both worked so hard to be where we are. But this just claws at the back of my head and i hate it, and love it at the same time.

Every now and then i make the mistake of looking at photos of her. She's still so beautiful. Of course she's just living a normal life, she has a partner too and she seems happy which i know in my heart is the best thing and i'm glad, genuinely. But i feel it. I don't think i'm angry or sad or even happy. It hurts so damn much but feels so good at the same time. Part of me is scared that it could easily be called obsession. I never want to come across as creepy or weird but of course i can't help but feel bad about it. No matter how hard i try thought it just doesn't leave me. It always comes back.

I don't know if anything would ever fix it. I've tried but i don't know if it can go away. It feels like a piece of me is missing, which is hard to admit. I love my girl so damn much, she is such a big part of me and my life and i wouldn't trade her for anything ever. I KNOW that i'm not having a conflict about choosing. I suppose it's probably perfectly okay to be in love with multiple people, maybe that's a little controversial to some but, i think it's true. I think the worst part may be longing for some kind of closure. I don't know if that would help but, it feels like i just need her to at least know. Just know that i miss her dearly and i care about her. I'd like to tell her i love her but...of course that's terrifying and i'm afraid of what she's think or how she'd react. I've tried reaching out but she never responded....kinda made an ass of myself. I got angry...then apologetic...then i just tried to be open and told her to block me so i wouldn't be tempted to bother her again. Still, never talked to her ever again. It's infuriating to have to hold it in. Especially when i know she's been back in town, she's seen people i used to know or be friends with. I even came very close and kinda indirectly talked to her. I was sad and nostalgic and went back through my first group chat on fb. Just wanted to tell some old friends that i loved them. My parents recently went through a near fatal event so, i've really gained a new appreciation for telling people that i care about them. Seems like the least i should do in life if there's any chance it might ever bring someone joy or comfort. Anyway naturally she was in that chat. Someone brought up everyone getting back together. She responded and it made my heart shrivel up inside my chest. Of course I couldn't say a word after that without addressing the elephant that was tightly crammed into my personal little bubble.

I guess i just don't know what to do. I guess i feel a little better after sitting here to do this. Just hit midnight. I don't even know if i'm hoping for people to reach out and respond or if there's even anyone who will see this. I wish more than anything that i could talk to her. Of course part of me screams that it's better off not to. Idk if there's any advice anyone could give that would make a difference. I feel like it may just be something i need to carry with me. Any weight that doesn't crush me will only make my legs stronger. Strong enough to carry the weight of the people i love when they need me. But it still hurts. 

My partner knows some of this. Obviously she doesn't really like to talk about it but of course i can't blame her. I just hope she truly understands how much i love her and how thankful i am that i can tell and show her exactly how much i care for her.

Funny and maybe thought provoking side note, i'm not terribly religious but i do essentially believe in re-incarnation. I always felt the the girl from my childhood was someone i had met before, in another life. She always felt familiar. My partner though is the total opposite. She feels new, different. Part of me wonders if the girl from my past is my partner. Maybe in her next life, come back to see me before we met or something.

Further side noting, i'm just trying to put down my thoughts straight outta my head. I'm sure this is moving into romance novel territory but i keep a photo of my partner and me in one of those stupid photo booth things stuck to my laptop. Making dorky faces and being goofs and kissing each other on the last one of course. Do you ever get that feeling when you look at someone at just think ""god i need to kiss you and love on you so fucking much"". Fair to say i get invasive thoughts when i think about this girl....naturally i want to tell her that too but, i'm sure i'm only sounding so much worse and creepy now (i swear i'm a nice guy!) XD I'm gonna be sure to give my partner a big ass kiss and hug when i'm done writing this. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway i think i've rambled on about long enough. If you by chance read even some of this, thank you. I love you too! (in a less dramatic, romantic, possibly creepy stalker way XD)

488,"So  I'm taking one of my philosophy's to heart here, but before I do I was  wondering if its possible for employers to see your travel history? Like  can they find out if you have been issued visas in another country? I  would assume only the government would be able to do that, but I'm not  sure. I am a legal US citizen, and in fact I've never even left the  country. I don't have the money or opportunity, but I figured the next  best thing would be to fake travelling; ie, just take some vacation days  and go black on social media and say that I'm in Europe, Thailand,  Dubai, the Caribbean, whatever. I'm entitled to vacation days. I never  even use them, but I figure it would be a good way to inflate my  importance. Make it seem like I have more money and status.

My friend’s close family member discovered issues recently and went for a scan. They said they told me when the results were coming in but I must have completely forgotten because I had no idea (first mistake). I had a very important project due this week, and another important test at 7:30am the very next day, so I was very preoccupied this week. I was barely in contact with anybody as that is how I prefer to focus, so messaged this friend maybe once a day except for one day where I didn’t reply. They asked me if I was okay on the morning the project was due, I explained and they said no worries (speaking totally normally with nicknames etc). The next day I messaged, got no reply, and asked if they were okay, to which they replied today saying they were upset I hadn’t spoken to them when they needed me. I know I fucked up, but I don’t know how to make it up to them. Had they messaged me and said they needed to talk I of course would have been there, I just must have completely forgotten the results date and was so busy I didn’t take the initiative to message myself.

492,"Hello, anonymous redditor here due to best friend is on reddit as well. This will be a long one I think so I will put a TL;DR at the bottom for anyone who doesn't have the time to read all of this but still would like to give a tidbit.

So the gist of my problem that has been plaguing my mind as of the last 5 months is that I can't stop thinking about my best friends sister. I know what most would say is that there are many fish in the sea however she has the most in common with me, then any other woman I know. Whenever I'm with her, a certain calm and happiness that I have never had when talking with other woman falls upon me. I say things to her in the spur of the moment that later I think ""Wow, where did that genius come from?"".

 Another reason probably that it seems I think I can't get her out of my mind is that I've never had GF before. Now I know that sounds like I'm ugly or something but I'm actually quite good looking just my social skills with women is garbo. In High School I moved halfway through which kinda screwed me up big time with the whole dating game. So I just concerned myself with graduating and thinking I would find ""the one"" in college or at least get into a relationship to better myself for the future... Alas, I didn't go to college but a technical school for aviation maintenance which did not, as you can imagine, have any girls. So I then went on to finish that and now work to build aircraft for US contractor and make a decent amount. We have now arrived to about 5 months ago and where my best friends sister became the forefront of my thought. 

Now to get you up to speed, I have a close relationship with my best friends family where I get invited to their holiday get togethers. So when I got invited to a party they were having at the end of summer I said sure. I've always been one to probably speak the least and just be a good listener. However, something changed temporarily for me when I saw her that day, almost as if something caught aflame in my heart. I was much more talkative and lively then I probably have ever been to even my own family. Whenever I got the chance to speak to her that day I was comfortable and relaxed yet Jovial. We talked for a good hour about nothing really of great importance just a fun conversation until she got called away. After that we chitchatted a bit more until I had to leave due to it being late. When everyone was leaving and saying their goodbyes, she walked up to me and gave me a hug and gave such a warm smile that I still cant forget. On my drive home, I replayed all of those moments over and over in my head, with a big smile of face.

Now to my problem, She is currently in another state in college and my best friend knows that I have some feelings for her yet he said something weird when it got brought up one time. He said 'You do not want to date my sister, the women in my family are sharks'. Yet, every experience I've had with her she seems to be anything but. My best friend knows that I would treat her with the upmost respect and never disrespect her.  I want to be with her so very much, yet I feel like I have gotten no where. 

TL;DR : My best friend's sister who I have fallen for, who is currently in another state for college. Yet, my best friend seems to be not 100% against my feelings for her but still doesn't think its a good idea because he said 'The women in my family are sharks'. Which I still dont understand. 

Please help fellow redditor, you are honestly my last option that I can think might give me some type of fix for this.",08Feb2020,1
493,"A few days ago we got into a fight and after we made up she broke up with me. It was a mutual decision, for the most part. We were together for almost 5 months. 

Our relationship was kinda rocky for the last month. 

She has untreated depression or bipolar, neither of us is really sure. She refuses to go to therapy mostly cause of her financial situation. 

I was ready to move on but after thinking about it I decided I don't want it to end so I went to her town the day after. I told her I want us to try again. She told me she wasn't sure if she had any feelings for me and that she's confused. She says her emotions are a mess and she blames it on a depressive episode. She said she needed some time to think and then I got onto the train. 

After like half an hour she told me she wanted to get back together again in a couple of days, after she got back from a trip she's going on in a few days. 

My friend, who is really against the relationship, started a fight with her, told her that if she really loved me she'd be certain of it and not so unsure. My girlfriend says that this basically made her realise she does love me and said she's now certain she wants us to get back together.


I honestly don't know how I feel about the entire situation.

In the dream I had a boyfriend who broke up with me for whatever reason.

I remember having this extreme sense jealously I have never felt before - like I could feel my blood boiling. 

The setting was a department store and I was taking a two part test for whatever reason. I got it over with, and walked out the front doors of the store. It was nighttime and I could see all the lamps within the parking lot beaming down . It was mostly empty.

The next thing I remember, I’m standing over her body. Smack-dab in the middle of a parking space she laid on her side, totally lifeless with the light directly over her, almost like she was on display. I walked away thinking something vile like, “I told her” 

I walked towards the front doors and the same ladies who gave me tests earlier, walked up to me and say I need to take the other half of the test.  I’m walking towards the back of the store with them while accepting my fate of life in prison. I was already imagining the headlines of a body found in my own town. 

And then I woke up.

I’m used to working at companies in the creative aspect (such as the music industry) or my previous job which was just a part time retail job. Both places felt like home due to how close we got to each other and how free spirited the work environment is. 

I recently switched careers into the first response field and I absolutely love it. I may be getting a job soon in a wonderful and big named hospital/company though.

I just feel out of place because everyone is so professional looking and with the way they speak and carry themselves. I’m 22 and all the nurses who make up majority of the space are probably in their late 20s, early 30s, 40s maybe.  It’s intimidating me because of that, along with the extreme professionalism, and the fact that this will be my first experience in the field and its an extremely professional experience. 

I’m getting kinda scared and anxious to have my first “big girl” job and I’m not sure how to emotionally handle it. I know I can definitely handle the job and its requirements... its more of the switch into it. Many of my friends are still working retail, or dog walking, or a desk job, or unemployed. The early 20s is a weird stage bc everyone is all over the place. I guess to know that I’m about to start a stable career scares me and I’m afraid to outgrow people... and maybe I might even change. From being this creative, youthful person.. to someone who is serious and professional. Maybe I have to just switch my personalities and differentiate work from personal life? 

I have no idea what to do or how to approach this or deal with it. Please advise me with wisdom!!!!!",08Feb2020,1

506,"Hi im looking for some advice, i hope this is the right place. Im not sure if im having a bad reaction because of my self conciousness or if this is just a bad idea. Im going to be vauge-ish to keep it annonimous.
So a friend of my family is publishing a book that has advice and tips on a subject i am also well versed in. She asked a while ago if i would write some short tips to be added in the margins spread through the book. She also asked my mom because her expertise is also related. 
When she first asked, i was in the middle of having the worst flu ive ever had, so I didnt answer at all, and she heard through my mom that i was sick. 
The next time i heard from her, she emailed me with a short bio she wrote about me. It was VERY exagerated (though flattering) in a few ways... such as stating i was an expert with materials i only casualy used a year ago and no longer use, and that i run a ""very sucsessful"" etsy shop. I do have an etsy shop, no one would ever describe it as anything but super casual (like, only 20ish sales over a year). She had also originally asked that i include a high def headshot of myself. I do NOT take pictures of myself. I dont like the way i look and I get overly upset and down on myself when i see pictures of me. I know this is a personal issue and not normal, but it doesnt come up a lot so i dont deal with it. I asked if i could instead send a ""headshot"" picture of a, lets say doll, that i created instead (this is relevant to the books subject and does not look like me in any way) she said it was fine. I sent my tips, my new bio and a few optional high def pictures.
 I didnt hear from her until a week later, she said nothing about if the bio and tips, just said the publisher isnt keen on using the doll photos, and suggested i send one of my wedding pictures. This is where dont know what to answer or do. I really dont want my picture published, but it would be awesome to have my words published and give me some credibility in my field. I genuinely don't have a recent photo, and where as i looked beautiful on my wedding day, it was nearly 8 years ago and i am now post-kids, bigger, and in my 30s instead of 20s so i think thats a bit cringey to publish that now. I would have to take a new photo of myself which just the thought of makes me want to cry. I have a small online presence and work very hard to keep it NO pictures of me, this anomininity is important to me and my self confidence. I never want any focus on me, just my work. My husbands advice was to just tell her forget about the whole thing cause it is weird to begin with, but i suspect hes just tired of my overworrying and thats the fastest way to put an end to the anxiety over this. I feel like if i email her with my concerns, ive already been so unprofessional with the timing and already asking to use a surogate photo that shes going to be fed up with my issues. I do want to be in the book. I do not want my picture published. Im also afraid now that instead of a small picture of me in the ""about the authors"" section like i assumed, that it is going to be more prominently shown than that. If my picture is on the front or back covers im going to be devistated. What do i do? Suck it up and take a picture, insist a compromise be made, or pull out of being in the book all together?

507,"i'm 14. i started homeschooling last year because of really bad social anxiety; going to school made me physically sick and i would cry almost every day when i got home. i definitely like being at home all day better but now i'm just hiding from people and i can tell my anxiety is getting worse. none of my friends really made an effort to text me or hang out once i left school and that really hurts me. whenever we talk i'm always the one to text first. i've started taking piano lessons and group acting classes because i like acting but everyone in that class already knows each other so it's hard to make friends especially when im so quiet and boring and at the most say ""hi i like your shirt"". and then proceed to shake and sometimes turn red for the next few minutes because of how anxious saying that made me. 

that's only once a week and the rest of the time i'm at home. my mom takes me to movies and out to eat sometimes because she can tell how lonely i am. it's embarrassing. i haven't hung out with a friend in 3 months . i feel like no one except for my parents would really care if i just disappeared. 

and now i'm beginning to talk to myself, my pets, just whoever will listen. i spend hours daydreaming about this world ive created in my head, one where i'm happy and extroverted and everything is perfect. i just feel stuck. i'm not sure if i should go back to public school next year. i don't like the feeling of being on edge and anxious and sweaty for a whole 8 hours. but at the same time i'm making absolutely no high school memories. in 50 years i'll look back on 9th grade and remember how i used to roll up my comforter and hug it and pretend it was a person to get a sense of human contact. i truthfully prefer being alone but sometimes i feel really lonely and trapped because i know if i try to make friends they'll think i'm weird for blushing whever i talk. therapy is an option but it's too expensive and my parents can't afford it right now . i just feel so lost i don't know what to do, any advice is appreciated",08Feb2020,1

512,"I need to know what my options are.
My friend recently got broken up with by his ex. He seperated from her and came to me asking to be taken to a Psych ward. Turns out you can't self admit. So I take him over to his family.
While there he has a mental breakdown??(not 100% sure) hallucinating, depriving himself of food and sleep until he lands a job.
Guy seems to be doing better, acting more like himself again(dating this girl changed him a lot) 
But he keeps obsessing over his ex and his old friend who's living with his ex ""B and A need to know it's not okay to do this to people, they shouldn't hurt people like this"" and he had a fair poiint.. they hurt him a lot

Then one day he asks to borrow a car from his family, they let him and apparently on the same day he quits his job and drives over to his exes place. Where he lives for a few weeks. Until recently when he showed back up after not talking to his friends or family for about 2 weeks. 
He messaged us all asking for cash to get an airplane ticket SOON to leave for another state.
Then he shows up at his sister's apartment out of nowhere, he asks to be let in and she obliged. Then he made a comment about going to a gun show(which I can't tell if it's humor as his humor is dark, or if this is a warning sign) and he leaves. From there which he walks approx 10 miles in the winter at night to his family's house. 

I asked him if he was going to the gun show in town and he said yes.

I'm worried he may attempt to harm his ex/his old friend.

519,"Sorry for the long post. The title sums it up. My bf was visiting from out of state and left his credit card at my house. It was last November so I can’t remember exactly where I put it, but I do remember him leaving it and most likely I stored it in my room somewhere without really thinking about it. When I’m not away, I live at home with my parents and they wouldn’t go through my stuff. 

Here’s a timeline of chain of events:

11/19 bf leaves credit card at my house. He’s out of state and I can’t return it. He also trusts me enough to not use it, so doesn’t close it or file for a new card.

12/19 I have to go out of state to help family out, coincidentally my sister’s bf breaks up with her and since she was living with him, she’s forced to move back in with my parents and stays in my room since I’m gone. she also loses her job at this point because she worked at a family owned business of her now ex-bf’s. No job, no money and back with the parents.

1/20 transactions are being made on my bf’s card. He doesn’t know it yet as he’s made a purchase prior to forgetting the card at my house, and pays off the amount due. 

2/20 bf gets notice his card is maxed out. Realizes wtf Bc he left it at my house. I do some serious sleuthing.. long story short, my sister with no money has been going out and I wonder with whose money? She uses my parent’s credit card and I was able to obtain a copy of her transactions. Side by side comparisons show transactions of the same exact locations within days- either the same day or a day off. It’s definitely her. 

Some back story:
My sister isn’t a bad person. I’d call her a lost soul. She’s made a lot of poor decisions growing up  and has a long history of dishonesty. I love her to pieces Bc she’s my sister but beginning at an early age (middle school) she got the idea that shoplifting was fun until she got caught . To my knowledge she hasn’t done anything like that since, but has done the“ taking siblings’ things without asking. “ very frequently. In fact she’s lied to my face before and I’ve caught her red-handed many times. Idk how she turned up that way Bc we were raised in the same household. To be blunt, her judgement isn’t the greatest with guys either. To my knowledge she’s never been single for over a week and in the six years I’ve been with the same guy, she’s probably been with 15. I’m not one to judge and I don’t think that’s wrong because people live how they want, but  basically she goes from guy to guy, spends most of her time partying but more importantly, has a history of using my parent’s credit card without their knowledge, to the point of over withdrawing and causing fees. This upsets them and idk why they don’t take their card from her(?!) but that’s for another post...

I spoke with my bf. At first he panicked Bc he thought it was identity theft. When they told him the card was being physically used, he was a bit more relieved. Even more so when the chargers were close proximity to my home. The charges on his card match the locations of charges on my parents’ card, which she used. They are also at locations she frequents, I know for a fact.

I can confront her but if she lies do I press charges or threaten to do so until she admits the truth? She’s my sister and my bf doesn’t want to file for fraud. He would rather lose money to avoid the dispute but imho thats enabling her to be dishonesty and that’s not right. If I leave it to investigators she may go to prison or pay a hefty amount, which Idk but seems like the only way to sort her out. What sucks is that throughout these past months I’ve gotten closer to her and she’s relied on me to be a confidante. Going through a breakup is tough and so is losing a job. She’s approaching 35 and it sucks living with parents when everyone at that age is getting degrees or having families, but CA housing especially OC area makes it hard to be single, jobless and afford an apartment. She’s opened up to me about the pressure she feels, and I feel for her. The last thing I want is for her to be even more shattered by her choices but at some point, she has to learn that even through tough times, breaking the law, lying to the people you love, and using them and their money without their knowledge is NOT the way to go. I called her last night but she was at a party so I just texted her to call me later when she’s available and sober. 


TLDR; My sister definitely stole my bf’s credit card and maxed it out. it’s just a matter of what to do next. Any advice would be appreciated.",08Feb2020,1

522,"I was contacted by dealer about having a buyer that was interested in purchasing my car from me. I know this is a common sales tactic to get customers into the dealership but thought it couldn’t hurt to check out anyway. 

I informed them from the start that I was not looking to get out of my lease, that they had initially contacted me, so I would only be willing to do it if the price made sense. I was clear with what I was looking for and at what price. On more than once occasion, I was told this was do-able. If they had just informed me that they couldn't meet the demands I was looking for initially, I would not have been upset. I understand that it is a business and if it doesn't make sense financially then there's no point in discussing it further. However, this didn't happen and I ended up going back to the dealership multiple times for no reason.

During one of the meetings I got a quote from them. It was much higher than what I was looking for. No problem, I figured that would end the transaction. I asked for a copy of the quote just in case I changed my mind. After a lot of back and forth I finally was able to take a picture of the quote. I wondered why they were so reluctant to allow me to have a copy of it, when I got home and ran the numbers for myself, I figured out why.

I still have the worksheet with the numbers given to me. It's much easier if you have it in front of you but I will do my best to explain. I was looking to lease so using those numbers (rounded for clarity). They were offering a price of $36k including taxes. Looking at the lease, they had worked the bi-weekly payments to roughly $300. This was on a 3-year lease financed at 0.99% with a residual of almost $17k. While I was at the dealership, I said no thanks can't afford that but they said they could offer me a discount and keeping everything the same except dropping the price to $235 bi-weekly.

When I ran the numbers for myself something didn't add up:

$36k (selling price/amount financed) minus $17k (residual) equals $19k

$19k divided by 78 (3 years of bi-weekly payments) equals $243.59

I then realized what they had done, using the numbers on the quote they gave me. The initial bi-weekly payments should have been $243.59, however they were inflated to just under $300. So when they were able to offer me a ""discount"" to $235, that is just what the initial bi-weekly payments should have been (roughly). So basically, they had used fake or overinflated bi-weekly payments and then pretended to give a substantial discount. When in reality, the second quote or “discount” was more or less what the payments should have been in the first place to equal the amount financed.

I even brought this issue up to them, and he accused me of not being able to calculate the payments properly. I reached out to the dealership directly going on about a year ago now. It seems as though they don't think this is an issue so I'm posting this to hopefully warn other customers of this trick, as well as see if there is any recourse I can take.",08Feb2020,1

That I understand but I've gone around 3-4 weeks of no IRL interaction with my friends.

Like half of me goes away to anxiety and I start thinking of what I’m saying and how I sound and I start worrying about whether or not they’ll like me.

(she’s never done that) we went back and forth for a couple hours and she came to the conclusion that we just didn’t need to be in this right now, she says she still has feelings for me and wants to be with me but that we just shouldn’t talk right now. i told her if that’s the case she should probably block me because i will keep trying to fight for it and potentially mess things up more, she didn’t want to do it and i didn’t want her to either but that’s how i had to be shut down in the moment so i knew i could quit trying. but now it’s a few days down the road, she still hasn’t said anything, i still haven’t said anything else, but i’m not sure if i’m actually blocked or not. i don’t know where to go from here. should i give up? should i messege her? should i give it a few days? i just feel stuck and i wanna have some closure before i start tryna move on. one thing we’ve always stressed is that we wanted the relationship to be mature and responsible because neither of us have really had that before but for all this to happen because mainly of one little event and for this to potentially be over over that one little thing it seems a little silly and immature as is to me. i apologize for this being so long, i’m cringing at the fact that i’m actually doing this but i just want someone’s opinion/advice. thank you",08Feb2020,1

 i don’t get along with my ‘best friend’ as much as i used to do and it’s seem like i am the only one who feel this way. i am an asshole. i’ve talked behind her back with probably everybody in our group of friend and most of them agree with me. tbh she is very mean and every time we told her that, she just laughed then brushed it off. but i don’t know if she knows that we talk shit about her and sometimes i feel kinda guilty. and i don’t know why but i have a feeling that i am afraid of her. our relationship is not equal (is that how you describe it??). i have always have an advantage but i am the one who feel 
insecure, like why?

for some reasons i cannot give up my friendship with her (we have know each others for 5 years). no matter how much i hate her, i still find myself try to please her. wtf is wrong with me??

534,"       So a couple of months ago, one of my (15F) classmates (15M) was diagnosed with cancer. It wasn’t looking good but now we found out that he has a very rare type of cancer. He’ll have surgery later this month in another country. There’s a very slim chance he’ll make it, though I don’t think he knows that. His birthday is next week and my class decided that since we cant go to him we will each wish him a happy birthday on camera and someone will piece the recordings together and send it to him. 

        I’ve known him for 2 years and we got along quite well because we both liked the same kind of video games, especially Overwatch. When he got sick we all bought him a PS4 so that he could play while in hospital and I once played with him again. I thought about sending him something funny to brighten up his day because we’ll all send cards with heartfelt messages anyway. But I have absolutely no idea what to do. It doesn’t have to be long, actually I wouldn’t like it to be too long. So any ideas please?",08Feb2020,1
536,"I graduated college just last year and I got a good one-year job contract that paid 3x the starting salary for my degree. It’s at my hometown where I lived for 21 whole years with my parents (note: it is normal in our culture to live at home even as an adult).

I don’t hate it but I don’t love it either—it’s just an alright job. But the thing is, life at my hometown is *boring*. There’s nothing much going on here; it’s a quiet countryside place and I feel like there’s nothing for me here beyond my job and my family. Also, I’m not very “free” because of my parents. They’re not *bad*, but I still have a curfew because of them and if I want to go out I always have to ask + they always have to know where I am.

I planned on moving to a bigger city after my one-year contract and I was pretty excited about it, but then I found out that they’re extending my contract for another year and maybe even more, so my excitement was *squashed*.

Now I’m torn between staying at my job or ending it after one year like I planned. The pros of staying would be: I get to reap more from my high pay; I barely have to spend any of my cash because my family takes care of everything; and I would probably not get a salary as good as this if I look for a different job. Basically, I would be able to securely save a lot of money.

The cons would be: My life would stay stagnant, which I’ve found to be not very healthy for me mentally.

537,"I am 13 stone 5ft 6 which makes me technically obese, and my Mother is 12 stone and 2 inches smaller than me. She thinks I am smaller than her, she was literally surprised when I said how heavy I was. I don't know if maybe the weight is just more hidden like in different places (thighs or arms?) or if it's muscle mass because the work I do is very physical i.e heavy lifting. But I am still losing weight and dieting but for some reason she thinks I should stop. Like I can still see the fat on me and I want rid, and that's what I am doing.

 She thinks I am not looking after myself, so does the manager for a different section at work. Not sure what's wrong with losing weight? A lot of people have said how great I look since I started 6 months ago (i've lost over 2 stone since starting), so I am for the most part, happy with my weight loss, except for the few people worried, Is it the rate I am losing it? Maybe they can't see the fat that is obviously there. I am 13 stone for a reason. I wanted to be at least 11 but I don't want my Mum to think that's a bad thing. 

She isn't the type to be jealous and want to be skinnier than me, that isn't it at all, she is genuinely worried. I just don't know why. Any suggestions? I just moved out a couple months ago so she can't see what I am eating but I am for the most part, eating well, even been having fatty foods sometimes!

544,"Hi all, I'm in a weird situation right now..
I met this girl atva party and  we clicked instantly, even though she is older than me by 3+ years. We started talking and we talked until I had to go home. We exchanged numbers, we started to chat. We would get together EVERY weekend and it was always so much fun. We talked about life, shared secrets that nobody knew and got to know each other on a truly personal level.
Because of some family problems, she had to move to another region after a year of our friendship. We promised to each other to stay close because we needed each others. We chatted maybe once or twice a week, sending each other super long voice messages as if we were talking in person. She worked and it never was a problem, because even if she didn't respond to my messages (sometimes for days at a time) when she found the time she would answer me without missing a beat, remembering what I said to her and answering accordingly. She was extremely busy and she would apologize for bot answering me fast enough but I always told her I didn't care, she was working her ass off, I was happy for her. Then we got both busier and started to chat maybe twice a month, which -again- was totally fine. Life happens.
Slowly things started to change. At some point some months ago I started to notice that it was mostly me that started conversations, and most of the time said conversations would end simply because she didn't respond. Didn't even listen to my messages. It would be okay if she would then respond by answering my past messages, but she would just ignore them.. I would listen to her sending me 3 or 4 15 minutes long voice messages, respond and ONLY when she finished talking I would then talk about me and she would humor me for a while and then.. ghost me. 
Theeeen she even stopped doing that. I would start a conversation asking how things were for her, she would unload all of her problems, I would listen and answer and when it was my time to talk, she wouldn't even listen to my messages and just stop. Rinse and repeat.
Now... yes, she has to work. Yes, it's stressful. Yes, she has some problems. We bonded trough those. How come she has time to send me super long messages and talk to me and when the conversation moves to me she is busy?
Should I just stop starting conversations and let things go or should I try and talk to her? We aren't ""high school friends"". We told each other some very fucked up shit. We cried in each other's arms.

Yesterday we were waiting for our managers to finish their work because most of the time they give us a ride home. We started talking and after some time her parents call her and ask why she wasn’t home yet, she explains and jokingly says that they should come by to pick her up her parents say that she is being so disrespectful which was weird but ok, they might just be strict. After some time I’ve noticed that their parents didn’t have an accent, she is Chinese and her accent isn’t very strong, but it is noticeable, so I ask her about it. She says that her parents don’t know Chinese and then tells me that her dad is white and her mom is Chinese. I ask how does she know Chinese then but her parents don’t, because she was born in China. That is when she tells me that she was adopted, and moved to US, she didn’t tell me the exact date but I’m pretty sure that it was in 2015. She then told me that she was adopted because her biological parents were abusive. At this point she was almost crying but denying it. I don’t know how to react I literally just say “Fuck” in shock and then ask her if she was okay she says yes the two times I asked her. At this point our managers are done with their work and I stop talking to her about it because I don’t want our managers to notice and make a fuss, also because I respect her privacy and personal information that has been disclosed with me. Also she mentions that she hates living in America and hates most people because she thinks they are all fake.  And I think she hates her adoptive parents because they are too strict.

548,"Tldr at the end

So it was my 19th birthday and well, it was underwhelming(?)

Good thing was I stayed over at my boyfriend’s place and I woke up next to him and we spent the entire day together (at mine), until it was dinner time. Considering we are both working now (we’re both waiting for university to start and taking part time jobs, but our schedule barely matches. He didn’t have work yesterday, as I managed to take time off last min, so we could both spend more time together), this is actually really rare and I really feel so blessed. 

Not so good things that make me a little upset:

1) I receive a grand total of 4 well wishes, from: my mother, my boyfriend, and 2 friends whom I wasn’t super close to and totally didn’t expect. Don’t get me wrong, I am super happy and touched that they’ve texted me to wish me happy birthday, but like what really got to me was that all my super close(?) friends (or at least I thought we were close enough, like we’ve been close friends for years, go home together after school kind) didn’t say a single thing to me. And I really don’t know how to feel about that. To be honest, even thinking about that now brings me to tears a bit :/

2) after my boyfriend went back home to eat dinner he was going to play mahjong with his friends, and like at first the idea was that I could go to his afterwards to join them so I wouldn’t be alone at home. But then his dad was not home and he didn’t know what time he would be coming back so in the end he told me to just not go. (Back story: his parents don’t exactly like me, and his dad would go into the guest room where they usually play and like talk to his friends a bit, so ideally I shouldn’t be there :/) And I don’t want to call it this, but I guess I am jealous that he’s having fun without me, while I’m home alone, watching bon appetit on YouTube because I’m almost running out of videos to watch. Idk if anyone can give a better explanation yes please. But ya it just sucked a lot

3) it just felt like any other day. It didnt feel like a birthday; it didn’t feel like it was my birthday. Yea I took a day off from work, spent time with my boyfriend, but other than that it just felt like any other day. Like in the past when we were still schooling and I got to spend a full day with my boyfriend. There were no presents, no cakes, no cards, no well wishes. And if I’m terribly honest it feels like crap. Like nobody cared about me. Okay I have to give credit to my boyfriend he was a lot more affectionate (and not always finding things to pick on; or rather somehow I just didn’t make him angry — usually he’s quite short tempered and can turn grumpy quite easily) and I really felt so blessed. But like other than that, it just didn’t feel like it was my birthday. And I feel really so upset :/ but then I’m thinking about it, and I feel a little childish, but I really feel so crappy about my birthday that I just feel like crying right now. 

Honestly I don’t even know why I am here or why I am writing all of this or what I’m looking for. Okay I guess I do want to know, if it was childish of me to think this way and be this upset :3 thanks in advance y’all, much love and appreciates

It seems like nothing is ever her fault. For instance, if I confronted her about her aggressive or commanding tone, she will say she wasn't being aggressive and I am being too sensitive. Fair enough.

554,"I've always had problems on communicating with other people. I would take a lot of time to think for the right word, I would overthink on appereance and if It's okay to go on that route. I've moved in another country a few years ago with my family, my comunications problems skyrocketed. Even in my native language I would trip while talking to find a way to express the interesting things I want to say, but now that I moved is even harder to communicate properly. I don't even have anything interesting to say. 

&amp;#x200B;

I barely can talk with girls, most of my relationship we're online where there I could find the right words, the right topic and think through what I have to say.Where I have studied there weren't many girls either, like 1-2 girls in one class. I had to break up with the girls i was in relationship online. Because it wouldn't work, I wanted free time.I know they had strong feelings for me(I wasn't cheating is just in different points of tim).After that I burried myself into books, light novels, animes.. I would read all day, even where I study, or sometimes at work. And it always hits me how lonely I am, can't even change myself, no matter how much I tried. I tried to go to gym to lose some weight, had to leave it because I had to study and work. Now even if I want to do something I just can't, it feels like theres a big hole and I can't move, so I just stay in home all day when I have free time. I really want to change but I feel like I cant, like I'm a lost cause. I want to go out and meet someone, even If I do it, there is no one who would, and if there is I would have problem on expressing myself. I'm not saying I have some deficit or something like that. Maybe is just anxiety.

 I tried to change by losing weight but everytime something would happen, familiy health problems, school, work and being depressed. While depressed I would eat more than usual, some snacks, and it makes the problem even worse. I don't know what to do. A few months ago I decided to lock this lonely sentiment and keep myself busy with reading and watching but it just opens up that emotion even more.

555,"so as a child i was bullied really badly by this girl (Jia) all through primary and partly through secondary school. she moved schools and i never saw her again until January. we work in the same sector so see each other a lot. about a week ago, one of my coworkers quit and Jia was moved next to me. i never had any closure from my bullying (she left abruptly) and i wasn't sure if she even recognised me. but she did and it was super awkward but i tried to keep it professional. 

one day she pulled me aside and asked if it really was me from all those years ago. i said yes. she got super emotional and apologised to me. i, feeling even more awkward someone was crying, just accepted the apology (i said 'sure, don't worry about it') and i thought that was that. i was partly glad that she apologised and had grown but i did/do not want to be friends with her. 

well Jia didn't think that way and from that day on she kept acting like we had been best friends from birth. i snapped when i heard a conversation while in a toilet cubicle. Jia and another co worker came in and were talking, no biggie. the coworker commented on how close Jia and I had been over these past few weeks and asked for a backstory. Jia says that we had been friends all through high school and how i got her through some tough times with bullies. the coworker was sympathetic and that was that. 

a few hours later i pulled Jia aside and told her i heard everything and i just went nuts at her. it turned into a shouting match. i told me supervisor that i don't feel comfortable with working near Jia because of my past with her.  i went home and came back the next day. Jia had been moved across the room. great. that's all i wanted except now all my coworkers are giving me the cold shoulder because apparently Jia is a 'sweetheart'.

I’m an a relatively beginner lifter. I’m a teenage male who has always been naturally skinny. One of the hardest parts of lifting for me is eating enough. A combination of two problems always gets in my way:

1. I always end up feeling too full. I get nauseous if I try to eat too much in one sitting.It doesn’t even take that much either; I sometimes struggle to finish a hamburger and fries.

2. I have a hard time finding room in my busy schedule to make all of the high calorie foods I need.

My current situation is as follows: I’m a 16-year-old male. I’m 6’0”. I weigh 150 pounds on a good day. I started lifting in July of 2019. I did StrongLifts 5x5. I pretty much stopped in October/November and lost all my gains. I’m back at it again and am back to where I was in September before I stopped. (Sidenote: I didn’t stop because of lack of motivation. I had five after school activities a week and couldn’t drive making it nearly impossible to go to the gym, but I’m back into it again.) My current 5x5 number are as follows: 145 lbs squat, 95 lbs bench press, 205 lbs deadlift, 60 lbs OHP (I know kinda weak), 110 lbs Bend-Over Rows.

I plan on continuing to do 5x5 for at least one more month (probably a couple more). I was just wondering what yalls advice for programs to transition into once I’m finished with 5x5 is. Also when do I know it’s time to transition?

562,"Hello,

For the past couple of years (id say it started getting really bad around the ninth grade, im in my first year of college now) i've been struggling more and more to get things done. It doesn't matter if its studying, doing homework, even doing hobbies such as catching up on episodes of shows i like or practicing drawing, i just can't bring myself to do it.

In the example of studying, i took IGCSE'S and took tuitions, i had 2 years from beginning the syllabus in school to the actual exams, and i just didn't study, barely did any homework, and my performance on school tests kept getting worse and worse. My attention in class was slipping, my mind would wonder more often, and simply the thought of studying made me want to rip my hair out. When the time of the exams came, however, literally the morning of each exam i'd just skim the notes and go into the exam certain that I'd get C's and D's but that's not what happened. The truth is, i got \*great\* grades, and i have no clue how. It makes me angry, because for two years i stressed over not being able to study and spent more time reading articles on how to get motivated and how to actually do work than actually formally studying just to ""revise"" everything in a panic and get good grades, it doesn't feel fair, even to me.

This issue also bleeds into hobbies i like, like i mentioned before, even the process of watching episodes of shows is almost too mentally taxing, it requires too much effort to focus on the plot and when i do watch episodes ( or do other hobby things) i become more aware of the time I'm wasting that i should be using to do more important things, such as studying or chores, etc. This happens even when i have literally nothing else to do, and i am perfectly capable of spending time doing the things i like, i always feel like i don't have time and i should be doing something else, then i waste my entire day watching youtube videos and scrolling through pinterest because its so easy and is mindless enough not to make me feel guilty.

I also work really slowly, whether it be drawing, studying, solving, etc etc. I can plan 2 hours to finish studying a single chapter and the entire day has passes and im barely quarter way through. So no matter what i want to start, I'm afraid of not completed what i want to in the certain amount of time i set for myself and end up doing nothing at all. There are times when i actually set out to do something, but i feel like when i do i cant switch to doing anything else, i have to start it and finish it in the same burst of motivation, because i know that if i put it down im never going to pick it up again, or not with the same amount of passion.

  


I can speak more at length of the things i do and how i basically manipulate myself and never get anything done, or my daydreaming habits that let hours slip by without me noticing, or other dumb things that i hate doing.

I tried doing what articles tell me to, like setting up a schedule or writing down what im thinking or sleeping early or drinking more water or breaking down things into small chunks, etc etc. But none of it works.

I don't really know what to do anymore, i hate wasting my time and stressing about it. Any advice on what i should do? Thanks",08Feb2020,1

565,"I have never had anything close to a survival instinct. I'm not suicidal I just see life and death as equally valid and if life gets worse than neutral, I'd switch. Someone mentioned conscription and I said if I was forced into the army I'd probably just suicide and everyone looked at me like I was insane.

Again, I'm not suicidal, but if life sucks and you'd rate it negatively, why not just switch to death and have 0 pros or cons.",08Feb2020,1
566,"I sometimes like to frequent anonymous chat rooms. I recently met a woman who I hope to God is fake. She said she was 17, a single mother, and worked for celebrities like Justin Bieber and Billie Eilish. She said she was constantly guarded by 100s of guards, but that she had escaped by breaking a window. Then she ran to the beach to visit a friend who drowned at 6:43 PM on a Valentine's Day. After saying she was suicidal, I decided to try to help. Aftet I said the wrong thing, she started crying blood, apparently.

The next morning, I said goodbye to her and deleted the app because it was a major trigger warning for me. I couldn't stop thinking about her, so I logged on later on to check on her. She, again, said that she was fine now and actually encouraged me to delete the app. I informed the app administrator of the situation and deleted the app, but I still can't stop thinking about her, so I keep obsessively redownloading it and checking on her, and I've noticed that she hasn't logged into the app in a few days. I am very worried. 

What I want to know is, what are the chances that this person is fake or a troll? If she's not, is there anything else I can do?",08Feb2020,1
567,"For the last few years, I have experienced living hell in terms of my life. I have struggled a the anxiety and panic attacks since I was 8 years old and college put things into overdrive. With all of these school shootings, instances of police brutality, heated debates over controversial issues, conspiracy theories, data breaches, news media organizations spreading questionable or even inaccurate information only to dismiss any responsibility for their actions, whistleblowers calling out corrupt and oppressive governments on their b*******, religious people using their faith as an excuse to be hateful, bigoted, or pseudoscientific, and individuals of authority and academia and healthcare utilizing their power and authority to spew controversial ideas onto the minds of patients, employees, and students as absolute fact.

It has come to the point where I have difficulty trusting anyone, even people of authority that I thought I can trust. Even people such as my doctor, my mom, my girlfriend, and my bishop at church are difficult to trust at times because I feel that they are acting out of ulterior motives and care more about their selfish desires than altruistic desires to help humanity.

I get it that humans are not infallible. But I feel like I have to be very distrustful and skeptical of everyone to prevent myself from being hurt. I have heard horror stories online of people having their lives ended or permanently ruined by the acts of manipulative and naive people who claim to be sources of authority.

I don't know who to trust. On one hand, strangers on the internet say that you should not trust loved ones nor sources of authority, which include doctors, police officers, instructors, etc. because they don't really care about you even if they claim it. They cite the *Appeal to Authority* fallacy. On the other hand, The people who I can see in real life tell me that ""you should take what individuals say online with a grain of salt because while some information online can be true, other information online can also be false"". But that doesn't really help my situation much. 

Some of these questionable organizations mix inaccurate information with accurate information to make their claims seem more plausible to their audience. Anywho, this is not doing good for my mental health. I want to move on in the past and enjoy life again like I used to before college. I don't know what to do in terms of who to trust. Trump calls CNN ""fake news"", CNN counters that claim only to get into hot water for using their website to spew medical misinformation and conspiracy theories for revenue.

This is all so overwhelming. I cannot trust anyone. Trustworthy sources make mistakes, the fringe groups online say that they cannot be trusted. Please help.",08Feb2020,1
568,"I’ve had a strained relationship with a friend for a while and most recently had a heated argument where I felt really hurt and feel like it’s the last straw. 

On top of them not caring much about what’s going 
on in other people’s lives, they also make super questionable life choices and like, there’s only so much you can listen to someones drama while getting nothing back right? 

Anyway I’ve been distant a while which makes it awkward for the friend group as we are close. Friend in question has asked about my distance and I said I’m still not over how much I was hurt in the last row but I have made some effort recently. 

I also hear a lot from another friend about how friend in question is acting towards them especially when they are having their own problems (not caring, being dismissive, would rather talk about their own problems) which reignites my annoyance towards them but my question is, do I just let the distance go on and on until we eventually just stop talking or make an effort to say I just don’t feel like it’s a positive relationship for me any more and I wanna cut ties?

Hi, i needed advice from a ‘new’ perspective. 
I have to be honest, i am not really good at expressing myself so if this is a tad bit confusing i am so sorry you can ask questions in the comments and i’ll try my best to elaborate. English is not my first language, so i am sorry about grammar errors. There’s a lot of incidents that happened that can explain maybe better the situation but i don’t feel like writing a 1000 page book.
Also, relevant to the story, i never lie, never did and i’m not certainly gonna start now.

So, the first part of my life starts at my birth and finishes at me being 19 (female). My father has always been abusive (verbally, emotionally, physically,..) my entire life. I honestly can’t recall of even a week in which i didn’t have to endure his shit. I am talking about broken bones, locked away in a room, insults of every genre. Seems simplistic if i say it this way but i couldn’t go to school because of this. I’ve been beaten at 4, at 10, at every age, really. Now, the excuse was i needed discipline, rules, and all this was out of love. Mind you, in order to provoke my punishment i would only ask a question like ‘why can’t i have ice cream’ or ‘what does that mean’ or whatever; or sometimes i just ate food wrong or i was just breathing. I couldn’t do anything, not go out, not speak if it wasn’t something he would approve of and so on. Still, this didn’t break me. During all this years, my mother never protected me, every time i took a beating, she would just come over and say that i deserved it, maybe spit on my face. As i got older she decided that she wouldn’t pay for my living so i had to get a job (as a babysitter at first) at 11; i paid my part of rent, my part of food, my part of bills, everything.You know, the usual. If my little brother or sister did anything wrong, it would be automatically my fault. They never had to do anything, just living the best of their lives
Still, i didn’t break. I thought that one day i would be rewarded for enduring this and at 18 i would just move and start over.
But alas, life didn’t want to make things simple. 
Even though when starting to get older i became kinda braver and fought back at my parents i still needed something to distract myself. I wanted to make friends. Oddly enough, i seemed to attract the wrong people. I’ve been insulted, humiliated, shoved, excluded and ridiculized. When i started high school i thought that that would be a fresh start. I met new people, and a group of friends was formed. Honestly, it was nice at first. It was only nice when we were drunk as sh*t, high as fu*k and only if we talked about superficial matters though. And i, very emotionally unstable and needing an outlet for all the crap i had to go through, didn’t really feel okay with this. It wasn’t that simple though. I started noticing things: they would talk behind my back insulting me to other people, if anyone else in the group had a problem everyone would go running and help, but not with me, i wrote countless times on the group chat if anyone was down to talk and help me with some advice but never had an answer (it was like seen, ignored and then would start a new conversation between them), if one of them knew that i had a maybe kinda bad day i would see literally them fleeing upon at my arrival at the place (we went to the same high school). Very much other stuff happened. I started becoming suicidal. At first it was probably just attention, i tried to explain why their actions fuckin hurt so much and why i hoped they would just change their attitude and help me out. We were on vacation and that night i didn’t feel good, i was like attacked and insulted by all of them at once (group of 10 people), took 40 sleeping pills, they found me vomiting at the hotel the next morning and avoided me like i was the plague, like i did something wrong. That day, five years ago, is the day i actually died inside. See, up until then, i still had hope, i really wanted to live and i thought i still had a chance to get better. But something that day changed, like my fake bubble of positivity exploded and reality just fuckin smacked me in the face. After coming home from the worst vacation of my life i had a huge fight with my father over probably some stupid things and i cut my wrists in front of him. He laughed at me saying how i couldn’t even kill myself properly. The rest of my family was just standing three meters away, pretending that nothing was happening. I left that night. I stayed at a hotel and after some weeks i was put in an apartment for kids at risk while finishing my last year of high school. I didn’t have no one really at that point. Since then (5 years ago) i attempted suicide 8 times. The last time was the worst: i actually died, came back and stayed at ICU for 4 months. I was really sick. And i made the really grave mistake to come back home and try to recover with the help of my family (i only went back because my father retired and went back to our origin country, so i knew i wouldn’t see him). I didn’t see them for a lot, they also came and picked me from the hospital (it was 6 hours away from their home). I don’t actually know why the hell i made that stupid choice, like all the things they did to me were cancelled by the fact that they had come to pick me up. I wasn’t better, i was severely depressed, so suicidal that i couldn’t touch anything without thinking how to kill myself with that said object, i probably have borderline disorder (my psychiatrist won’t diagnose me), and evidently am not really stable. This brings to the last 7 months in which i came home. It all started small: like why don’t you start a diet and go running (thanks mom for the eating disorder) or wash the dishes (i am the only one who has to do it, my brother is 23 and can’t make his own bed, but my mom does it from him because he’s tired from clubbing al night. For me it wouldnt ever be a problem doing chores if she just wouldnt be such a bitch about it and hypocritical). Then it became like ‘you do nothing, claiming you’re depressed when you could just go for a walk and clear your mind. Then she would ask for the gas money back from the time they came to pick me up at the hospital. And so on.
Now, i said earlier that at a certain point i started to fight back (i can say with 100% certainty that i never started shit), that led to me being insulted more because i hit my mother back, i shoved back my father and insulted my siblings for sitting there and watch. Now, all this is already enough to deal with. What i’m losing my mind over is the gaslighting. All this shit could have been easier without the gaslighting. I swear to god, my blood is on the walls of my old room (i never cleaned it) and they claim that i am fucking crazy and invented this shit, that if there were times that i have been hit, it was because i deserved it, and if it was really all that bad, then why the hell am i still alive. I opened my head open for banging my head on the walls because i am going crazy. I don’t know if i can take it anymore. I’m scared i’m gonna hurt somebody because i don’t have any more ways for suicide (its not easy to get a gun in Switzerland, there isn’t really poisonous plants here and sleeping pills have little to none effects on me). I honestly don’t know what to do anymore. Please help me.",08Feb2020,1

Not to excuse it. 2 weeks ago she was triggered and she shut down hard and was threatening to cheat on me and all this shit. So i broke up with her. She couldn't believe it at first. She started going to therapy 3 times a week. I went back for some stuff at her house and we ended up sleeping together. We watched porn together which was something i never thought would happen because of her jealous tendencies. The watching porn was awkward but i was impressed she did it and i her back. Shes been great so far. No shut downs. Its been about a week. But i still have some resentment about what she said during her last shut down and some of the ones before that.

575,"Hi,

I (23/m) currently work as a forklift driver for a small furniture company. Because of certain circumstances I couldn’t go to post secondary after high school despite good grades. My first job was an electrical device assembler making $40k which my father gave me. Despite the money being good, I dreaded work. My manager would constantly harass me about my performance, I would usually be the fall guy for the mismanagement of others and was told that I wasn’t very smart by another higher up (a comment I took really to heart). I quit that job to go to the job I am doing right now. My current workplace is much more pleasant and more relaxed. My manager is very soft spoken and a considerate person that makes sure his employees are happy. The only issue is that am only make $30k here and I have large expenses coming up with me moving out to live with my fiancée, saving money for a wedding and paying for classes to learn IT and programming (a passion I had)

I am thinking of looking for a new job but I fear that I will get a job like my $40k job. My current employer has said they will give me a raise but may only be $500-$1000 more annual. I am afraid that if I get a new job, I will dread it and regret my decision to leave.",08Feb2020,1
576,"(England) Hi all,

I (21F) resigned from a job on 13/12/29 at 1pm. I handed in a week’s notice but they told me to leave, meaning I worked 36 hours in my final week.

At the job I got paid weekly, but I still have not been paid for my that week. Yesterday I received a payslip for £169 stating “3.25 @ £52.20 per hour” on the date that I should’ve been paid for my last week. I used to make £341 for 40 hours, so I’m confused.

In my three months at the company I didn’t have any time off and I don’t owe them any money, so I can’t think of any deductions they could have made. My coworker who started and left on the same dates as me has received the same payslip, so I don’t think it’s a mistake.

I have asked them to explain how they calculated it and I am waiting to hear back. I am also still waiting to actually receive the money, it is 7 weeks late. What should my next step be? TIA

582,"I've recently started going to therapy on the premise of loneliness and suspected social anxiety. I've always known that this doesn't completely describe the problem I'm having and she basically confirmed that. We're doing some sessions of figuring out where the exact problem lies and last Thursday was the third time. I honestly think she's asking the right questions and I also think that even just discovering some of these things about myself helps me a lot while we're not really attempting to solve them yet. She's made me open up about things I'd never have considered opening up about otherwise. However the thing is that I don't really like her as a person. I can't even really put into words why, I'm just not vibing with her at all. I'm not uncomfortable necessarily but I know I could be way more comfortable with someone else. I really don't enjoy going there. The real question is: do I really need to be comfortable if it's working? If I'm getting the results that I want? I suppose the answer is no, but it might ruin therapy for me forever. I might just choose to call it quits after she's given me an official diagnosis and never try again. And there are lots of reasons to just stay. It would probably take a while before I can get a spot with someone else (even in the same institution) and then I'd have to go through the entire process of getting them to know me, only to have a *chance*, not a guarantee, that this new person may be better than what I have now.

583,"I'm REALLY BAD AT CONFRONTATION and I could never bring this up to his face.

I've known this boy for a few years now, and from what I remember he always had this weird smell that I can't describe, sometimes stronger than other times. It's not like a BO or ""sweaty"" kind of smell at all. I guess if I really had to compare it to SOMETHING, I would say I kind of react to it the same way I do to some sort of strong chemical cleaner smell where I just can't keep breathing it in and sometimes makes me a bit nauseous - but it's a bit different.

He has long hair and some facial hair and one of my theories is that maybe he doesn't properly wash his hair or face. And I have that theory because even when we cuddle and he breathes out at me THROUGH HIS NOSE, the smell comes wafting at me and sometimes makes me a little sick.

One time we went on a roadtrip somewhere and the many-hour long car ride was making things worse. When we arrived to our destination and went for a walk, I couldn't walk beside him because the smell was wafting at me and making me a little sick. I had to walk a bit behind and pretend I'm just tired and taking in the scenery. I think I also remember it wasn't totally gone even after he showered.

Does anyone have any idea WHAT THIS COULD BE or maybe knows someone who kind of had this? We just recently started being more than friends and sometimes the smell gets to me a lot and ruins everything for me, and makes me wonder if I should just look for a new boy friend instead.

587,"I’m gonna start off by saying this is long, but there will be a TL:DR at the end. (For the record I am male)

This gets repetitive so I’m going to refer to said friend as PF (problematic friend)

Okay, so me and PF have been best friends for just over a year and a half and we met at college. Last year I didn’t really click with anyone else in our class so I hung out with her all the time and that’s how our friendship started, however a lot has changed this year since we started in September.

So this year, I made a whole bunch of new friends and I finally had more than one friend and started hanging out with them slightly less but still a good amount than how much I hung out with PF. (I was staying hers almost every weekend which began to put a strain on our friendship) but it all kicked off in November when I was speaking to one of my new friends, and PF turned round out of the blue and said “shut the fuck up you’re being so loud” 

Now, she wasn’t being loud and I told her to chill and it wasn’t a big deal. She kept quiet and for the rest of class it was fine. But this caused a separation between her and my new friends. Since then, she has talked shit about them constantly, dislikes them for no reason, and hates seeing me hang out with them.

It got to the point where complained if I hung out with them for more than 5 minutes because I was “abandoning her” and all this crap, so to make her happy and my life easier I told her that during school hours, I would only hang out with them at our breaks. This was fine for a bit and it worked out, even if it was at the expense of my own happiness and my own friendships. 

As me and my new friends grew closer she got more and more jealous. She talked shit almost every day and I told my new friends and they had a huge fight.

She apologised - kinda (more on that later) and all was good. Except she kept doing it, and kept apologising. Over and over and over. Her apologies however are completely meaningless.

whenever I tried and go hang out with the new friends, PF would cry, complain and tell me I couldn’t and that if I did I would yet again be abandoning her and leaving her by herself. I complied and stopped hanging out aside for a few chats in class - which also pissed her off.

So, Christmas came around and my new friends wanted a new slate for the new year after the break and told PF that if she would drop the whole thing then they could get along and everyone could be friends. She agreed. I’m sure you can tell where this is going.

Again, she was back at her shit. By this point me and my new friends were close and I began hanging with them again and she started to talk shit again and again. Over and over she was given chances to make amends. Now she is left with no friends aside from me.

Every time I talked to one of them, PF would shoot me dirty looks, every time I laughed at their jokes she would complain and sulk and say “it’s unfair that you laugh harder at their jokes than you do at mine” to which I said “I guess it’s because they appeal to my sense of humour more” which ENRAGED her. To this day, whenever I laugh at one of PF’s jokes she pulls some crap like “wow I thought I wasn’t funny” or “I’m not funny enough” or some crap.

She would tell me I can’t hang out with them and that she felt left out of everything. I reminded her that I spend all of class time with her and spend every 3rd weekend at her house. And that I am allowed to talk to other people wether she likes it or not.

She complained and said “it used to be just us idk why you’re changing” and again I reminded her that it’s because last year I didn’t click with anyone else. She cried for two hours because she took that as “I only hung out with her because there was nobody else” which wasn’t the case AT ALL.

She is a compulsive liar. She lies about everything from what she had for dinner to where she got a piece of clothing, manipulates me, all her apologies are self centred and have a “but”. “I’m sorry but “ “I know I’m in the wrong BUT” And she always manages to make everyone the bad guy and victimise herself.

She talks shit, she cries at everything I do from talking to other people to making a small comment that she blows out of proportion, and she tries to control me and who I hang out with.

Last week I told her that she’s on her last chance. I said I was done keeping her happy at my own expense at that from that point onward, I would begin to talk and hang with my mates whenever I felt like it because I was done walking on eggshells and having my mental health be in the drain because of the constant stress of being around her. If she does it one more time our friendship is done.

It’s mostly stopped but I still see her sulking and crying and shit when she thinks I’m not looking and sometimes I really wanna have a mental breakdown because the constant shit I have to deal with. It isn’t fair no me or my friends anymore. But at the same time I don’t wanna stop being her friend because I genuinely care about her and our friendship but I don’t know how to get her to stop being a crazy, selfish, possessive, jealous bitch.

Please help me. I don’t know what to say or how to approach it anymore without her crying.

588,"I've done quite a few activities, but I can never be fully immersed in them and then I get bored of them.

I also play soccer. I was fine in the beginning of the year, but over the course of this year, I've gotten tired of it. I used to love it, but now I don't try. I know that I need to try and that I should try, but I just can't force myself to. 

Another example: math. I've always been pretty good at math, so near the end of 8th grade, I started to do competition math. I was doing good in the beginning, however I've gotten bored of that too. I think that as the problems get harder and I do worse, I lose interest because I can't do well. Sorry if this post feels too rant-y.

I'm not sure if this is related, but I always find myself exhausted. Some of that might be because I give myself half an hour at night to just look at my phone and watch videos. Sometimes that half hour gets longer because I just can't make myself put down the phone.

Anyways, how can I get myself more interested in everything I do? Most stuff that I do right now I love but I just can't find motivation to do it good?

tl;dr I'm not motivated in anything I do and I get bored of stuff easily. How do I change this?",08Feb2020,1

591,"I moved to California a year ago for work. I love my job, I love my routine here, I love the weather, and I think California is beautiful. 

However, I have no friends here. I've really tried to make friends - I've been to lots of different meetups consistently, I've tried to be more talkative with people at work - but none of it seems to be working. Making friends after college is ridiculously hard. 

I've also moved around a lot in the past and have had to make friends in new places, and it has always taken a lot of energy and I've been depressed. I'm trying to overcome that again but a part of me keeps thinking ""Great, you'll have to start over with new people for the 4th time in the past 5 years"". And i keep wondering if thats worth it.

A large number of my friends have moved to Seattle. I'm in touch with them and I visit them every 3 months and they visit me when they can. I'm thinking of moving to Seattle to be closer to them and nurturing those existing friendships instead of forming new ones.

But that means giving up on the good things I have here, especially the career growth. I could find a job in Seattle and it would be fine, but California is the place to be for my career. I'd say my career would move maybe 25-30% faster if I stayed here. I'd get paid the same in Seattle though. 

I also keep having moments of self doubt where I think should I be attaching so much importance to my friends, to the point where I would move for them? Would they do the same for me (probably not, but thats because they have partners and jobs that are not that easy to find in other places)?

tl;dr - my life is good but i have no friends and want to move closer to existing friends but that would mean being 25-30% slower in terms of career growth and I'm not sure if they would do the same for me",08Feb2020,1
592,"We've been together for almost a year and a half, we are both sophomores and I'm older by a month, but that's not the point, we started off great, talked for hours and never really ran out of conversation, we were both very open with each other and we both had our first time with each other, if you get what I mean, if you don't, we both lost our virginities to each other. Things were really great, always hung out, parents loved her and her family and vice versa, I feel like everything was perfect, and now for about 1 month she's been, distant, but then she's not? It's like she's on and off, we used to text constantly, and now there's a day where I don't get any replies, 1 or 2 if I'm lucky, then there are days where shes just texting non stop, when we used to hang out before all this me and her would have so much fun, goofing around and laughing for hours, now all she does when she comes over or vice versa is go on her phone and kind of ignore me, and then there are days when we have alot of fun, when we used to stay the night at each other's places  (we are lucky that both of our family is really accepting and doesn't mind) we used to watch horror movies, eat alot of food and later in the night we would do the deed, which wasn't an everyday thing since we couldn't spend the night at each other's house every day, I'd say only 3 or 4 times a week, now when our sleepovers happen one day she just goes to sleep, no movies or popcorn or sex, and the next day she throws herself on me. Please don't get me wrong this is not about sex, at all, I'm just trying to explain what is going on, and I feel like her behavior has a pattern? To simplify it's like Monday: ignore boyfriend Tuesday: love boyfriend Wednesday: ignore boyfriend etc you get me? And it makes me feel very shit because it's confusing me and my feelings, when she does this I feel unwanted and shit, and when she's acting normal I feel like I'm being used. I don't understand why she is doing this, I confronted her about it and she tries to change the subject. I also told her how she seems to have changed and it's confusing me, all she said was I'm sorry.   Right now she's in an ignore phase, and all this leads me to overthinking, does she not like me anymore? Did I do something wrong? Has she found another guy that she's into? And the thing is, all of this ""change"" happened in a sudden, from a Sunday to Monday she changed and all of this started happening a month ago, have I done something wrong?

593,"Me and my friend (Who I’ll call “K”) are both in high school. Both of our families are really religious, but me and K do not believe in God. We can never tell them this.

Me and K have both been through a lot with our families, but yesterday K’s phone was secretly taken away. His mom went through everything (which she does a lot) but this time it may have been the last straw.

He saw that girls were following him, He was using bad language, and listening to explicit music. 

K’s whole family is freaking out. His older siblings are telling him to “stay on the right path”. His Mom is scared her little boy is becoming into the devil.

She also probably saw me and K’s conversation, which was just memes and music really. She will probably tell my parents, who will kill me, but more importantly (I’m a good friend :), I have no clue what she’ll do to K. At one point she even said she was thinking about sending him to Saudi Arabia so he can become more religious.

I remember being terrified, I wouldn't shower for days when it was on, my Mom would say why are you scared, my mom didn't mind me showering for a few days, because where I live it is cold most of the year, my parents had me at an older age, so me showering was a lower concern. When I showered I had to look sideways and close my eyes because I refused to look. I was probably 8 and I told my mom I was really scared and then she took it down. Maybe a year or two later she put it back, and when I skipped two or three days of showering I told her that I was still scared, I preteneded not to be, but it was almost immposible, and she then removed it again. I did a mistake y telling my friends in elementary and middle school that I was scared, so they would trick me and show me photos and videos of whales, I'm scared of all types of whales, and when the water background is blue, black, green. To make matters worse I remember we had to do an assignment on Tilikum the Orca from Sea World a few years ago, for school.

This is definitely the lost we have ever been and you know the worst part of it that on the times where we were down, we would have the unconditional love from our dog. No matter what our situation was, he would be there with warm cuddles, loving licks, and the beautiful misdirected looks and smiles (he was blind but he did his best). 



The advice that I'm asking for is an answer to this question.

601,"Bit of backstory

* Family owned building material and farm supply store hired me on back in April.
* Family who owns it was outed by investors and some rich construction guys 
* These guys have no store experience and are doing their best to manage it. (Not that successfully) 
* Since my hire date in April, we have lost around 10 employees (A lot for a small business)

Quite a few people were fired for various reasons at the start, a couple quit, then winter came and apparently that's the slow season. Since then they've laid off a number of people and have dumped their responsibilities and work-load onto the remaining people with no intention of hiring anyone else unless absolutely necessary. Among them were people that were hired on with a much higher base pay. We know this cause those people have left and simply told us. We also had an assistant manager who quit and divulged all of us with pay rates. Since then we've talked amongst ourselves and pretty much no employee is happy with the way things are going. 

Now we have yet another 2 people leaving. The workload that they've accumulated is being passed down along with the big bosses claim that they want people cross-trained some more and for things to remain going smoothly. We're already falling behind on certain things like putting out inventory, re-doing isles and cleaning up the store. And when things pick up in the warmer weather, we're really going to fall behind. I'm in a small town in the South and there's not TOO many places to work, and to be honest, I kinda like working here. But the pay is so bad it's really getting to be frustrating. I've got kids in McDonalds and KFC making more money than me.

605,"I was regularly groped and assaulted by my next door neighbor in middle school over the course of two years, and I never said a word about it until I turned twenty. I went to counseling, I thought I was over it. I told myself the next time it happened, I would take control of the situation and say something. A year later, I was groped on a plane ride. I woke up to the man in the seat next to me with his hand on my chest. I didn't say anything. I turned away from him and covered up with a blanket. I kept it together, but I couldn't bring myself to say anything or make a scene or ask to be moved. I went back to counseling, I taught myself to get angry, to respond when I saw someone treat another person with the same lack of respect I was shown. I have no problem defending other women. I thought I would be able to do the same for myself if it happened again, though I prayed it wouldn't. But it did. It happened again today.

Literally like an hour ago, I was in line at a starbucks and the man in line next to me groped me from behind. I didn't say anything, I just got out of line and left the building on the verge of tears. I'm so frustrated with myself. Why am I unable to say something when it happens to me? Why does it KEEP happening to me? Do I just look like some vulnerable, defenseless girl?

Earlier today, we were at another friend’s house for dinner and since I’m always the one who’s the slowest at eating, I was really surprised and glad I finished first. Once I said “Wow I cant believe I’m first!”, C said that it was because I’m fat. I just shook it off because I thought he didn’t mean it. Then we played the sims together, my character kept swimming and C said “wow that isn’t you, you don’t exercise”, then he said something like “ohhh you don’t even have abs”. He’s right but what he said really hurt me since I’m really insecure about my body even though I know I’m not fat.

618,"So a little background on the guy kicking the bucket.

My wife’s step grandpa turned out to be her actual dad after we did some DNA tests last year because of some odd relationships we found on ancestry.com. And my wife’s biological mom after a year of therapy admitted she was raped by this man 35 years ago. And just all the shit my wife went through growing up dealing with feeling out of place. The man is a monster.

My situation:

So now he is passing and I awkwardly feel glad. I hate the guy and most of my wife’s now biological half siblings. There is a lot I could unpack here but I will try keep it on the fundamental problem. My wife and kids are upset with the news he is passing. 

For my wife it is all the unresolved conflict and dealing with the realization of how she was conceived. She grew up with this man thinking he is this knight in shining armor that saved her from her crazy biological mom (now we know she was abused and repressed this horrific event) and thinking her biological father was some mystery guy. 

My oldest kid is old enough to understand what is going on to some extent so she is sad he is passing which I understand.

The problem I have is I don’t want to see the guy or my wife’s family. But if my kids want to say goodbye to this guy I don’t want to be the bad guy and prevent them from doing this. And when he does die I don’t want to go to his funeral... his body shouldn’t even be allowed in a church. The man hasn’t admitted a single wrong doing.

So do I stand with my wife and kids when they say their goodbyes? Do I let others know he is a monster? I feel it’s probably not my place but the situation is something I have never dealt with and don’t know anyone that has gone through a similar situation.

619,"I think maximizing the world's wisdom and love are the two highest goals of life, the former more important than the latter.

If a person does not have enough wisdom, he cannot have a true understanding of the world, this creating false impressions and belief. This is really bad because knowing the big game we are in is the basic responsibility of playing the game. Without knowing enough, we make decisions that are not really chosen by ourselves.

If a person does not have enough love, he will become cold and harsh. He can make judgements with wisdom, but even if he is the most wise man in judging pros and cons, he will hurt a lot of others' feelings. This is also really bad because people will become hostile with one another, creating conflict, which is not beneficial to improving the world.

I will choose wisdom over love, which means I don't have mercy to someone who were to deceive me. Having a complete and correct control of choice is what I have to achieve, and being deceived is the complete opposite. This also means that I will pursue wisdom even if that pulls me further with others in different relationships, and cutting ties with friends if we aren't mutually growing together.",08Feb2020,1

Long story short, essentially both of my glutes are dormant, one of them has chronically been weak. as a result of this my shoulders are rolled forward and my head falls forward, i get self conscious and anxiety going out in public now. i know people stare at me all the time and not in a good way. i wasn't put to play sports as a younging and spent alot of time on the computer in a weird position. i didn't know the damage i was doing to my body i was ignorant and young.

 i missed the deadline to drop classes without receiving a W in my transcript. i can still drop the classes, but i haven't spoken to academic adviser how this would affect my school. glute bridges, clam shells monster walks just don't work on getting my glutes to fire. i've gone to pt and all they recommend is literally those things i've done at home. i know the glutes inactive cause my big toe is not able to grip the ground, i want to workout, but everything will just hurt me, si joint or my knees which indicates that once again my glutes aren't on. my spiral line is out of wack giving me winging scapula. i can't outrun this. i can't stretch my chest at all, no pec minor or major. i can't even sleep properly, cause of my levator and uppertraps forcing me to be a chest breather. my neck KILLS me the only time i get SOME relief is just by looking all the way up to the sky. i've honestly been suicidal and can't seem to get them to fire again i just wanna be happy again.

628,"so i'm in my mid 20's and last year was a very tough year for me... 

anyways i began a new job last year and there was this girl my age who seemed really cool and seemingly showed some interest in me... was often flirty towards me.

after a few solid conversations at work, i asked her to get coffee sometime and she politely declined... 

I also took her number down, we had some good texting conversations and realized we had lots in common...

long story short, about two months later just abruptly told her that I am drawn to her and want a relationship with her...

looking back, I am absolutely ashamed and baffled that I even said such a thing... it was the toughest time of my life, and I guess I just let my impatience and situation get the best of me.

she told me she doesn't feel the same way, in the weeks that followed I then apologized, she wasn't mad just put off by what i said.

anyways, since then things were, as you could imagine, awkward at work... 

She went from being casual and even playful flirty towards me (and all guys really), to being very reserved...

it's been eight months, and she still is quite reserved. 

nonetheless I have been very respectful of her/her space.

just today I happened to be in the break room while she was there, nobody else in there, and I politely walked up to her and told her i sent her an apology to her email.

she seemed very serious when I said this, and after saying this i politely walked away and said ""have a good day"". 

turns out, she didn't even respond to my email... it was just a simple apology, showing awareness and accountability for my foolish overwhelming text messages. 

there was no ulterior motive of me asking her to hang out, have a second chance etc... it was merely a heartfelt, brief apology.

She's seen me show respect for eight months, respecting her/her space at work...

Meanwhile I bought myself and my brother both a new account, second hand, payment went well, changed the passwords, then emailadresses, then passwords again and another set of new emailadresses. Now, three weeks later I received an email from mojang on both emailadresses, stating the account has been set back to its original emailadress without furthur questioning of Mojang and the passwords and names have been changed. I also have been blocked by the seller and basically I'm scammed now.

637,"(22M) I still live at home as a deal with my parents so that I can go to college without having to take out loans to pay for housing and such. We split my tuition with the money I save and the money they have saved for me. The deal is based on that I continue to do family activities, and go to church with them, and help out with driving siblings if needed ( I have 4 younger so after school activities can get hectic). 

About a year ago I met my girlfriend and after a while of dating she asked if I want to smoke weed with her and her roommates. I said sure as I was legally allowed to (I live in Colorado) and this I started smoking. There was one occasion that the rest of my family were gone on a vacation and I stayed home to watch the dog and still go to work, and one of my other friends came over and smoked a pipe in our garage, though I didn't smoke with him, but he accidentally left the pipe in there. They found it out there before I could grab it and they had an intervention type talk and I said that I didn't smoke in the house, which is true, though I never admitted I smoked on a regular basis. 

Que to this morning and I have a note from my dad slid under my door saying that they know I never stopped smoking after that and he feels like he has failed, but he wants to address it. He says that him and my mom want to ""understand my motive, provide necessary help and find a way to move forward together."" 

I know that they don't approve of usage, but I have kept my grades steady, I have held my job for years, I have paid my share of tuition that we agreed upon, I go to all my classes, and I help with things when they ask, which were most of the things they believe stoners can't do. How do I explain that while I understand their concern, it is basically my way of relaxing at the end of the day and I have never been reliant/addicted, and that it is not going to ruin my life like they say it will? I love my parents and I want to stay close with them, but I think that they are wrong and I don't want to be bullied into agreeing to do what they say to get them off my back, then disregarding it because I don't believe it.",08Feb2020,1

639,"Some back ground information: When my sister (37) and me (34) were younger about 10ish years ago, my parents divorced. My Father remarried. Yesterday, my father and his wife passed away in a car accident. The house that they shared together was solely in my Father's name. He also listed both my sister and I as sole beneficiaries after he passed and instructed us to sell the house. Because his wife also passed, her children from another marriage are also involved (they are 19 and 22) they were never adopted by my father. I have no idea what I should do. We can't get in touch with his job (they aren't open on the weekend) so we can contact life insurance, therefore I don't think we can start making funeral arrangements. The children of his wife are unable to meet us at his house ( we don't have a key, they do) until tomorrow so we aren't able to search for any documents that could help us. They insisted on being there while we search because they need the same documents for their mother ( I don't want to go into too much detail but her kids have a valid reason as to why they can't be at the house until tomorrow). Everyone is grieving. I have never dealt with anything like this before as fortunately my mother and my wife are very much still alive. Do we need a lawyer? What's the first step that we take? How do we deal with going to the house and finding documents, etc? I'm at a loss. And having to deal with all of this and grieve is mixing up my mind. I'm also worried about my job.

642,"For context, my dad is 50 years old and was born in Southeast Asia and came here to the US about 25 years ago. He works at a big automobile company and has been doing so for 20ish years now. He's overall a pretty ok dad. Never been abusive or anything but he is a bit narcisstic and overbearing but nothing to write home about. For the past 6 months or so he's developed pretty bad stress and anxiety and paranoia. He's somehow created delusions that there's a secret plot at his work against him and that his phones (work and personal) and laptop are both tapped and being monitored. It got pretty bad a couple months ago so my mom took him to the ER to get him some meds and a therapist. But in the past week it got back to his worst point and it seems like the meds aren't working. We keep trying to get him to call for a new therapist and get maybe new medication but he believes that all the therapists and psychatrists are out to hurt him and are all working with his company and part of some large conspiracy plot. Whenever we try to confront him about it he just talks around in circles for hours never getting to the points that actually need addressing and he just wants to kind of ignore any type of help. His own solution is that he wants to ask management at his work to switch departments and that'll automatically help everything since he's just ""stressed out"" and a change of scenery will help. Keep in mind in December he took about 3 weeks off so he could relax and destress but ever since he returned to work everything came back. The delusions he's having are super nonsensical and he'll tie together the weirdest happenings and somehow think it's proof that his phone is hacked. We want to take him to the ER again but he freaks out everytime we mention it and thinks that if we just give him some time he'll be fine again. Sorry for the long post but

644,"I am 31/M. I lived in the northwest suburbs of Chicago my entire life..

There is just nothing to do out here.  A lot of my friends drifted off or moved.

The last 10 years have just been me going to school or work and then coming home and sitting around alone because I didn't know what else to do.

I've always felt my location was a major hindrance.  Everything is far away.  Gotta drive far to get to anything remotely interesting and parking always sucks.  CTA takes 45 minutes to get to the loop, and then even more time to get anywhere else from there.

Dating and meeting people has been abysmal out here.  On all the dating apps I see everything is 15-20 miles away in the city.  When you match with someone and they live in the city, as soon as they find out where you live, it's over.

I feel like I need to move to where there are more people my age, and I have more opportunity.

I am a software developer and am looking to switch jobs currently. If I am successful I will be making around $120-125k a year.

 I like the idea of being where all the train and CTA lines converge, where I don't need to have a car and can get to most places by public transit.

I can imagine dating being much easier.  Setting a low mile radius and people being walking distance makes for spontaneous dates being easier.

Even if this is only for 1 year, I feel like if I don't do it, I will have regret the rest of my life.

Money for rent isn't too much of a concern, I feel like I can make anywhere up to $2400-2500 work.  I want the experience more than anything. Even if it's a short time.

Am I being stupid with all of this?

645,"I’m going to start by saying I’m 20 years old now and this is the first time the thought has occurred to me. I’ve been doing a lot of thinking about this recently. I would like a different perspective to tell me if it’s at all possible that this happened or if I’m just panicking for no reason. 

I can’t remember really anything from my life from before I was 12 or 13. A handful of foggy memories here and there. But otherwise I have no substantial memories. Even high school and middle school is a blur. I always though this was normal but I’ve been reading and it doesn’t seem to be that way? I’m not sure.

I have no absolutely no memories of my family. I don’t know what anybody was like back then. I don’t remember my dad being around even though I know he was, same for my mom. I don’t think they’d be the kind of people to do anything like that to me but I just don’t know. We were pretty heavily involved in church then and I do remember being alone with men older than me many times. 

I remember being interested in sex from a very young age. I remember masturbating at the local YMCA when I was 7 or 8 all the time. Even in public. 

I remember having nightmares a lot, waking up in the middle of the night feeling like I had died in my dream, like my heart had stopped beating.

I have no idea when or where it could have happened. But I was looking at signs of sexual abuse in adults and I hit a lot of them. 

Sex to me is kind of disgusting. With certain people I think it can be great but I am very much repulsed by the idea of sex. I have attachment issues and I get really attached really quickly. For example, awhile ago, I met a girl at a party and just spent the night with her (we didn’t do anything but make out) but the next morning she left me on read and I got depressed for months because if it. As a contradiction, my relationships have all lasted for no more than a month. It feels like a switch turns off and I get repulsed and I just say I can’t be with you anymore. And I never speak to them again.

I’ve had bouts with eating disorders. When I was 15 I starved myself. I have been depressed for as long as I can remember, and I have always thought about death and suicide. I’ve hated my body since I have been aware of it, like the fact that I have a penis disgusts me, and I don’t really know why. I feel constant nagging anxiety in my chest and I just thought this was all normal. Like I can’t breathe.

I don’t know how much of this is relevant to the question. I am trying to provide as much information as I can. Any direction is greatly appreciated.",08Feb2020,1
647,"Hello. I'm posting because I am unsure what to do about my current situation. To begin, I just finished student teaching and got my first job as a 4th grade teacher in the middle of the school year at a school I was a TA for. The 4th grade class is notorious for being very difficult and challenging. Not to mention, the school is a dual-immersion school. Meaning, teaching is done in both English and Spanish, and there are no curriculum books or resources. I have to make up 90% of my lessons. But I knew the kids, had developed a rapport with them, and thought it was worth trying for at least 5 months. However, it has been extremely stressful and challenging to pick up the job in the middle of the year with no real training or mentor support. Student behavior has been really challenging, to the point of making me break down at the end of each day crying of extreme stress. In addition to this, my peer teacher, who is male and  older than me (I'm 27), I assume in late 50s, has been making comments about how I'm pretty, smart, and sweet. At first I didn't think much of it, and ignored it, because he has been extremely supportive and helpful. But yesterday, he invited me to lunch. He gave me a ride and offered to pay for my food. I thought he was being polite and supportive. But after lunch, he leaned over to the passenger seat, cornered me, and asked for a kiss. I only had time to respond by turned my head. And he only managed to kiss my cheek. I told him I was extremely uncomfortable and did not appreciat his actions at all. He acted like nothing happened. I still had to continue the rest of the day going to meetings with him, all the while feeling extremely uncomfortable and shaken up. I was trying very hard to fight off an anxiety attack. When I went home I felt very gross and the thought of returning to the school keeps making me feel a lot of panic and anxiety. 

The thing is I really do love the kids I'm teaching, and yesterday was a very successful day with them. They had just gone through half the school year with a teacher that was verbally abusive to them. For a moment yesterday they seemed very happy. I don't want to leave them thinking that I quit because they were bad students, but what happened with the other 4th grade teacher, the man who was supposed to be my mentor, felt like the straw that broke the camel's back.

What should I do? I don't want to return to work on Monday. The thought honestly terrifies me. I want to report the man and this may be very stupid, but I'm not sure if it qualifies as workplace sexual harassment and his class adores him.",08Feb2020,1

655,"I was recently fired due to “prolonged poor work ethic” only to find out I was fired because they did not want to provide me my benefits. I was two weeks away from my probation ending and I had a talk about on what to improve the week before. They started to shift blame on me for things I didn’t do, thinking I was new and it was something every job dealt with, I took it thinking I would have time to better myself. Since I was training from the bare bottom, I was told it would take me around 8 months to nail the job, and instead of helping me improve they beat me down a lot for the past couple weeks. Instead of firing me face to face, they put me on shifts for the upcoming week, without warning cancelled them all and when I asked them what happened, they didn’t bother to call or tell me face to face, they texted me my termination letter. Since I was being trained from the bottom, it was well known that I had a lot of things to learn, though my other boss is known to be a perfectionist, instead of helping his employees, he decided it’s too much to train them and stopped helping me, which only leveraged them to let me go. The manager would obviously get furious with me when I made mistakes and expected me to know and be everywhere in one go. They knew this was a job that meant to me, used me and humiliated me. I tried very hard to be the best I can, but I feel like this could have been handled a lot better.

662,"So this was about a year and a half ago. I was 21 and desperate to get CHEAP/new car. First of all let me start off by saying I was young and dumb (still young and dumb). I tend to make irrational and quick decisions when i’m excited about something. For personal reasons that I don’t wanna get into I was not able to receive a license until I was 21. So when I finally got my license I needed, let me re-phrase that...had the biggest urge/desire to buy a car like the day before my license came in the mail. Also getting a car would allow me to start a new career.

Now for financial, and impatient reasons I was going to finance the car. Now when I say finance I really mean have the LOWEST monthly payment possible. My job requires me to drive 100-200+ miles a day mostly highways so leasing was out of the question. I also did not, and still do not want to buy used. Which is a whole separate argument for a whole different day. Anyway I was literally looking for the cheapest 2018 model car ever created. 

It’s a week before fourth of July and the cheapest car I could find was a 2018 Chevy Spark for around 13k. I figured what the hell I’ve waited 21 long years on my skateboard I can wait another week to try and get the “fourth of July deals” to increase my wheel size from 59mm to 200mm. 

Boom after checking “cars.com” everyday, on July 7th 2018 I pull up with my dad to a chevy dealership 90 miles away from home. Me, feeling like a Russian mobster (I’m Russian haha) on the outside, and as excited as a young school girl on the inside walk inside with my dad. I pull out my phone and show the sales guy the ad I saw. 2018 Chevy Spark for $10,001 in a lightish blue. 

Keep in mind I did NO research. I read NO reviews. My mind was set on this Chevy Spark. You could tell me 9/10 Chevy Sparks are reported to have a mind of their own and drive off of cliffs at 50k miles and I would still buy it without a second thought. 

Now I’m sure all of you can relate to a certain degree. You know the feeling of being so damn excited for something. The feeling of wanting something so damn bad that you would do irrational things to get it. In that moment you don’t want to hear anything negative about your decision. You just want IT. At the time it was the only thing I could afford so in my mind it was either the Chevy Spark or never drive a car again in my whole life. 

Back to the dealership, the sales guy asked if I wanted to test drive it, and for that 90 second circle in the parking lot (I didn’t even take my time I just wanted to get back and sign the paperwork) I fell in love what felt like for the first time. I didn’t even fall in love with the car I fell in love with the feeling of driving hopefully my neat future car. 

This is a Chevy Spark LS. I’m talkin manual windows, no power locking, no center console, cheap speakers, feel ever pebble on the road, get blown off the highway when a gust of wind or even ANY car passes by. I’m talkin a car that teaches you what claustrophobia is. A car that feels like you’re sitting inside one of those electric cars for toddlers. You get the point this was a bare skeleton with a piece of plastic around it. But I loved it. 

I had pretty good credit at the time so I was able to finance my first big purchase. 7.9 APR at 178 a month. At the time thats literally all I could afford. Ya know with insurance being so stupidly expensive if you’re young. So after a long day of paperwork and the sales guy telling us he literally can’t even drop a penny off the price I drove my baby home. 

Fast forward to January 1st 2020 around 5pm: “DAD I NEED YOU TO COME TO ME I JUST SLAMMED INTO A PARKED CAR GOING 60”

Okay okay I know you’re excited to hear what happens next but let me back up a little.

For my job I spend A LOT of time on the road and in my car. 200+ miles/6+ hours a day is not uncommon.  I’m about 5’7 and 150 pounds so I’m not the biggest guy. I’m a nice guy, but the Chevy Spark taught me what it feels like to be uncomfortable. It taught me what anxiety is. It taught me that you can have road rage at yourself. 

A little insight on my job; Im an in home sales man for home improvment. The owner of the company I work for (he took a liking to me because he is also Russian) knew I was planning on getting a car. He told me when I get a car he will train me in becoming a sales rep. Promoting me from my position as a telemarketer. So knowing this made me that much more in a rush to buy a car. We drive to appointments everyday, and sometimes just sit in the car to wait/chill in between appointments. So basically 2/3 of the work day is spent in the car, and the work days can sometimes be 9am to 11pm.

Me being naive and irrational did NOT think about these things when purchasing a car. I did NOT realize how important comfort is when sitting in the car all day. Sure the first 6 months I was so excited about having a car that I did not think about these things, but things quickly changed. 

I started to get really angry and started to despise working. I would wake up KNOWING I’m about to be very uncomfortable and annoyed inside of my car. 

Every detail about the car is horrible. My left elbow rested on what felt like rough old cement, and the rigid surface would leave marks on my arm. My right arm would always be itchy from the cheap cloth armrest. My left leg literally had no where to go. THE WORST PART ABOUT THE CAR THOUGH, my left knee would literally almost ALWAYS be touching the manual window roller handle. Half the time the handle was either directly on top of my knee or directly in front of my knee. I had nightmares about crashing the car only because I knew when I did that handle would be the end of my knee. 

There was no storage compartments in the car. I had no where to put my phone, my change, my wallet, anything else comfortably. Because it’s a tiny hatchback my back seats would ALWAYS have to be pushed forward to fit all of my work stuff (giant bags). MEANING I could not push/lean my seat back enough. It was the equivalence to those people in the asian countries that live in the tiny apartments that look lime walk in closets. 

Now I’m a music guy so listening to music is a must. Not even a year and my speakers started to blow... The speakers sounded like an old nokia phone in the first place. Or a better description would be when your earphones break so you have to pull out the old trusty $9 backup earphones from ross. Constantly I would think about installing better speakers but just never got around to me

There are 2 lessons to be learned from this pointless post, but one of them is how important comfort is when picking a car to own. I will now NEVER sacrifice comfort in the future. Not just in a car, but in anything.

Okay now....January 1st 2020 at about 4:30pm on a very main road. My new years resolution was to stop smoking cigarettes so this was day one!

So around that time of year it can get slow for my job. So as a side hustle I started doing Uber Eats. Let me take a quick second to say CHEVY SPARK DOES NOT QUALIFY FOR RIDE SHARING BECAUSE IT DOES NOT HAVE 5 SEATBELTS. I was EXTREMELY mad when I found that out AFTER I bought the car.

Since the car is so uncomfortably small it took many many attempts to find a phone mount/holder that was just okay. I finally found one that required my phone to be right in the middle. Keep in my mind this is my first day using it. Also keep in mind I am Russian and it was just new years. RIP to my liver the night before.

Here I am driving 60 on a very main road. My phone is right in the middle and I’m looking at it trying to figure out where I’m supposed to deliver this burger to. *Uber eats; pick up food from restaurant and deliver to customer* As I’m looking at my phone in the middle, while singing along to my music, most likely thinking about life, 100% hoping my headache would go away, wondering what my girlfriend is doing, admiring how warm my new north face jacket that I just bought is. Basically doing everything but paying attention to the road (And I’m sorry my grammar is getting worse as this post is going its 3am and I stopped caring as much LOL). I’ve been driving for a year and a half now I’m so confident in my self I can drive with my eyes closed using my feet.

Anyway, BAM I look up and my car is basically inside of an Audi SUV. “FUCK!!!!!!” “Fuck fuck fuck fuck” *close my eyes cause its a dream* *open them cause I’m waking up after a nightmare* “FUCK”

This is my first accident. I was going 60mph, at this point I’m completely speechless and very shocked. Every one always told me that car was a death wish but after about 5 seconds of stating in front of me I immediately climb over the airbags and exit the smoking, pulverized hunk of plastic. 

I slammed into a parked car on the right side of the road. Really horrible too, thank you seatbelt. I don’t even know what to do in this situation so I’m dumbfounded. Witnesses are asking if I’m okay I was so all I could say was “yeah I’m okay” 

I called my dad, and after what seemed like a minute he shows up. The owners of the parked car came out of the restaurant all normal accident stuff. I had a sprained finger, bruises yada yada. 

Now my insurance wanted nothing to do with is since I was doing uber. I filed a claim through uber’s insurance and they said I’ll be covered. Awesome, score, BUT I didn’t know what gap insurance was at the time. I failed to do my research which I always end up having to learn a lesson cause of sometimes heedless decisions.

I had 8 thousand left to pay off my car loan and 40k miles on the car. I for sure thought it was over. I was done, game over. Every one told me the insurance would pay me 5 MAYBE 6 thousand for the car leaving my to pay off the rest. 

Now I’m not religious but by some kind of mystical higher power I was blessed. I pretty much hit the jackpot. My payout was $11,200...

I purchased the car for $10,001...

I got my loan payed off AND received about 2k.

Now if that doesn’t scream second chance I don’t know what does.

To wrap up this long long meaningless story I just want to say a few things. 

If you read up to this point I applaud you. It wasn’t a hell of a ride to read this story. It wasn’t the script to the next big summer blockbuster. It was more like, a carnival ride for children ages 3-6. 

But there are some important lessons and morals to be taken from this.
1. Fuck the Chevy Spark
2. Comfort in a vehicle is very important
3 Do your research and please get a car that you will love even 2 years down the line. Get something you like. If you cant afford it wait until you can if you can be patient
4 GAP INSURANCE
5 Don’t make hasty decisions like me

After lots of research I am getting ready to finance a 2020 Toyota Corolla SE next week, and I’m very excited! 

We live and learn. We make mistakes and we learn from them. I know when it comes to stubborn minds like myself we won’t listen/pay attention to advise that much until we have to pay the consequences. I try to listen more and look things into a different perspective as I get older because the older you get past 18 the more bad decisions screw you over. The consequences weren’t as bad as a teenager but now wrong avoidable decisions can really change your life for the worse. Adulting isn’t easy but thats just the game we call life. Goodnight ya’ll I have to be up in about 4 hours to drive my rental 100 miles to go sell some windows.

I know I shouldn't compare myself,I should be happy for her, and things will change. But I just can't. My family kicked me out,my financial status is shit, some of my friend died. I'm fucking lonely,she all that I have atm. And day after day,I notice that she drifted away from me. I don't wanna lose her. I just hope everything will be ok but it's not.

From the start, she has told me that she has to get over her ex and isn't looking to date and I was fine with that. So a couple months go by, we fuck and start to warm up to each other, texting frequently, etc. Skip to now, a week ago, she didn't know if she was pregnant (she wasn't) but we talked about the situation and then after that night, she texts me telling me how I make it hard for her not to like me (Because she's still not trying to date), fast forward 2 more days, we're studying together and she starts showing PDA and flirting with me (she's really against PDA) and then talks about potential living location's for us and how she's gonna drag me along with her when she travels, no more than 2 days later, she sent me a text saying we gotta be friends and now, I'm just confused.

From my perspective, I feel so dumb. She barely has been texting me after that. And I'm just wondering how you can invest so much and then just pretend like I don't exist or whatever. It makes me wonder if she really is the person I got to know or was it a persona. She would constantly tell me how she worried about me and about hurting me in the end but look what's going on now.

669,"I’m on mobile, sorry.

I’m 17, turning 18 in April, and I’ve been addicted to various forms of nicotine for a couple of years. I had easy access to it until the new laws were passed. So after the laws were imposed, I decided to quit vaping - which was the hardest thing I I’ve ever done. I also quit weed &amp; psychedelics, I stopped talking to most of my friends, and I quit my job. I’m extremely depressed and the only person I can stand to be around is my boyfriend.  After this change in my life, I couldn’t help but turn to cigarettes. They’re so much easier to find, I mean they’re everywhere! I came across a pack on the street, and ever since, I’ve been stealing them from cars, smoking ones I find off the street, it’s disgusting. But having this one thing, keeps me going every day. It’s a necessity for me. 

I’ve been waiting so long to turn 18 and be free of this nonsense, the lying, secrecy, and humiliation...To finally become a legal adult and be able to just get my fix in fucking peace. Then, 4 months before I turn 18, the government does this...I can’t believe it. 3 more years of this nonsense. 

The worst part is that nobody else seems to care. It feels like I’m the only person in the world who gives a fuck about this injustice. I feel more alone than ever. Is anyone else in this situation? How have you coped with it? What loopholes, if any, could I use to get what I need?",08Feb2020,1
670,"Hi guys,

So I’ve noticed huge strings of my hair falling out of my head. Bit more than usual but thought it was normal. But then I was practically shedding. Just been to get my hair done and hairdresser noticed some loss around the front and suggested some treatments. 

I know this is a problem but I don’t know how to not be stressed. I’m. 23-year-old university student who’s also working full time as a junior software engineer. I love my job and love my uni work, but I’ll admit that together they’re an incredibly stressful combination. When I get home from work I’ll remain stressed about work, what I got done or didn’t get done there, and then I’d have to go onto doing my uni work, and that’d also be stress-provoking. I don’t feel like I ever have any time to just enjoy myself, like read a book I wanna read or play video games. In my head, a bit of hustle now (work and uni) will be worth it in the long run—so temporary struggle for my career which will hopefully be great.

675,"Here is my situation. I have two roommates, me and one of them get along like best buds and the other one and I butt heads sometimes. I lived with these 2 roommates last year and the one who I don't get along with as well (lets call him Steve) did pull some shit that made me and the other roommate(lets call Ron) did not like. We were contemplating on whether or not we could live with the kid another year but we were already locked in so we had to do it. Steve was much better the first semester of this year and everything seemed good, it seemed like he changed and was less self-centered than before. However, when he came back from Christmas break its like things changed or something. Everything was all good at first, everyone getting along, until one day when he was throwing some things out before these cleaners came. He accidentally threw out a container of some workout stuff of mine that was pretty much full and wouldn't take responsibility for what he had done. He started saying the cleaners did it, which made no sense, and then proceeded to bring up shit from the past that he had given me and therefore didn't have to pay me back for it. I was kinda taken back when he said that cause he was acting like I had never done one thing or given one thing to him. He eventually paid me back but said that I could forget about him ever doing anything for me again because ""I didn't appreciate all that he has done for me."" This was the first pretty major argument we have had this school year but it gets worse. Flash forward a few weeks later and I think all is good, there is still some tension in the air but nothing major. The other night he was making some brownies and I was with him and watching and he said I could have some when he was done and that they are for the whole apartment. I went to sleep before they were finished by grabbed one the next day. He came in my room and asked if I had one and I said yes and he asked me how it was and I said good and he walked out and it seemed like a friendly conversation. 5 hours go by and all 3 of us are deciding on what to order for food and out of nowhere he says to me, ""you know what's fucked up, you ate one of my brownies and didn't even ask. I said are you kidding me? you literally told me I could have some when you were making them. To which he replies yeah but you still have to ask which I thought was kinda silly but whatever I just let the argument go. Not even a minute goes by and he says that im unappreciative for everything he has ever done for me and that I'm one of the most unappreciative people that he knows (which is just not true and I find this ironic coming from him) and I said dude are you kidding me, all this over a single brownie? I started saying he was acting like a baby and a toddler and he then backed out of the deal all 3 of us had for the food and started sulking. He then proceeded to say some more pretty messed up things like how a friendship is give and take and that I don't give him anything of use and eventually he walked away because he said we weren't getting anywhere with this argument even though he brought it up. Idk what to do guys, it seemed like he wanted to argue last night or something and today he has ignored me all day and honestly I'm considering moving out by next fall(college). Last year Steve would even say that he would wanna punch me and that he wants to slam me for no reason. We're all pretty muscular dudes so I'm not worried about Steve trying to attack me or something but it's just not something you say to your roommate, especially when I haven't even wronged him. Ron and I both think he's acting ridiculous but Ron doesn't really want to talk with me about Steve's behavior because he said it wasn't his argument or situation. Ron is a great friend and roommate but I honestly don't know if I can live with Steve for 2 more years of college.

At first, everything was fine. I thought all three of them were quiet and nice. But oh boy, I was really wrong. Last semester, they threw parties every one or two weeks, I could tolerate it, but occassionally I had to tell them to quiet it down. But now, they throw parties twice a week, and its beginning to take a toll on my sleep schedule. Also they play music, and tend to blast it, like the loud music you would hear at a club.

And then normally the next morning after their parties, there's beer cans and bottles scattered everywhere, the floor is sticky. It's just a mess, and I'm tired of seeing it. They barely wash their dishes, take out the trash and recyclables, and buy toilet paper and paper towels.

683,"Hi there! I’m a 24 year old female. Two years ago I moved a thousand miles away from home for an internship and completely fell in love with the city I was in. I was great at my job, entered my first healthy romantic relationship, and made incredible friendships. For the first time in my life, I truly felt happy and like I was living instead of existing. My mom, however, was not happy about that. Every single phone call or text messages was sealed with a passive aggressive, “I can’t wait until you come home/you flat left me” bow. Despite wanting to stay in the new city after my internship, I came home just to make her happy. Throughout my year away, I was constantly told by family and friends how miserable she was because she just missed me SO much. I voiced my desire to stay to my dad and my aunts, and they all more or less told me that I owed coming home to my mom, because the internship was supposed to be a year and going “SURPRISE! I’m moving here” seemed cruel. I was also told that my dad was having heath issues as well. They also all told me that I can always move back. I felt like I had no choice, so I moved back home. 

Ever since I’ve returned I’ve been extremely lonely and depressed. I feel like my life in on pause, both socially and career-wise. I have a bachelors degree in English, and I’ve been taking finance courses at the local community college and making podcast as a means to distract myself from my crippling loneliness. I’ve applied for a few “big girl” jobs and have gotten an interview or two, but nothing came from it. Right now I’m working at a “high end” retail store. 

I was recently offered a position back at my old company. I told my mom and her response has just been hysterical crying for hours. She keeps saying things like “what’s the point of having kids if they’re going to leave you?” “You’re born alone, you die alone” “why can’t you just move an hour away” “I never thought I’d have a kid like that” and “I’m so mad, I’m so mad, I’m so mad.” Obviously I love my mom and I feel so guilty that I’m breaking her heart. I know this change is going to affect our family dynamic forever. I want to make this move, but it’s so hard not to internalize her sadness and this guilt. I love my mom so much, and she has done so much for me. She works a terrible job that she hates because it pays well and provides for the family. She always went without so I could have extra. I’ve heard from so many friends and even my dad that I am not responsible for her happiness and that I need to live for myself, but dealing with the fallout from this is so hard when I know I’m breaking her heart. 

She keeps saying that I just want to live with my boyfriend and that I’m going to be stuck in a low paying job forever. However, I have every interest in getting a masters degree and going back to school to study either finance or psychology. The company I would be working for would even sponsor me for full tuition assistance. And of course I want to live with my boyfriend, but he isn’t the main reason I’d be moving there again. My parents are still together, but my dad has a massive temper. Every week or so there’s also a huge fight because of something so small and insignificant (ie dishes being in the sink). I don’t want to live in an environment like this anymore. I miss having a job I liked, having a social life, and feeling like I have agency instead of being trapped. But with her being so upset, it’s making me feel so guilty that I’m starting to question what I want. I don’t know how to be strong and do what is best for me. 

I love her and I don’t want to hurt her, but I also don’t want to end up in a Grey Gardens situation where I waste my life away just to appease her.",08Feb2020,1
684,"(Throwaway in case the friend in question sees)

I’m really good friends with someone who is a mother to an amazing daughter. She’s 6 and already incredibly intelligent and witty and prized by her entire family and the community around her, including me. 

Here’s the thing: I’m pretty sure she doesn’t like me. 

My friend invites me to hers quite often and whenever I arrive, her daughter looks disappointed I’m there. She often refuses to answer me when I ask her questions (eg hey, how are you? how is school going? How was your birthday party? etc) but will take over the conversation if her mother starts talking. She is reluctant to wish me good night when her mother tells her to. She also often hosts “discos” which I am never invited to. I know this because she will ask everyone else around me to come and when her mother tells me I’m invited too, her daughter looks annoyed by this. I’ve known her for a couple years now and she just hasn’t warmed-up to me at all. 

I’m not a bad or intimidating person, I’m a small woman in my early 20s and I’m friendly with her. I try to make her feel included with “the grown-ups” as opposed to ignoring her, as she is always the only child present. I never say or do anything aggressive or inappropriate and if I had, my friend certainly wouldn’t be inviting me over as often as she does. 

But it’s really getting to me that this young girl is so clearly annoyed by my existence. She doesn’t behave like this with anyone else. She seems to love everyone else around her - even the people who openly dislike children and have said so around her. 

It’s getting to a point where I want to reject my friend’s invitation to come over because 1) I don’t want to make her daughter unhappy by my very presence and 2) it’s really hurting my self-esteem and feelings. What’s more, I’m very much a member of my friend’s family by now and I cherish her and her siblings as if they were my own siblings. But nobody likes being around someone who makes them feel unwanted, and I’m definitely feeling unwanted by her daughter. I don’t know if my friend can tell as much as I can that her daughter doesn’t like me and I’m afraid of asking in case I come across as silly or immature.

So reddit, what is your opinion on this, and do you have any advice on how to handle myself and my emotions in this scenario?",08Feb2020,1
685,"I just started seeing a new girl in December, but I only see them about once a week. I've not been massively social since December with my friends( I'd been sick since Christmas, I still am). 

I have a friend , female who I'd been pretty close with as friends over the years. She'sa nice person but the type who can be a bit clingy, possessive and emotionally draining. I kinda buffer hanging out with because it can be a lot..
 
I've been sick almost 2 months and I've not made any plans beyond rest, work and see my new gf about once a week. But I'd noticed my friend had been quiet, so I text last week to see if all was good with them... big mistake..

They created a narrative in their head that I dropped them for my new gf. (Literally just been sick for weeks, not making plans). They felt that the friendship is one sided (I'll admit she wanted way more out of the friendship than I was willing to give.) I tried to resolve things, but I'm also not the type of person to take shit for things that are bullshit.

I knew this friend liked me more than friends, but thought my being clear on things over the years would avoid anything like this. She more or less told me that the friendship is done, because the ""trust is broken"". 

Truth be told I'm sad, but also relieved. It was demanding being her friend. She didn't have many, so I felt kinda responsible for her, even when hanging out was completely draining. 

So, should you never bother to try to foster friendships with people, if you know they like you?

686,"I work for a small business with no HR department and I recently requested a review with my supervisor. My supervisor is generally nice to me and is positive towards the work I do, but is also very power-hungry and her supervisory role goes to her head a lot. 

She had me fill out a self evaluation prior to my review and then we met on it to compare our notes. It was mainly a positive review, but the negatives she addressed were issues that other employees had given her. That didn’t bother me initially because I expected her to speak with other employees that I work closest with. However, when I asked her to provide me examples of instances where these negative things occurred, the only one she could give was from someone I don’t even directly work with at all but is my supervisor’s buddy at work. This was very off-putting as this was evidence she went to her “friends” to get their opinion on me, regardless of our interactions at work, which makes me wonder who else she talked to. 

I found out later that she also did not go to the one person I work closest to, which further made me believe she was not really looking to gather the facts. I feel like my review turned into a gossip topic for her and her friend, versus it actually being constructive and valuable. 

Is this something that might be a violation of HR or basic professional practices? I’ve been considering going to upper management about this, but just am not sure if it’s worth it. Any advice is appreciated.",08Feb2020,1

I also love way too deep and it never does me any good except when I hear people tell me that I am a ""good person"" and I make them feel special, but that doesn't do much for me other than a little reassurance that I'm making other people happy.

I haven’t been able to find anything regarding the identity of this toy yet (since what I remember is so vague) and was hoping someone could identify it.

The toy was a ferret or raccoon looking stuffed animal that made cute noises when you played with it (like when you put a fake baby bottle in its mouth). It would move when you activated it, which is to say when I would pet it or pretend to feed it. As a toddler, I lived in Indiana with my mother (no father around), so I can assume that it wouldn’t have been too expensive as she was having a hard time making money. It wasn’t round like a teddy bear, it was long and slim, somewhat close in length to my forearm (if I remember correctly).

699,"So long story short, I had been dating someone for 2 years. This guys has many friends who are strippers but what we discussed in the beginning was that they were mutual friends BUT...I did not feel comfortable with him being friends with random strippers he met online or at strip clubs. I could see that he was friends with SOME on FB. We discussed, he said ok ""I don't meet them online""...I came to terms with that and tried to be open-minded.

Recently I mentioned one of them by name in a calm, open discussion where he was bringing up that first conversation. I mentioned one stripper he was friends with by name. He denied knowing her, her name, ever meeting her, or being friends with her. He raged, called and messaging his friends calling me paranoid and crazy. I ended up believing that she was accidentally added without his consent since it happened to me. But I knew that they were friends and that he took her off his list, even though he let me see his friends list that night.

Soon afterwards, I found an old phone of his, logged into facebook. I took a picture of their facebook history, and they had been interacting and friends before and during our relationship. He was active on her pages where she was posting bikini pics, posting happy birthday, etc. Some of these interactions were after we were official.

I took a pic, put the phone back in the drawer packed up, and went to a hotel. I told him why, and the next day I receive a message that he will call the police if he doesnt get his phone back. I call a friend, she comes over, wait till he gets home. She is my witness that the phone was left in the apartment, and I haven't been back.

friend (20m) and I (20f) have been friends since middle school. we weren't particularly close, in fact, I don't even remember how we became friends when all along I saw him as a classmate and he only started talking to me more since after high school. 

I am not a good texter and I am in university while he isn't schooling (he quit). I don't reply often and fair to say, I barely initiate conversations and most of the time, it is friend initiating conversations and asking to meet (of which 90% fail because I am not keen in meeting him and I do not have much spare time because of my course).

here's the thing, he blames me for not texting him more and not meeting him but I can't tell him in the face that I actually do not enjoy this friendship (for various reasons including him being overly intrusive, him only focusing on his problems and never really communicating with me for the sake of understanding me). I tried to hint at cutting ties by giving slow and cold replies, telling him that I am busy and hoping that he will understand and leave or something. but now he blames me and I don't know if I should just tell him how I feel about this friendship. I just feel like this friendship is very pointless because we do not understand each other and he keeps finding fault with me. yes, I am at fault but I am just trying to avoid him and distancing myself away from him. he doesn't seem to get it though.

702,"We dated long distance for a year. Three weeks ago I broke up with him over the phone because he slapped me as a joke the last time I visited him and I couldn’t trust him anymore. Over the phone he even said “I understand, I’m just not the one for you” and I felt relieved because I thought he understood that I saw no future with him anymore. I did not contact him again after breaking up, and I blocked him on all platforms I didn’t want him contacting me or following me on anything. I am unable to block him on Spotify and he still follows me and has a playlist titled with the initials of my name, and he fills it with music and sometimes includes music I am listening to because he can see what I listen to since he is following me. He also has shared a Google Drive folder (titled my initials) with me - I also can’t block him or reject the sharing of the folder - and he writes diary entries that then pop up in my drive, which I use for school work. My willpower hasn’t been strong enough so I will sometimes open them and read them. He writes in there saying stuff about how I’m the one, and he’s gonna wait for me, which sounds innocent enough (even though it’s unwanted and unrequited). However, 2-3 days ago he made a post saying he is going to fulfill the promise he made me (while we were still dating) that he is going to come to Florida to visit me. And he said “if it goes well, I’ll get to spend the weekend with a special someone, and if it goes bad I’ll just spend two days alone”. Needless to say, I was immediately freaked out. I haven’t spoken to this guy in weeks and he is still writing about how perfect we are together, and now saying he is going to come to my address.

703,"I (m/30) have always kinda been unsure about my career choices.

I grew up in a conservative environment job-wise. My dad was a sales person and my mum was at home.
The most important thing for them was that their children would do a solid job with a regular income but didn't care what we children would choose.
We didn't grow up rich but after the divorce of my parents my mom, me and my brother struggled quite a bit.

I got really sick when i was 19 and almost died. This experience made me rethink a lot and value my life and time way more. I run around with a cronic disease bit it doesn't affect my day to day, luckily.

Because I survived I fulfilled my dream of traveling to places where lions and tigers and monkeys are. Where monks walk down the street in prayers and rhythmic music plays out of the jungle.
I worked hard to save up money and went for several months.

I fell in love with travelling, worked a bit to save up and went again.

I met quite some people and some older ones suggested I should study and have an education to have it easier. They said that because I wanted to work half a year in europe and travel the other half. But if you get older it is harder to get employment.


So i came back and studied to become a teacher. I like to teach but don't want to end up being in the same place all my life. (i know i can change places, but i hope you get what i mean). I tried the 9-5 thing but really felt like it would slowly kill me.

During my studies at my bday party a curator came with a friend of mine.
 He saw the paintings i did on the walls and suggested i should make an exhibition.
Doing that involves quite some money (to do it right) and big canvases and good art supplies are really expensive.


To go down the artist road involves a lot of sacrifices and whether i have success or not is pretty unsure.

I stopped my studies as my childless aunt got sicker.

I took care of her for a year until she died. During that time i worked at a grocery store and while taking care of her so my own life of was in the back.

I took some time after her death to recover. Taking care of an elderly woman dying of cancer is really hard.
Suddenly i had my life back.  I took some time to paint and got a good response. The small town i am from doesn't offer much, so i would need to move to a city. I don't have huge amounts of money, not enough to pay for a gallery and the art supplies but i could manage.
I showed my work to several galleries and partake in art competitions getting a good response. the galleries said i need to have a concept and a complete exhibition but recognised that i have the hand and eye for art.

A month ago an accident happened and destroyed the place i lived and 10 of the paintings i had already done. So i would need to start over completely.
I got over the loss, nobody got hurt, that is what counted for me.


recently i needed to rethink it all. My studies aren't complete, I feel like time is running through my fingers and that i hit a point of getting 'old' and that i 'need' to decide.

I can go back to study, even paint on the side but preparing an exhibition is really time consuming. And studying is too.
I would have a degree in two years and be 'save'.

Or i could dedicate my entire time to paint, work on the side and prepare for the exhibition.
If so and i would not have success, i would loose surely 11/2 years if not more being at a similar point i am now.

I would always need to work and rent a place.
(i only can and want to do it on my own, my family can help me out with some pocket money if i would need but surely not finance my life, lol)

707," 

Graduated with my engineering degree (Should be grateful right).

Pretty happy for myself since I did it 2 months before I hit 25. (25 next month)

I got an internship with a company thats about 30 minute drive. 40 minutes back because traffic.

I definitely want to work somewhere closer (I literally live 3 minutes away from Ford HQ but they are pretty demanding on requirements for jobs so I will keep trying).

This company I currently work at, is giving me 4 months of contract internship. It is actually really chill because nobody yells at you if you go eat, go outside to breathe, relax for a bit or anything. In fact, it's just your standard 9-5 but you can relax if you want.

I just don't know what the issue is, I hate how jobs are not 9-5 more like 7:30 to 6 because you have to wake up early to eat, change, drive, drive home. So it cuts into your personal time pretty heavy.

Maybe if I found a position closer that'd help. But it's just the final of life. Like this is life? Working 9-5s? Even if I'm an Engineer and getting paid like $30 an hour making good money.

I'm going to do this for the rest of my life? I always thought (I'm sure most people thought) that I'd be successful without working for someone else. I do prefer engineering compared to anything else (nursing, lawyer etc). But I don't know what it is.

Maybe it's because I'm a recent grad and this job life is new I don't know. It doesn't seem healthy to me for the average human to work 8 hrs a day 5 days a week while incorporating their own personal hours into it. I don't know.

I'd love for remote work some days where I can work from home. I don't know how I'd even approach that when applying for a job.

720,"My car was recently stolen. We put up a post on Facebook that spread to almost everyone in my city offering a very large reward for any leads. A person called and claimed they found it randomly in a different city. This person then said they decided to just go ahead and grab it and purchased a battery for it because it was missing in the car, and proceeded to drive it home.

Suspicious for a few reasons:

1. How did they know that the key was snapped off in the ignition and they could just start it on their own? Nobody had that information except for a few people we knew, and the people they told- which we assume is the reason why it got stolen because we live in a very safe neighborhood and car thieves usually would break the steering wheel column before checking whether the ignition turns on its own (I assume).

2. Who finds a car they think is stolen, and decides to just go ahead and take it off the street without confirming that it is truly the car with the owner or police?

3. The guy who returned it looked a lot like the guy who I saw right outside my house around the time the car went missing.

So, I have my car back and I’m happy about it, but this guy is calling and asking for his large reward for finding it. I just feel really uneasy about giving it to him because his story doesn’t add up and I feel I would essentially be paying this guy for stealing my car, taking out the very expensive stereo system and keeping it, as well as some expensive tools that were inside the car, and then bringing it back.

He’s not fessing up and i don’t have solid evidence but this feels wrong.

727,"My father and mother had my older brother (29M) and then myself (25M). When i was 4 i was diagnosed with a type of paediatric cancer and was rushed to hospital for treatment and intervention. At the beginning of my hospitalization my mother left my father, inexplicably. I don’t remember much at all of my childhood, but they seemed to have a decent relationship/marriage and were good parents as my dad worked and my mother took care of us full time. I also don’t remember much from time in the hospital, but my father was always there, nearly 24/7 tending to me/talking to doctors and specialists. I can only recall one day/memory of my mother visiting me when I was hospitalized. During my hospitalization I underwent surgery and various types of treatments for a year and a half, and thankfully came out cancer free and slowly regained my health.

From approximately age 7 to 25, my mother and her side of the family virtually disappeared from my life and anything I heard about my mother I heard second or third hand from family members. One of these things I was told is that she suffers from some sort of mental illness. I have only seen or even talked to my mother a handful of times since, and I always saw her with my older brother. I last saw my mother last when I was 16/17, and she seemed somewhat unstable and/anxious and very nervous around my brother and I. It was a very awkward interaction for me.

Recently, my brother said he wants to meet and talk with our mom. Essentially I think he wants to get some answers or settle the situation somehow and move on; to quote him “start off the decade right”. I have thought about every possible scenario that might happen if I go with my brother to see and talk to her. If I were to go, I wouldn’t expect much from this possible future encounter aside from what she says and whatever I learn from the interaction with her (alongside my brother). I have been apathetic about not having a mom since I was a teen and have built my life fine without one.

733,"To start this off, I am 25 years old, have been married to my husband for 6 years, and we have a beautiful 2-year-old. I have always been aware of my attraction to women(my first crush and “sexual” experience was with my next door neighbor and best friend when her and I were both 11). My family, mainly my stepdads, always made it very clear to me that they would rather throw me away than see me with a woman. So because of this, I went my through my life dating boys and then men more than women to please my family. 

When I was 19, I met my husband. I was coming out of a terrible relationship with a severely unstable and abusive guy and my husband was my “knight in shining armor”, plus my family actually liked him. He was the first man in my life to show me love and treat me like an actual human being. After only 6 months, when he asked me to marry him, I jumped in head first. 

We have had our up and downs and been through the works. Throughout it all we have managed to stay afloat. Our entire relationship and my whole life I always pictured myself with a woman, loving and living and growing with a woman by my side. This was a massive hole in me for a while and my husband decided after our daughter turned one that it was best to open our marriage and allow me to be with women. 

While exploring myself and my sexuality I have gone from feeling I was bisexual my whole life to knowing for a fact that I am gay. I still very much love my husband and I know I always will. But being married to him just doesn’t feel right anymore. I just don’t feel the same type of love I once thought I did and having sex with him is hard and it kills me to say it. I feel terrible about it, we have our daughter and a whole life together. We just signed a 3 year lease last October. 

To add to this tearing in my head and heart, this last year I fell in love with the woman of my dreams. She is amazing and incredible and I’ve never felt this strongly for anyone who isn’t my daughter. In the beginning of my relationship with her, she was okay with me being married, now with us talking about getting serious and her wanting a family with me someday, her feelings about it are not the same. She has gotten distant and blown me off and now after 2 months of being nonexistent, she has left me for all those reasons above. 

Now it’s not just because of my relationship with my girlfriend coming to and end but I was consistently finding this to be something most women are understandingly not okay with before her as well. I’m struggling with wanting to follow my dreams. I’m torn about what I should do. I feel as if I were to do what makes me happy I would destroy my family, the life I’ve built and my daughter’s world. On top of breaking my husband’s heart, who I do love, he is my best friend. On the other hand, I have a burning passion to embrace myself as a gay woman and live my life the way I feel will make me truly happy. I guess I just want advice or to know someone has felt this and gone through it, and what was your outcome? Do you feel you made the right choice in your similar situation? I’m just so lost, it hurts. Am I just being ridiculous?",08Feb2020,1

736,"Hi, for context I'll just say that we're both 13yo girls. Oh and its probably important that you know we're both bi.

I think most people's initial reaction would be yes, because *what's the worst that could happen?* and *you might regret not telling her* and all that stuff, but there is another factor... She's my best friend. And if I were to tell her, it could, well it would probably kill our friendship. 

We have a lot of intimate moments, and I have no idea how either of us see those moments. Are they platonic? Are they romantic? I don't fucking know, and I don't know if she knows either. And if I tell her and she doesn't like me, all those moments will be stolen from us.

Another thing is that if she were to like me back, then what would happen? Because we're both very young, neither of us have ever had a relationship before this and what if we screw up both our romantic relationship *and* our platonic relationship? I don't care if it's platonic or romantic, I really need her. I mean maybe I could wait until we've had more experience? But then a whole bunch of other problems show up. 

I get how I'm acting as if it has to last forever and if it doesn't then it's not even worth trying, and I know that nothing can last forever, but I want her to last as long as possible. I know I'll probably meet someone better, but right now I just want her.

But here's where I run into some major complications...

When we were 11/12~, we were both super desperate for a girlfriend. And being the idiot I was, I was like *'hey u can say no, but idk do u mayb wanna b my gf'* over fucking text. And she said sure and that began our 5 day relationship. At night over text we would profess our love to each other, but during school we could barely look into each other's eyes. Eventually we just missed being able to talk and have fun with each other so we broke up. 

Afterwards, she said how it all just felt kind of wrong to her, and how she was never able to say 'u/idkwhattoput69 is my girlfriend' out loud, when I had said it multiple times and it felt pretty right to me.

I know that it must seem pretty trivial considering that we're only 13, and I know it is, but just really don't know what to do anymore and I need help.

742,"About a year ago, my boyfriend bought a fancy motorcycle. He's never been much of a biker, so it came as a bit of a surprise. Even more of a surprise was how into it he got; he spends most of his free time riding around the country now. For my last birthday, he was going to gift me a driver's license and a motorcycle of my own so I can join him on his tours. 

Thankfully, I found out before Christmas rolled around and managed to stop him. We had quite an argument about it. I don't like motorcycles, and I do not want to ride one myself. I also don't enjoy being his passenger. I'm really not into it because I think it's too dangerous and also I don't enjoy fast speeds as much as he does. I've been vocal about it ever since he got the bike, and I've told him from the very start that I wouldn't be joining in on this hobby. Of course I don't want to disappoint him - but I get so scared when he makes me ride around with him that I actually cry. 

The problem is, he counters everything I say by telling me it's an irrational fear and I should at least try to get over it. In theory he isn't wrong, however it's much more than an irrational fear on my end. I know quite a few people who've had life-altering accidents. Two of my uncles died. I know it's a risky fun and for myself, I've decided I like being alive and well way more than riding motorcycles. I've told my boyfriend this, but he says he's also well aware of the risks - but to him, the joy is greater than anything else and he desperately wants me to experience it with him. 

What are some arguments against riding motorcycles? How can I convince him that I don't just need to get over my irrational fear? 

Tl;dr: My boyfriend wants me to ride his motorcycle with him, but I am both scared and simply unwilling because I find it dangerous and don't enjoy it. How can I convince him to leave me alone about this?",08Feb2020,1

I have recently started a full time teaching position, and after a number of years at university my career is finally taken off. The last year or so I have been tutoring a couple in the language I specialise in, and last year I anticipated that 1 hour weekly in person sessions would not be a large commitment and I could still tutor them.

Fast forward to my first few weeks, where I'm staying after school until 5 and still going home to work to get everything done, and will be for the foreseeable future, and not even having enough time to exercise or play video games. I have realised that continuing tutoring with them, when I have to drive 40 mins from my school to them and wouldn't get home until around 7pm (in bed by 8ish) is going to be a burden on me and I just don't have the mental energy to go do that after a full day.
Weekends aren't an option either as I'm comatose most weekends and am working when I'm not. 

I just don't know how to break it to them as they were really excited for me to continue tutoring for them. My plan right now is to meet with them next week and explain how my situation has changed and that I can't take on this commitment anymore without me not having enough time to work/relax/eat at home before bed and offer to find them a replacement tutor or program.

754,"I'm a twenty-year old college student. I know that, usually, most people my age would have some sort of job supporting them already. However, I don't. At least not right now, but I am working on doing something for income (more below). 

I'd like to blame this on a ""weird"" structure that my family has (I'm Filipino) and my complacency regarding said structure. It's all I've ever known and it's the way most of our family members (the one's I know well) also operate. To me that's the norm and I never questioned it because, in all fairness, it benefited me anyway.

The familial expectations dictate that my dad has to be the one with the stable source of income, and it's my mom who manages the household, raises the kid(s), and maybe do random odd-jobs that may or may not last or become regular thing. Moreover, I was raised to rely solely on proper budgeting and my dad's hardwork. In fact, my parents never pushed nor expected me to work until I finished undergrad. My dad likes to say that the reason why he was working so hard overseas was to support all our needs. We had a conversation about me saying I wanted to get some sort of work-at-home job I can try fitting in my college sched. and he lightly scolded me about how ""I'm working precisely so you don't have to think about things like that for now."" 

I respect him for all he's sacrificed for us, but still. It's an outdated family structure and tenuous at best, in hindsight, relying on just one person. Though, to be fair, my parents are shrewd with our finances and have back-up plans like renting out apartments.

Sometimes, however, even back-up plans don't initially work as well as you want them too. While it's true my parents have apartments we're renting out, I overheard my mom telling a friend that the rent they get from there is only enough to pay the bills and we would need at least one other steady source of income to support our needs in the future.

I mention this because, unfortunately, we'd received the news that the company my dad works for is no longer renewing his contract. By the end of February, he's out of a job. This is a problem because I'm still a year away from graduating and my university's tuition fees are one of the highest in the country. On top of this, while I may be an only child, I'm not the only student my parents are currently supporting (college-level or otherwise).

When I heard the news, I already started going through my list of work-at-home jobs I can apply for. Initially, this had been the case because I wanted to work on the down low as my dad still stubbornly asserts he has enough saved up for me to finish my studies even if I want to pursue, say, a masters degree. While I don't doubt my father's ability to save up money, there are still so many factors that might put a wrench in a plan that's ""my savings and the apartments ought to be enough.""

Then, a friend suggested starting writing commissions, for fanfiction, which I already, occasionally wrote when I had spare time. I then got the idea that I could put my currently-at-works university degree and help undergrads like myself (or maybe even high school students) with their academic papers. I could proofread or edit papers for a small fee. On top of this, I could help students with a detailed outline for an academic paper to help them solve the problem of still having to brainstorm flow and content. I could even help make individual presentations, I thought. Or transcribe audio/video files of class lectures and the like.

 ^((The disclaimer, of course, is that my specialty is limited to English Literature and History, primarily. However, I can also write basic Theology papers considering I come from a Jesuit university with 12 units of required Theology classes—and I do mean Theology, academically. Depending on the material, I might be able to offer help regarding a Philosophy papers—we also had 12 required units for Philosophy. I can write fairly well academically in both English and Filipino too. Ironically, even, I'm more fluent in English than the latter.))

Right now, I'm working on compiling a portfolio of my academic papers and building a website where I can advertise my services. I'm also creating an inventory of old books and other knick-knacks I might be able to sell (this one is put on hold at the moment). If all else fails, I still have the option of applying to a call center agency when I'm fit to work (I'm currently on leave from uni due to health reasons).

**However, these options are regarding my semester after my leave. Which isn't until months from now. I have time to, hopefully, raise enough money to even cover 50% of my tuition fee. The reason why I'm asking about the possibility of online fundraising anonymously is regarding my health.**

Around two years ago, I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder. I'd experienced bouts of irrational irritability, concerning depressive moods, and nonsuicidal self-injury (though I do have suicidal ideation) for much longer but the actual process it took to getting an actual diagnosis (much less a regular appointment with my current psychiatrist) was a long and difficult process. [I mentioned it here briefly](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfharm/comments/edprvr/i_have_a_weird_insecurity_about_my_scars/). 

Due to the lack of resources regarding education on mental health illnesses here in the Philippines, and the wildly inaccurate portrayals in media, it's understandable that my parents have a lot of misgivings regarding mental health. Primarily, they seem to genuinely believe mental health issues aren't real health problems. You know, love and care and prayer is all you need. I know they're coming from a good place, but good intentions don't always translate to good results.

My mother, in particular, doesn't believe my meds are necessary. She's more concerned about my kidneys than my ticking time-bomb of a brain because I'm taking ""too much"" meds, apparently. She's even asked my psychiatrist if I could just take my meds every other day and ""wouldn't her kidneys get destroyed by all these medications?"" I swear she means well most of the time but, unfortunately, love isn't really a cure-all.

Mind you, I'm only taking two different medications to treat my BPD and keep my moods stable. One tablet I take in the morning and another tablet I take in the evening.

The one I take at night is particularly important for me. Not only does it keep my mood from venturing into dangerous lows, it also helps me sleep. Because of this, my mom now thinks that it's just a sleeping pill even though I already tried explaining that it's a mood stabilizer that works in tandem with my other med. It just so happens that it has the added benefit of helping me sleep.

^((My psychiatrist was supposed to talk to her about my meds this month but I'll be with my dad abroad to help with packing so I can't have an appointment until April.))

I have a hard time sleeping, especially when I'm stressed out or I'm anxious. My brain just goes into overdrive wanting to distract itself rather than just sleeping away our worries. Sometimes, it's bad enough I'm bone tired and have a headache but am still unable to sleep anyway. Ever since I started taking my night meds, I've been able to sleep when I want to but just sleep well in general (provided I'm a bit more lethargic waking up).

Well, lately, since I heard the news about my dad soon-to-be losing his job, I've been extremely stressed out. Usually, when I'm anxious it just manifests into shutting my brain out with external stimuli (e.g., reading books, writing stories, watching videos, etc.). I don't really get panic attacks with more evidently physical symptoms. I've had two in the the past (less than) two weeks. And that's two too many already in such a short amount of time.

Still, again, my meds are actually helping me not to go in an especially bad depressive state. My mood is relatively stable all things considered and I have tried harming myself in nearly a full month. I'm more proactive than idle, and I'm actually productive.

Unfortunately, I've been earning my mother's ire lately for not sleeping at the right time. (My schedule is flipped upside down.) And because she thinks my night meds are just glorified sleeping pills, she's threatening to stop buying them for me. It's the more expensive of my two meds. I understand she's also upset and under a lot of stress because the brunt of managing the household finances is her responsibility. I know she's saying the threats out of anger and I'd like to believe my mother isn't capable of the kind of maliciousness where she'd just stop buying my meds.

Still, I acknowledge that my meds is more expenses she has to think about. I still feel guilty having to need them in the first place. I don't want to risk the possibility that my mom simply stops buying my meds either because she deems it too expensive, useless or both.

So, there. This is the reason why I'm wondering if it's possible to start online fundraising anonymously. I have PayPal with my personal bank account attached to it so online fundraising isn't technically an impossibility. It's more a matter of anonymity. I don't want to cause my parents to lose face just in case my relatives find out. (I made a joke about pretending the fundraiser would be for my birthday in a few weeks but honestly it just rubbed off as entitled to me. So I scratched the idea off my list.)

 I'm sorry it took so long to explain all of this. Or if all of my explanation is unnecessary. I wanted to get all of this out. Please, any advice would help me. And, thank you, in advance.",08Feb2020,1

756,"you can take a look at my post history and think of me as a piece of shit but i don't really care because it's come to the point where i genuinely have stopped caring and stopped treating life as a serious thing but if you're still willing to give me a hand then that'd be cool

i used to have existential crises (which have degenerated to chronic nihilism) because i kept thinking about how everyone i love is going to die and how i'm probably the only person that exists but after going through all that stress i have learnt not to pay much attention to the fact life fucking sucks

now, to get something clear: i'm a 14-year-old over-privileged, self-deprecating, self-aware, subconsciously-malevolent piece of shit and i have all the resources to become someone and somebody (everything that you need to get lucky to get instead of work hard for has been handed to me on a platter) yet i choose not to and just resort to stupid, trivial things in order to redeem myself (in my own eyes, i don't expect others to understand me and therefore don't really bother with trying to prove myself) 

good examples portraying me as an asshole would be me making fun of people for their sense of humour at times (the repetitive ""no u"" stuff) but my ego has become so inflated that even the thought of insulting someone and not making an effort to appear as a tier-1 samaritan that indiscriminately treats everyone in a tolerant manner is nauseating to me and i can't tolerate bearing the thought of stooping as low as the people i criticize

i've come to reject any and all moral principles (i still follow them because having to deal with confrontations is very annoying to me) and don't think of life as meaningful at this point; i haven't had any suicidal or depressive tendencies besides my curiosity of finding out what's beyond the realm of 'life' -- i don't find pleasure in common things anymore. i find something fun and get bored of it really quickly. if i don't, i lose it in one way or another.

i genuinely believe i'm of above-average intelligence which is why i'm greatly pained by all of this shit, thinking that it's an aspect of awareness that leads me to assume such a mentality. i am not someone who infers but someone who operates on logic to figure out behavioural paradigms (including shifts in them, along with how to act), and i use this to be able to justify the fact i consider myself ""intelligent"" when in reality i genuinely think this is hell and i was condemned to perpetuated suffering because of some dogshit unbeknownst to me

759,"There is so much backstory to this so I'll try to keep it as brief as possible to funnel through all of the in-between. 

My sister (33) has been with the same guy (36) since she was 16, he was 19 when they got together. This has been her only boyfriend. He took her virginity, which in the state of Texas is recognized as statutory rape. My parents found out and were furious but decided not to take any further action. Their relationship has been a constant up and down, but we've all tried our best to support whoever it is that she has chosen to love.

Several years have gone by with him going back and forth between jobs not being able to support even just the two of them before the kids came along. Throughout this relationship he has spent thousands of dollars on video games and car parts that they can't afford, leaving his family in financial distress in the process. He is stuck in this constant child-like state, he can't seem to grow the hell up. He has developed a drinking problem and refuses to acknowledge it. He is not physically abusive, as far as I know, but he is no support at all to my sister or his family.

He recently left on a trip to Kentucky to go and meet friends that he games with online, while my sister is currently pregnant with their 4th child (She also works full time). This is not the first trip that he's taken, he left last year to do exactly the same thing.  He's in to the VR gaming, which I have absolutely no clue about to be honest. But he's talked about how he ""can be a different person"" and that he has several ""virtual Relationships."" He's tried showing me different forums that he's on and I've definitely seen some suggestive photos from women. I have no proof that he's cheating, and I have absolutely no idea what goes on with his online friends. This has taken a huge toll on my sister. She has been suffering from severe depression for years and he is incredibly flippant about it. He brushes every concern of hers off as if she's just ""being a woman"" and ""over re-acting."" My family and I have had endless amounts of conversations with her expressing our concerns for her well being as well as the kids. I understand that there is only so much you can do for a person who doesn't want to do better for themselves. I feel like she's given up fighting and I can no longer sit back and watch him destroy my sister and my nieces and nephew. This trip is the last straw for me and I have no idea what to do. I want to confront him, I want to yell at him and tell him to stay in Kentucky, but I can't. I don't know how to help or who to reach out to, my family has been sitting by just watching everything unfold and I can't stop fighting for her or those kids. They deserve so much more.

Everything feels so rushed with psychologists and I feel like the sessions should really be more like 4 or 5 hours long.

766,"For years I had been hanging out with my brother once a week and it seemed like we had a decent relationship. However recently every time we met we started getting into very long arguments over such trivial things that people would be surprised that we could argue about for hours. Arguments would escalate to where he would resort to personal attacks, accusing me of being ignorant, not being on the right political side, etc. I did not make personal attacks on my end and all the hostility and personal attacks are coming from his end. I am an introverted person who prefers to avoid confrontation and like to avoid arguments whenever possible but I find myself getting into these arguments with him despite my attempts to change the subject or keep it civil. At one point I told him he was being argumentative and don't really enjoy talking about politics and he blew up and said he was only arguing about politics because I have such few interests in life that politics is one of the few things we can talk about and that he has no problem with arguing and that I should grow a thicker skin.

After a few weeks of silence and not meeting up, I had called him to see what is going on, and he basically said the entire relationship all this time was never that good and never lived up to his standards, and gave a list of all the things he found wrong with the relationship listing all the negative things he thought about me. He said I have few interests, am socially inexperienced, have poor social skills, compared me to people who have much better social skills than me who he feels much more comfortable and fun hanging with, tells me he can talk to his friends about pop culture but can't talk to me about it because I don't know anything about pop culture, tells me I am making poor decisions in life, kept badgering me and asking me what possible interesting thing I had to talk about and when I gave him some topics I enjoyed talking about he would challenge it and say he is not interested in talking about those things or would say there's not much to talk about there. I am introverted and these personality traits I had all my life and didn't seem stop us from continuing to hang out and seeming to have a good time nonetheless. So I don't know how something that I was my whole life and didn't seem to bother him in the past is suddenly something that he realized he had a huge problem with. There are many things I can work on in my life and improvements I can make, but it didn't seem like he was offering constructive criticism. It seemed like he was tallying up all my defects and weaponizing them to use to personally attack me. In the past, I thought maybe he knew all my flaws and accepted me for who I was. He never even mentioned my lack of social skills or introversion even once in the past. I never knew he had such a problem with me personally until now all of a sudden he mentions his frustrations out of the blue. If he had such a problem with it why did he not let me know or just stop hanging out with me? The odd thing is, he also claims to be introverted at some level too and he also doesn't talk much in social situations so I don't really know why he such a problem with my introversion and lack of social skills when he himself has much of that in common with me.

I would've accepted that things changed and maybe we should not hang out as much or at all anymore, but I was taken aback at suddenly how personal he made this and how he suddenly realized how he never enjoyed hanging out with me in the first place. The relationship from my perspective went from being okay and hanging out every week to complete silence and becoming completely dysfunctional within just a few weeks. But he seems to be telling me that it was never that good in the first place and he just suddenly realized it now.

I don't know if all this is actually all about me as he claims it is, or he is having a tough time in life and he irrationally is taking it out on me, if he some mental issue, abusing drugs, etc. All I know is there seems to have been a very sudden personality change I am only finding out about now that is making it very uncomfortable for me to even be in the same room with this person and I am really hesitant to go to family gatherings where I would encounter him.

Is telling other family members about this unfair in the sense that it is spreading rumors and dysfunction around when it is private matter between the two people? Or is such a significant change in personality possibly a front for a deeper issue such as mental illness, drug abuse, or some other significant issue that maybe the entire family should know about?

If I do not let family members know and just not attend family gatherings, many of them would feel like I am acting distant and that I don't want to hang out with them anymore when it is because of this one person that I have a problem with. They would think that I am avoiding them and that I am the problem. Although I could attend the family gathering, they would notice that I never talk to him anymore, avoid him, and it would be very awkward and mentally taxing for me just being there. If I do let them know what happened, it could work out, but on the other hand they could think I am spreading rumors and trying to cause division and forcing them to pick sides. I tend to avoid drama and am surprised to find myself in this awkward situation that I don't know how to get out of.",08Feb2020,1

In the recordings you can hear my dad tell me to stop anytime I stand up for myself. I took audio recordings because nobody's ever believed me when I said my stepmom was batshit; so I did it to prove a point to everyone. I have been living with my mom (I'm a minor) and have refused to talk to my dad. I'm also in the process of getting a restraining order against my stepmom. My dad keeps trying to reach out and make amends through texts and gifts. I've told him to stop and that I don't want to see or talk to him and I will not make amends unless he divorces her. My mom and therapist say I'm being unreasonable but I don't think the trauma she's caused me is worth still seeing my dad. This abuse has happened for years now and her kids have it worse (CPS has been called and won't do shit). If anyone has advice please leave it. In conclusion, am I the asshole here?",08Feb2020,1

I never made a move because of that existing relationship but now I fear I might be in the friend zone. I hang out at her apartment a lot and she compliments me often. Yesterday she asked me to run errands with her and said that she didn’t actually need my help, but just wanted to spend time with me. We go to exercise classes together and have been talking about activities we want to do together. We‘ve gone out for dinner a few times.

So she does lots of suggestive stuff that really makes me think she likes me. But I’d really be going out on a limb because our relationship thus far has been platonic. Or maybe all the things she says and does with me are a green light to try?? I’m nervous about shooting my shot and throwing out friendship out the window.

For my sister’s wedding it was my mom shelling out money for whatever my sister wanted (or even didn’t). But for mine, so far she has acted very matter of fact, “here’s a small sum, I’m done with it”. My dad on the other hand has seemed pretty lax about how much he’s willing to spend.

784,"Tl;dr: i have driving anxiety and I’m afraid I can’t get through it. I’ve been rear ended twice on the same highway and I’m afraid other people will hit me. I tried therapy, but it ended up giving me more anxiety when my therapist said, “if you don’t conquer your fear of driving, it’s gonna be harder for you as you get older and it might stay like that for the rest of your life.” It didn’t help and now I’m terrified of driving. I know I need to get out there, but I’m so scared of people crashing into me and I might possibly get hurt/die. 

My uncle, siblings, and parents got into car accidents (not the same accident) when I was little and it terrified me to the point where I told myself that I have to be super careful on the road at all time. 

I got my drivers license at 18 and driving was a piece of cake. I am a very careful/cautious driver and aware of my surroundings at all times. I took driving seriously and I don’t like driving for “fun.” I’ve never receive a ticket or anything of that sort. Last year (24 years old), I got rear ended while entering a highway by someone who was on their phone while driving. My car was totaled and ever since that day, I’ve been terrified to be on the road, especially that highway where I got into an accident.

I have massive driving anxiety because I’m afraid other people will hit me. I tried driving on that same highway with a friend to help calm my nerves down and I got rear ended again (bad luck), but it’s not as bad. Ever since that two accidents from the highway, I’m so terrified to drive. I can drive to local places or familiar areas, but I’m terrified of new areas/highways.

785," I struggle a lot with social anxiety so therefore making new friends seems impossible.

Anyhow, since nursery I spent my younger years with this friend. We would play all the time during nursery and would hang out afterwards. When we started school we went to different ones since his family moved a couple hours away to the countryside. However we still kept in contact and although less often, we had sleep overs a couple times each year. This continued even during highschool. We would hang out play games, watch anime, draw and other geeky stuff which we didn't experience with our classmates. 

During highschool I was very depressed but we still hung out and had fun. Fast forward a few years, he suddenly started making racist remarks about immigrants. The first few times I found it odd but, thought he was joking. One thing to note in this relationship is that I am black and he's white. Majority in this country is white. So I might therefore already relate to the struggles of the ""outsiders"" in this country. But where I lived which was a urban city, one would experience a more diverse group of people, but on the countryside where he lived it was very singular in who lived there. The countryside in this country from personal experiences and voting wise is pretty racist or rather closeminded. 

So therefore I kinda blame this on his surroundings and him being easily influenced. I remember during highschool he wholeheartedly believed mermaids had been found because there was a documentary he saw with footage of it. I also remember one time when we went to buy candy and there was a beggar outside the entrance. He found this person disgusting and was sure this beggar must be a scammer, without any particular reasoning. My overanalysis of the past is that he's easily influenced by media, blind to the narrative many conservative outlets present. These ideas are very popular right now in our country's media. 

Well... the comments hurt me, regardless of them not being directed at me. His view on culturally different people saddened me, since I knew him as this, lighthearted mostly kind person. Seeing him identify more with this rhetoric hurt me. At the time this happened I was extremely depressed and couldn’t deal with this, although I did tell him those comments saddened me which he was suprised by. Of course he started giving me examples of how the immigrants were ruining everything, how ugly their languages were, followed by more prejudice and mockery.  I knew these points were incorrect, but for these type of arguments you need hyper specified statistics and research for him to agree. I am not interested in researching these pointless arguments to find ""evidence"" that allow me to remove this layer of him which I see as a ugly stain on a decent person. 

Now it’s been a few years without us talking, since I've been focused my time battling my depression. Recently  he sent a message asking what had happened to me and wanting to hear  from me, missing our conversations like the ones we used to have.

We didn’t end on bloodboiling terms, with my depression I simply faded away from this friendship. I believe he is a decent person on the inside and we both miss eachother. Now I struggle knowing what to do, I have not spent my years researching these stupid points, instead on things which I deem more important. This kind of research only has one use in my opinion, which is to overthrow someone in a debate, which is not my calling. I can't memorize every single statistic, neither do I find it interesting to learn.

791,"Hello everyone,

So I have this “friend” who I have known for two years since my freshman year in college .... right now I am a junior. Freshman year I wasn’t really friends with her and we went to parties like 3-4 times with a group of girls. But sophomore year we started becoming closer and closer but I feel like she isn’t a true friend. 

1) she almost never initiates to hangout...maybe once or twice, it’s always me which texts her and says “hey u wanna grab something on campus” she does text first a lot but never initiates or plans.
2) we have shared Chegg and Netflix and Disney+ account between our whole groups. The Chegg and Netflix is connected to my card so when they money gets taken I Venmo request everyone. But she always pays super duper late, everyone pays in a reasonable time but I have to remind her 20+ times to pay. 
3) when we have gatherings, she never brings anything, especially at like Christmas parties, Halloween parties or gathering she never says anything or brings anything and never helps or contributes with anything, even tho she is a pretty wealthy person. 
4) every time when I initiate the hangout, she always shows up like 2 hours late. Let’s say she’s supposed to meet me like at 5 PM she doesn’t come until 7 or 8 and never apologizes. And this happened multiple times. 
5) The most recent time, like TODAY she finally initiated to hangout, so I got SO excited and I was like yay! And she does “actually I reached out Bc I need help with coding haha so let’s not go anywhere” which I found so rude for some reason. 



I know I sound so mean :( but I am very pissed Bc I feel like my friendship is very one sided.... am I hallucinating? Should I say anything to her? Or do you think I shouldn’t say anything and slowly back away from her? which will be hard since she’s in my friend group also (thx to me!)",08Feb2020,1

802,"I have a friend, I’ve known her since year seven and been best friends with her since I turned 12. Recently she moved away, and I haven’t seen her since august. As times gone on, more and more things just keep ringing alarm bells in my head, and I can’t stay friends with her.

Yesterday I had some party going on with friends and a few weeks before she asked a group of us to meet up. I told her it wasn’t possible because of this other  meet up and after party that had been planned months in advance, that I’d be hungover the next day and I wouldn’t be good company to be around, I also didn’t want it to be the first time I’ve seen her in six months and be miserable and bad company because ultimately I’ve missed her an incredible amount.

Yesterday was the party and I was messaging her saying it was a bit rubbish and that I wasn’t nearly drunk enough, but I was enjoying myself.  To which she replied with “so you could have met me tomorrow” but this wasn’t the after party. This sounds stupid but I was gobsmacked she ruined the first part of the night by this guilt hanging over me. I told her I had the after party next and it was supposed to be really fun, which she just took a video of her rolling her eyes. I carried on talking to her but she wouldn’t say anything back. So I stopped talking and ignored her, she’s said nothing to me. 

Now I think about it not once has she asked how I am. Not once has she cared when I told her my achievements or failures, she brushes it off saying it’s not relevant to her. Not once has she ever taken a second out of her day to message me first.

On the flip side I ask her everyday how she is, I talk through her problems. Last week she was in a fucking terrifying situation, as something had happened at a party she was and she was lost and couldn’t find her friends. She went quiet and I was manically ringing and texting to see if she was ok, I was hundreds of miles away trying to get in contact with anyone. She didn’t say thank you once. 

I’m always the first to message, she repeats what she says to the people she left behind like a script:

“I miss you guys so much”
“I talk about you everyday to everyone of my friends”
“I want you to come down and see me”

We’ve both had serious issues, and I don’t think she’s ever been there to support me. I’ve been in a manipulative relationship with a guy and I had months of not being able to trust anyone, then when I was getting better she said her situation was so much worse then mine, that I’m lucky I got over it so quickly and she’s been through so much more then me. She makes me feel guilty because my parents are together, she makes me feel guilty because my household looks more wealthy then hers. Telling me I can’t relate to her when I can’t afford to go out because I can just ask my parents for money, which I can’t.  Telling me that I can’t have the same issues as her, that I will never be able to have depression because I have a lucky life.  I’m not allowed to feel depressed or stressed or down because her situation is always worse then mine. 

Even looking back at what I’m saying makes me feel incredibly guilty, I’ve just said horrible things about her, and what I’ve said seems incredibly petty. Can someone just knock me in my place, tell me I’m being dramatic and to be grateful that she’s my friend.  I feel ungrateful and I think I just needed to rant. 

Can someone just give me advice on what to do from here and give me perspective?

Throwaway because I have some friends who know my reddit account. I've (M17) been dating my GF (F16) for about 5 months now. And I like her and shes great and I don't think I deserve someone like her. She's told me that she loves me and I say it back, but I'm not sure if I do. Sometimes I find myself making up excuses to not hangout with her. We have different interests and hobbies so it can be hard to find common interests making the relationship a little rough at times. But this isn't the main reason I'm here. There's this other girl (F16) who I liked before I knew my GF. She rejected me \~9 months ago but we've remained good friends. Both of us deal with pretty bad depression and we often talk to one another about our depression and how we're doing. We might go weeks at a time without texting but whenever one of us needs someone to talk to we're always there for one another. She's always been there for me when I need her and I like to think I've been there for her just as much. Like I said before she rejected me some months back, but I don't think I've ever stopped having feelings for her. I like my GF but I don't think I'm happy with the relationship and I'm not sure if we're compatible. I've pretty much admitted to myself that I have stronger feelings for this other girl than my GF. I would break up with her but there's a few reasons why I don't. First I care for her and I don't want her to feel bad. Second I don't think this other girl feels the same because of her rejecting me a while ago. Lastly, my friendship with this other girl is extremely valuable to me. She's the only person I feel comfortable talking to about my depression. Without her I wouldn't be alive, she talked me out of committing suicide a few months ago. I couldn't bear to not have her in my life. But I'm scared if I tell her how I feel she'll reject me again and then she will be out of my life.

807,"About two year ago I moved to a new school. I didn't have any friends and I thought that I'd befriend some of my new classmates. However something happend to me before going there that made me really sad so during the first few weeks of school I was a lot quieter than usual.

So naturally I became the ""quiet kid"" and I didn't succeed in making friends. For months I tried really hard to talk to as many people as possible and I made a few friends. 

The problem is that I don't know if they are really my friends. Sometimes I think they like me, sometimes I think I annoy them, sometimes I'm sure they like me and sometimes they just completely ignore me. I often feel like I'm their last resort like they'll only talk to me if there's nothing that's more entertaining. The thing that bothers me the most is that I never get invited to anything. They often hang out together but they never bother to ask if I want to join. They also have a private group on messenger that I'm not part of.

 I have a huge fear of rejection so I couldn't muster up the courage in a thousand years to just straight up ask. I'm still dealing with what happend and I'm still quite sad so my social skills are roughly equal to a teaspoon's but I try really hard to be entertaining but I always get left out or ignored.

808,"Hi all.
Really looking for your thoughts on my actions , wether or  not I acted irrational, stupid or what not.

So to set the scene.

I am waiting in my local Indian,which today is exceptionally busy.After pre ordering on the phone , I'm still waiting a further 20 minutes and this for anyone would piss them off , but I sit and wait like everybody else.

A guy around 50/55 comes in (intoxicated) and Is just being loud , drunk and annoying. I think nothing of it as we have all been there.This guy has apparently also ore ordered on the phone and has been waiting an hour?? He was actually there for like 10 minutes, bit I can appreciate his frustration if he had pre ordered....but like I said the place was very busy

So we all finally get our food all at the same time ( myself , the drunk guy and a guy who the drunk guy seems to know and is chatting too)

As we are giving out food this guy takes it upon himself to , not say but shout how ""shit the service is"" how ""fucking pathetic they are "" and how "" these Pakis provide fucking shit service""

At this point I couldn't hold my tounge and my temper got the better off me. I told him to shut the fuck up and fuck off "" 

The guy was an snooty , obnoxious fuck who , had to make the whole premises known his feelings. 

The Indian guy who had served him , was just trying to diffuse this and kept asking him to go but the drunk guy just would not let it go!

At the point of me voicing my opinion he then turned to me and told me to ""Sit the fuck down""  in which this enraged me even more and I told him "" to come outside and say these pathetic racist remarks to me ""


During this whole time the guy who he was chatting with ( not drunk) was trying to now diffuse the drunk guy and I.

I wanted to punch the guys head off as he was nothing but a bully. All I could see was red.


Long story short I ended up following the guy home ( making my presence known ) just to put some kind of fear into him!

I must add I actually live on the same route this guy went so I didnt initially go out of my way to follow him.
And I must stress , I would never be some kind of weirdo that would sit outside his house or take it any further , it just happens that we where going the same way. 

I Just want him to think what if?? 
Who was that guy I told to sit the fuck down ?
Have i made a mistake??
Is this guy crazy??


The guy was a racist bully , I stood up for what I thought was right. Although my temper took it further than what I wanted.

Thoughts guys??

809,"This happened about 6 or 7months ago now. I (19M) had a friend, Michaela (19). Her and I had a close friendship. This bond formed at the start of our final year of high school (2018) and continued into the earlier months of 2019. We spoke every day, saw each other at least a couple of times a week and we were comfortable enough to share our deepest feelings with each other. It was great.

One day, Michaela just stopped messaging me. Ignored all my texts and calls and I tried asking her mom if she was okay and all I got was ""She's fine, I'm sure she'll message you."" She never did. My close friend just abandoned me for no reason. I tried thinking of something I had done to cause this, but I am 100% sure that things were on a good note between us before she ghosted me. I know that Michaela had recently had her car stolen and that life was a bit overwhelming for her at that point in time, so I figured she needed some space and that she'd be back when she was ready.

Weeks turned to months and I eventually realised I wasn't going to hear from her again. She couldn't have chosen worse timing either. At the time, I was struggling to deal with the loss of my brother (car accident) and I had moved to a new city all on my own so life was just very difficult at that time. I was really counting on her to be there for me. Normally, I wouldn't be too phased if somebody decided to leave my life. Sometimes people feel they need somebody out of their lives and that's perfectly okay. However, it was the way she did it that hurt. To just completely abandon me and ghost me without warning, especially when we were so close. She was a person I trusted to always be there for me when I needed her, as I would be there for her too. If she had explained to me that she didn't want to be my friend any more and at least given me fair reasoning and warning, I wouldn't be typing this right now.

Truth is, I still haven't forgiven her for it. She abandoned me and it hurts to this day. It makes me angry to think about it. I have no closure and no insight as to why she did it. I am wondering if confronting her about it and gaining some closure is a good idea or if it will just rub salt into the wounds and make a shitty situation even worse. So, Reddit, should I confront my ex-friend for abandoning me?",08Feb2020,1
811,"I'm a perfectionist, I'm hard on myself and I blame myself even when it's not my fault. How do I know this? Because I had a full-blown panic attack yesterday, the whole nine-yards; heavy breathing, short breathing, sobbing, blurry vision, muscle tightness, and chest pain. It took 5 hours for me to fully calm down and that entire evening I refused to eat and I had this issue over something that is not my fault--but I always see it as my fault.

I'm a sophomore in high school and I try really hard with academics. I have A's in everything except for math and science (we'll get to that later) and the reason why I'm not as good in math and science is that I have Dyscalculia or math dyslexia which makes it hard for me to properly understand math and science subjects. I'm fine in math mostly because I have a good teacher and retakes are an option in my class but science? I'm taking honors chemistry this year because chemistry is a requirement and I thought taking honors would help me because it's weighted...it didn't. In fact, right now I have an F in the class and like I said before when I saw my grade yesterday I lost it and even though I know realize that grade is not my fault I still couldn't handle it.

I feel stupid when I see that, even if the grade is only temporary, and I feel so highly of myself in English, History, and career geared classes that when I feel like failed in harder classes for me it really ruins my self worth and lowers my confidence. To me when I see bad stuff like that it feels like this is forever, everything is ruined, and no one will want me. I just couldn't help but think to myself that I would never get into a good college, that I'm going to fail this semester, and won't get credit for it for this year and have to retake everything over again...I have a very destructive mentality. In reality, I'm fine, I have more than enough time to switch into regular chemistry and get an B or possibly even an A and take a retake in math which will also raise my grade.

I need to learn how to calm down, does anyone have tips on how to deal with academic stress and how to be more relaxed and reflective when it comes to this stuff?",08Feb2020,1
812,"Two years ago I moved to a new school. I didn't have any friends so I thought I'd befriend some of my new classmates. However something happened to me that made me really sad so during the first few weeks of school I was a lot quieter than usual. So naturally I became the ""quiet kid"" and I didn't succeed in making friends. For months I tried really hard to talk to as many people as possible and I made a few friends. The problem is that I don't know if they are really my friends. Sometimes I think they like me, sometimes I think I annoy them, sometimes I'm sure they like me and sometimes they just completely ignore me. I often feel like I'm their last resort like they'll only talk to me if there's nothing that's more entertaining. The thing that bothers me the most is that I never get invited to anything. They often hang out together but they never bother to ask if I want to join. They also have a private group on messenger that I'm not part of.  I have a huge fear of rejection so I couldn't muster up the courage in a thousand years to just straight up ask. I'm still dealing with what happend and I'm still quite sad so my social skills are roughly equal to a teaspoon's but I try really hard to be entertaining but I always get left out or ignored. I've never been this lonely in my life and I get sadder every day. I just want a few genuine friends who I can talk to and hang out with. How can I improve my friendship with them and how can I get invited?",08Feb2020,1
813,"Yesterday my boss sent an email using language I very clearly used in our own team meeting to address a totally different concern. It's like they lift my concepts and apply it to everything. This happens very frequently and others on my team have had this happen to them as well without any recognition. The boss is pretty insecure and fails to recognize people for their hard work, thinking rather the work our team does makes them look good. 

The worst part of all is that it makes me not want to volunteer ideas even when we need desperately to make changes to our works process.

Part of me says I should be happy that I'm heard, but the ego or something else in me says losing this kind of recognition prevents me from moving up in this company (and out from under this boss).",08Feb2020,1
814,"My brother and I have an amazing relationship. I can say with confidence that he's my best friend. Currently, we both live at home. He's finishing up his junior year in high school. And works a part-time job. I also work part-time, but obviously more than he would. I make (before tax) around $1800 a month. He would be making around $700-$850. a month. We found a few apartments ranging from 450-900 dollars a month. And I'm confident we could manage rent in a timely manner and have enough to survive rather comfortably.

But that leads to my question. Would this be strange/immature of me to do? I've been looking for a new place for a while. And a couple of the apartments we're looking at were apartments I was debating on moving into anyway. My brother just threw the suggestion of being roommates out one day, and we've been rolling with it ever since. But Obviously, his high-school, and post-high-school education is the priority. And I'm not sure if this is the best move for him. Obviously, it wouldn't be 50/50 on rent and other necessities. We'd probably do something like a 30-70 split on everything. We're essentially roommates already. Hell, a lot of the time - we'll sleep in the same room, and watch movies, and play games, and shit. So, this wouldn't be anything new. I'm just curious what all of you think. Should we pursue this, or not?",08Feb2020,1
815,"I'll finally admit it. I'm not okay.

I'm 18/M and all I do is drink and feel like crap 24/7. I've tried seeing a therapist and that really didn't work. I've tried exercising more and forcing myself to do stuff and that had no effect. I've tried socializing more and that didn't work either.

Most of my problems started after I broke up with my ex gf. I honestly think it was the worst decision I ever made. Her family and I never got along so I figured I'd let her go because I was older and things were only going to get more dramatic between her brother and I. Over the summer I told her how I felt and she told me that her new boyfriend was soooo much better than me and that he did more for her in the 1st 2 weeks of their relationship than I did in a year. I'm still crushed.

After I heard that I went crazy on self-improvement. I went to the gym all the time and I started investing my money but I still wasn't happy. I've spent the last year and a half in misery. I feel like I'm living in a perpetual headache. I'm extremely depressed. I didn't want to admit it but I seriously think I'm depressed. I drink heavily most weekends and its the only thing that gets me through the week.

I'm now super self-conscious about my height and looks. I'm afraid that I'll never meet another girl again because I'm a short guy (5'3-5''4). I've honestly contemplated suicide and I'm not proud of it. My dad works for a local college so I can get free tuition for a number of schools so that's really the only thing keeping me alive. I leave for uni in Aug. and I really hope I can meet someone there. I know MGTOW is a really big thing these days but I really do want to meet a girl. I don't want to spend my life alone and miserable because I'm short. I've posted on Reddit a few times and people flat out told me it'll be extremely difficult to meet women post high school due to my height and that I should settle for whoever gives me the time of day. Of course, this makes me feel worse.

Most nights I just drink and cry alot. I don't feel like I have a future worth living for. I know I should be glad that I don't have cancer or a missing limb but I can't shake this feeling of doom. Anyone have any advice? Am I really screwed? What is wrong with me?",08Feb2020,1

It’s embarrassing to say because most people I’ve known had at least one job but I’ve applied since I was 16 and only had one job interview at a Hardee’s. It’s become frustrating because I basically have to rely on my parents for money when I need clothes or personal items. I don’t want to do that..its not fun but the only money I’ve gotten was my financial aid refund. That went mostly towards the bills in the house and getting stuff I needed. I wanted to save up for a car originally but ended up not being able to. 

My step dad always makes the comment on how I don’t have a job and I am trying..I applied to many over the last few months. But it’s also pretty difficult to get to a job when you don’t have a car and no public transportation available. I had to take this semester off because my mom could no longer help take me to school. My older brother, when he moved with us for a bit, got a job in a week because my step dad got him a spot at his own job. They both would gang up on me and just go off on how I don’t do anything basically (I was entering my fall semester in college, I wasn’t not doing anything, but that didn’t count as doing much to them). I guess I was a bit bitter at that because I have been trying..I don’t know what I’m doing wrong though? My older sister says I need to call them a few days later and let them know I’m interested in an interview and a position and I’ve never done that.

822,"Back in High School, I used to have really bad social anxiety but I was still able to go out and meet new people as long as I had people I knew well with me. I'm really good at making friends online and conversation comes easy. I even meet up with most of my online friends eventually and I don't feel like it's meeting a stranger because usually we will be friends for a year or so more before we meet. I've gotten much better with socializing now that I work in retail.

However, I recently started getting really close with my co workers. They want to hang out tonight. Yet, I run into this hesitation and anxiety. It's something I've felt before. When my in real life friends ask me to hangout I always hesitate and I end up flaking or bailing on them. I don't do this with my online friends that I meet up with. Part of it is because I know there's going to be guys there that are into me. I'm not sure if its because I had a lot of time to get to know my online friends before we hangout or if there's something wrong with me?

823,"I’m 21 and I constantly have flashbacks to an apartment I lived in in my youth, probably around the age of 5 or 6. It’s been this way for years. Every time I have a flashback I have a dark eerie feeling attached to it, kind of like scared but more just darkness and shame. I feel all this but I have no idea why. All I can see is a flashback of the apartment, and also a flashback of a toy I had as a kid, on the ground outside of my apartment. I’ve had a relatively good childhood, parents have been divorced for the longest time, but good relationship with both. Not really any abuse that I can remember. Why do I keep having these flashbacks? I also randomly have imagined thoughts  about getting attacked in my day to day life, it’s definitely often I that I think this.

829,"Ok so my friend, a 16 year old (f) in England, has her horses at this kinda crappy yard. She has two horses and one recently got diagnosed with chronic Lymphangitis (clogged blood flow). Shes been having to work a job while caring for this horse 24/7 and working towards GCSEs (big english exams). During this, she wasn’t able to give the other one much attention and stable-wise, was only able to do a light muck-out and clean of the place, nothing too extreme but admittedly much less then she should have. 

This is where the boomer comes in. She’s a sixty year lady who’s not known to be the nicest in the first place, but is super passionate about horses, app. she has a bias towards teenagers but what boomer doesn’t. Also has a liking towards publicly humiliating people.  Friend asked for her to take her horses out into the yard while at work, saying that she’d clean the stables later that day. When she arrived later, the bedding of the stable had been dragged out in front and Lady™️ had gathered the rest of the occupants around. Thus ensued the screaming. She began by throwing a fit at how lazy the youth of today are and how irresponsible they are. After successfully reducing the 16yro to tears, she told them that she had 28 days to get her horses a new place and to get off her property without a previous warning. 

Although I’m ultimately defending my friend here, I understand she was in the wrong. Neglecting her horse, no matter how slightly, isn’t a good thing and Friend completely understands and agrees that she fucked up. Though kicking a girl with a job, school and two horses of responsibility out of the stables for that is overkill especially in front of a crowd is overkill, at least to me.

I'm 18 and a sophomore in college. My parents have been emotionally and mentally abusive all my life. I didn’t know where I was born until I was 15 and applying for colleges because apparently I’ve been living here illegally (from canada, my parents pay taxes and everything please don’t hate on me because I didn’t choose to come here illegally I was legit two months old). My parents never let me go out or join any school clubs or anything because they were afraid I’d do something stupid and get in trouble. Then, I found out I have two half siblings that my parents hid my entire life. This probably seems like its not that big of a deal but there’s more.  

I tried to attempt three times, the first time I overdosed when I was 15 and my dad forced to throw up and kept me home for two weeks. He never even took me to the hospital and to this day I am sure it is the cause of my stomach problems. I attempted again within three weeks and finally got hospitalized and told my school about the physical abuse I was facing at home. Child Protections Services got involved but my parents kept telling me my life would be ruined if I said anything negative so I gave up and lied and said everything was fine. I figured I could get out of this house if I graduated at 16. I worked my ass off and studied every minute I could. My parents never let me hang out with friends and never got me help for depression. Once I  got to university they would call me every ten minutes, theyd make me leave them on video calls to make sure I went to sleep and my mom monitored my school work (mind you I had high honor roll throughout high school and took high level courses). She started harassing my friends this past fall semester making sure I was in my dorm and no where else. She would call me in the middle of class and SCREECH over the phone if I didn’t leave class to pick up the phone. My boyfriend and best friend became aware of my parents’ behavior and became very concerned. In the fall my parents would started texting my room mate if I didn’t pick up their phone or call them first thing in the morning. My parents threatened me several times that they were coming up to campus and withdrawing me from university if I didn’t pick up their calls. Several times I packed and unpacked my room. They’ve scared the living shit out of me several times and then retracted on it. They forced me to stay home this semester and go to a commuter campus within my college, not for money reasons, but to keep an eye on me. I’m grateful that I am still able to go to school but I wish I did not have to stay at home. Things are getting harder here and my mom has a serious toll on my mental health.  I try to make it to seven pm everyday just so I can live. I can’t type anymore because I cant stop crying so if you need more info you can ask.  The only thing stopping me from leaving is that I don't own a car and they're funding my education. ALSO i had a scholarship but my mom said we dont have that money anymore and I am 100% sure it is because she used my scholarship money on something else or shes lying to guilt trip me into doing the major she wants me to do.

834,"My best friend texted me on New Year's Day and said she was officially done with human beings, so if I didn't hear from her for several months, I shouldn't be alarmed. I asked her what happened, and she didn't respond. I've been sending her encouraging texts every few weeks or so just to say that I am here if she wants to talk, and care that I care about her, or i send her funny things I find. She hasn't responded. If I still haven't heard from her by March, I'm tempted to go knock on her door and tell her I'm not leaving til she tells me what's going on, but I don't know if I should. 

I mentioned this to another friend, and she said that I should respect my best friend's desire to not talk (boundaries), or I may end up pushing her away. And I'm struggling because on the one hand, she absolutely has the right to want space and time away from people. I'm not one of those friends who needs to be in contact with all my friends all the time, I can go weeks or months at a time without talking, but I do still worry about them. She moved back up here because she wanted to be close to me, and now who knows when I'm going to see her again? 

Am I right to be worried about her? As far as I know, she's still working and interacting with people at work, but she won't respond to any of my messages. I half wonder if it's something I did or not.

I get that people do sometimes disappear for months at a time to relax and focus on self-care, and I'm all for that. But at the same time, I feel like I need to check on her. Would it be wrong of me to give it one more month and then go knock on her door and tell her I'm not leaving til she tells me what's going on? I don't want her to feel like she can't have space, but at the same time, I feel like I have a right to know what's going on, since I'm her best friend. 

I want to help her. Should I leave her be until she decides to text me back? Do I go knock on her door in a month? Do I mail her, ""thinking of you"" cards? I don't want her to think I was never there for her by me not doing more to reach out to her, but I also don't want to annoy or anger her by trying to reach out when she requested space. 

TLDR: Best friend moved up here to be close to me, now says she doesn't want any human contact for several months, without an explanation of what happened. Not sure if I should respect this or go check on her.",08Feb2020,1
835,"So I (18F) started uni in September and I’ve been pretty happy so far. I enjoy the feeling of independence and I like meeting new people despite having had problems with socialising before (I.e. bullying early on in primary school and being very quiet up until I was around 16-17 years old). I also have some trouble with intimacy with close family members (I.e. I tend to get awkward if someone says or does something intimate and I feel obligated to reciprocate it). I’m generally really comfortable talking to strangers and friends who I’m not close with (people who I see maybe once a week at most), but I’m finding myself more and more uncomfortable when hanging out in small groups or one on one with the few friends who I have started to become more close with.

I go quiet and make the whole situation awkward because I can’t think of anything to say. I’ve really started to obsess over what they think of me and I’m constantly worried that I’ll do something to make them dislike me. Whenever one of them says something nice about me I cringe a little because I feel like it’s exaggerated or wrong (even though i don’t usually feel inadequate or have poor self image) and that they’ll find out they are wrong and think of me as a fraud. I can’t shake the feeling that they are pretending to like me even though I don’t actually have any evidence that they are.

It’s starting to affect my behaviour around them a lot. I don’t make any effort to start conversations or ask them if they want to spend time together because it makes me worried. One of my friends messaged me the other day to ask if they had done something wrong because it seemed like I was avoiding them. They’ve also noticed that I’m quiet when talking to them and that I don’t seem to make any effort to carry a conversation with them.
I’ve also had a few episodes where I’ve gotten back to my uni accommodation after seeing friends and started crying and hyperventilating because I thought I’d said or done something stupid or something that made me look like a bad person (even though my friends didn’t give any indication that I had).

I’ve done this before with other groups of friends and it’s very rare that I become close enough to a person to be comfortable around them one on one. I have only ever had three friends that I could be completely comfortable around.

I’m scared to talk to anybody that I know about this because I’m afraid that it will affect their perception of me or at the very least it will make to problem worse because I will start to feel more like they are changing their behaviour so that they don’t upset me.
I feel like if I don’t change something soon, I’ll start to get distant and push people away and I’ll be back to square one with no friends. I really like these people and don’t want to lose their friendship.

Does anybody have any advice on what I could do try and reduce these feelings and make myself a little more confident in small groups of people?",08Feb2020,1

839,"I recently ordered earrings from a small business on Instagram. I gave the jeweler my address but I accidentally typed part of the address wrong and I forgot to write the zip code. A few hours later the jeweler let me know they had sent. I then went back to my original message and noticed the errors in my original message. I told her about these errors and she said it was too late to fix. I said I would let her know when/if I receive the package. 

It has been a few weeks and I still haven’t received my order. When I let her know this, she said she can send me a new pair for half price. At this point, I don’t know what’s fair...should I ask for a refund? Should I ask for the new pair for free? Should I just pay for a new order at half price?

I acknowledge that I made an error in my original message but I feel like she should have at least asked me for my zip code before sending me the order.

842,"hi, i literally don’t have anywhere else to turn for help so here i am on reddit. i am 20 years old, and i will be officially homeless on monday morning. i work full time as a caregiver and had my own apartment for two years, i had escaped my abusive dad. however, my life went to shit. 

my “best friend” sexually assaulted me, attempting to rape me. i got a few threats from him after, he came to my apartment late at night banging on the door multiple times, yelling for me. i couldn’t get a restraining order because i didn’t have any “proof”. he got a group of people together and they broke into my apartment 3 times. 

i had to leave, i didn’t feel safe. the only place i had to go was back to my parents house. most of my stuff was stolen in the break in, they stole my bank info and I had no money. i didn’t have renters insurance so i couldn’t get reimbursed and the cops never arrested him. 

my dad is starting to act the same way he did when I lived there previously. he’s now threatening me and he’s threatening to kill my cat, my moms cat and my sister’s dog. he’s also been threatening to throw my mom, my little sister and my little brother out onto the streets but my mom is refusing to leave. 

he’s emotionally abusing her. he won’t let her get an actual job (he makes her do all the bookwork for his company and DOESNT pay her), he won’t let her have friends, he yells at her anytime she visits her mom, he’s threatening to take the car, the house, and leave her with nothing. 

&amp; i have to be out by the time he gets home on monday. 

i have no credit, very little savings, im going to be living in my car with the few possessions i can take with me and my poor sweet cat who doesn’t deserve any of this. 

i’m so lost and scared. i don’t know what to do. i lost all of my friends when i reported the man who assaulted me. i need help, or advice. i don’t know where to park to sleep at night. i don’t know what to do with my cat while im at work, i don’t know what to do.

848,"From age 5 to 19, I have been struggling with generalized anxiety disorder without treating it with psychotherapy or medication. Eventually, I chose to take an antidepressant fluoxetine for the anxiety. Initially it helped, but it made things a bit rough in other ways in terms of irritability so my psychiatrist at the time added lamotrigine (generic Lamictal) to stabilize my anxiety further. It helped and ""did the trick"" but I ended up gaining 45 pounds, become apathetic, my sex drive vanished, and developed gynecomastia.

Eventually in mid-2019, I decided to taper off my psychiatric medications because my PA agreed with me that feeling like a zombie may not be advantageous if I could remain in remission while being free of side effects. So she rocked the boat, metaphorically speaking by doing a taper. In February of 2020, I came off the fluoxetine (came of the lamotrigine a few months earlier) and I've been off it for five days and so far I feel no changes in moods or side effects.

I don't know if feeling blunted and disconnected from my environment is how I should feel. I've been feeling this way for a few years and don't fully remember what it's like to feel like myself in the past. I talked it my therapist about it and even though he claimed and stressed to be neutral in opinion, he claimed to be fine with my decision to discontinue the meds as long ""as I remain stable"". I didn't like that language as it implied that I am somehow broken for having mental health problems. He also frequently asked me if I was having suicidal thoughts. He asked that that 6 times over 9 sessions. I was never hospitalized for a mental health issue BTW.

I eventually stopped seeing him because I felt he thought me what I needed to learn and I wonder if I am going to feel like a zombie for the rest of my life. Nobody can give me a definitive answer. I don't know if I'm depressed or not but I don't want to go back on the antidepressant. I have to put up with these side effects, not my prescriber. However, many of my mental health professionals dismissed my comments as ""lacking insight into his situation"" or ""not loving himself"".

I feel like I am constantly being beaten down by people who are supposed to help me. I recently tried to get a consultation for a double mastectomy for the gynecomastia, and while my insurance covered the consultations, they are currently refusing to cover the surgery since it was deemed ""not medically necessary by a doctor who works for the insurance company"".

I am trying an appeal to see if that works. I would feel self-conscious about my breasts, but I feel absolutely nothing. I just feel like a robot and thought stopping the medications would fix the problem but so far, no dice. The reason why this bugs me is that if I feel depersonalized, then I would have to live with it, not my family members, nor my prescribers.

I tried exercising but I keep getting exhausted and fail to keep endurance. My financial situation isn't helping this matter either. I need help. I don't know if I'm going to feel like this for the rest of my life.",08Feb2020,1
849,"Tonight there’s a couple of parties going on, one for the boys, one for the girls, in my year. I chose not to get close to many people in my year, so I understood if I didn’t get invited to the girls thing, I just didn’t expect people who were less rated than me to be invited.

There r 2 girls, that literally follow me around at parties, or want to be around me at school. And as much as they are fun people, whenever anyone gets to a weird level of wanting to be around me, I suddenly don’t want to be around them at all. Maybe that’s normal, or maybe something inside me just doesn’t like being tied to one group.

Anyways, these two girls were invited to the party, and I wasn’t. Does that make me now want to be friends with them? Fuck No. But does that make me slightly upset for being forgotten, yes.

I’ve subconsciously made myself the independent one who doesn’t care if I’m not a part of things, as a reflex to not being a part of things, and I think its royally fucked me up.

I guess my confession is that at some point I’ve tricked myself into believing that I’m better alone, and I don’t know how to be dependent anymore. I’ll briefly explain:

I dissociate myself from any groups I’m ever in. Whenever they start to like me and involve me, I stop talking when more than 3 ppl in said group are around.

I tell myself that I’m not meant to be a part of it bc I’m so different to them. And I become more and more social with other groups. But as soon as I’ve pushed myself out of the group, I find that I can’t even be social with other groups.

My closer friends all say that it’s a shame no one in school really knows me, because I’m so fun. But I’ve fucked myself up so much that I don’t think it’s possible I can ever be dependant on anyone.

Melatonin helps a little by making me more calm and tired but it doesn't actually make me go to sleep. I try not to go on my phone when I get into my room. I leave my tv on for a while because it's kind of calming before going to sleep. I read on my kindle which usually makes me tired. But when I put everything away and turn everything off, I don't fall asleep.

I know it's all coming from anxiety. I've always naturally gone to sleep late but normally it doesn't take long and is pretty easy. During times like right now where I have a lot of anxiety about sleep, it's almost impossible. Even if I have nothing to do the next day, just being worried about not getting any sleep makes me...not get any sleep.

864,"Hello Reddit Im a 22 year old man from the Midwest currently thinking about what I should do for a career.  I went to college for 2 years and found that it wasn't a good fit for me.  I never got much satisfaction in writing a paper or doing any class work.  I never failed a class or did poorly but I was miserable and depressed when in a classroom or doing homework.  I worked construction as a flooring laborer part time during college.  I really really enjoyed the process and art that goes in to construction projects.  I also loved the teamwork aspect and hard work that went into it.  It was probably the most satisfying and rewarding process I've ever been apart of, especially seeing a beautiful finished floor at the end of the day.  

After 2 years of college I realized I was way happier when I was working full time and decided I wasn't going back.  Eventually I started working 80-90 hour weeks for about 2 months straight that first summer and my body fell apart. 

 I separated my shoulder 6 times and developed knee tendinitis while playing football in high school.  After high school I was physically in great shape and didn't have any pain because I worked out regularly, did yoga weekly and ate healthy.  So the shoulder and knee injuries didn't affect me. After the 2 months of crazy hours and labor those physical issues came back to haunt me.  Turns out working 8 or more hours a day on your knees is bad for someone with knee tendinitis.  I tried working less hours and that didn't work either.  I was still in a lot of physical pain every day and could barely function doing the job.  I had to stop doing it and it was very sad because I loved the job and all the people I worked with.  

Fast forward to today and Im currently working in a home improvement warehouse.  I've been there for a little over a year and have been promoted twice in that time.  I work in the receiving department unloading and loading semi-trucks, organizing boxes and cleaning the warehouse up.  **I really love this job.**  I probably walk like 7 or more miles a day around the store and warehouse.  I get to lift heavy things throughout the day and work with a lot of great people in a team environment. **Most importantly I get to use Power equipment all the time.**  I absolutely love using power equipment - forklift, narrow aisle reach truck and narrow aisle order picker.  I get a total thrill using it and could definitely do it for the rest of my life.  My knees and shoulder are not affected because Im not working over head or on my knees.  So my physical health is very good at the moment.  

My only issue with this career path is the pay does not top out very high for this specific line of work.  Im currently at $14 an hour and realistically the most I could make in this specific line of warehouse worker is around $18-21 an hour.  That's livable money but I want a career with more potential than that.

I love being on my feet, being active throughout the day, working with a team or group setting, and most importantly love Power equipment.  I specifically love working with heights and working high up in the air.  Im the type of person that is incapable of sitting in a office cubicle all day or working on a computer for hours on end.  So Im looking for something that is not typical or boring.  I've spent a fair amount of time looking for something in my criteria and haven't found something that jumps out to me yet.  **So if you redditors have any ideas or insight into what Im looking for I would love to hear it.  Thank you very much for reading through this and in advance for your responses, hope you all are having a great day!**",08Feb2020,1

I do regret how I could’ve handled those types of friendships though (if that makes any sense)

Some use me and then never talk to me or talk less to me later after I’ve done them a favor. I understand this is how life is, and I guess I can deal with it, but I just don’t understand why I’m constantly the one going through stuff like this.

873,"I obviously know as soon as possible, but around what age should I be moving out? I’m 19 and feel like I’m going to be here until I’m at least 23 or 24 maybe.

So I’m not going to graduate until I’m 23 or 24. Is that a decent age to move out, my parents don’t mind me living here since I was never a bad child and they know I’m doing something positive in life, then I’m also their only child.

879,So for a little background I moved last year and had a guy friend who I had known for 7 years living in the area and we decided to be roommates. His budget is a lot lower so I pay a couple hundred dollars more in rent at our apartment in order to live somewhere nice but still have him as my roommate. We have been living here 9 months and his girlfriend of 8 months has recently started acting like our roommate. She has spare keys which I don’t mind because my roommate has a weird work schedule(has to wake up at stupid times) and I like that she can lock up when she leaves. My boyfriend also has spare keys but he never comes over when I’m not home unless I’m on vacation and ask him to check on my cat. My roommates girlfriend has now been over very many times while he’s not home and I’ve come home to her just sitting in our living room watching TV or cooking. There is a potential plan in May of her living with us and paying rent but she’s not paying now and I don’t know if I’m in the wrong for being upset that she’s always here and I’m paying so much more in rent.,08Feb2020,1

Apologies for grammar as English is not my first language ( :

When my son was born me and my wife argued over what my sons names should be. She wanted to name my son Santino after her grandfather. I wanted to name him Benito after an influential figure on my life. She pretended to agree with me but deceived me as she tricked me into being out of the room for his birth and when he was named. Because of her my son is legally named Santino. 
I have been calling him by his rightful name, Benito and she has been getting very mad at me. She says that she doesn’t want people to think of Mussolini when they hear his name. I said that he can just easily go by the nickname “Ben” but she is still being spiteful and stubborn. I think that it is also stupid that she won’t let me name my son after Mussolini as he was a great man who furthered the interests of Italy. He really is not bad like her and some people say. I want my son to radiate strength, heritage, and masculinity like the name Benito certainly dose.

We share a very small one bedroom, one bathroom apartment and I just pull put the futon in the living room every night and it's been fine and comfortably cozy for 4 months now. We are moving at the end of March to a 2 bedroom and I'll have my own room. 

Before we move, I want to set up ground rules with them for having guests over. I say guests, but I mean their girlfriend Abby. When she would come over to our apartment, she would stay for up to 4 nights at a time. It's a tiny space and I already don't have much privacy so I, an extreme introvert, felt very invaded. She's loud, she tries to talk to me when I'm working (niceties, I get it, but dang leavemealone), and I've come to dislike her for very petty reasons and that's why I want to make sure I'm objective and fair. Anyway, we previously agreed on two nights a week and have finally decided that until we move, she won't come over at all.

However, I don't want me having my own room to mean that suddenly we will have a 4th roommate, without my consent. There will still only be one bathroom, she showers (utilities), and dang it's my home I don't want strangers there.

890,"So... my boyfriend and I moved into this apartment 6 months ago. We have used the gym here on several occasions. There is a distinct smell of air fresheners in this gym which is SO potent. You can smell it from the hallway when you are even just approaching the door to the gym. Some people prop the doors to the gym open. 

Anyway, every time we work out here we get a headache and a weird feeling in the chest. It becomes very hard for me to breathe. I did have asthma as a child so it can come back a little bit if triggered. My boyfriend also experiences difficulty breathing, to a lesser extent. When we work out in our apartment at the same intensity, we never feel the headache or chest pain or intense shortness of breath. clearly the chemicals in the air fresheners are affecting us. 

The issue is it’s a really nice gym and very convenient for us, but once we start working out in there, it quickly becomes not enjoyable, and for me, it becomes a struggle. Also the apartment complex itself is “LEED certified” and they try to be as eco friendly as possible. So it seems a little strange to be polluting the air in their gym with toxic chemicals. 

We want to talk to the apartment management office about this, either in person or by sending them an email. But I need advice on if I should, and if so, what I should say. I don’t know if they are going to be willing to remove the air fresheners, but I hope they will so we can actually enjoy this amenity without compromising our health.

Stop? 


I tried. I 24m. I can’t help but to take care of my single mother (almost 55) . I want her to eat better and stop taking medications. I fight hard internally everyday trying to focus on myself but it makes me more stressed out feeling like I’m leaving my family hanging. I can’t just go over to her house and see the condition the house is in, the condition she’s in and just act like it doesn’t bother me. I don’t know what to do .

I am fighting hard to break generational cycles  of unhealthy lifestyles passed down through both sides of the family. Poor nutrition and heavy reliance on western medicine to be specific . I have been dealing with the spectrum of putting bad things into my body and getting bad results . I want better for myself and while I have a lot to work on still, I am making great strides . My family who I am most concerned about, are in the their later stages of life. I try not to, but it stresses me out thinking about their poor diets and the many prescription medications taken. I know there are medications that are absolutely needed, but I definitely believe that it can be narrowed down to much fewer. It drives me crazy and I dint know what to do because I obviously love my family and I just want them to be happy

TLDR: 24 m trying to will a dysfunctional family to do better . I grew up living like them, and once I got away for awhile and I formed  a different outlook on life. How do I keep this shit together? I want everyone to want more out of themselves . no matter how hard I try to just step away and focus on myself, it creates a void in my life that just grows larger and eventually creates more stress .

Everyone is complaining about other roomates act, everyone is insulting others and judging what they are eating or doing. I cant even come home with food without being judged immediately. Nobody minds their business. Everyone likes to laugh at others' behaviour and remind them of their bad choices later on and use it as defense.

I work three retail jobs, but would be more than fucking lucky if I even touch 25 hours a week. No one wants to give a fucking full time that's reliable. Work there for a month, and boom- labor cuts. It seems like the only way to make good money is to be scammer or drug dealer or already have some degrees in your hand to work as a dental assistant or wait till someone dies in a fucking dmv office.

I finished highschool, but not my bf bc he needed to take care of his broken home. He has his license, but I don't. I would work on it, but we're both so fucked that we cant even afford rent this month. His unemployement literally only gave him three $40 checks and refused to help him further, which when we told others, they were confused and angry as hell because he worked a full time, before they let people go.

901,"         When I used to live in LA, I ate a lot. Then I moved to NE and ate less as I fell into depression. Then I moved back and ate a little better and then came back to NE and now I barely have an appetit anymore. All I eat is spicy chips (used to be Turbos Flamas, then hot cheetos and now Doritos Flaming Hot with Limon) which came to be my dependant food (food that I rely on to basically help me cope with myself).




        I try not to show but I weigh 98 - 100 lbs and I am 5'3. I am not sure if that is underweight or just normal but nonetheless. I used to eat about 2 meals a day because my sister was home and she used to remind me a lot to eat. Then she left and now I eat one meal a day. At first it was because I just didn't want to eat, never felt hungry at all. Then I started to forget it entirely because I was always so wrapped up with myself and hobbies that I forgot to actually take care of my body. 




           I try to eat though. I try to make smart decisions and eat a meal but it just ends up in me messing up my stomach. I am very hyper when it comes to food nowadays. I can't eat a full plate without walking really fast or moving my arms in very quick movements. Which ends up in some food not being processed right so my stomach starts to growl for a while. When I try to sit down, I just start getting tired and I lose my appetite so quickly with just a few bites. 




        I dont eat breakfast or even lunch at school. I dont know why but my crush's friends usually stare at me for some reason. We dont have a ""pure"" past but they always keep an eye on me and even though I mainly sit alone, I don't like eating in front of strangers at all so I just go the full 8 hours with nothing to keep me going. The most I have ever ate there is a small packet of Sponch (very soft cookies with marshmallow and a tiny pool of solidified jelly in the middle) and even then, we were watching a movie in class. I didn't even get through two cookies because I was so scared that everyone was hearing my crunches (they werent even crunches at all, just small snaps that I only was able to hear because it was inside my mouth).



In case it matters, I am 14 (which you probably caught on with the previous paragraph) and I am a female. I got curcumin gummies to help me increase my dopamine levels but I know it is going to take a lot more to feel better about myself eating than a bottle of 30 vitamin gummies. A lot of the reason why I dont eat in public is because I was always feel like a slobby pig. I just feel selfish. I dont know why but I just do and I cant shake that feeling off.",08Feb2020,1
902,"**TL;DR:** I got into a pretty prestigious dual degree university program, based in Europe for the first two years (very far away from home) and then to a Canadian university (very close to home). I’m quite unhappy with where I am right now and this program and wish I was closer to home. There’s a lot of conflict with my parents and I can’t seem to make a decision as I can’t seem to properly weigh other people’s advice, opinions and what factors really mean the most to me other than mental health and family/friends.

**The Full Story:**

I’m currently a first year uni student, in second semester living in France. I’m part of a dual degree program with a Canadian university and Sciences Po. The latter has a very prestigious reputation in France, especially for political science (which is what I thought I wanted to study, I’m really not sure anymore). I’m supposed to spend two years here in France and then move back to Canada for my second degree which is another two years. The canadian uni is one of the best in Canada. It’s considered large in terms of campus and student population, and has much more student support, has student facilities and is close to home. It’s quite close to a big city by bus. In comparison, my Sci Po campus is one building and a student population of approx. 250. There are limited student services and no facilities whatsoever. While it’s close to a city and other small towns, Europe has never spoken to me in any way.

I applied to this program because I wanted to see if I could get in since it was more rigorous than any other uni I applied to. I chose the program because it was such a flex to be able to say I was going to get two degrees and I wasn’t worried about moving since I had a very rocky relationship with my mom, who I live with. I didn’t do much research into the program at all and tbh @ the time I didn’t really know what I wanted for uni. I’ve really fixed the relationship with my Mom now. 

To say I had a rough first semester would be a huge understatement. From the moment I arrived in this small town of 28,000 people (in peak tourist season), my anxiety skyrocketed and I was constantly crying. It was intense homesickness for the whole first semester and even though I made a couple very close friends and was friendly with everyone, plus I joined a few clubs, I felt incredibly lonely and was incapable of calling home or friends without bawling. The school is so restrictive, it’s one building with no facilities and you have absolutely no choice in what classes you take in first year. Class lengths range from two to four hours and a typical week was 32 hours of class. I went home for xmas and completely cut myself off from anything that reminded me of the school. I dreaded the very thought of returning and missed nothing. The worst part of break was people asking about university. 

Coming back for second semester has definitely been better. I’m more emotionally stable; meaning that instead of me constantly crying throughout the day, I cry maybe once a day. Some days are much worse, some are better. I have a better schedule relative to the first semester (still no choices), better class hours - only 20-25 hours per week, and the weather is nice again. Second year is supposed to be much worse. On the good days when I’ve spent time with friends, I think I could tough it out but whenever someone suggests it to me or a classmate implies I’ll stay, my mind instantly screams, “No!” I still feel really lonely here, I don’t really enjoy many of my classes and 9 hour time difference has my sleep more fucked since I wake up early to talk to people from home. Plus  I’ve always been an overthinker and the “what if’s” of this situation really stress me out. Will I have regrets if I leave? Or resentment if I stay? I don’t know what I would major in at the Canadian university (but if I transferred I could actually take electives and figure it out). How important is this second degree to my future - Do I fuck up my prospects if I leave? I think \*\* I should probably mention that if I stayed for my second year I would be picking the least worst option of 3 possible degrees, none of which are appealing to me.

One of the biggest complicating factors has been the fact that my parents don’t support me. Their support and pride in me has always meant a lot and I’ve never strayed from the “path” - until possibly now. I’m terrified of disappointing and angering my parents. At first they were sympathetic but its become evident that whatever arguments or justification I give them for transferring (I wrote a 1200 word essay in semester 1) and testimony from another student who is almost done with the program but had a terrible time, is not enough for them to change their minds. My parents aren’t willing to validate how I feel or show empathy and believe that a positive mindset is all I need to get through. They’re adamant that this dual degree will set me up for any masters I want and my future and my Dad values prestige the most. They tell me it’s just one more year. Sci Po has prestige in Europe and in the political science realm. I thought I wanted to be diplomat or work for the UN like my parents did but then I realized that I want to settle in Canada in the future and I’m tired of moving around like we did when I was a kid. I also don’t need to be a “top dog” at work.

Note: I wouldn’t need to reapply to transfer and I would have enough credits to go straight into second year.",08Feb2020,1
