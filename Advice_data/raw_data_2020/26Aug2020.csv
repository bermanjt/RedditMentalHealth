1,"Hey guys, I don’t know what’s going on. I have one indoor cat that I recently adopted, I’ve been feeding her the same brand of dry food they had her on at the shelter, and occasionally a can of wet food that I’d keep in the fridge. We kept finding little worms in the wet food after a short amount of time, so we discontinued that for now. However we’re also just finding them around her dry food bowl too. She’s a very messy eater and gets it all over the floor, and today there was some up under her bowl. None inside it yet. But what eats dry cat food, and how can we stop them?? We try to keep her area neat and while the food bowl remains out at all times (with a little bit in it) we only fill it a few times a day for her to eat from.",26Aug2020,1
2,"So, this is gonna be a lot and tbqh i am not 100% the advice i need, but i am still processing this and i am unsure of what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; company i had a first day of took no COVID precautions, i feel like i should do something but i really don't know what, asking for advice on how to feel less guilty about walking away from this. 

&amp;#x200B;

So yesterday (8/24) I had my first day at a fortune 500 tech company job, where my job would've been in IT and based right outside of the capital of my state. I took this job as the recruiter had told me after the training period, I would have the option to work remotely and he reassured me several times the company was taking many safety precautions as far as COVID goes (wearing masks at all times, PPE available for all who enter the building, individual cubicles with walls, etc). Plus I work in IT as my career and they were gonna pay me to do that. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am very fortunate to have saved enough up from previous jobs where I could leave my previous job, but as I have been unemployed for around 2 months now- I do not want that big of a gap in my employment history. I have been looking and applying since I put in my two weeks notice at my previous job 2.5 months ago. This was the only reputable job offer I had gotten, and the pay was a little less than I was looking for but it was a contract and better than nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I showed up yesterday and everything was ok to start. Pretty normal, you walk in - the trainer had PPE on and the 8 other people starting with me (and myself) were advised to keep our masks on the entire time we were there. They had reduced staff at the location, but easily over 100 people were in the building total. 

&amp;#x200B;

The first time i noticed something was up was when this one woman was walking around touching her coworkers (not inappropriately for not COVID times) without a mask on. No one was even acting like this was strange or that they were uncomfortable. During the training period, we were in a classroom type setting with masks on and our desks were far apart from each other and the instructor. 

&amp;#x200B;

After about an hour of going over company history - a man came in, complaining about wearing a mask, to give us a COVID-19 precaution presentation that he complained he had to give. During this, he quickly stated that while at the cubicle you did not have to wear a mask. He then stated you just need a mask on you, you do not need to wear one unless you are in a meeting room (and when wearing one, you need to have it over your nose). He made sure to tell us we could not tell people to put on masks and we could not ask people for more space from them, we could only walk away ourselves and tell our supervisor later if we see any issues. During this he also joked about having to send out a weekly email notifying those who were directly exposed.

&amp;#x200B;

Later on in the day, we got a couple of bathroom breaks and during this I realized no one on that floor was wearing a mask \*at all\*. They did not seem to have any on their person. There was only about 15 people on this floor, however, so I was willing to look past it at that time - although this made me extremely uncomfortable. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then, we were given to our future supervisors to get fitted for our cubicle. There was around 50 people in this room, none wearing masks and one social distancing. We were encouraged by the other team members to take our masks off at the time we got to our cubicles. There was one woman who was clearly having a cold or something as she was sniffling and coughing, but she was also sitting on other peoples' desks. It was completely surreal. People were hugging each other and giving high fives and I started freaking out at this point. I tried to stay as far back from others I could. 

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, one of the other people starting that day leaned to me and was like "" are you seeing this too"" and I was like ""uhh yeah"". Then my supervisor, whos mask did not fit him and was well below his nose, almost under his mouth, showed me to my cubicle. Having previously worked in IT, the Avaya phone and keyboard I had been given was left clearly and grossly dirty. White/grey stains from previous owners had been left there. He stated (I am guessing my disgust wasn't hidden well despite having a mask on) ""sorry about the mess, the people didn't  want to touch someone else's stuff"". At this point I almost started crying I was genuinely so shocked by all of this.

&amp;#x200B;

He then asked me to look in the drawers to make sure nothing was left. Someone's keycard, family photos, and something I can't remember was in there. I was shaking at this point as I was sketched out by the place and live with a couple of people that could easily die if they catch COVID. My supervisor came around the other side of the cubicle, touched my shoulder, and stated ""you'll get used to it here. Sorry I know its kind of small"". At this point, I knew i couldn't do it and said ""Ya know what? I am feeling kinda sick. Would be okay if I left now and came back early tomorrow?"" to which he said ""yeah of course"". I left the building and emailed my recruiter that I wasn't coming back tomorrow and explained why.

I just can't shake this weird guilty feeling I have now, though. I feel like i should've done something or told someone or something, I am looking for advice on what I should do now.",26Aug2020,1
3,"I'm having trouble deciding what to do with my job status at the moment. I'm working security, full time. Its a new thing that came about when I unfortunately got laid off from substitute teaching due to covid. The other job that I had, working in a hardware store, cut my hours down to 15 a week with occasional opportunities to work 24 a week. I ended up finding part time work as a security officer, and they have moved me to full time. Problem is, I don't know what to do about the other two jobs. The hardware store pays me 11 an hour, so I make more money there, but the pay is every two weeks, as does the security job. Subbing is closer to what I want to be doing, however, as I am slowly working on a education degree.  It pays a flat rate of 75 a day. Sub work is not always guaranteed but it has been fairly reliable in the two years I have done it. The biggest draw is that it pays on a weekly basis. 

The security company has already agreed to work with me to allow me to sub three days a week if I so choose, and the hardware company would let me leave with more than enough time to get to the security job. 

Any advice would be appreciated.",26Aug2020,1

5,"Hey guys so this might seem like an odd one,
But recently I was finding myself gaming until all hours of the night, to the point it was causing issues in my marriage. (I'm a 27m)

I have since recently sworn off video gaming, a personal choice not one forced by my wife, because I could see personally that it was becoming an issue. 

I still enjoy things like D&amp;D, but have sworn off pf console because of its' time consuming and  personally addicting nature. 

To be clear this isn't me bashing video games, I know a lot of people enjoy them responsibly, I am just not someone who can.

It’s frustrating because i know I’m wasting so much time, but sometimes I just can’t handle it.

19,"Sorry this will be pretty long but it’s been weighing on me and this is my last resort so bare with me thanks. So I’ll start with a little bit about me. I’m a older adolescent girl who has recently moved back to the town she lived in as a young child. I’ve never really known how to talk to/never was interested in talking to other people around my age. I never have been able to understand the language or I don’t understand how they think. I’ve always been told by my teachers (who I’ve always been close with) and my parents that I’m just more mature and a big picture thinker and an old soul or whatever. I think it’s due to having moved around so much and struggling with crippling anxiety disorders all my life. Anyways, on the first day we got to our new house I saw this lady pulling weeds in her front yard and I don’t know why but I just felt this weird feeling like I was being pulled toward her. I had no idea who she was but I instantly felt connected to her. My younger brother and my mom both have met her and talked to her so everyone except me has. She’s in her 60s (would never have guessed cause she looks 45) and lives alone because her kids are grown with families and her husband passed away from an illness only a few months ago. I won’t go into detail but based on how she acts and the sparkling truck she leaves untouched in her driveway, she really really loved him. The reason I moved back here was because my father jumped ship on our family a couple months ago and it was too expense to keep living where we were. I guess we both lost important male figures recently. All the other neighbors we’ve met immediately bring her up and say she’s the “sweetest ray of light out there” when we say where our house in on the street. I’d imagine she’s very lonely because she doesn’t have many people to talk to and she stayed inside all day pretty much every day. I think she’s super shy too. I thought I might just say hi and introduce myself if I was outside. Tonight when my mom and I were walking our dog she came outside and was super happy and talking from her door out to my mom and I couldn’t help but smile because I’d never heard her speak before. She didn’t say anything about/to me though and I didn’t know what to do because, again, crippling anxiety disorders. I just want to talk to her and maybe be friends or something like that. I’d even just go over to help her with stuff because she has the whole house to take care of by herself or Im sure we could really use some company with reading or taking care of her garden or whatever she likes to do. I’ve always preferred talking to and being around adults but it’s always really hard to be acquainted with them when ur not exactly an equal in terms of how long you’ve been on this earth.

I’m trying to come to terms with the fact that these things don’t make someone a man, but no one can doubt that many men are judged by their height, penis size, even muscle density.

I never gave up on that. I’m really stubborn and this was my goal since the beginning of high school (15).Last year I moved to London to work and understand how to apply to unis and whatnot. I was really hopeful but I already knew it would be really hard with papers and getting accepted etc. I hired a consultant that helped me get my facts straight, she suggested to not leave during the pandemic and continue to work, which was really fucking scary lol
last month I came back to Italy for a little vacation and to spend time with my family which I love a lot and have a tight bond( mum and brother). My dad is an alcoholic and my mum decided to divorce after having to live with him during the pandemic. He’s really manipulative and violent and has been like that since I was born. My mum wants to move in the north and try to have a new life which I longed for forever (without my dad)
Problem is she doesn’t want me to move back in London (I wouldn’t move till January bc the first semester is online) I never ever thought of going to uni in Italy because in London I have way more opportunities and I love being independent in a big city
I would go to an uni I don’t like at all for the first year and I don’t really know what to do 
I was also thinking if it’s worth spending that much money on tuition in England because a lot of people told me it’s way too expensive, I would have to go through student finance and basically get a mortgage from the gov for approximately 50.000/60.000 pounds
In italy i would go to uni for free and get some money too because i’m poor lol
I know that sounds promising as hell but I fear I won’t be happy going to uni here and fall back in depression and anxiety attacks

37,"September 7th, 2016. It was a beautiful day. I finalized all my paperwork, and got all my stuff together with a transportation company to get my stuff shipped back home. This was the day I flew back home from completing my term in the United States Army. I was 3 months away from being a year married. Everything looked green, as I had a job lined up with the Customs and Border protection Agency. Hispanic ideologies and culture, dictate that as a man, I am to provide for my wife....like give her an allowance, and pay for meals and everything else you can think of. I was giving my wife the majority of my paychecks anyways when I was in, because she was dead broke. I just wanted her to feel safe and secure, and overall...Happy.

As soon as I got home that day, my mother offered me an apartment behind her house, so that me and my wife may live in peace. Together, without anyone else involved. However, my wife refused and insisted we live in her mothers house. Something I was really doubtful about, because I didn’t want to live with her family....as they would focus negatively on the things they don’t like or respect about me. 

In my culture, el muerto y el arrimado, a los tres Dias apestan. The dead and those who are living in your home that aren’t necessarily family, stink by the 3rd day.

I knew this going into my wife’s house....and I even told her. However, she insisted that this was our best choice. (She didn’t know what she was talking about.) 

A few days passed, and I thought things were indeed going well. Granted, I was now unemployed, but I was still getting payed from the Army since I was in payed leave. However, I was wrong. By the 2nd week, her Mother’s real toxic and negative personality began to show. As a result, the entire family started treating me like shit because I wasn’t working, and insisted I find a job. My wife didn’t even have a job herself. I was getting payed to be on vacation....she wasn’t getting payed shit, and still i would provide for her. We weren’t even having sex at all. I was horny every fucking day. I was 21, in shape, and fucking banking! I had quite a grip of money in my bank account. Since i would save up all my money. 

To provide my wife with happiness, although she wasn’t providing me any happiness....I found a job by begging a union boss to give me a chance at a solar gig. I used my veteran card and everything. I was in tears. Granted I didn’t want my family to find out how I was really feeling about my life at this moment. If they’d found out about how was being treated, they would have forced me to divorce my wife....but I loved her so blindly, that I just didn’t want to risk that. My family cares a lot about me....they even were against me marrying my wife. But that’s a longer story for me to explain.

I started the solar gig late September, and my brother was working there. I was easily making 1,800 dollars a week. It was a lot! $7,200 a month, and this isn’t including overtime. I was even taking the weekends off, as they were optional for us to work. Things started to calm down, and I was really happy for that. But I was always so fucking tired. I’d work from 4am - 6pm. I was literally putting in 12+ hours a day. I’d get home beat! My wife wouldn’t even give me oral sex, not any kind of sex for that matter. I was blue balled, and exhausted. I needed to find some kind of pleasure or relaxation. So, as soon as I would get home, I’d play video games for about 3-4 hours and go to bed. This was my routine each day. I had to find some time for myself, as I was always bored. So this was it. My wife eventually grew to hate the fact that I would prefer to play video games than to “spend time with her”. But, I didn’t just want to watch Netflix for 4 hours everyday and go to bed untouched. I was angry! I was resenting my marriage for that. Then one day, My wife was crying while I was playing a video game. Her mother even came and chewed my ass out. I defended myself, and insisted that my hobby isn’t a bad thing. If anything, they were just overreacting. However, they didn’t appreciate that. But, I didn’t understand. We would go out every weekend to all kinds of places, and I would even blow my money on her. She would even give me sex during those times....I just felt unappreciated. I could be at a bar for all I care....but I’d stay home.....

I loved my wife so much, that I was blind to the toxic beginning. Things eventually calmed down, until November hit. November 23rd, 2016. I was called in, along with hundreds of workers and was laid off....along with all those workers. The solar panel season ended, and my $1,800+ job went straight out the window. But I still had the CBP gig around the corner. So I wasn’t too shaken from the loss of a job. I even opened up unemployment for the first time that day. $900 dollars every 2 weeks, $1,800 every month. Lol! The irony! I had about $27,000 saved up, including my wife’s account and mine. All the money was mine anyways....but I  beefed up my wife’s account because I thought it was what a good husband would do. She was even about to start a job of her own, so I was really excited for her! (She just recently graduated as an MA at a private school, which was a bad idea in the first place, but I always showed my undying support! However, she was in debt because of a loan she took out! This was before our marriage, $8,000! They wanted her to start paying that late November! I felt bad, so I decided to pay it all that same day! $19,000 isn’t a lot! But, I still felt a little secure! I didn’t even receive thank you sex, or any kind of appreciation for that. Just a simple thank you. I was a bit dragged by it, but I felt happy for her! I was investing in her future, and showed my interest in it. 

A few months passed, and things were okay. I would get treated like shut by her family for being unemployed though, and My wife would occasionally make me cry. I would head to my car, and would sit there....doubting myself. I just didn’t think it was fair! 

Then I received word from the CBP! They wanted me to work for them. So I was finally excited! My first big break! I’ll finally move out of this stupid families house, and get my wife to change a little! As she’ll grow out of her families influence....which was rather toxic and negative. A few months passed and the last thing I needed to get in was the Polygraph! I was excited. Until I took the polygraph that is. I was interrogated, and spat at! The polygrapher accused me of lying, and failed me. He was even in the national guard, and an infantryman! I was active Duty, and infantry. I felt betrayed by my country! I was not granted my big break despite all my service and hard work! I drove home, and all cried all the way. I was in a really dark spot. Driving back him to my wife and her crappy family made it worse. I failed the polygraph despite telling the truth, and was called a liar, by my wife and her family....and even mine. I felt alone! I was alone....

It was June by then of 2017. I decided to enroll for college! My wife, her family, and even my family scolded me for applying to the local community college. They insisted that my duty was to find a job and provide for my wife. But, I had enough of the shit talk! I wanted to focus on me for once! Like I once did in the Army! And so I went to school! And I was killing it! I was making school my B****! 

But since no real result would result from my straight A’s.....I was constantly treated like shit....and belittled by everyone. 

After summer, and Fall semester, even after getting 4.0s in both, my mental health hit its peak! I was crying each day, despite my efforts. So, I decided to try and commit suicide. I got so drunk, so that it wouldn’t hurt as much....but I called the veterans Hotline.....I told them everything happening in my life. They knew I was in so much pain....they sent out emergency personnel to my aid. They found me drunk and passed out under some bushes in the middle of the night. The knife I had on me before I was drink was gone.....no one found it, and neither have I. It just disappeared. 

After that, everybody in my life started to lay off on me. My wife even denied knowing why I would even bring myself to that predicament to the authorities. Everyone knew why I tried to do it, but no one ever admitted it....since I never killed myself. 

After a huge hospital bill, my funds were pretty much gone. My wife was banking! She was a year into her new job, and had money left over from all the allowances I’d give her back then. I never asked for any of it, even when I knew I need financial help. 

After a few more semesters, I was starting to get treated like shit again! Even despite my flawless 4.0 track record. I had enough of it! My wife even accused me of cheating on her in late 2018....so I decided to ask for a divorce. Finally! All the pain I felt, she feels now! I saw her cry like I have never seen her cry before! But then I felt bad for her. She accused me of cheating on her on my way to my physics final....because I was leaving an hour early to my final. 

She insisted we give having a kid a try, and so I did. At first, it seemed like it fixed our marriage! 9 months into 2019, and my son was born October 1st, 2019. I was one more semester away from graduating! But, I was also still going to school! The day he was born, 30 minutes after he was born, I decided to go and take my midterm for my physics 3 class. And I got a 100% on it. Having a son made me more hungry than I ever have been! 

But it don’t make me love my wife more than I already did. In fact, I felt colder towards her. I felt no real love. It wasn’t the same anymore. Having a son didn’t fix my marriage. It just made me work even harder so that I may provide a better life for him! My wife at this point, is not my priority anymore....she felt more like a friend.....

After spring 2020, this Covid pandemic has made shit go crazy! I graduated with 4 associates degrees! Math, physics, computer science, and university studies in science and math. All with distinction! With a flawless 4.0 record! 

However, I still get treated like shit by my wife and her family. My parents treat me like shit too! I have just grown cold...and I no longer hold that same burning, and passionate love I once held for my wife. I no longer hold honor and respect for my parents, wife, and her family. They all have shown me little to no support! And they still insiste I get a job! Aside from this pandemic! People have died! And People have gotten sick for not abiding by quarantine rules. People are sick with Covid and still go to work, school, and outdoors! They care more about me making money, than my personal health. I am not willing to let them dictate my life, or health any longer. What do you guys think?",26Aug2020,1
38,"First of all, this is a throwaway account. It is not my main one.

Basically my mom and I moved in with my mom's boyfriend of about 3 years around a month ago. He's an okay guy, but we had a fight back in April that never got resolved thanks to him. Since then, I've stopped seeing him the same way I used to before (which was leading towards a father figure), and I think there's a building resentment growing in me each day. The fight wasn't that bad, but he said a lot of things he shouldn't have, did a lot of things he shouldn't have, and because of my childhood, will definitely stick with me and keep me from being able to fix my image of him.

We moved in, got settled, etc. His youngest 2 daughters live with him as well (twins, 18), and they have shown their true colors since we moved in. They smile at us to our faces but seem to complain a lot to their 3 older sisters who aren't living at home. He's gotten on me for things I didn't know were problems, and is old school in the way that you listen, don't talk back, and just have to suck it up. I'm not that type of person, I've never been that type of person, and I hate it now. I can't be frustrated back or irritated back because then he'll lose his shit.

He religiously smokes pot in the connected garage. He smokes it every day, all day, and then sometimes drinks alcohol. He has a really high tolerance all things considered, but he stinks up the house every day. I've since learned that the smell makes me even more nauseous than I typically am (I have some weird medical things). I hole myself up in my room and avoid him now. I don't like being around him all the time, mostly because he always somehow pisses me off. Plus, his house conditions aren't ideal and make me kind of uncomfortable.

I've had to change a lot about myself since moving in, and the list is growing. I hate it, so I'd rather stay in my room and do whatever I feel comfortable doing. I'm also not used to sharing my mom. We were really close and would spend a lot of time together because it was always just us, but now we hardly spend any time together compared to what we were before, and I hate that too. What should I do? My mom knows I don't like it here, but she loves her boyfriend. I get that. But I am growing to hate living here more and more every day.

40,"I’ve been to several psychologists and tried medication, but nothing has helped. The psychologists agree that it’s probably because of my younger life. My dad was an alcoholic and my mom was rarely home and left me to raise my siblings. I became serious and depressed at a young age. I didn’t have a fun childhood.

41,"First off, I’m currently working a decent paying job that’s not very labor intensive, in a small-ish rural town. I am currently looking for a new job because of everything that’s gone on at my current job, but being in a small town during a pandemic means very limited options at this time. So I’m just looking for advice on how to best handle my current situation until I can find new employment.

My current employer is a small local business, which means no HR (or oversight of any kind really). The environment is extremely toxic. 

Sexual harassment goes unchecked, and is thought of as a joke. I’ve been groped and humped by my boss on multiple occasions. 

Extreme blatant bigotry is a daily occurrence (exacerbated by the current political climate as well). 

Bullying is just considered “good ol boy” behavior. 

But the final straw was just the other day, when my direct supervisor made a “joke”, saying I wanted to rape my own 5 year old daughter. Mind you, this is a company with 4 employees, and the person who said this to me is the senior-most employee, directly under the owner. All 4 of them laughed at it.

Much of the sexual harassment and bigotry reaches this same level of grotesque-ness, but because it’s perpetuated by the people who are actually in charge, it’s thought of as “harmless fun”. My attempts to have discussions about these things have been brushed off many times already. They think what they do is okay, and I certainly can’t change their minds. It’s gotten to the point that it’s affecting my mental state, I come home feeling angry or depressed or completely defeated almost every day. Please help me figure out how to survive these next few weeks (or months) until I can find a different job.",26Aug2020,1
42,So I’m starting to take my art career further and I figured the best way is to utilize my following on Instagram. The point of this post is to due with my email. Yes I know it’s a small and petty thing but it makes the world of difference when people view your account and want to contact you. So I what I want ultimately is an email address which shows people commissions are open for art prices and that companies can contact me for promotions etc (I have a following). Assume my real name is Keith Long. Should I make my email address have a business feel to it like “keithlongbiz@yahoo.com” or make it have a artsy feel like “artbykeithlong@yahoo.com”? And no I don’t want to make two email addresses. I think having one for art commissions and business relations all in one is better but i can’t seem to be set on which kind of email will attract both targets. Any other suggestions would be appreciated so much.,26Aug2020,1
43,"maybe i’m just like a serious ambivert, but during school year i’m quite social and during the summer i can go three months without seeing my friends and it’s totally fine. i stop responding to any texts, i dread seeing anyone i know. literally right now i’m thinking about whether to chicken out on seeing my friend because i really just don’t want to leave the house. i’d rather stay home, be comfortable, and watch a movie by myself. 

during the school year i party and drink, and during the summer i quit all of it cold turkey and don’t have any desire to do it again. i literally would be happy not having any human contact (except my parents) for the rest of the summer and it just feels like a chore to see my friend (really just the one friend that i see from highschool, i have different college friends during the school year)

44,"My (19F) sister (35) is dying. She was diagnosed with a type of cancer called multiple myeloma in 2017. It’s a sort of bone cancer, I don’t know too much about it. We also have two other sisters, 23 and 16.

Back in December of 2019, she went to the hospital and was told that if she didn’t start this specific treatment then, she had two weeks to live. Then, in the end of May beginning of June, she was told there was nothing else they could do and they gave her 3-4 weeks to live. These two deadlines were given to her by a doctor out of state. Her local doctor has been helping her and treating her since then. This past week, he decided to stop her treatment. He said that the cancer is growing faster than the treatment is working. So basically she only has a few more weeks. 

I’ve dealt with death and grief before. My boyfriend at the time committed suicide when I was 14. But that was a different type of grief. I have to move back to school Sept. 5th and I’ve still been preparing to do that even though my mom says I should try to move in later. My sisters are crying a lot and my mom is really upset but I just want to continue as if life is normal. I don’t really know what else to do.

45,"So my sister just got a phone about a year ago. She's 12 and like most girls, she's SUPER into her phone and is on it 24/7 if she isn't watching Netflix or playing with her friends. Well, almost as soon as she got her phone she made an PUBLIC Instagram account without my Mom's permission. (which is actually illegal since Instagram and pretty much all SMs are 13+ because of COPPA.) Something happened, I'm not sure what since my sister never tells us anything, (she's always like ""mind your own business!"" all the time) but due to what happened my sister's Instagram account was deleted by my mom and she lost her phone for a month. When she got her phone back she almost immediately downloaded Tic Toc as an alternative since at that time it was when Tic Toc really started to blow up. Her account was and has been private, and she mainly just does dances and shares them with her friends. However, my little sister CONSTANTLY keeps pushing mom to let her have a public Instagram/Tic Toc account and Mom is actually ON BOARD with this despite her being underage and female. My little sister's dream is to be an Instagram influencer, and that's a big problem because she's a 12 year old girl and the prime target of pedos. I'm extremely afraid that my sister would begin to sexualize herself on Instagram without my mom even knowing at age 12/13, attracting a massive audience of pedos and hitting it big. My mom doesn't keep that close watch on what any of us are doing (me, my 15 year old brother, and my 12 year old sister. I'm 18) so I'm really worried what my little sister could be getting herself into with making a public Instagram account as such a young age and exposing herself to all sorts of creeps who actively seek out underage girls on there and offer them huge cash payments to sexualize themselves in increasing perverse ways. I'm extremely worried for my little sister's safety. Doesn't help that she's basically a pedo's wet dream. Small, flat-chested, gymnist/dancer, cute, (in a non-sexual way) and complete loli-bait with her demetor and actions. She's practically a IRL Elise from Fire Emblem Fates, and that's not a good thing with the kind of people lurking around on Instagram. Whenever I try to talk to her about the dangers of being an underage girl on very-public SMs like Instagram (compared to more anonomous SMs like Reddit and Twitter) she just starts going ""lalalalala can't hear you!"" to tone me out and not listen to anything I have to say. I'm extremely worried for her safety, and my parents aren't doing anything. Please help.",26Aug2020,1
46,"I didn’t realize that commenting that something was helpful would stop comments. I am very appreciative of the advice but I am also looking for advice on what to do about the written warning as well. 
A little background:

I’m currently 18 (F) and this is my first job and I’ve been here for a year already.
My shop is attached to another larger store, but is owned by the same people, but where I work there is only one other employee. 
I used to work in the bigger store but got permanently moved to the back most likely because I had an anxiety attack ONCE. 
I just got a written and final warning today for some (what I believe) BS reasons “Failure to complete job responsibilities” “Refusal to do required job” and “being disrespectful to coworkers.” They explained everything to me, and I’ll explain it here as well. 
For the failure to complete job responsibilities, it was because I forgot to pick something up of the floor yesterday when it was mentioned, and i’ll admit, I did forget because my memory isn’t all the great, and I was pulled away to do another task before so could remember to pick it up, and because I had forgotten to take some tape off of the wall months ago, but they are saying it only happened three weeks ago. 
For the refusal to required job responsibilities, I was never made aware that I was supposed to do something, it had never been mentioned to me a single time that i was responsible for doing this task, so when I said “I don’t deal with that, Boss does” apparently that was the wrong answer. 
For the being disrespectful to coworkers, I was joking around that I didn’t have to take “orders” from two of them because I was give 6 specific people to take orders from, and those two people I was joking around with were not included. I was saying it in a very joking manner, and we were all laughing about it, so I don’t think I was being all that disrespectful. Some other coworkers of mine have said very disrespectful things to me over our Headsets, which everyone can hear, and it was said in a very rude, very disrespectful manner, and nothing was done about that. 

Anyways, I’m currently in a dilemma. I absolutely hate my job, and I can barely stand the thought of getting out of bed to go. The only two reasons I haven’t quit yet is because a) I don’t have another job and b) if I were to quit the smaller business would most likely go under because there would be no one else to work there besides that one co worker, who is also potentially leaving. I feel really guilty about it because I don’t want the business to have to close down, especially since thousands upon thousands of dollars was put into it with purchasing the products and everything. My main question is, should I quit this job once I have another one lined up or would it be an AH move? Also, was the written warning justified and I’m just being sensitive or was it unfair?",26Aug2020,1
47,"I'll try to keep this fairly short. For some reason I have a serious fear of flying that developed somewhat recently from a bad experience on a plane. For that reason, I took a half a pill of klonopin (which is similar to Xanax) I just graduated college so I've experimented with stuff like this but never grew dependent. Before my flight where I was going home to my parents, I decided to get two beers to loosen up a bit before the flight.

The thing is, I have been receiving unsolicited comments via my social media, mainly old creepy dudes saying they are in love and sending me pics of my every movement during the hour I host. Meh, I try not to take care of that. 

But recently I have started dating a co-worker (I would say ""my bad"", but dammit, I'm free and we're not harming anyone and the company policy doesn´t state that this is in any way looked down upon. There are tons of couples at work). He is also a tv host, sports. 

The thing is, we have a stalker and he (?) has been harrassing us with fake profiles and we feel kinda followed. It is ridiculous. We are NOT big shots, even if we are tv hosts. I feel so incredibly scared and annoyed and frustrated with the idea of being followed and that now my private life will be, somehow, public knowledge. Im counting the days until the entire workplace hears the rumour that me and him are dating, and the possible gossip that will ensue :(

So my question is very specific but I truly need help and guidance. How can i deal with this newfound attention? How can I be more careful and take all the precautions to protect my privacy?

For a few years now, I would say I've been depressed (haven't been diagnosed) and have anxiety, both have gotten worse this year. However, I've never spoken to my doctor about this because he treats my whole family (all the way up to grandparents) and has been a family friend for a long time. I went to see him today about headaches and he started asking (for the first time) questions about my mental state, like ""do you ever feel unhappy? Do you ever feel anxious?"" etc. For some reason, I immediately just said no (which couldn't be farther from the truth). Then he asked if I was having trouble sleeping, and I answered yes. He ended up prescribing me an anti-anxiety drug to help me sleep. And when I got in my car, I cried because I didn't realise help was so easily gotten if I just asked. But now here's my problem, and what I need advice on: after responding no to his questions, how do I go back and tell him the truth without feeling like an idiot? I also went on my mum's phone and notice he had texted her what he told me (his diagnosis for my headaches) and I'm worried if I talk to him about this, he'll tell her and there's a huge stigma around mental health in my family. So, do I talk to him and how should I do it?

Bonus extra advice, in the same vain: for some reason I also told him I had nothing else to ask him, but I have been meaning for months to talk to him about how I get awful cramps.

I really want to ask her for number and get to know her outside of her job but I'm honestly unsure how to do this without being weird or creepy. Any advice would be great!,26Aug2020,1
59,"I was with my ex when I was 17. He was 24. We worked together at the time. He is 27 now and I am almost 20. We were “together” for a little over a year. I had a key to his apartment and we talked often about trips we would take and things we would do. He ended up ghosting me and sleeping with one of coworkers. I quit my job and worked elsewhere until he had quit and moved back to his hometown. 
He messaged me a long apology yesterday taking full responsibility for everything he did. He talked about how he was in a bad place and didn’t think about how he was affecting me. He said a lot more, which was nice to hear, but it wasn’t sufficient.  
We messaged for the test of the day, probably an hour or two between messages. He got my phone number again and we just started texted. 
Before he ghosted me, we talked and he had said that no matter how long we went between talking we would still have a connection. He knows a lot of first experiences for me were with him. I am worried that this apology is more from a place of personal guilt and manipulation, than a place of true apology. Opinions???",26Aug2020,1

61,"Long story short I [19M] was blackmailed on gmail after meeting someone who I talked to and shared nudes with on reddit, and I blocked them after giving them some money.

I later met some people online who said they could help bring the person to justice. After talking to them for some while I think that the situation boils down to “we get this persons name and location and then what is essentially pressure them to while on livestream with them delete the photos. I feel like this is in some way vigilante blackmail in itself but they’ve stated that they have done this before and they always send the entire record of things to the local police department where the person is.

My question is, would it be better to risk doing this and potentially have it backfire and my nudes get leaked or telling these people to stand down and just letting my nudes along with face and name and things like that sit on this persons account forever. 

This has been a great source of stress for me, and I think these people are legit, but I’m not sure if the risk of what they’re gonna do is worth it in comparison to living with the risk of my nudes getting leaked for the rest of my life. 

I don’t want to go to the police directly mostly out of fear and also because I don’t want there to be a public record of this whole incident (when they go to the cops my name will be anonymous and everything related to me will be theoretically deleted off this persons account.) 

I don’t think, and I hope I haven’t committed any crimes. I just don’t want this to ruin my future, or have it looming over me.

What should I do?",26Aug2020,1
62,"I have been feeling sadder than before these past couple of weeks and it is really making me rethink everything and what life is about and making me feel down. I live with my parents, my brother, and my daughter. My mother has been angry and explosive at me more recently than before. My brother has been very unkind to me also - Telling me that everyone in the family hates me and wants me to move out. My mother and father has been telling me to move out and that they cant stand me anymore. This has been going on for months but has been more frequent lately and this week it has been extreme. It really hurts me a lot. I cant get a job, I have no friends, I have no one to help me. No one. I cant afford an apartment, I cant afford child care, I cant do anything. I cant drive, I cant get anywhere, I cant even buy my own groceries when I get EBT from the state to purchase them. I have no time to myself. I cant better myself or even finish college because I have no one to even give me a few minutes of time to myself. 

My own daughter even chooses my mother over me. today it hurt me the worst. She started yelling at me telling me to move out and my brother did too, and I told my daughter to come inside with me and she choose to stay with my mom and was scared of me. I was calm and told her to come inside with me so my mom could ""cool down"" and she would not. she told me she wanted to stay with my mom.  I feel alone.

My mom has always loved my brother more than me. They got him a truck and always got him expensive toys and showered him with affection. They promised me a car after I graduated back in 2012 and they lied to me after I graduated and never got me one. They never taught me how to drive. They spent all of their time with my brother and taught him how to drive and do things I never got a chance to learn. 

Now that my mother finally got approved for Social security income they are just bashing me constantly berating me to move out and that they don't like me and that they are tired of me. I don't know what I did.

I am bipolar and filled with anxiety and have been on medication and seeing a therapist. They constantly call me crazy and that I need to be better evaluated that I need to be in a looney bin. I know they would all be happy if I just disappeared or even died in my sleep one day.

I do not have any thoughts of harming myself, just wanting to escape this horrible situation.  I wish I knew how to drive or even had someone help me watch my daughter so I can work and get out of this house. I don't know what to do or where I can turn, I am sad and alone and crying.",26Aug2020,1
63,"I don’t feel like I want her as my best friend anymore, or maybe I just want to keep some distance till things get better and okay. but I know it would break her. 
this year was really bad, for me it was my anxiety hitting the roof because of what she’s been going through as of family problems and such. 
I just want to keep distance for a while but it is a very difficult time for her, and whenever she asks to meet I do my best to put her as a priority but it has been very draining 
I don’t know how to deal with myself because of her anymore 
she’s very suicidal and sensitive and going through the toughest time of her life, so seeing her so called “ best friend “ pushing her away would be very hard. knowing that our other few common friends know of her and are with her in this but they know how much she values me and put me first
however, I can’t take being in this lately
anymore, I just want a break and not to hear of her
it is a harsh thing to think of, seeing her not being able to handle herself at the time and that’s how the pressure is on me mostly. and I don’t want to regret it future wise. 
it just affected my mental health badly, and made me forget about my other friends. I don’t know what to do anymore. I feel like I do actually, but it would be very hard and would make her really sad and worse, and would complicate things way more

64,"Everyone else's reaction to me receiving the offer for the master's 'omg congratulations  yay welldone!'. 

My inner monologue 'ahhhhhh ahhhh ahhhh'. I feel anxious and overwhelmed.  It could b a. My gut is saying it's not the right choice of b. I'm scared of change / challenge. 


I have a lot of deadlines for stuff that I find stressful at the moment simultaneously.  So it could be that.

I haven't written an essay or lab report for years. 

I was in tears so many times doing stats for my undergrad. I had undiagnosed dyslexia...I thought I was just sleep deprived and that's why the numbers were jumping around. 

Logically, I know I'll get support this time around. But this is course is extremely stats heavy. 

I'm worried I'll fail...that this will be harder than undergrad and I'll not cope. 

Also, there is hardly any UK funding for st age 2 training to become a health psychologist (this masters is stage one). 

I probably want to work therapeutically with patients/ clients but this masters is very geared up for research scientist training (as was my undergrad compared to a standard psych degree). 

I'm scared about finances.

My health hasn't been great recently and I don't know if I'm well enough.


However my current career is quite dead end and even if I decide I don't want to be a health psychologist after all...this is such an amazing uni and they also will have a great career service  and it might push me to change for the better instesd of staying in my dead end position.",26Aug2020,1
65,"Background: This girl and I became friends late sophomore year of high school (about 5 years ago). Since I’ve known her, she’s manipulated me into paying for things for her. She even went as far as to use my card to rack up $400 of doordash charges WITHOUT my knowledge or permission. I have dropped everything I was doing to come rescue her, even sitting with her after a 10 hour day during her graveyard shift at IHOP. Majorly thanks to the pandemic I had stopped contact with her. She'd recently reached out saying she would pay me for tutoring her in math. (she went to 4 different schools for high school by her volition and didn't graduate. I graduated with honors) I didn't really want to, but the extra cash would've been great because Covid drained me. In the conversation I had with her about it, she said her mom/step-dad, boyfriend, and dad/step-mom are all moving out of state within a few weeks. I suspected she just wanted to draw me in again and hang out but we agreed to Saturday/ Sunday 9-12

The first Saturday. We HAD to get coffee since she wasn't already awake. (thankfully she paid for it) After a lot of uncomfortable to watch PDA with her BF but I was able to teach her a few simple pre-algebra/ algebra concepts. Eventually, I got hungry and we went to get food. Her boyfriend left when we got back. I figured we'd eat and get back to it since we really hadn't covered much and her timeline was so short, we didn’t.

Sunday... We reschedule for 11 since she went fishing with her dad. I don't mind since I was having breakfast with my family. She tells me that she is so tired cuz she got up early and proceeds to take a nap for 2 -3 hours. I left after she woke up as no one else was home to be able to lock the door.

The next Saturday, we spend 90 minutes working on math. (I’d pulled math problems from previous GED tests for her to try throughout the week. Waiting until last minute and then yelled at me that morning about how they were too hard and she didn't know any of them and threw a tantrum) Her mom knocks on the door and asks to get off the wifi since she is trying to live chat with family. She throws a hissy fit and says she can't work now because she has no tv noise. Something that wasn't a problem prior.

Sunday she says she doesn't want me to come so she can study alone and really focus

The next weekend was coming up, so I messaged her Friday to make sure we are still good for tutoring as I’d been doing. And she said that she was on Vicodin for an infection in her jaw and couldn't focus. Saturday she messages me wanting popsicles, I make it clear I wasn’t coming to get her... she decided to drive to the store and use the oven in the house while no one else was home on narcotics.

I told her at the end of the day I was no longer going to tutor her because there was a clear lack of effort and she was constantly distracted. And have since ceased all contact with her once more. AITA for this? I feel bad but I'm much happier without her around...",26Aug2020,1
66,"Hey guys!
So i am planning to go to Abroad for uni. I am doing a 3 year course + 1 year foundation and i kind of have limited funds. 
I have worked out the total cost for the first year (foundation year) and it comes to around $15,000 and I have about $10,000 saved up from freelancing online for the past year and a half.
I am not sure if I can replicate my income for the coming year and im really feeling anxious on what if i completely run out of funds and Don't have any options.
I have looked into getting a job in the country i am going to but the maximum i can get is about $200 a month where as the monthly expenses are approximately $600. 
From the 1st year of the course (after foundation) I can get a student loan so that should be abit easier. 

Would love to hear your thoughts/suggestions on what I can do and if i should take the risk and hope i can manage those funds. 
Thanks in advance :)",26Aug2020,1
67,"There has always been a bit of a spider problem in my house. I live in a council house so the quality of the house isnt exactly the best. But anyway it has resulted in spiders being annoying my whole life. But recently things have gotten out of hand!

Every day there is a bigger and bigger spider in my room. Every day.

Sometimes multiple on the same damn day.

The one today was the size of my fist! 

This wouldn't be as much of an issue if I didnt have a massive phobia of spiders. And by that I mean I cant even go near one. I cant even be in the same room as one! 

I'm constantly paranoid now, I cant sleep anymore. I'm always looking for the next massive spider.

I'm beginning to think there is some kind of infestation in my house. Or a nest in my walls. But I cant go on living like this- my hands shake for hours after seeing a spider and as an artist that is very bad.

But please can I have some advice on how to keep spiders out of my room. If I keep seeing them I'm going to jump off a cliff",26Aug2020,1

70,"Hello fellow redditers, this is my first post ever! 

So it’s pretty simple and as the title says, I always get stomach aches before work every morning. 

I’m a 24 year old male, 6 foot 2, a bit on the bigger side, etc etc you get the idea. 

Now I drink ALOT of energy drinks a day. I’m not sure about the rest of the world but here in Australia we have one called ‘V’. You can get it in a variety of flavours and sizes, I always get the Blue flavour one and in a 500ml can. I can drink anywhere from 1-10 of these a day, the caffeine doesn’t affect me so there is no different between 1 and 10 for me, I just like the taste. 

The only reason I’m giving this information is because a lot of my friends and family swear that’s the reason I get these stomach aches is because of these and nothing else...but I don’t think so. 

I work a pretty standard job, average pay, fulltime 38 hours a week. It use to be a hellhole, I’ve been with the company for around 4.5 years now. The first year was good, then year 2 and 3!for some reason the boss decided I would be a good target and we use to but heads like nothing else. But this last 6-12 months we have both matured and that nonsense has stopped. I use to think that this was the reason of my stomach aches...but I digress, the stop happen to this day. 

Every single morning without fail, I wake up fine, get ready and head off to work. Half way through the car ride I ALWAYS get a shocking stomach ache and half the time I don’t even know if I’ll make it to work without pooping myself (luckily I never actually have). 

The thing is, this NEVER happens on the weekends, ever! Saturday and Sunday mornings I’m calm and controlled in the bowel region. But I don’t do anything different, I still drink the same amount of drinks. 

So reddit, what I’m asking you is: is this the drinks, really bad anxiety about work, or maybe something more serious. 

Any help would be greatly appreciated, have a good day everybody! :)",26Aug2020,1

I have ptsd from being sexually assaulted in high school and having to go to court and then from being raped by my boyfriend in college. Because of that I've also developed an eating disorder and the idea of having sex with someone get's me very anxious and I basically dissociate. For a while, I thought I wanted a boyfriend so I joined a dating app and went out with someone a few days ago. He was really nice and we connected and everything but after that, I didn't eat for 2 days. We were going to hang out tonight and he suggested coming over to my house and getting dinner. This instantly made me, to be totally honest, freak the fuck out. I got really hot and anxious and started crying really hard and started drinking. I lied and told him I forgot I had to do something and asked if I could text him to reschedule. This experience has made me realize I am not in any way ready for a relationship and that I have to get help for my ptsd and eating disorder.

My situation is basically what the title says. I’ve been deciding whether or not I should unadd a bunch of people on snap and Instagram, or just let it go.

75,"I came home from work tonight and my baby boy, my Groot, I found him dead. I've lost cats before but this one is hitting me more than any before. His brother Rocket is still here and just last night they were playing chase with each other, Grooty was his normal self... jumping on me and giving me headbutt cuddles which could sometimes get annoying if you were trying to sleep but now I'll never get them again.

I always make up affectionate serenades for my cats, he was no different. Some of my favorites were play on words with his name, and both he and Rocket have their fair share of dual ones.

I love them both so much, they are a huge part of my life because of not having any friends, which is mostly my fault because of my stupidity over the years. Rocket seems to be searching for him and hovering around me a lot. I can't look at him because I feel like it's my fault although I have no idea why or how Grooty died, but he doesn't have his brother anymore. I don't know what he's going to do. Do cats grieve for each other?

I still can't believe he's dead. I was crying and sobbing, pleading for him to wake up. Part of me still refuses to believe it, that he'll wake up and be so scared in that box he's in temporarily until I can bury him. I can't take it that I'll never see him again, and I don't think my mental health can take this tragedy.

I am searching my brain to be sure I pet him and sang to him before I left for work today, that he got my love one last time. I take it for granted that he'd always be here when I get home. He was here with my mom all day, she said that nothing was out of the ordinary and he was headbutt cuddling her and bugging for treats like always. She knows that she pet him, so the fact he got love and attention before he passed is a little bit of solace. I just wish I knew it was my last time with him this morning so I could have shown him all my love.

A giant hole in my life is here now, and I don't know what to do for myself or my little Rocket man.

80,"So, my father is a pathological liar and an alcoholic with an inability to accept responsibility. When my brother and I were young, he physically abused us both and sexually molested me. I can't say if he molested my brother as he is non-verbal and disabled--I do everything in my power to make sure my brother is never reminded of my father so any memories of abuse won't be triggered. He was also abusive to my mom and she refuses to talk about those years. 

While we were still young, my father abandoned us and had no contact with us for years. He eventually reached out to my mother and told her how he was remarried, had a great government job, and was having another child. My mother was a nurse trying to take care of two kids, one with severe special needs, and was struggling. She asked if he would pay child support and he responded by filing for full custody of my brother and me. What followed was a supremely fucked up court battle which only ended when a child psychiatrist told the judge that any level of forced contact with my father would ruin my life. 

Fast forward a while and my father has repeatedly tried pulling me into a relationship using his two new kids. They seem nice enough and I would stay in contact with them if not for my father. He only lets me contact them through an email he manages and he has to be present in any video call we have. 

I recently decided to just cut him out of my life entirely, including severing contact with my half brothers until they can talk to me independently. It's just that any level of contact with my father gives me shakes, headaches, and a whole lot of stress. My fiancé assures me that it's the best thing for me but I feel awful about not talking to the kids. My father repeatedly says that I'm their hero and that they idolise me; it's a huge punch in the gut thinking I might be letting them down and be as bad as my father.

I never feel that my boundaries are disrespected, I know I can talk to her about anything, and we're just generally exactly on the same wavelength.

We usually just joke and laugh about it. Today was the last time we would see each other before she leaves, (socially distant of course) and I forget how we got there, but we basically starting talking about how we always have seen ourselves staying together even through our old age, and how we mutually feel that we'll keep contact long beyond high school. She even talked about sometimes she felt like she would marry me when we were older. I can't imagine my life without her, and I don't find her unattractive, and I have a deep love for her, and told her so. We were laughing, but things got kind of serious.

90,"My (22NB) sister (25F) was visiting a little while ago for a month. She lives about hours away by bus so we don’t see her often. While she was visiting, I was often leaving the house to go to a friend’s or just to walk around, and if not outside I was staying in my room most of the time.

After going to a friend’s one day, she was passive aggressively ignoring me and glaring at me, or snapping at me for every thing I did. Finally after almost a week of that, she slammed my door open and said she was waiting for an apology. I said for what, and she said that I had missed her birthday dinner when I had gone to my friend’s house.

Her birthday is in May, and this was in July, maybe a few weeks after my birthday and my mom’s birthday. We had had a birthday dinner for her at a patio earlier that week, because we weren’t able to in May with COVID, but I had gone to that birthday dinner of course and didn’t know what she was talking about, or if she was angry I hadn’t bused to her place during a pandemic months prior.

Apparently her and my mom were planning a second birthday dinner for her but neither of them told me this, and both were there when I said I was leaving to go to my friend’s and neither said anything then either. I said as much, that I didn’t know cause nobody told me, and she called me a selfish b\*tch and insulted me some more so I tuned her out and then she left.

We haven’t spoken since then other than a message conversation where I asked again what she was angry about (because the above reason felt so petty and weird that I didn’t think it’d be what she was so angry over) and she said again, it was because I hadn’t gone to the birthday dinner and that “not knowing is not an excuse” and that “if you cared you would have asked” which is just mind-boggling to me. Then she said she was also angry that I had left her to take care of the dog and “everything around the house” while she was on vacation, but I think that’s pretty unreasonable considering she wasn’t doing chores or making dinner or anything. And I’m the only one who walks the dog. Not to mention, he is an elderly blind dog, it’s unreasonable to expect to not have to “care” for the family dog when she is home for a whole month; A.K.A. Let him out in the backyard to pee. Since that I haven’t responded cause I’m not sure what to say. And she’s messages several times to say that she is still angry with me and stuff like “You really have nothing to say?”.

I feel guilty that I was avoiding the house or staying in my room a lot of the time but my family is a lot to deal with. The only thing that makes me feel normal is going to visit friends and being treated normally by them. A few days before her running into my room and calling me a selfish b\*tch, my mom had been screaming at me on the couch because I was anxious to go to orientation for a job, and she was saying that she “was sick of dealing with me” and trying to pull me by my arms to leave. When I came home, and said I couldn’t take the job because of location and hours stuff, she started berating me too. It was my birthday that day, so I had two friends over and she was doing this in front of them and starting grilling me about what I learned today and how to not end up in a situation like that again and why I should have asked more questions during the interview. Not to mention, when I said no to watching a movie with them, my mom came up that night and said really horrible things, like: “You think you’re the only person with problems? Cause you sure act like it./I \[applied for jobs\] and you can’t even do that while you sit in your room and do NOTHING/you are so selfish and hurtful“ and then saying that I ruminate on my own issues so I can hurt everyone around me, and that I’m the biggest issue in the house and the reason everyone else is ever upset. And anytime I bring up her saying those things, I’m told that I “have a whole fantasy world in my own head“ and that “all I do is put words in others mouths to make them look bad” and that maybe she should start recording everytime we talk. With all that going on, plus like a whole a lifetime of that but it feels worse since I’m back home because I lost my job during COVID and everybody is frustrated and anxious and bored, by the time my sister came in with that, it felt like this was a huge joke. Or like wondering if she was that mad about that, and just needed a punching bag too, especially considering she was basically parroting my mom.

Given the chance to do over, I wouldn’t spend more time with her or in the house, because it would have been really unsafe for me. I’ve had some mental health stuff, including psychosis which is why it hurts so much to be told I’m a liar, but the psychosis is latent and has been for a while and I am proud of myself that I’ve made progress on suicidal thoughts and self harm!! But the environment like this, it’s scary that I’m having thoughts like those again and it feels like I’m slipping back.As much as there are obviously good times, I just don’t have the incentive or will to spend time with my sister or the rest of my family because I spend the whole time acutely aware that if I slip up, then I might make them angry and it’s upsetting to be insulted and yelled at. Call it selfish, but I have to be responsible and take care of myself, and if that is selfish, then I‘m fine being called that.

I know that if I don’t apologize to my sister, she will never apologize to me. I can see where I went wrong even though she didn’t say it explicitly, I think she’s angry that I wasn’t spending enough time with her while on a rare visit. But if I apologize I am confirming my family’s belief that I am horrible, selfish, and hurt people. I’m not interested in changing their opinions on me, it’s none of my business and I’m not likely to maintain a relationship when I can move out again, but for my own sanity and pride, I refuse to give that to them. But If I don’t apologize I am really afraid of what will happen, considering refusing to apologize is a worse offence than saying no to watching a movie. This is really long and I’m sorry there’s so much rambling but I wanted to provide a little bit of context at least around the week of the event.

TLDR: My sister is angry at me because I didn’t know about something that I was not told about. I don’t know how to apologize in a situation where I don’t feel like I’ve done something wrong. Also if I give a standard apology with full admission of guilt, it reaffirms my family’s belief that I can be yelled at and insulted and that I deserve it. And if I dont apologize soon, there will be consequences for me. If anyone has any advice/an apology outline/do’s and don’ts that would be amazing.",26Aug2020,1

92,"I was just fired today from my first real job out of college because I failed a hair follicle drug test. The drug test wasn’t even for my company but for another company we work for. They said that this is the first time they’re doing hair follicle drug test and with my luck I was the first person to get one as a new hire. Normally it’s just a piss test which they also gave me and I passed. Because of this they said they’ll allow me to come back but I have to do one month of rehab. I did some research and it’s more counseling which I can do online. 

I graduated university in December and received this job offer in November before graduation. I took a few months off to travel before starting work and then covid came and messed everything up. I was going to start in March but since covid they kept delaying my start date and I finally got to start a week ago. 

I occasionally smoked weed throughout college and since covid shut everything down and not being able to work, I indulged while I waited with a plan to stop a month before my start date as I anticipated a drug test. 

I finally got a start date which was a week ago and didn’t smoke at all the month before. To my demise when I walked in the first day they said I had to do a hair follicle drug test. I was freaking out on the inside but just acted normal. The results came back yesterday and I failed. I had a talk today with my supervisor, who is on my side and thinks a hair follicle test is ridiculous especially on someone fresh out of college, but it’s company policy and I have to do a month of rehab before I can come back. I’ll have to wait an extra month too since I’d have to take another hair follicle drug test when I come back. They said my job will be here when I come back. Which was reassuring. 

The job pays very well, about 100k a year, and a long interview process to get it. I got a degree in engineering and I have a good resume, so getting another job wouldn’t be difficult, but it will be hard to find another job that pays this well. It’s a high stress job with a lot of traveling, that’s why it pays so well. 

Do I just suck it up and do the rehab and wait an extra month so I’m clean? It’ll probably take me a month or two to find another job anyway. Or do I chalk this up as a learning lesson and move on to another job, one that pays less but is less stress? Any advice is appreciated. 

I’m just looking for an outside perspective and advice from someone older about whether a high stress high pay job is worth it. 

TLDR: I failed a hair follicle drug test for my first job out of college. It’s the first time it’s been required so they’ll let me come back but I have to do a month of rehab and wait an extra month to be clean. It’s a high stress high pay job. Is it worth coming back?",26Aug2020,1
93,"Hi, to the person reading this. I think this is the first time I'll be airing out my problems like this outside of a few friends so I hope I get my point across.

Ok, so I'm in my 2nd year of Medicine school and I'm starting to have doubts if this is really the career path for me. First of all, I didn't choose this career because it was my dream. My mother is a doctor and as stereotypes in the Asian household go, it is expected for children to follow in their parent's footsteps (or even if one of your parents isn't a doctor, it's still a very common career path because it's a noble profession and it brings in good money). 

 During our semestral break, I had the chance to focus on my passion for drawing. I've always loved art and I've always wanted to become an artist or maybe an animator, altho I have minimal experience in the latter. Everything I know about art is self-taught and I know within myself that my talent may not be enough to get me a job in the arts world. 

I keep thinking if my situation would be different if I took an art-related course during college. If I had professional art teaching... If I learned how to actually animate aside from what I learned from youtube... would I be good enough to pursue an art career? That's always been in my head but I'm already in Medicine so if I quit now what can I do? Go back to college and pursue an art career? That's another 4 years of me studying and a big burden on my parents.

My best bet for now is to endure Medicine, become a doctor and if I still have the energy, then I will find time for my passion but this time I will be able to support myself. 

That's my plan but I feel like I'm on the edge of a breakdown. Everytime I see my classmates get so excited about online classes I just get angry and depressed. My seniors as well, I see them posting about how happy they are and how close they are achieving their dreams. Meanwhile, I can't help think that it's all fake just because I can't relate to their enthusiasm. I can't imagine someone being so happy while suffering studying Medicine. But I guess that's how it is? Even if it's hard they push through it because it's what they really want. Can't say the same for me. Most of my friends know what specialties they're going to take (pediatrics, cardiology, stuff like that) and me... all I need is to graduate and whatever happens will happen. 

Anyway, I'm sorry this is so long. I'm asking for any kind of advice. Really. Any. Advice.
I'm just so lost right now.

TL;DR. I'm not happy studying Medicine because my passion is in art but I can't quit because I don't have enough talent for an art career.",26Aug2020,1

I have to let them fizzle out because I find myself chasing them, (?) aka I’m like the last option for them and I’m the only one asking to hang out.

The thing is, I've never really been bothered by the fact that he was hooking up with girls before because it's never been serious. I've always known, deep down, that they were not right for him (i did not tell him, to let him have his experiences, and I was there for him when it was over). Now, I am moving to university out of the state, and I just realised I am in love with this guy. I KNOW it is cheesy asf and that I am a dumba** for not realising this earlier, but the past is the past. I don't know what to do, partly because he just started seeing someone so it would kinda be wrong toward both of them to just declare my love, but also because I dont want our relationship to change for the worse. On the other hand, I simply cannot imagine my life without him, and it would kill me if he left me because he's not comfortable with me liking him like that. I want to believe that our friendship is strong enough to survive this, but what if it's not? Should I just move away and never tell him? Would that be better for everybody?

I (21F) am a college student. I pay all of my own bills myself, and it's been really hard lately, especially because I'm getting treated for mental health for the first time, which is a lot of money by itself.

For reasons that will take to long to talk about, I moved out of my mother's house two years ago and I haven't looked back. However, she kept the dog. I've been buying dog food and stuff to care for her since I moved out. Also it's important to note that my dog is like 6 years old. My mom and everyone in my family is shit and I don't think she's been to the vet for at least 3 or 4 years.

I was informed recently that they believe that she has a tooth problem because she's avoiding chewing with one side of her mouth or something, so I'm assuming worst case scenario she'll have to get a tooth removed. 

And then today, they told me that she needs to go to the vet TOMORROW because she has scabies?? I'm going to take her and get it checked out. I don't really know what scabies is at all and I don't know what to do. 

TL;DR: I'm struggling with money and I'm taking my 6 year old dog to the vet tomorrow. She might need a tooth removed, scabies treatment, and a regular check up and all the vaccines that she's missed over the years. How much money should I expect to pay? Is there anything else I should know?

My dad and I have a troubled history. He’s always been verbally and emotionally abusive to me and on a few occasions, he’s been physically abusive.

109,"Help!    will this nightmare ever cease?!  will i ever be able to sleep? !

For the past 9 Years I have been harassed on a near daily basis by my next door neighbors mentally ill man-child ""Son"".

Backstory and facts:

10 years ago I purchased my first home.  it was relatively cheap and in a rural area.  only a few neighbors,  I was sop exited!  little did I know it is probably the worst mistake I had ever made.

for the first 6-8 months everything was going great,   Until my neighbors ""son"" man-child got a new toy.  his mother  bought him a used diesel truck  with the works  lifted, loud exhaust, train horn, ect.... 

every morning 530 -730 AM he would start up and REV up this truck, jujst sit there in his driveway for roughly 2 hours  Reving,   driving it  full bore up and down the road  and tooting that damn train horn.

a few days of this and I could not take it anymore.   I waited one morning until around 8 am when he was done for the day with his  truck. knocked on his door  and his mommy answered  and I asked if I could speak with him  .  

He came to the door and I remained CALM and POLITE and asked him if he could possibly do his truck stuff later on in the day  because its way to early for all of that noise.   

He said NO and if I didn't like it I didn't have to listen to it, and that he will do it more now that he knows it bothers me.  so I left and went back home.   and yes I was nice about it  this guy is just angry at the world.

this incident with him is the reason for him to harrass me and my family on a near daily basis,

The diesel Truck is not the only thing he uses to cause us grief.   he has an assortment of toys.   dirtbikes, snowmobiles, ATVs, Chainsaws, lawnmowers, fireworks, rifles/shotguns

and he bangs on sheet metal and or metal barrels at ungodly hours 1-2-3 AM.

none of these vehicles have mufflers he either cut them off or runs straight pipes.

Some Facts:   

Our houses are about 200 feet apart and his driveway  meanders through the woods and comes within 30 feet from my bedroom window.   He does all the truck stuff around the part of his driveway that is near my house  specifically my bedroom.

since it his ""his"" driveway there is nothing i can do about it.  he made it a point to use that area next to my house as a basecamp to tinker with vehicles and other loud stuff.

He is a 40 year old Man child who never had any kind of employment and his mommy takes care of his every need.  food, housing, clothing, beer, cigarettes'.  he very rarely leaves the property  once a year his mommy brings him camping for a week.   that 1 week is my only  peace and quiet.

What have i done about it.  tried to be polite and understanding about the situation tried to talk to the mother about it but she is in another world  ""Dementia"" I think. in her mind her son can do no wrong and its everyone else fault.  

I tried talking to him but he is so unstable / angry / delusional  there is absolutely no way to get through to him

this guy has never worked so he just does not understand that people who work need sleep.

when that failed i tried to get Police involved/ noise complaints ..... ECT... for years and none of it works,  its a very rural county and they are many miles away with little patrols.

I have tried many things to soundproof my bedroom.  i hung carpets on the walls like a Russian. i put heavy welding blankets on the outside wall   built a sheet metal fence   to try to block all of this sound.  and 3 years ago i snapped and beat the hell out of him, he had me arrested pressed charges and i spent some time in jail.     yes i do realize that violence is not the best course of action but i couldn't take it anymore.    especially when you get violently woken out of bed for years straight only to see this idiot  either revving up some loud vehicle right outside your window    starring and smiling at you.

some other facts.  my other neighbors hate this and we all tried to make complaints with the town, i think he has a relative in either the sheriffs department or town.  He is literally untouchable.

&amp;#x200B;

i have thought many times about trying to sell my house and move but its still a fixer upper and i dont think i will get much for it, honestly it is  an underwater mortgage  i was young and nieve and bought a dump.   Worst mistake EVER !

i am open to all suggestions  except for violence / property destruction.   any witches want to do a spell for me??  Or the devil himself im ready to make a deal   \*JK\*

The only solution is pain medication. I hate it, and have made that known since the day she was prescribed. My family has had issues (as have all of ours) and I am just generally scared of the consequences.

Today, she overdosed for the 2nd time. Both times, my 7 year old daughter called 911, like I rehearsed with her. She knows my phone number just in case. Luckily, my fiance is fine, and now home. Since it is an accidental overdose (truthfully) they sent her home after an injection of what the Doctor called ""strong Xanax"". That was to delay the withdrawal until she could come home and take her next dose of pain medication. 

I don't even know what to do. I love my fiance. She is a wonderful mother. I know she is in agony and needs the medication, and she accidentally overdosed by taking a second dose early because of the pain. But am I enabling? Are the Doctors? I just am scared and worried.

Sorry about the length, I just needed to get that all off of my chest. I created this account on the Longshot that someone would have some advice on this truly screwed up situation.",26Aug2020,1

120,"Let me preface this by saying I am a current student. 

I'm stuck between working $12 part time with my mom, with the school board. So it's a secure job. But im an assitsnt. Idk bow likely i am to get promoted soon. I have looked for jobs within them but its hard as I'm not qualified. The jobs are the same or less if I take into account gas. 

The NEW job offer is a full time assistant/office manager position where I could earn up to 50k with the bonuses and incentives. Its a pretty office space in a super nice building where the security seems strong (there's a bank and large corporation's headquarters in the same building) BUT the website for the small company seems super minmal, there is no BBB or LinkedIn for it either... Maybe the owner isn't that technologically advanced idk... but there's also almost nothing on him. I think i tracked his records and the one that seems like him seems clean ... 

I called the boss back to ask him to draw up a contract and he was very quick to say yes. Just a bunch of things to consider. 

I'm worried because (luckily) right now I have loyalty with a secure organization AND I feel safe, which for me as a young girl is important. 

So do I take the risk? I'll take any helpful, courteous advice!",26Aug2020,1
121,"Hello all, 
  So basically my adopted dad was a pos who cheated on my mom and got in an accident, became readdicted to drugs and is now in jail. I do have good memories of him though when i want younger, but im also angry at him for his actions. I did visit him in jail a few times after his mom, my adopted grandma, had reached out to me. So for a month or two i was talking to them and visiting my grandma and it was ok.

The problem is that I feel like she is just manipulating me to spend time with her because shes lonely and her and my dad are both extremely manipulating, although she is only wanting my time it seems. My dad stopped calling after i ignored a bunch of calls, and it hurts, but my grandma keeps replying to my stories on instagram asking questions and such which i have been ignoring for months now.

I dont know if I should block her or just tell her I dont want to talk to her or what. My dad apparently is becoming a bhuddist in jail and is turning over a new leaf but i am highly suspicious of it. 

Overall I feel like interacting with them is negatively impacting my life and is just a waste of time and draining my energy.
 
On the other hand I feel bad ignoring my grandma and dad when I really do want them to be happy and healthy. 

I dont know what to do, sorry if this is hard to follow but i am just rambling and feeling guilty. Any advice on what to do?",26Aug2020,1

123,"Hi guys 

If you could please be kind I would appreciate it. 

Basically I was raped a few days ago by this guy I'd gone out with previously. We met online and had a nice dinner for our first date. Looking back he did make a few strange comments about how he believed all women were secretly into sex and had forbidden fantasies but since he didn't specify I guess I just laughed it off. He otherwise seemed very nice and has a respectable job, social media with lots of friends, and no obvious red flags.

We had another dinner a few days ago and went back to his place to watch a movie. I hadn't had anything to drink and he had two beers at dinner. He got out wine before we watched the movie but I didn't have any. He drank his pretty fast but I still wouldn't say three drinks over the course of several hours is enough for a 6 foot, muscular man to be super drunk.

Basically when we were watching the movie he got super weird and started making comments about how much I wanted sex and how it radiated off me. He said that I probably dreamed about being attacked and loved violent men (without any evidence of either thing, I actually can't even watch scary movies because I hate violence). He said I was the biggest whore he'd ever seen and he felt that he had no choice but to destroy me like an animal (exact words).

 He told me he was going to rape me and held me down while he did that. At one point my legs gave out and I was virtually numb from the waist down because it was so rough. I was bleeding and have one bruise on my neck and one on my arm. I tried to fight him and was yelling stop over and over but it only stopped when he finished, went to the bathroom and I ran away. The security guard at his building asked me if I was OK because my clothes were basically ripped off and I was crying. 

He texted me the next day to ask why I'd left and said he'd had a great time. I didn't reply and then got 6 other texts in an hour asking variations of the same thing. I finally just said that he had assaulted me and not stopped when I asked him to (oversimplification but I was scared). He told me he was not that kind of guy and asked if I could be thinking of someone else. I said no, it was definitely you, do you not remember? At which point he claimed he was blackout drunk and couldn't remember his actions. He said he had never raped anyone and that any of his friends would defend him on that. I said well this doesn't change what happened here. He then said that he understood I couldn't trust him but said the most important thing is that we remained friends. He said I should make the effort to show him how his behavior was wrong and that he would try to learn. 

The thing is I understand that sometimes there is poor communication in a relationship but this was absolutely not one of those times. Categorically he told me disgusting things, became turned on by telling me how he wanted to attack me, told me he would rape me, and then did. We had not slept together until that point so this isn't an issue of me liking rough sex either, I don't, and he didn't have any idea what I liked or didn't like. 

He continues to text me almost every hour saying how bad he feels for the misunderstanding and asking me out, saying he just wants to see me. I feel cynical thinking that he is worried about the cameras in his apartment building but he did tell me many times before that the cameras there record everything so it's super safe. He doesn't know I spoke to the guard but literally I sprinted out of the apartment, down 8 flights of stairs, and out in the lobby where I probably looked terrifying. I would think if I wanted to push it the cameras would probably support my account.

I'm sorry if this is a stupid question but I'm not thinking clearly now. Is this a normal thing people do to apologize for assaulting someone or is this weird? He has said probably 20 times that I am super understanding and he'd hate for me to change myself just because of what happened. I honestly just think this is an attempt to silence me and he's taking further advantage but I don't know if I'm being too harsh. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated. Oh and I already talked to the RAINN chat but I don't have any friends close by so it's been difficult for me to process alone. Thank you so much",26Aug2020,1

125,"This is a long story the starts all the way back in 5th grade so bear with me. I (15f) met my best friend (15 genderfluid) ""Erin"" back in 5th grade. I was bullied for my birth defect marcus gunn jaw winking syndrome which was activated when I ate. When 5th grade started I sat at the end of a table with a bunch of random people because I knew one from church (I was raised mormon). Erin was someone who was grossed out by my defect and didn't want to be my friend. Yet overtime I gave them my food which made us really close. 

Flash forward to 8th grade. I was now also best friends with ""Lily"" (15f). We were all really close to the point that Erin knew about my mental issues. I was harming myself and had severe bulimia which Erin didn't encourage but never told anyone. I overdosed on Tylenol in a suicide attempt and was sent to the mental hospital and then to an e*ting disorder clinic. I was gone for all of 8th grade recovering. When I got back it was the summer and me, Erin, and Lily weren't so close anymore. During that time i made a lot of online friends. I completely understood because I was gone for so long and they needed to get on with their lives. We still hung out but I was now a background character. 

At the end of the summer Erin held a dnd game which I went to. That's when I met ""Kyle""(15m). We hit it off really well but I later learned Erin and Kyle had a thing. I asked Erin about it and they said it was a while ago and that Erin only liked women. So with their encouragement at the beginning of freshman year me and Kyle started dating. I was absolutely enthralled because no one had ever liked me like that before him.

My relationship with Kyle wasn't the best. He would pressure me into sexual activities even though I'm an asexual r*pe survivor with ptsd. I would cry but he'd guilt me into it anyways. He also isolated me from my friends and I felt like I needed him. During this Erin would make comments like ""I could take your man"" and ""you were his second option"" all while cuddling him or sitting on his lap. This made me uncomfortable but i let it go because i thought it was a joke. All of my friends would go to this church event on Thursday nights so I would too. I'm a pretty hard-core atheist but I went just to hang out with my friends. I was always very respectful but never got respect in return. The leader made fun of my sexuality, e*ting disorder, and tried to pray my disability away. Eventually I had enough and told Erin I was no longer going because I didn't agree with the ideologies of the group. Erin got a little mad at me saying I was being disrespectful to their religion when I wasn't trying to be. In the end me and Kyle would just hangout at his house on Thursday nights. Side note my online friends HATED kyle. I didn't really see while until I saw how unbelievably rude he was to them. He even asked my best friend (17m) to suck his d*ck. I met this friend in a therapy group for sexu*l ass*ult survivors. So Kyle knew he was asexual and had PTSD.

Covid hits us and Kyle broke up with me at the beginning of the lock down. It was out of nowhere and I was completely heartbroken. Kyle said I was gonna make everyone hate him because I was crying. I told him my best friends might take my side but no one would hate him for leaving me. It was like 2 weeks later and Erin and Lily have been ignoring me. I ask them if they want to hangout in my basement for my birthday since I can't hang out with a large group of friends like normal. They both declined and went back to ghosting me. 

3 more months go by before I return Kyle his stuff due to bad timing. I drop off all his stuff to learn he had trashed all the things I lent him. Some of them being very important to me. I shrugged it off because I was having some major health issues I needed to focus on. It was around 11pm and I woke up from a trauma nightmare (a little high on painkillers). I decided to text Kyle and tell him i was officially moving on but I wanted to be friends. 

""Hey. I just woke up from another dream/nightmare. I decided that I need to officially and fully move on. I thought giving your stuff back would help but it didnt that much. I think I just need to let you know that I love you and always will just one last time. Hopefully I can fully and officially move on. Thanks for listening to me ramble I just don't want it to be awkward when we go back to school ♡ thank you"" - my text.

I thought it was sweet but not pressuring so I went back to bed. The next morning I woke up to Erin very aggressively telling me not to text Kyle. Erin said I was a horrible person who did horrible things to Kyle. I was rather confused and asked them to explain. They then proceeded to tell me a bunch of lies Kyle told about me. I quickly disprove all the lies and give my side of the story as civilly as possible. At kne point they even said my friend sent Kyle death threats when all he did was asked him to stop sexually harassing him. I send Erin the screenshots of Kyle assaulting my friend. Erin goes on to say that they don't care because that's not the kyle they know. It turns out they also told Lily all these things. Some things that said that upset me were ""your life is terrible"" (its not), ""if you want to be my friend you need to put in more effort"", ""you're toxic"", and ""we didn't want to pick sides"" (even though they picked Kyle's right away).  They didn't even bother to ask me about my side or listen to it. 

I cried hysterically and showed my parents everything that happened. They both said I'm not the asshole and they hated Erin since the beginning. I could go on about all the things Erin has done but one is leaving me abandoned at a restaurant at midnight and telling everyone my r*pe story. I also showed some other irl friends that aren't mutuals with Erin and they agreed im not the asshole. One even came out to me about how Kyle had sexu*lly har*ssed them. 

I keep getting told I'm not the asshole but I feel like such an asshole. I lost my two irl best friends and they won't even listen to my side. They are calling me a horrible person. I hope this makes sense. I made this in a rambled, crying rage. It won't let me post this on aita.",26Aug2020,1
126,"This could be a long response to a trivial matter, but that seems the nature of my life right now.

I believe the location of the property is important in regards to describing how the event occurred. My house is situated in a private community which shares a single walkway accessible solely by foot and that extends for a half of a mile along the marshy coast of S\_\_\_\_ bay, where it dead ends. Branching off from the central walkway are those of the individual houses, which vary in length, some, like mine, lying almost adjacent to main one. The actual structure of my house consists of a large front room. The side which faces the walkway is mostly glass and though not at all private, best accommodates the view of a large expanse of marshland. My house is the second to last so while in the front room, it's infrequent to see a neighbor pass, as there is only one who ordinarily has reason to do so, however it's not rare that others journey the length of the walkway.

I am practicing the clarinet in the front room, which is the nicest room to play in. The Neighbor who recorded me, Neighbor T,  who moved several months ago into a house well before from mine, walks by. They pass from my view and I assume, continue to the end of the walkway terminating some fifty feet after my house. I've stopped playing the clarinet because I'm not any good and am not eager for others to listen (not that I begrudge anyone who can't help but hear me play as they pass, in most cases the neighbor with the furthest down house). Though I am no longer playing, I remain focused on the sheet music in front of me so as to give impression of occupation. I sense Neighbor T in my periphery, a sensation that becomes increasingly discomfiting through the suspicion that they're trying to get my attention. I look up from the music stand before me and see that Neighbor T holding their phone directly at me as they slowly walk back in the direction they came (there's about a 15ft distance between them and I). I am incredulous. I motion with my hands to stop. Neighbor T's pleased smile disappears and is replaced by an expression of slight embarrassment. My incredulity remains, never has anyone, visitors let alone neighbors thought to point a camera inside the house with clear view of me. I exit and approach them, asking if they would please delete the Video. At this point, a fair account that excludes neighbor T's and privileges my own is impossible. Furthermore, I must admit too that I already feel the right course of action may be to forget it all, that in writing this account I am seeking the justification of others in what may be merely an outburst of anger. But how the events continue is very angering.

In response to my request, Neighbor T says that they were filming the houses because they found them interesting. Most mystifying is how Neighbor T then characterizes my desire not to be filmed: ""But for some reason you want your house not to be filmed"", is as close an approximation I can come to. Whether I incidentally  happen to be visible within my own home, the ostensible subject of her video, or this is modification on their part and they were deliberately filming me , doesn't need to be discussed further further.  There very existence of privacy laws in California regarding the filming of others makes it clear such a violation is at best discourteous. It's windy outside, I am trying to keep from becoming excited and stammering my words, I dispute their supposed bewilderment by taking issue with their phrasing of ""just some reason"", they think I am asking for their reason which they repeat this time including that they were also interested in the chairs standing in front of the house. At this point the confrontation starts dissipating as a resolution seems impossible. Neighbor T says they will delete the video and film the other houses again, with the exclusion of mine. Before doing so, they say they're actually is late for work and leave. I intend to remain cordial to Neighbor T, even outwardly friendly, but believe that however I reacted, I didn't make it too uncomfortable for them recognize a mistake, and to their neglect to do so is a sign of dishonesty or lack of imagination that seems impossible not to privately (with exception of this post) judge them for. Is it wrong to do so?",26Aug2020,1

After a couple of days I had learned that she thought my best friend was cute. Knowing this I had become quite upset but even knowing she liked my best friend, my other friend and I helped him get with her by giving him courage to talk to her.(despite my growing interest in her) My best friend eventually followed her on instagram and they began chatting. They only talked a few times in person and stopped chatting around the end of September through text. (that i know of) Around November I learned that she thought I was cute. I was shocked and didn’t know how to feel because she also liked and talked to my best friend. I felt that if I were to talk to her I would break the “bro code” even though they never dated. I just brushed it off and never told anyone I liked her a lot. (he later told me he stopped going after her because she was an extrovert and he was an introvert) During November to March I noticed she stared a lot at me in class and smiled. I could tell she was interested but I never made a move. School was cancelled during march so I never did end up talking to her but she followed me on instagram. I followed her back and never dm’ed her and neither did she. Fast forward to august neither of us made a move but we both like each others photos whenever we post. My best friend doesn’t know I like her and neither does she (maybe she does). Anyways what would you do in this situation? Would it be weird if I dated a girl that liked my best friend?

137,"I have an office job at a tech company, and yesterday I signed an offer letter for a new tech company, spoke with my manager, and submitted a resignation letter to get things moving with HR. Next Friday is my last day.

We are a small team of 12 and I’ve worked at this company for 3 years. I have daily contact with every single co-worker and we are all quite close.

I wanted to tell my team because I respect them and don’t want to blindside them, and also want to have time to work on transfer of knowledge. I asked my manager if I could tell the team my news today at our daily team meeting, and he said no, and that management would be communicating the news.

Tonight he called me and said, “So, how do you want to tell the others about this?” Again, I asked if I could just tell them myself, and he said no, so I said I guessed whatever he thought was best was fine, and to tell everyone I have enjoyed working with them and hope they stay in touch.

Is this typical? At my last two jobs, I was encouraged to openly discuss my leaving with co-workers. This feels strangely controlling and I don’t quite know where it’s coming from. My manager told me that our GM is planning on telling everyone at our team meeting a week from today, and then having a going away virtual happy hour on Friday (3 days later). This all seems impersonal and like it is setting everyone up to be surprised in a bad way and not have enough time for me to train other co-workers.

140,"this is the first time im positing on reddit. I never really had a good relationship with my mother as we tend to clash on a lot of topics throughout my life. (Eg, she can be hella homophobic: eg when i asked her if she would rather me to be gay or be someones mistress, she would rather me be someones mistress) 
For context, I am 50-51kg at 168cm. 3-4 months ago i was at around 55kg.
During circuit breaker (something like lockdown) in march, i made a point to lose weight because my mother had been commenting about it ever since i was 17, telling me i look fat etc etc. So during the lockdown i had a lot of time to exercise after work etc which I did. But every single time i exercise she would pin point certain parts of my body i should work on, etc my arms, my legs, my butt. She cannot seem to keep commenting on how big my butt is or why my boobs are huge (i am asian so typically they expect you to be stick skinny with average boobs and no butt) i mostly dont think much of it but it really has taken a toll on my self esteem. I resorted to eating sweet potatoes for breakfast and drinking soya milk for dinner to lose the weight + exercising. A few months back when i hit 52kg i told her this is the maximum i should go for my height according to my BMI, anything lower than 52 would be underweight and i told her if i continued i would be at the risk of aneroxia. She said no i would not be. So i dropped another 2kgs. I even tried to drop to 49 so she would stop commenting on my body. She likes to say that i look meaty etc etc. She also likes to compare the fact that when she was my age, she was around in the 40s in her weight. Mind you, she is 161cm. I got so light headed and grumpy all the time due to the lack of food in my system. Eventually i managed to get a balance and i stay around 50-51kg, which is now. Last night, however, I reached home after an outing with my friends and the first comment she said that I looked bloated. I told her my period was coming. After that she said my arms look like it is gaining back the meaty-ness. I asked her what does she mean by that. She said she thinks i should take note of her comments. And somehow i got pissed off as she kept asking me if i thought my arms have gained weight. I said i didnt have a problem with it. She keeps saying she thinks i should take note. She however, doesnt like it when i point out that she isnt in the best shape, she is heavier than me. I tried pointing it out to let her have an idea that if she doesnt like someone to comment on her weight so much maybe she should stop commenting on my physical appearance. Even so, my friends keep telling me that im at a ok physical body build, she would say “who should you believe? Your mother who known you your entire life or your friends?” I broke my limit last night after she kept commenting on certain parts of my body and we started screaming and i kept saying shes ruining my self esteem (which she is) she kept saying i was too sensitive, ill admit my tone wasnt good because she kept telling me i was being rude so i tried to say sorry but she asked me to shut up and told me i was not sorry. I couldnt take it anymore and left for my friends house. She called me but i ignored it but i told my dad where i was going. She asked me if i wanted to break the mother daughter relationship, and at the end she asked me if i was happy for making such a big thing out of nothing.

141,"When I (f27) was 8, my parents got divorced. It wasn't a nasty divorced. My parents never said anything bad about each other, I was never put in the middle, I was put first and they were always on good terms with each other significant other. I had a very good childhood. I can say that I was very much a daddy's girl. Not to say that I didn't have a good relationship with my mom but it was just easier with my dad. In my rebellious teen years, I kinda blamed my mom for the divorce even though I didn't know what happened between the two of them. 

Last week, my dad invited me to dinner and he said he had somethings to discuss with me. My mom was also there. My dad started by saying that my mom is the love of his life but that he wronged my mom a lot. He said that when they were 25 and engaged, he had an affair that resulted in a pregnancy. Coming from a wealthy family with a generous trust fund, he paid the woman off. My mom didn't find out until years later, after I was born. My mom actually fought with him to do right by my sister. They divorce because of this. 

But there is more to the story. Apparently I've met my sister before. My sister is married to a lawyer that works at my dad's law firm. We met at parties with families. She apparently know who we are and had at one point confronted my dad. My dad says she doesn't want anything from us. But my dad recently had a health scare. He says that abandoning her and breaking our family are his biggest regret and he wants to make amends. He wants to build a relationship with her and us. I don't know how to feel about all this. My dad isn't who I thought he was. For some reason I'm more upset at my mom for letting me worship my dad when she knew what he did. I went from being an only child to being the youngest. I just feel like my whole world is flip upside down and I don't know what to do.",26Aug2020,1

I love my girlfriend but she never cleans herself. maybe once a month. she brushes her teeth every day, twice a day, but doesn’t shower. To my knowledge she doesn’t have body dismorphia or anything mentally making her hate taking showers or getting naked. I’ve tried talking to her about it but as predicted i was the asshole boyfriend.

145,"So, to start off: This is a definitely a first-world problem, and I hate that I somehow have to deal with this. The problem is essentially this: I (17F, almost 18) keep getting gifts from my parents, whether it's money, clothes, electronics, etc. And whether it's for my birthday, christmas, or just at random, they seem to want to bend over backwards to get me whatever they think I want. My parents don't mind having a little luxury every now and then, and I can respect that, since they've earned it by working hard. On the other hand, I really hate having too many possessions, and try to live as minimally as I can - an old, but reliable phone that I fix myself if it ever breaks, just a few sets of clothes that I use and re-use for months or years at a time, and very few things I ever keep for sentimental value. My parents and I clash pretty often because of that fundamental difference, and it's hard to deny gifts because I'm labeled as ""ungrateful"" when I don't use a gift that's given to me, or if I just put it into storage or give it away - fairly often.

For the most part, we've learned to just live and let live with this, with me either just accepting gifts without an argument, or with my parents not getting me anything for a period of time - either one keeps the peace. For the few things I *do* need to talk to them about, though, it becomes a major argument every time. The most recent example would be medication: If I tell my parents I don't really want something they're ""offering"", their immediate argument is ""You don't want us for &lt;minor thing&gt;? Well then I guess you don't need us to pay for your medication. You can get a job yourself and pay for it"". They don't *actually* stop, and I've tried to call their bluff before, but it's enough to shift the conversation in a whole other direction for the time being. Or if I do approach them about wanting something (e.g. a laptop, since they complain I'm in my room all day - my computer, books, and therefore all my schoolwork and downtime is in there, I don't have much of a choice here), it becomes the argument of ""We've already paying for &lt;x&gt; and we've gotten all of these gifts in the past that you don't want. We're not going to get what *you* want just because you're ungrateful"". 

So reddit: How do I approach this conversation with my parents, preferably in a way that stop them from calling me ""ungrateful"" when they always go behind my back to buy things I appreciate, but don't need? And how do I approach them about things I genuinely could use, when they don't seem to actually care about what I do want?",26Aug2020,1

**Why am I a failure?**

Ever  since I graduated high school it feels like I haven't made any good  decisions. I was forced into college and only lasted a semester at a  community college until I dropped out because of my lack of interest and  being on academic probation.

So  the next big decision I've made was to go to a trade school for HVAC  (air conditioning) to be a tech specialized in that. I ended up  graduation that in 9 months, but, so did everyone else if they just  showed up, finally started to feel like I've made the right decision.

Fast  forward a couple of month of job searching (forgot to mention I've been  working at the same grocery store for 4 years) I finally got hired to  an HVAC company, I lasted only 2 months until I quit/was forced to quit  because of my poor performance. I really tried my hardest when I was  there, I just wasn't good enough.

Fast  forward to now, I'm still working at the same grocery store, just  recently bought a gaming computer to stream and make YouTube but I don't  even know where to begin on that, I have no interests and no passion to  go back to school. OH, icing on the cake, I used up 100% of my prepaid  for college on this trade school, and have nothing to show for it.

I constantly fuck up and I have done nothing right in my life, I feel like a total waste of space.

My  anxiety has gotten worse and my therapists response is to give me more  pills, I barely even find the energy to go to work anymore and I have no  energy to do anything except play video games and lay in bed, I haven't  cleaned my apartment in months, I eat less, my gf has gone back to  college and I'm afraid she will find someone better.

&gt;!A year and a bit ago, I was raped by someone i met a couple of times. I didn't report it at the time, but did tell a lot of friends and family. He knows that I told people as he is now banned from a particular place because of it.

 At the time, he lived about an hour away, but through a weird confluence of events I found out that he moved within about 20 mins of my house and literally a couple of houses away from a really good friend's house (the friend's house is essentially my second home when there isn't a pandemic). It's also just a neighborhood where i am a lot, at various restaurants/stores/venues. I also get around by public transit.

I'm not concerned about running into him socially, more just on the street or in a restaurant or something. I live in a very interconnected area, if that makes sense, where people often nip around towns and cities in the general metro area, so i could really run into him anywhere...

 I don't really know what he would do if he saw me, though violence is definitely possible. Does anyone have any advice? All that myself and my friends can really think of right now is to try not to be alone when I'm in that area.!&lt;",26Aug2020,1

Last week, my school announced that the fall semester will be entirely online, meaning that there’s no point of moving in if classes aren’t in person. I don’t see things getting better anytime soon and I fear that the whole year will be online classes. My sister lives in Philadelphia so I will be staying with her until further notice. Originally, I would’ve been living with 5 other girls which made myself and my parents uncomfortable. My parents are also immunocompromised and I wouldn’t want to risk giving them the virus if I visited them for holiday.

Other than my roommates friends I’ve only been in somewhat regular contact with a couple girls who live next door (though they definitely don’t seem like the type of people I’d get along with if I spend much time around them), some girl who lives on the same floor of my dorm, and this girl I met yesterday.

152," Let me preface this with Im in high school so sorry if somethings are a little weird and I am on mobile. Also kinda long background tldr at the end

 My school is a 6-12 one and I've been here since 6th grade. I met B in 6th grade and I'll admit i was the definition of a nice girl and out there. I know it isn't the best excuse but this was during my parents break up, immediate hook up with new people and some other more personal things I can't go into detail about.

 New school, all my friends were at other schools or different schedules to say the least I was a wreck. I become 'friends' with B as he was in most of my classes. I obviously developed a crush on him as he was a definitive positive in my life and in my opinion very attractive. 

 Throughout middle I had him in some of my classes and let's just say i was definitely clingy, cringy and slightly stalkerish. Nothing like follow him home or stalk his social media but i would crowd snoop. I would talk to him and i even tried to use HOROSCOPES to justify our maybe relationship.

 I ditched my cringe train of thought and ""quirky"" personality for something I believe to be better. 9th grade rolls around I dated two people then I'm done and haven't dated since. Personally I don't think I'm emotionally or mentally ready for a healthy relationship. 11th rolls around and B is in one of my classes. I think cool, it'll be nice to see him and see how he's been. It'll be cool to see how we've grown as people. 

NOPE. 

 Let me say it sucks to think you've made progress on yourself only to be reminded and sucked back to your old train of thought. I feel like i can't help it. I know i don't love him but i can't deny my attraction and want to fall in love with him. On one hand part of me fantasies that if these feelings have remained after all these years it must be true!  On the other hand I feel disgusted at myself and think I'm almost fetishising this poor guy.

  I distanced myself from him and he switched out of the class. I like to believe it was me and i wish it was because that might help me stomp out any hope but it was for his grades. I feel into some old habits and crowd snooped on him. Seeing how he was and what he was up to. Found out he started dating someone and when i was angry and jealous instead of happy he finally found someone who makes him happy i completely stopped any and all forms of contact/info.

 Well here we are 12th grade in all it's covid glory and he's in almost every goddamn i have save 3. Sidenote i am doing online which will help cut down interaction with him greatly if not completely. I already found myself trying to see if we have classes and I'm thinking of him. I was wondering if he broke up with his girlfriend and I'm really wondering if I've gone full psycho obsessive. I hate that I'm already falling back into old habits with him yet again!

 I also feel bad that poor B has some crazy chick basically fetishising him even after all these years. I've tried thinking about all his negatives but then think if all the wonderful things i could learn getting to know him that would make up for them. I went years without seeing/talking to him but the second i interact im back at square one. 

How do I end this cycle? Do i just hold out for the end of the year as that's when I will finally be able to leave it all behind? Is this something that i might develop with others? I'm really pissed at myself and need help.

TLDR: can't stop being a cringy obsessive freak towards a guy I've known for close to 6 going on 7 years.",26Aug2020,1

154,"Our sister is a meth addict who has been to rehab two times. She is 30 years old and is very pretty. We think she has relapsed again because she has lost weight quickly, no longer answers her phone to family, and lies about her whereabouts. It seems like she needs money because she's been posting her things online for sale. She does not have a ""real"" job - she does some hustling which we dont know much about to get money (my suspicion is sex work). Recently she went to the hospital and refused to allow the doctor to tell us anything. She got released from the hospital and told us she had a seizure and that she walked home. We dont believe a doctor would allow her to walk home after a seizure- it seems like a liability.

She is living rent free with a man 2 decades older than her. They have some kind of arrangement that is sexual in nature in exchange for food and a place to live. Because of their relationship, we think his judgement is clouded and he doesn't know what she is doing (or can't stop her). He has a rule that she can't have boys over but she does it anyway. He recently confronted her after neighbors saw her with a boy going into the house and she yelled at him, denied it, and would not have a conversation about it.

We've had a hard time getting her to go to rehab in the past - it took really dangerous situations where she really could have hurt herself for her to agree to go (and even then, she went begrudingly). Its hard to watch an impending train wreck, but she's an adult and we can't force her to do anything. We really fear every time this happens (hospitalizations or catching her in really precarious situations, once with a TON of drugs in the car) that it will be too late and we will have lost her forever (sometimes it feels like we have already) What can we do?",26Aug2020,1
155,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. I don’t go to therapy and truthfully just need people to vent to/advice on how the fuck to get over this. It’s hard talking to my family and also just really weird to me.. 


Anyways, my dad was my best friend truthfully but he’s done some weird things over the years that honestly has always made me feel uncomfortable around him, but I never fully thought about it until now. 

When I was younger I remember wanting to climb into his bed to just sleep next to him one night (he was the only parent present at that time and sometimes I just wanted someone to sleep next to, my mom slept with me for YEARS until she left so I think it had most to do with that), he usually slept naked which I didn’t know at the time because this was the first time I ever tried to climb into his bed, and I remember him taking his hand and putting it on a very inappropriate place. I’m not sure what his intentions were at the time and I’m pretty sure I just walked away and slept in my own room. I’m just now starting to REALLY think about how fucking disgusting it was.. I also would not have continued to want to sleep next to him if he was naked but either way I feel like my dad shouldn’t be making me touch him when all I wanted to do was sleep in his bed next to my parent.. :/ 

Another time he’s done some creepy shit was he messaged my best friend when we were younger, like YOUNG. and asked for pictures of her naked.. and pretty sure said something along the lines of wanting to “have fun”. My best friend was kinda “slutty” back in the day but she would NEVER in her life do anything with him, she actually showed me the messages and I just can’t believe I didn’t say anything sooner.. I just feel so bad for her because I know that she loved my dad like he was hers and he was just trying to take advantage of her at that point.. I’m sure it made everything so much awkward for her. We’ve never talked about it again but I’ve always thought about it.. 

I remember bringing this up to my mom the first time and she said that things were going around in my family way back in the day about either my dad or his brother doing some weird shit involving a little boy .. she didn’t go into details but I can kinda assume what went on. My grandpa also never believed it was my dad and never thought he would do such a thing .. 

The second time she brought it up she told my sister and my sister cut off ties with him. I felt so bad for him and he knew why my sister stopped talking to him but he would deny it. I stayed in touch with him but lost contact over the year and he eventually passed at the start of this year. He mentioned suicide at one point and I can never get over it. 

I wish that he was man enough to admit the things he’s done. I always shoved it to the back of my mind but it’s just bothering me so much lately and I just wanna put his urn and picture in a box and forget about him. He was my best friend for my whole life though and it kills me to even think he would do something like this. I defended him in my mind for so long and i’ll never understand why he would do those little things and make me feel uncomfortable so much, to the point where I thought it was totally fine. 

He would also do things like not knock on my door before entering which doesn’t say a whole lot but he’s caught me having sex and changing multiple times. I never thought anything of it and I was broke as hell back then so never thought of getting a lock.. and adding my young ass friends on facebook when they were like 13-14 at the time. I feel embarrassed knowing he might have been weird towards them because I always felt like that might’ve been the case. 

TLDR; my dad asked my friend for naked pictures when we were younger and he made me touch him in a very inappropriate place when all I wanted was to sleep next to him. He made me feel uncomfortable a lot but he was also my best friend and supported me and was a really good parent to me.",26Aug2020,1

157,"Okay, so I've been selected as an intern (campus ambassador) for a specific NGO(it is very famous, IMUN - just for.the context). One of the many main task of this specific NGO is to promote registration of potential candidates for their online conference. Before this, need to clarify that I was a Mumbaikar for most of my life.

I am a recluse. Don't have any friends in universities, obviously because of bad household. Won't go more into that, but here is it - I have to promote a conference, that happens every week on Saturday as well as Sunday, and I haven't received a single referral. I have also made attempts to DM my classmates privately, and explained each and every details about it. Right now, I am probably sure, I look like an idiot, because a quiet kid is trying to be vocal...

I need atleast 3 referral to get an internship certificate, or I will end up with a flimsy, basic certificate of participation, with no earnings. I am using all the possible social media to promote, be it Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin, Snapchat and I am so desperate now that I am being forced to use Discord and Reddit.

I seriously don't know what to do. I even submitted a properly informed WhatsApp message to my CR, and requested him to share with the other CR, I even submitted a mail to my HODs, Training/Placement officer as well as the Principal.

I just don't know what I am doing wrong. The area that I am currently in, is a very shitty and boring place to live in. Back then, in Mumbai, people were so enthusiastic, and participated in every activities. But this town, this place, is the epitome of boring-ness. Gossip talks, Kumkum Bhagya, and all other South Indian soap opera bullshit (I am a Tuluva myself, only that I am alien to my own culture and language - both Tulu and Kannada, I cannot speak either of them). No tech enthusiast, no interest in diplomatic talks, nothing.

168,"Hey Reddit! I need some help with something that's been whirling in my mind, if you'd lend me your thoughts.  I've got a B.A. in Music Education with 4 years of prior teaching experience and a year out of the field due to severe burnout.  The school I came from was really underfunded and had a toxic professional/parental environment on TOP of the responsibility of teaching 8 middle school classes ranging from 5th-8th grade that lasted 37 minutes each (to the music teachers out there- yes, it WAS a shitshow).  Not to mention I was getting ready to get married/move cross-country and having a quarter-life crisis so THAT'S fun.  Anyway, I digress.  

Lately I've been playing with this idea that maybe my time as a teacher isn't done yet; because I loved working with kids, and I felt confident in the teaching side of my ability (while not so much with the  musician side of my ability).  I also realized my style of teaching is more 1-on-1 rather than whole class, which with middle school band and choir is about 95% of it.  I can't confirm, but I felt like with art, while there is full-class instruction (which I'm totally comfortable with), there's also more room to give kids individual attention to help their personal growth as an artist.  Also, I already know I want to continue teaching middle school if I were to commit to this endeavor. 


---


TL;DR-  B.A. in Music Ed is considering returning to college for a B.A. in Art Education instead.  I've been doing research online, but have a few unanswered questions:

1. Are there typically any prerequisites like some kind of portfolio?  If so, what stuff needs to go in it and how diverse should it be for best consideration? (I ask because I have no experience in digital art and  my sculptures from high school art got destroyed in various moves).

2.  Have any of you returned to college for education-type stuff?  What paths did you take (i.e.: did you just go straight for a 4-year degree or did you do community college courses first then transfer?)

3.  Any perspectives on what the art education field is like and if I'm having rose-colored vision on what it might be like?  I don't think the field is any easier than music- I simply think it may be a better fit for my teaching style and personality, but I'd love your opinions.

Thanks in advance! ♥️♥️",26Aug2020,1
170,"So to make this somewhat short: I have come across photos of me posted on here and across other forums without my consent. These are photos that have long been deleted from my social media and it makes me thoroughly uncomfortable to have these images pop up when you type in my former username (I have changed it since discovering these images). 


These images are not explicitly pornographic, nor am I minor in them, so I’m afraid they won’t see it fit to remove them. Does these pics of me still count as my “intellectual property”? I have tried to reach out to the mods of these subs and the users themselves that posted these pics but I have received no response. I’m trying to make a report to Reddit atm but I am hesitant to give out my personal information which will also be sent to the person who posted these images. I fear blackmail, doxxing, etc. I want to avoid getting a legal representative, mostly due to the fact that I simply can’t afford it. 

Any advice on how to handle this? Thank you!",26Aug2020,1

172,"This is my first reddit post and probably just a throwaway account but i wanted to get more opinions on this matter because i sometimes get bad episodes from thinking about this. 

Im a 15 y/o SEA chinese male, born into a traditional and conservative family with slight helicopter parents. I was 13 when I met my ex, lets call her Sandra. Sandra was a very emotional person, she had a lot of breakdowns and was VERY clingy. She blamed most of this on her ""abusive parents"". Whether this was the case I've never really found out, but as far as I could investigate, she just seemed to not appreciate the things that were given to her and was somewhat attention seeking. (e.g crying because a close friend cut her shoelace, Sandra's mother bringing her on a trip Sandra asked for and her getting angry and saying she never wanted to ago, crying because ""people glared and scoffed at her during an exam for coughing"" (i asked around and nobody actually seemed to care about the incident).  etc.) 

So anyways, that's Sandra, and as for me, I'm just an average introvert who doesn't know how to hold a conversation. I'm mostly just a soundboard to support my friends. As 13 year olds do i naively dived into a relationship with her because of low self esteem and wanting attention from a female. It was nice for the first 2 months, but after that my rose-tinted glasses started to slip a bit and i kept catching glimpses of a bad choice, but i refused to acknowledge them. It was also around this time that i introduced Sandra to my older brother (lets call him Jack) as a friend of mine. I trusted Jack because yknow, he was my older bro and Jack was older, she was 13.  

5 months into our relationship, Jack and Sandra seemed like good friends and I was really happy, but it was around this time that Jack suddenly started to have ""depression episodes"", he wouldn't show it, but he would post on social media and rant to some of his friends (i talk to some of his friends) about how his depression is ""killing him"". So, i tried to indirectly offer help but he would always deflect it and dodge me.

Come to 6 months, Jack passes me his phone to watch a video and i see him receive a suspicious message from Sandra but decide its harmless. 

This happens again multiple times over and i have proof that she is in fact cheating behind my back with Jack and confront her about it, she apologizes and says she'll leave him. I naively believe her. 

9 months in, I kept on the lookout and found evidence, but just labeled myself as paranoid, all because i wanted to believe in her. Then same scenario occurs and i find out she's been sexting him. 

I became furious and heartbroken. I cry and tell my father to send me over to my grandparents place because I didn't want to see Jack's face. At this point, I have a short lapse in memory and I cant recall what happened, all I know is that during this time period i broke up with her.

It's been a year and I'm still trying to trust Jack but every time I see him showing his true colors in a scenario my memories kick up and I get an episode.

Can anyone give me advice on how to forgive him or what I should do to forget this?",26Aug2020,1

180,"I hate my life, and the only thing that is wrong with my life is that I am not getting laid. Seems like a small thing to normal people, but it is the only thing I care about. I have lost all interest in anything else because everything seems pointless if I'm not getting laid.

I feel like a failure of a man, a failure of a human. I hate the world for doing this to me. I see people who are assholes and people who are less accomplished than me getting laid, and I feel so incredibly jealous. I feel like the path in life I chose is the wrong one because I cannot accomplish what to me is the most important thing in the world.

I'm saving up for an escort. But after I finally lose it what then? I think for a while I will be content, but then I will need to wait another 3 months to save up enough for another experience. I think the only thing that can make me happy is a gf or a fwb.

And even if I learn to get laid like a warlord, I will have to spend my entire life dealing with the fact that I was a virgin until 20. The shame is too much for me to want to live. I look at 15 year-olds who have had their first kiss, and I cannot talk to them because at such a young age they are more accomplished than I am.

181,"Lately I feel like it's really hard for me to talk to my parents. To make it short, I go numb whenever my parents insults me. They usually don't use direct insults but would imply. They would compare me to Trump and imply I'm just fat-bum who eats whatever I want. It's to the point where I question my sanity. I remember once my dad and I got into an argument about my opinion on something and he called me a liar and compared me to Trump and a guy who embezzled my dad all because he thought my opinion was wrong. I just don't see how an opinion can be a lie. My mom truly believes I'm manipulative and it's for simple stuff like if I say ""my phone is laggy and not working"" she would say stuff like ""you don't have to try to manipulate me I know you just want a new phone"" even if it's not the case. It's led me to fear that everyone just assumes that all my opinion are lies and my actions have ulterior motives. I realize my parents are just humans but they say a lot of hurtful things. I have normalized it but recently when my sister's bf came over and my dad said something that I wouldn't deem super hurtful hurt my sister's bf I realized how bad and rude the comment was. When they use insults like ""retarded"" ""liar"" ""manipulative"" or ""thinks about the stunt you pulled"" when referring to my mental health I just check out but they do hurt my feelings.

185,"*for context*
I live in a mental health facility. It’s a semi-supported complex that has 10 flats in it and, so far, 6 of those flats have clients in (including myself). Everybody here has a mental illness, learning disability and/or brain injury. 


So, our home is smack bang in the middle of the town centre. The front office is in the street where all of the shops and bus stops are, but our flats are located down an alleyway next to the front office door. There’s a small corner shop just down the road not even a minute away, so all of us go there to get whatever we need. Sometimes one of us might feel like we need staff support, so they’ll escort us to and from the shop. All of that is fine.

There’s a guy that works in this shop, and he’s pretty obnoxious. He talks about some pretty inappropriate stuff, and seems to make a lot of people uncomfortable. I don’t usually mind - it’s not difficult to just ignore it and move on with your day. He asked me a few questions a little while back that I thought were odd (things like “are you depressed?”, “are you having a shit time?”, etc), but I just shrugged them off, said “I’m alright”, paid for my stuff, and went home.
Well, yesterday, somebody came down the alleyway to where the flats are. The member of staff that was in and I were sat in the smoking area, so she asked him what he was doing down here seeming as it’s private property. The guy said that he thinks that he has mental health issues, and was wondering if she could help him. She said that she couldn’t give him much advice other than to get in touch with a MH support team or an on call social worker. He then went on to say “well, isn’t this place for all the waifs and strays that were on the streets? Like a homeless shelter? And isn’t is for REALLY crazy people that have schizophrenia and psychosis?”. The member of staff said “no, this is not a place for waifs and strays that were on the streets. And everybody here is stable enough to be out and about in the community. Where did you hear that from?”. The guy said “that guy that works in the shop down the road from here.”. She asked him if he looked like a short description of the obnoxious guy, and he nodded. She spoke to him a little bit more and sent him on his way. We were both pretty pissed about what this guy had said (well, I was anyway. She just looked pissed about it lmao), so I expressed to her how I felt about it, and she said that she understands and agrees with my views on it, and she wants to talk to his manager as this is way out of line. 

See, from what the guy was saying, he didn’t even mention anything about his mental health to the store guy. He didn’t ask him for help or advice. The store guy just said it as “banter”. THAT is the main problem. This obnoxious jerk is degrading us to being some random homeless people that are all really “fucked up” and “nasty”. He’s spreading rumours around about us and our home. If this actually was a homeless shelter for mentally unstable people, it wouldn’t be that big of a deal. But this is a place for people that have been in mental health hospitals for a long time and are ready to be introduced back into living a “normal” life again. We’ve all been through so much shit, and this is how we’re being viewed? As crazy people that should be avoided? It hurts. He doesn’t know anything about us or our lives. 

So, is it actually worth speaking to his manager about? I don’t want to potentially mess up this guys work life, but I also feel like he shouldn’t be working in a shop if he’s going to spread damaging rumours around about customers. I don’t know what to do.

186,"My [M 23] brother’s girlfriend [Kathy, F 25] has a close friend [Sam, F, 25 I believe]. Sam likes the horror genre like I do. It’s really clear on her social media, which Kathy tags a lot in her Instagram story. I asked Kathy a while back if she could introduce me. Kathy said “omg this is so cute I’ll let you know”. Long story short, she never did let me know. Before you say anything, yes, I CAN take a hint. Silence probably means “not interested”. Probably. 

Fast forward a few months, and Kathy shares a photo of Sam on her Instagram story that’s all spooky-lit. I’m intrigued. Kathy says on her story, “Follow Sam for more spooky content”. 

I wish we could live in a world where dating wasn’t so compatible (debatably) with social media. Here’s what I’m wondering though: Could I reasonably take Kathy’s invitation and follow Sam on Instagram, despite Kathy not responding to me, and go from there?

I am 28 years old. My father is 52 years old. I have been taking care of my dad on and off since I was 15.

He still uses but he manages well. I have 2 kids and a wife, we don't and never have done drugs but I understand addiction. 6 months ago he moved in his disabled sister who had a stroke last year. Her husband met a new woman and divorced her because of the disability. I took her on because I didn't know how much of a burden it was. She was always been a big help in my life before the stroke.

199,"Bear with me when I tell this story... I promise I'll try my best not to ramble :)

You know how the summer before college when you talk to people from facebook and try to find a roommate you think you'll get along with. Well I did that, found a really nice girl, drove to where she lived to meet up with her, and texted all summer until we moved in. Basically she's really nice one-on-one but the instant friends she made (she moved in a couple days before me) are just not nice people. They're the type of people that stand in front of you when the group is standing in a circle, or make new group chats without you to plan things. Among other things, but you get the point. So as much as that sucked, I'm moving on, accepting that my roommate's a nice one-on-one person (and that's it), and am just not hanging out with that group anymore. I honestly stopped talking to the other ""potential roommates"" I had been talking to once I found mine, bc I figured we were in this together and could both ""venture"" for friends together. Yeah, that didn't happen. That being said, I'm trying to find friends on my own. The thing is... how?? I know there's other people who don't have friends but like...where are they?? Everyone I see walking outside or eating is in a group of 4+ people that look so comfortable with each other. I desperately went back to my dms and messaged a few girls I had stopped talking to over summer and have been meeting up with a few for coffee or lunch, but it usually ends with them saying they have to go because they're doing something with their roommate or they have to meet up with other friends. Why does everyone already have friends? It's only been like 5 days!! I see tik toks about people saying they're lonely in college and that freshman fall kinds sucks which is definitely comforting, but why is everyone I see walking in big groups or already have close friends? 

And don't get me wrong, I'm not one of those people that stays in their dorm all day. I've been proactive about saying hi to everyone in the elevator, asking them their name, major and where they're from and adding a bunch of people on snapchat. I sit in the lounge area of my residence hall incase other people come in and I introduce myself. I really don't know what more I can do and why I'm just so unlucky. 

And don't get me started on corona. I've always heard the key to early friendships is through orientation and through student groups. We didn't have an orientation! I have not endured a single cringey ice breaker. And there's BARELY any student groups because they all pretty much have to be on zoom and we all know you can't befriend people over zoom. It's just an awkward space. But yes, I've already joined a couple clubs (even kinda random ones) that will hopefully meet in person.

To top it off, it's hard telling myself ""oh everyone's college transition is tricky"", ""it'll come don't worry"", and ""people aren't as happy and close to their friends as they seem"", when my 3 closest friends from home are all having amazing college transitions. They've all met people and are having a blast. Even with corona.

So, any advice? I don't know what more I can do other than what I've been doing and it honestly sucks. Not to sound superior or anything, but I had a really good group of friends in high school. We were nice to people, people liked us, and we were all super close. I also had a bunch of close friends from different groups. I say that to explain that I'm a very sociable person. I like interaction. I love telling people random things that happen to me, and asking people about themselves. I consider myself to be pretty funny and outgoing, and sure I love time to myself to have a nice hour-long scroll through tik tok, but I want friends. I don't know what I can do differently or who I can reach out to for help. My family and friends all say the same thing: ""it'll come with time, keep doing what you're doing, don't force it, it'll happen, just give it time."" That advice just isn't helpful anymore. I don't expect them to know what to do, and it's honestly just comforting to hear their voices. I've (obviously) been pretty upset these past few days since moving in, and I just really want friends. As sad and lame as that sounds. It's just a real sucky feeling. Any advice?",26Aug2020,1

201,"Just to make a quick background. I am in the process of studying for my second LSAT (law school admissions test) which is in October. I also apply for school this November. With that being said I graduated undergrad last December and have been working and studying since. 

Last Wednesday after a few rounds of interviews I was offered a job at a law firm. I’ve never had any type of legal work experience until this. The thing is it’s 70 miles there so 140 miles round trip and roughly an hour and 10 minutes there and the same amount of time back. I normally don’t get back until 7 at night. 

It’s only been a week but I’ve recognized that this drive is way more intense to be doing and I’ve realized commuting has already led me to a huge decline in studying. I really enjoy and am thankful for the opportunity to get experience at a law firm but I also hate that I’m not able to focus on my actual goals ( getting into law school).

I’ve been thinking already about leaving the job due to the commute and how much time it’s costing me but I’m also upset because I know it’s a great work experience for me. I’ve asked a few people but hoping someone here can provide me some more advice on what should I do? Stay at the job which I’ll be working Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and saturday and lose most of my study time and having to drive 140 miles per day OR stay at my previous job which was much more flexible, 7 minutes down the road and I was able to study for three hours daily as I’ve been doing?

My boyfriend has been living with me for over a year, and we are serious and are in pre-marital counseling. We need to talk about finances and I was hoping to get some opinions on how to handle this before we discuss it in counseling.

I have a house which I bought a few years before meeting the boyfriend. We will call him D. We both earn a good salary in a high COL area as federal employees. We currently make similar salaries (he makes about 93% of what I do but I have to contribute an extra 3% to my pension for the same benefit so it is not much different). Previously, he was living about 30-60 minutes further from his job, so moving in with me saves him hours a week on a commute and made it easier for us to see each other. He has been studying for exams addition to his full time job for most of the past year (and Covid delayed his last exam by 8 months so far), and I have been very supportive of his studies and worked around the limited time we have together. I’m happy to do so, but I point this out because it is one-sided.

He currently pays about 1/3 of the mortgage/HOA total (the house could rent for a similar amount of the mortgage/HOA total) and nothing towards utilities or upkeep. We split the groceries (I am a tiny girl and don’t require much food), and he wants to split all costs of going out, travel, etc. The house was fully furnished when he moved in, and he just brought a bedroom set. I cleared out a room for him, and we each have our own office/guest room. He does not want to contribute to any furniture or household items like kitchen supplies, etc.

He keeps saying that things would change like a light switch when we got married, but I have a hard time believing that. I need to know that he cares more about being an equitable partner than just scoring a deal before I can agree to marriage. As background, I have always been independent and supported myself. I have no debt other than the mortgage and have string retirement savings. I grew up poor and have no interest in returning to that life, and I’ve worked to have a nice life for myself.

I love this man, but I am tired of feeling like I’m being taken advantage of. Our relationship has become a lot more serious in the time he has lived with me, but it feels like he only wants to contribute less (e.g. not take me out to dinner like he did earlier on) over time rather than be more equitable. I think he saves about 3/4 of what he earns. The “rent” he pays me every month just goes to savings, so it is not like I need his money in order to afford my life. I just want a partner.

TLDR; My boyfriend lives with me in the house that I own but things don’t feel equal. How can I approach this to offer some better solutions than just feeling bad?",26Aug2020,1

I’ve built a functional (and admittedly pretty ugly) prototype and I’ve been testing with my family. The pandemic made this a lot harder, since families will usually sugarcoat their gripes, and I can’t ask strangers with a fresh POV what they think. However, my testing has been going well. 

My question starts here. What’s next? How should I continue? I’ve read some online resources, but they’ve been a little confusing. How should I set up my kickstarter for manufacturing costs? How should I go about distributing? The creation aspect has been very fun, but the behind the scenes of creating a game has been somewhat overwhelming and I’m hoping for really any advice.",26Aug2020,1
206,"I landed my “dream job” about a year and a half ago. It was a very competitive position that I truly never felt worthy of. 

I’ve recently been cleared to work independently, and it just seems like nothing is turning out well. I have had hiccups on every single duty assigned to me, and it feels like I can’t ever get anything perfect/right (a big deal to me, but no big deal to my colleagues/supervisor). 

My job is in law enforcement (non-sworn), and I didn’t realize how taxing it would be on me emotionally.  My colleagues don’t seem to be phased by the cases we get, but they’re all incredibly sad/difficult. It’s frustrating when my colleagues don’t seem to have the same level of empathy that I do, which makes it hard to find someone to talk to who would understand. Almost every case I’ve worked, I can’t help but think about the victims and their families and what they’re going through. I find myself crying at my desk sometimes as I’m completing files/reviewing case information because of the events of a particular case. My job is supposed to offer “free therapy” for the work I do, but when I tried to reach out, I found out they only covered three sessions and it was incredibly difficult to secure an appointment (and to be honest, I’m worried it’s not entirely confidential). 

I’m new and I’m slow compared to my colleagues. I’m about 10-20 years younger than my colleagues, and they’re all years ahead of me in experience that makes me feel inadequate/stupid/useless. My turnaround time is drastically lower than my colleagues, and I feel like things don’t come as easily to me. I also fixate on minor details which make it very difficult for me to focus. 

There’s so much violence and trauma.  I’m constantly stressed with “what if’s”. What if I mess up? What if I can’t bring a family justice? What if I forget something and I screw up a case? 

I’ve only been at this for a year and a half. I keep telling myself it will get better, but it’s only gotten worse. I love the subject matter of my work and I can’t imagine myself doing anything else, but at the same time, I don’t know how much longer I can keep at this. I had a breakdown in college that almost pushed me to end my life, and I’m scared that may happen again. I’ve lost interest in things that I used to love. I just go to work and come home to sleep. I’m sad and alone.

213,"I am a 20 male I bought this safe few years back, I just save cash there when I do gigs or work with my father he pays me. 

If they ever ask me for money idc they can take it but ASK ME I don’t like people taking stuff without asking. 

I had $2,300 cash in it probably 4 months ago, couple weeks past and I add a hundred bucks and I see that I’m down to $2,100. Sometimes I take money out of my safe if I’m going out I didn’t think much of it. 

Last week I counted it again and I was at $1,700 I was so confused cause I don’t really go out like that or spend money on unnecessary items. 

My mom doesn’t like when I bring up money even tho I let her borrow $1,500 couple months ago, and whenever she needs I just give it to her. Her parents are selfish and she always compares me to them. Even tho my grandparents have everything they could ever want and don’t buy anyone anything or even treat themselves, I’m 20 young and with inflation over the years I want to save money, invest, and just go up. 

So I asked both my parents and my mom said she had to take $500 out but she’ll pay me back. I said okay but tell me next time. I was thinking of when I went from 2,300 to 2,100 so I asked my dad today aside from the $500 did they take $200 before that? My dad said he didn’t but he’ll ask my mom, he told me not to mention it to her since she gets mad if I ever mention money. 

I tell my father it’s hard to trust people sometimes when they do stuff behind your back. He got mad and said not to say that. I said it’s true if I would’ve never mentioned the money situation I would just have money being siphoned from me. I would’ve never known, again I don’t mind if they ask me hey can I borrow x amount of money and eventually they can pay me back. 

I have amazing parents I just don’t like this. I don’t pay for rent or anything like that. Just bought my car and the gear I use to freelance.

Called my suicide attempt a ""stunt""

Calls me ""retarded"" if I forget to do chores after a few times

When she's angry or something doesn't go her she huffs and puff and stomps her feet like a child upstairs and her faces gets red

Got mad that I didn't do anything productive this summer because I wanted to take a summer off before I go to college. ( I have worked hard throughout my 4 years of hs and got a bunch of scholarship while she almost flunked out of hs)

Called me manipulative for simple things such as if I complained about my phone acting up she would say that I'm just trying to manipulate her to get me a new phone

Purposely talk loud enough for me to hear her complain to her friend on the phone about how I placed last on my track meet (that was my first and last year of track because I was crushed by that)

Told me what to talk about to my therapist (my best friend at the time backstabbed me and that's all I could talk about because I was so hurt and she said she doesn't want to pay for me to talk about that)

Make up memories even if she wasn't even there

I say what’s up?  She says “nothing. I’ll go have a good night. “ I ask her what she means. She says “I dunno you don’t seem like you want to talk”. I ask “why not?” I literally don’t know what she means. She says “maybe you’re talking to someone else”. I ask her why she thinks that. She basically goes on and says the sometimes it seems like I could care less. Keep in mind most of my replies to her messages are paragraphs???? So I proceed for several minutes to try to get her to give me a screenshot of some replies in which are “careless” in her opinion. Then she says never mind. Several times. Is this manipulation?

221,"So, my family is extremely toxic. I'm not sure I can use the ""abusive"" because there are children and people who faced much worse and the background I come from, this type of treatment is considered pretty normal. But I do believe my mom is either bipolar or has some mental illness. She has been to therapists and they have always strongly advised her to continue therapy because she has many issues, but she hasn't. We butt heads A LOT. We can't go an hour without arguing. 

I have to admit, I absolutely push her buttons at times which cause pretty big arguments. But this comes from a place of frustration and feeling trapped. She starts arguments for nothing. I will be doing college work or getting ready for work and she'll find a way to call me a loser and saying I'm not doing enough with my life, and often compares me to other people. 

She says I can't make good decisions (she doesn't like my friends because they aren't conservative/don't have conservative views on marriage/sex, but I don't know how she even knows this considering she never has real conversations with them), and she often tracks me. Or she will say I have ruined my reputation because I was friends with this one girl who I knew in high school who turned out to be gay. This girl came out almost a year after I stopped talking to her so I don't know how that has to do with me. And she says I'm a disgrace to my culture for God knows whatever reasons. Et cetera et cetera. You're getting the point. She's emotionally ""abusive"" (I don't think I can call it abuse though). 

I want to move out, but I only have $2,5000 saved. I don't know where to go, but I absolutely know I want to get out of my state. I'm thinking somewhere on the East Coast? But how would I pay for college, because I'm on financial aid right now? Work isn't an issue. It's stable and I will be able to transfer no problem. 

I guess what I'm asking advice for is should I move out or stay until I graduate (1.5 more years) or should I save up until I hit around $4-5k and move out and never look back? Therapy doesn't work, my dad is emotionally absent since he is always working and also has very traditional views especially considering our ethnic background.

222,"So. Plans to travel during the pandemic are giving me quite a bit of anxiety. Sorry, this is going to be long!

Since my bff is currently working remotely bc of the virus, she wants to use the freedom remote work is granting her to travel and she’s asked me along for part of the trip. She’s looking to fly cross country and find a place to stay for two months.  I told her that I could come out for max two weeks bc of family/pets but that I’d love to go, if she was okay with taking full precautions for the virus.

Tangentially related: Since the pandemic started I’ve been staying in as much as humanly possible. I have preexisting conditions (lung scarring due to repeat pneumonia) and am generally a sickly person. Bestie has not gotten sick since we were very small and has an awesome immune system. I didn’t want to cramp her travel plans if my COVID regiment is more than she was expecting (masks when in public, not eating at restaurants, etc.) She said that she was already planning on taking every precaution and that she just wanted to have me along so we could spend time together (love her to death). 

We chatted for a bit and settled on CO for a month and NM for another month, with me joining her for the first two weeks in CO. We’re both huge hikers and wanted to find a place where we could stay away from other people and hike. I should mention that she was originally planning to spend the entire trip in NM and added the CO stop after I spent a while rhapsodizing about Estes (she’s never been). She makes quite a bit more than I do (esp with my side gigs shut down at the moment) but generally spends as little as possible so we’re at around the same budget for travel.

We booked a private room in CO for a month. After booking, BFF was just talking with the host and was informed we’d be sharing a bathroom with one couple for the first week in out, and then another couple the second week (both booked a few days after us)..and I don’t know what to do. :( Bff has been handling looking for places since she’s staying there for the full month so I haven’t looked too too closely.  I should have read the listing more thoroughly and managed to miss the potentially shared bathroom sitch. 


Month-long stays are non-refundable, so we can’t change any plans. I was already fairly anxious about being around other people for the flight out/back and am now more anxious. My day job is related to COVID-19, and I see a lot of (bad) statistics on the reg.

I don’t know. Do I go through with it? We have a private area (two rooms) within the house we’re staying in, we’re just sharing a bathroom with four other people during the stay...we know the virus travels best in small, non-ventilated spaces. On the other hand, if none of the other travelers have been exposed it’s obviously not a problem. Am I being paranoid?

If I don’t go, should I pay BFF half the rent for the month? She‘a not big on spending money in any case and most of the reason she’s stopping in CO at all is because I suggested it. She initially said no when I brought it up, but should I push it? What is the etiquette here?

Sorry for the word vomit. I’m having some anxiety here, as you can probably tell lol. Advice appreciated.",26Aug2020,1

We've hung out at our own places but tonight was the first night we went out to do stuff. I'm completely okay with us being friends no matter what, but I was also considering asking her out at one point. Her having a bf was always ambiguous as she never talked about it/him and no one else did (she does have an online personality, so I'd understand why). We were talking to each other about some very personal stuff after watching a movie and I decided to ask if she's in a relationship with ___, with the reasons above but also because I wouldn't want to let it slip if she was keeping it a secret. She told me that he has been harassed in the past when people found it and I get it.

So I left it there, but a few minutes later, she kinda went silent and then asked ""why are you my friend?"" a bit nervously. She is a bit self-conscious, so I didn't really see it as anything. I told her why and then I asked her why she's friends with me. She said that while I have things in common with her other friends, she's most comfortable talking to me, despite knowing me for a smaller amount of time.

So I left it there, everything else went good, and we're making plans to hang out again as I type this. But I have to ask...did she ask that question because she thought the whole point of hanging out was to ask her out? Or something else? She seems totally fine right now, but I hope I didn't make her uncomfortable.",26Aug2020,1
232,"Back story: my husband and his sister are about 5 years apart. He moved about 4 hours away which is where we currently live and she lives 10 mins away from them. They were treated VERY different growing up. He didn’t get name brand clothes, had to work to buy his first computer, didn’t get a cell phone until much later and on and on. She on the other hand got EVERYTHING she and NICE things. The first time I met his dad told me she thought the sun revolved around her, and of course, it was their doing. 

Fast forward to my husband and his sister becoming adult. These are some examples of a vast differences of treatment. 

When my husband and I bought our house and moved in, they were upset we weren’t married (we were 23 and I had a two year old that he was raising as his own) and they kicked him off of their car insurance. Fair enough I thought. 

The sister and her boyfriend buy a house and THEY PAY THEIR DOWN PAYMENT AND PAINT THEIR BEDROOM for them. 

I could give several more examples of shit like this. They will buy her something and verbatim say to him, “well we did this for your sister so we bought you: a car, a Mac book, a phone.... the list goes on and on. This is my burning rage issue. They never do anything because they want to do something for him. It’s always a retribution gift.

Consequently my husband was bullied and had low self esteem. She was a popular cool girl. Now I’m not blaming every bit of that on his parents but when you go to a semi rich school and you are wearing Kmart shoes but your sister gets clothes from the mall because, “girls are different”, they definitely bare some responsibility. 

The most recent issue that has me so freaking mad is she just went through a divorce. It was sudden and pretty traumatic to her and the family. He had a mental breakdown two years ago after a suicide attempt and was hospitalized for two weeks. Obviously that was also traumatic for the family. He had a lot of issues from his past that he never dealt with on top of drug interactions and binge drinking which made him crazy. 

When he got out of the hospital they were involved by calling, sending a sweet magnet for the fridge, stuff like that. His sister goes through her divorce and I kid you not they have dropped at least 10k and maybe up to 30k redoing her entire house (new counter tops ,cabinets, back splash, sod, on and on). They also fund her shopping sprees. When he got out of the hospital we had several thousand dollars in hospital bills. they never offered to help. And you know what, if they had we would have appreciated the gesture but declined. But It would have been nice to see them offer to help him even a tenth of what they do for her. 

I called them out on it several years ago which made things weird for awhile and they owned up to some things but it’s never changed. It’s been more on their radar even though they claim they treat them equally. So my fil texts my husband saying he is going to give him his corvette (which is his pride and joy) because he’s been spending so much money on the sisters house and doesn’t want him to think she is his favorite. So my husband ends up feeling guilty and apologizing and being like, “absolutely not”. That sent me over the edge. It was an attempt of transference of guilt. My husband doesn’t even care about that damn car, it wasn’t even anything he wanted. 

I wish I had the time to give more examples of this kind of bullshit. My mil has been texting me and I’m being short with her because I’m so tired of their bullshit. I blame them for his low self esteem and self worth and I’m tired in partaking in this charade like everything is fine. 

My husband has gone through years of therapy and has mostly moved on, he’ll roll his eyes but that’s about the gist of it. I’m the one that is eaten up about it. For so many years he was made to feel that his perception of how different they were treated was invalid. Through therapy he’s basically came to the point he had to let it go and accept things for what they are, or lose the relationship with his family. He put the work in to accept it. 

I just can’t help but keep score of all the slights they’ve done to him. I also can’t partake in the charade if acting like it isn’t what it is. And here’s the thing. My husband is not a materialistic person. We are semi well off frugal people trying to become debt. He doesn’t want all the “things” she gets. All he ever wanted was acknowledgment that she’s the favorite and that yes in fact, they always have and always will be treated different and everyone can move the fuck on. 

Any advice would be appreciated for me to accept things as he has. I don’t want to make things harder for him and it’s exhausting being so upset by this. 

Considering I’m frugal I wanted to be nice and not have her pay me back on something I get at a good price on (my moms a vet - seresto collars for their 3 dogs) and I see all of instagram that they dropped probably several hundred dollars on her shopping spree on outfits, Gibson guitars for her wall asDECORATION (she doesn’t play but my husband does) and ect., all while she’s going out everyday getting her Starbucks, eye lash extensions, going out to dinner with friends, her expensive gym membership, and on. Meanwhile over here we try to stick to keeping extra spending to a minimal because we are trying to pay off our house. It just feels like a slap in the face. 

Help me let this shit go please.",26Aug2020,1
233,"Recently I’ve been thinking about reaching out to those I don’t really talk to anymore. So the next person on my list is an old best friend. We met in college (2015) and stopped talking in 2017. 

What made us stop talking was this. She had graduated and was living one state away. She was planning to come visit me for a weekend. She brought along the guy she was seeing at the time and he was going to spend the weekend separately from us, with his own friends. 

I was so excited she was coming to visit! She ended up spending most of our first day together on her phone texting the guy she knew, wondering what he was doing. 

That night we got drunk. I was newly 18 (my friend was 24) and I hadn’t really been drunk before. I got trashed. I was throwing up, just a mess. We were playing around and I threw my phone at some point. It wasn’t done meanly at all, but I understand it likely hurt. It was a giant iPhone and it hit her in the face. I don’t remember this. I do remember her calling the guy she was seeing to pick her up. And she left. 

I called my boyfriend sobbing that my best friend left me alone. He consoled me and stayed on the phone until I fell asleep. We lived on opposite sides of the country at that point so he couldn’t just come over. 

After that, my friend told me she told her guy about the phone throwing thing and he wasn’t happy with me. I felt really bad about that. I apologized to her profusely and asked if there was anything I could do. She laughed it off and said everything was fine and not to worry about it. 

But then she kept on bringing it up! For weeks afterwards she would bring up how my phone hit her in the eye. She posted about it on her snapchat story... I apologized again and expressed how terrible I felt about it. She wouldn’t drop it. 

Long story short, I just got tired of hearing about it. I cut contact with her. I have not spoken with her since early 2017 when this happened. 

Today I found myself wondering about her and I thought about trying to contact her to catch up. I understand we likely won’t start talking everyday or even be friends again but I felt some desire to see how she is. 

I don’t have Facebook, but she does. I thought I could make a quick account and message her. I would just be honest and say that I have an interest in catching up, I understand if she doesn’t want to talk... idk what else to say. 

I included the above story because I was wondering if I should include that I was hurt by what happened and that’s why I stopped talking to her. 

I guess where I need advice is should I even contact her? If I do, what should I say? I don’t want to sound like I’m being a stalker or anything. I also don’t want to sound like any of this has plagued me for years. It hasn’t. In the 3-4 years we haven’t talked, I’ve thought about this only a couple of times.",26Aug2020,1

235,"I am not sure if I came to the right place, but I'm going to divide it into different sections so it's easier for whoever is going to read. I don't know where to seek help... Fyi, i'm a 24 years old dude.  


1. Friends

Over the past few years, I have been struggling the make friends. The friends I have right now were mostly from high school and first year at university. They are fine, but it's just that, the amount of new friends i made and none of them last have finally made me started to believe that, I'm the issue. I'm rather different, I come off pretty well, demanding, as in, if they are not putting as much as effort as I do, i will feel like crap and want to cut them off. It haunts me that, why is it so hard for me to find new lasting friendships? Am I asking too much? Some of them I met through reddit, some are through school, some are through social media, and it all ended up the same way, they never ever engage anything with me and i ended up deleting them. I honestly do not mind if they act that way, at least I know what i am dealing with and i have no problem parting ways, but when it's been happening way too much, is it the method that i make friends wrong? I don't know, what do you guys do when these so-called friends are not really being your ""friend"" ?  


2. False-Loneliness

This is just easier to explain, comparing to the last one. This is the fourth year that I've been single, and I have been rather a, hoe? I do admit it, I go out of my way to get laid, and most of the time is because i want the attention and i feel lonely. However, I don't think i'm really lonely, I am quite close with my family, and I have people that I could count on. The loneliness will ONLY go away, when I engage in sexual relationships with others. My friends are wondering, why don't you just get a girlfriend. I do, but, at the meantime, I am not very active looking for one, well first off, because school was hella busy, and i literally just finished my undergrad like two weeks ago. Second, I love my personal time and space way too much. Lastly, After my last relationship, I found out I have serious trust and jealousy issues, and, well, I still havent found my way of dealing with it, and I can get jealous over something for nothing, no matter they are strangers, friends or crushes. Anyways, I just feel lonely almost all the time, and I seriously don't know where it comes from.  


  3. very hidden insecurities 

For those who know me IRL, they would never think I am the shy and insecurity type, because my behavior sorta covers it so well, and I wrapped myself with a fake illusion to make the ones that don't know me so well, that i'm rather popular or cool or whatever. I'm a dude that is rather loud, impulsive, makes jokes out of everything, likes to lie, like to pretend and this and that. And that, I feel like whenever I'm in a genuine exchange with someone, I am rather awkward, silence, shy, can't be myself and always said the wrong/boring thing. I am also chubby, well, 5'8 but 200 pounds, doesn't look good, but yet i tried to act like that doesn't really bother me, but deep down, it does. I think of the phrase that you gotta love yourself first before anything, and, i don't think i do. I acknowledge a lot of things, but i don't know what to do really.

I would like to change myself, for a better future, and for a better me. Where should i begin?",26Aug2020,1

237,I've lost touch with everything. I don't feel pleasure in anything anymore. Nothing excites me. Nothing thrills me. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm numb. I used to be so happy but I've changed. I'm not me anymore. I don't want to do anything. I'm scared. I'm so so scared. I don't know where to go from here. Nothing else matters anymore. Nothing makes sense. My family is mad at me. My friends all left because all I did was express my feelings. It's my fault but I didn't know what else to do. I have no one anymore. I'm all alone. I strongly believe in karma. I had to do something really screwed up for this to happen to me so I know that somehow I deserve this but I'm in so much pain. I don't wanna feel like this anymore... I don't know what to do...,26Aug2020,1
238,"I'm going to get directly to the point on this one: I'm a terrible person. I have absolutely no willpower to do anything. I've got no motivaton or desire to do anything. I contribute nothing to society. I don't make things, and although I have wanted to before, I feel no want to anymore. I'm at the lowest point of joy in my life, and as I see it, I'll keep going downhill. I can't remember the last time within a year I've enjoyed doing something that isn't just playing games. 

But... I do, in some little sliver of my heart, want to make something. I don't know what. Music, art, games, I don't know. It keeps nagging at me and telling me to get off my ass and do ssomething. I can't understand it. I want to be happy, in that same part of me. The rest of me is apathetic towards whatever I do, with my only solace being gaming.

Please. Either help me find a way to destroy that part of my heart that seeks joy, or find a way to increase my will to do anything.",26Aug2020,1
239,"I just started my 3rd year of a STEM degree, and I absolutely hate it. I cant pin down exactly how I ended up where I am now but I can pretty much just say its my fault somehow and it doesn't matter anyways. What I am now certain of is that I have always had a passion and desire to practice art, even though I'm not the best at it at the moment. Even aside from this issue I have been dealing with many other issues including some concerning turns in my mental health and its gotten to the point where I am constantly switching between bouts of depression and frustration and anxiety. I dont have the motivation to do what i need or what I want to do and have spent the past month or 2 doing nothing but shutting down or battling with my thoughts.

I hide all of this from my family and friends and it hurts me everytime I tell them I'm happy and that I like what I'm doing, but I can't tell them the truth. I dont even know how I should or even if I should because I've let this go on for too long. I am tired of it. I have dug myself far down into this hole and I cant dig or climb anymore.

240,"I’m a 24 year old guy. I’m quiet and short (5’8”). I guess people think I’m weak so they like to pick on me. I walk around my town which is a small town (population 5,000) located in the Midwest.

I walk 3-5 nights a week for exercise and normally get honked at or yelled at during about half of my walks. I’m always in deep thought so for some reason I always jump. I feel like an idiot. I’m not really that scared; jumping is just my body’s natural response. I can’t stop it.

So tonight I was walking and this guy in a car comes up behind me and yells loudly. Of course I jump. He then passes me and stops at the stop sign and looks back at me laughing. I smile and give him a nod.

Inside I actually wasn’t smiling. I was pissed. I never bother anybody on my walks and I don’t understand why these people (it isn’t always the same people - mostly they’re random) keep picking on me. Nobody wants to be the subject of somebody’s joke. I’m thru with being the joke.

Why do these people pick on me and make fun of me? What this thrill in making a pedestrian jump? How should I react next time? Ignore it? Call the police? Confront the them? Ask them why they do it? What do you think?",26Aug2020,1

242,"Hi.

I am a 20f currently in my junior year of college. I've never really had a nice solid relationship with my mother but as I have grown in age it has just worsened. She gets aggravated at me for almost anything and I just really hate it cause it makes me feel so small. My father left when I was young so it's not like I have any other adult figure. 

Today I was finally able to move in back into my dorm at school. I was of course pretty happy about this because now I have more freedom, and I can go anywhere I want to without my mother knowing. Prior to leaving I had told my mother that I don't want her calling everyday and that I wouldn't be answering her calls (I meant it in a half joking way and explained to her that as a 20 year old I don't want to keep leaving my friends to returns calls to my mother). 

While I was getting dinner with my friends today and catching up after moving in she called me and I didn't answer because I hadn't realized that she called but before she called I texted my little sister that I was at a ""floor meeting"" which is why I can't call them. She of course got angry that I didn't answer then text me ""Wow you told me you won’t pick up the phone if I call you that’s nice I got you "". And that just really upset me because I hate that she is always so angry with me for no reason when she isn't this same way with my sister. She called back later and I answered and she was still angry asking why I didn't text her even though I was in the ""floor meeting"".

I thought that me going back to school would be a great way for me to get away from my family again and be able to live as my own person. I'm fucking 20 I should be able to not have to talk to my mother every single day at college. 

I'm open to any advice that anyone may have.

But since the pandemic has started I've been changing. At first I would start to overthink and we would get into these toxic episodes where I would start to overthink and be passive aggressive to my girlfriend.  Then I think i started to get insecure and confused about life and i would continue to have these episodes untill. I probably get them about 4 times a month. It usually consist of me accusing my girlfriend for cheating or just thinking of something dumb to start an argument. I would get in this mood where I just want to make my girlfriend cry but when I hear her cry I stop immediately. Sometimes I would accuse her of the things of the past for example her smoking or liking other guys. I have been improving and lately I really been working on it. Getting a therapist and reading books and writing on a journal.

Yesterday I had one of these moments where my girlfriend was going to see her friend but I think i built a resentment against this friend because she smokes and i personally don't like smoking. So she was going to see this friend so I started to get one of these moments where I thought she was going to smoke so I started to insult her friend through text saying shes a ""tweaker"" for some reason I don't like her friend and never met her. I still dont like her but at the same time I do. My girlfriend would ignore me but I usually spam her untill she answers like a little kid. Then she usually cries after and I stop. 

I know the way I act is dumb and unreasonable. Its also unfair to my girlfriend.

251,"TL:DR - my husband basically said that my boundary I set was unrealistic because it meant giving me space after work.

My husband and I got into a fight today about something we fight about at least once or twice a month. I work fulltime, and he hasnt worked since late April because of covid. I work with kids and have to give them all my energy and patience in order to be a kind and joyful caretaker. I work with them 40-50 hours a week. 

My husband says that I am mean when I get home. And it's true, I am super snappy and easily agitated because of how tired I feel since I used up all my patience on little people all day. Doesn't excuse my rudeness though, so I get why he's upset.

When I explain to him that I am tired and need alone time when I get home, he gets mad. I tell him I need to recharge and he is annoyed. He says to just be nicer and when I say okay I will try, but also please give me space, he doesn't give me space.

So today we fought and I said that I am actually getting pissed with him after work because despite the amount of times I ask to give me space right after work, he doesn't. He knows I'll tell him about my day, how I'm doing, etc after I have a quiet moment for like 30ish minutes. So I said ""that he keeps crossing a boundary I keep setting over and over again, by interviewing me as soon as I get home"" and he said ""well you need to set realistic boundaries"" 

Is my boundary unrealistic? If it is, then I will work on it. But I don't see why asking for space after a long day is a problem. Idk. Maybe I'm just a major B*tch and didnt know it 😂😂😂",26Aug2020,1
252,"We’ve been together for a while but haven’t been sexually active because I have severe body issues and can’t get into it yet. He gets it, i’ve offered an open relationship but he always refused saying he loves me and doesn’t need to see other people. 

A few weeks ago him and one of my friends(whom i’m not very close with and i don’t really like but he thinks we are) added each other on social media and have been talking occasionally. She’s gay and he knew it, so I guess he felt comfortable talking about such things. (He later told her “gays spot other gays”)

Today they had some small talk and he randomly told her how much he likes muscular guys or something, then they started talking about his attraction to guys in general. He told her that he loves me and if it weren’t for me, he’d be full on gay, then asked her i she thinks he sounds/is gay. This was all really strange to me, like why does it matter so much? He’s told me before that he is bi and he knows i like both boys and girls, so I got a bit confused as to why it’s a big deal. We like what we like, and if you say you want to be in a monogamous relationship with someone, why would your attraction to other people matter so much? I hope this? makes sense, like now that I’m dating him why would I worry about how much i like girls? Or want to even talk to his friends about it? Sounds absurd. 

He then told her that years before all this, there was this guy who semi-forced him to suck his dick, but in the middle of doing things he actually enjoyed it. He then spent a year having sex with men almost every week or so. It was “more about the desire to be a sub to a guy, than the actual guy” and that he never liked guys romantically. He’s dated girls too. He told her he likes the “raw sexual nature” of men and the softness of girls. This honestly sounds like a really traumatic experience, and I feel bad that he’s never told me about it. After reading that part of their chats, I completely get why he would still be questioning his sexuality and would never do him dirty. What bothers me, however, is that he chose to talk to Her about it. 

Right now I just feel like a burden, like some kind of obstacle between him and what he really wants. I’ve suggested being open many times, he refuses, yet goes on to tell my friends how much he wants to fuck other people? I’m meeting him tomorrow and all of this has made me extremely sick to my stomach, I won’t be able to hide it. My friend does not want me to tell him she told me all of this, and it would be really shitty of me, but I see it as the only way to ask him about it. I’m really starting to think he’s just using me as a coverup in front of his family and friends, and it’s making me feel even more unlovable. I get it, I really do, but I cannot help but feel that way. What would you do in this situation?

253,"Yesterday my colleague picked me to go to our work. He is always the one driving me back and forth from house to office. Yesterday, when I rode his car, I found him asleep and the smell of alcohol was so strong. BTW this happened 11:30 am. 

While he was driving, I noticed that his eyes were half shut, there were times that his eyes were totally closed for a short period of time. He was fighting hard not to sleep. I even asked him if we should stop, and he asked me why. I told him he was sleepy. I asked him if he was okay, and he replied,  he's a little okay and still drove the car half asleep. I was able to take a short video of him while his eyes were closed and driving. I was shit scared all through out, whenever there's a truck on the other lane of the road, I would clench my fist. I was looking at the rear view mirror and will found him trying his best to be awake. I am having anxiety and was really afraid for my life, thinking what will happen if we crushed into another car  and praying at the same time that we can reach our office safe. I am the sole breadwinner of our family right now. And I am working overseas. 

Last night before going to sleep, the images of the truck that we've met on the road appeared in my mind. This morning, while I was riding his car I was still a little uncomfortable whenever there's a truck on our way. I asked him also this morning if he was drinking alcohol yesterday and he denied it. I wasn't able to confront him. I think he's undergoing personal problems right now. 

Now I am thinking if I should tell our office about this incident, because I am also quite afraid if he would take it against me once he's reprimanded by his behaviour. I am a foreigner in their land and I live alone. However, I also don't want it to let it pass. What should I do?

255,"Hey

So I’m a single mom to a 3 month old. His dad helps occasionally, but not very much. He does help with formula, etc. for baby, but I carry most of the load. He doesn’t have the financial means to pay rent, or at least claims he doesn’t. Yes, I have filed CS.

So the issue is that I’m going to be about $600 short for my September rent ($1000). I cannot get evicted. I have a past evicition, and this place I currently live in took a chance on me. Not to mention, I obviously have a baby and he needs a place to live. There is nowhere else for us to go. 

What do you recommend I do? Talking to the landlord isn’t the best option, because if she thinks I am unable to pay the rent, she will go ahead and try to evict me. She said something like “Don’t make me regret it” when she agreed to rent to me. I got approved for the place by applying with my son’s dad who works and has an income, while I currently do not. 

I was substituting before covid got bad and the schools closed. Even then, I still did doordash. Then I gave birth in May. I receive unemployment, but they cut the weekly excess funds. Between security, rent for July, basic furnishings like bed and kitchenette, plus car note, insurance, gas, food, baby needs... I’m down to my last. I have been interviewing this week, but realistically I won’t be receiving a paycheck until mid-September. 

Just looking for advice and recommendations on ways I can make it to October and stay in my apartment. I’m almost certain I will be receiving regular paychecks by then.

256,"Basically as the title states. Using a throwaway account and have changed some minor details for anonymity. 

The super long story short, I (16) have been getting relentlessly bullied online and one day my cousin (27) decided he'd had enough. Cousin created a burner Twitter account and engaged with the people online (15-17). It was stupid and childish, and people have been asking if it was actually him or a troll. I told 3 people exactly that I didn't know it who it was. 

I feel really awful about lying but my cousin was the only person who was sticking up for me. I'm coming clean with the person my cousin directly engaged with within the week and I'm worried about backlash. What makes things messy is that my cousin works in a school district about two hours away and students there caught wind of it.

260,"Dear Reddit Hivemind: I'm volunteering to help a missing person search party track where everyone has searched and placed posters. There are a good number of people who are driving around, hiking, and generally checking areas out in addition to hanging missing person fliers. These folks have mostly been tracking the areas searched on pen and paper, but someone helped start up a Scribble Maps page, too.

My question is this: Is there any application that volunteers could download to track their GPS location while driving/walking, then upload to something like Google maps? Preferably something that can have layers (e.g., areas searched vs. posters placed) and is easy to use. A lot of these volunteers are older adults and aren't necessarily tech savvy.

Thank you!",26Aug2020,1
261,"My close friend died from suicide about 4 years ago. We were similar in age as she was 15 and I was 14 (now 18). I felt extreme guilt that led to me losing a part of myself and going a bit off the rails in 2018 which led to a suicide attempt that put me in a mental hospital. Since I’ve been out things haven’t gotten much better, in fact the guilt has gotten worse. For a while there I convinced myself I was not a bad person until I opened up my old phone and read our messages to each other. Basically she completely told me she wanted to commit suicide and I was completely ignorant and instead of helping I just said things get better and that we were in it together. I had no idea what she was going through, and it led to her death. I feel like i did something horrible and for some reason I’m just getting away with it. Everyone says it’s not my fault but now that I’ve felt suicidal I’ve realized all she wanted was someone to do something and care. And I didn’t. I don’t know what to do honestly I don’t know why I’m posting this I’m probably just crying for help because I don’t know if i can live with the guilt. It seems like I’m toxic and people just want to leave because of me because not only did she commit suicide but my older cousin and my grandpa. I don’t know what to do. Any advice would be much appreciated 

TLDR: friend committed suicide and I could’ve helped and I didn’t. I don’t know what to do anymore as the guilt is eating me away. And advice would be appreciated thank you",26Aug2020,1

272,"The female friend is good friends with my fiancé (they’re closer than I am with female friend) and is a bridesmaid in our wedding. I met the male friend through her as he was her boyfriend at the time and have spent a lot of time with him.

I recently found out that he cheated on her with another member of their friend group and broke up with her because our mutual friends told him either he end it or they’d tell her. He ended it, but she still doesn’t know that the real reason is because he cheated. He isn’t even aware that I know he cheated.

I frequently play online games with him and our other friends, but My fiancé and I are upset with him because of his actions toward this female friend.

I don’t want to pick sides because everybody makes mistakes, and I don’t think that it’s right to abandon a friend because they did something wrong. Tbh, now is probably the time when he needs good friendship and subtle guidance more than usual. Besides, his life is not mine to judge or oversee.

However, I don’t want to betray the female friend by continuing to be friends and communicate with him after what he did to her. I also don’t want her to feel betrayed if she finds out he cheated and nobody told her, but I don’t think it’s my place to break that news, especially before my wedding that they’ll both be attending.

Possible TW (idk if I should put this I just really don't want to trigger someone)







We were in the middle of sex when he stopped to grab lube. He grabbed a new kind we hadn't used before and applied it and the second I felt it touch me I asked him to stop because it burned. I said stop 4 or 5 times and he just kept trying. I was moving my body away from him and he kept just getting closer. I  turned and looked at him and said stop. He responded by grabbing me by the neck and tossing me to the other side of the bed. I yelled STOP at him.  He threw his hands up in the air angrily and stomped out of the room. 

I know what he did was wrong but he told me it wasnt assault and he also said that we've had sex since then so it didnt bother me. I feel the need to point out that there are times I asked to be choked (safely, of course). He told me grabbed me like that to put me back in the mood because ""I was into that"".

279,"This primarily pertains to my music.

While I’m not a musician by trade, I consider myself, as humbly as possible, a gifted musician.  I believe I was graced with God-given ability to play music well on various instruments, and I know that I love to do it more than anything.

However, I recently started my first adult job after graduating college, I’m in the middle of planning a wedding, and I’m usually tired or busy. But this problem started before any of that. During the times I have free, I find myself making excuses or simply being lazy and not playing music even though I know it would help me a lot mentally and emotionally. 

Part of me is hesitant to play because, despite the talent that I do have, I listen to experts play and become discouraged that I can’t possibly do what they’re doing, which is, in itself, a self-fulfilling prophecy because I never will if I never try/practice.

The larger part tho, is that I’ve simply become lazy and choose to spend my little free time watching TV or playing video games because it’s very low effort and I have no expectations there.

I’d be devastated if I looked back years from now and realized that I lost my abilities because I couldn’t pry myself off of the couch.

282,"Ever since 7th grade I’ve been more gloomy and unable to talk to people as naturally as I did as an elementary student. I’ve been so scared to the point where I shake in class just by being there. It’s been hard because usually I don’t find many things to say or I’m scared of the person talking to me, other students have tried to befriend me but I feel as if they’re just messing with me or being sarcastic. That sort of thing applies to everyone really. I feel I’m not well liked, and so alone all the time I just want to go back to elementary everyday.

When I talk to people I most times tremble and stutter, and I especially talk quietly. Sometimes I try to talk louder but end up sounding weird, like
I’m trying too hard. I can’t make any new friends because I’m unsure how to approach people, the only reason I have any is because someone from my elementary was there as well, and I eventually befriended their friends. (I’ll get back to that later) 
Due to corona virus I only have 2 total friends in school. One in my 2nd period, and one in my 7th. 
The classes I have with them I can’t really talk to them because I don’t sit close to them. As for the rest of my classes, I’m generally ignored in but I’m  almost always fine with it. 

Since 2/3 of students are attending online school, my friends included, it’s gotten worse. Without my best friends around I don’t have anyone to talk to, always walk everywhere alone, but I managed to find someone to sit with at lunch. That’s about the only time I’m social. I think I’m feeling gloomy because of lack of social interaction. As soon as I get home I go to bed immediately because of how late I stay up, so time goes by pretty fast there. I spend the majority of my time in school saying nothing to anybody and sleeping+eating at home. 

The thing I’m asking is how to talk to people better, have that natural charisma, and just make more friends in general.

I am the last to leave for college, and while there is still family close by, they are all busy people who cannot be around him as much as we were. I am quite worried about him, and I’m at a loss for how to help. He is quite technically savvy for his age and can use his iPhone well enough, but he isn’t great. He probably couldn’t download an app on his own, but he can call, text, google things, listen to his audiobooks, and play a few simple games I got him. I'm going to try to stay in contact as much as possible, but my problem is that despite having an iPhone 6 plus, the screen is still too small for him to see everything easily, and his hearing is terrible. My ideas so far are these: 
Get him an iPad, get him excellent headphones or a speaker, try and teach him how to use an apple tv. My reasoning for the iPad is that with the larger screen, he will find using it a lot easier and be able to read, play, FaceTime, and even watch tv on it. I’m not sure about the apple tv because I think it would be hard for him to change the inputs from cable to the apple tv, but I have no idea what else to do to keep him entertained. He does a lot of word scrambles, and I am trying to get him so fun puzzle apps, but they have to be simple enough for him to learn or based on something he already knows, i.e., solitaire. Apologies for the rambling, here is concisely what i am asking for:

On a separate occasion, I was told my brother and I can't walk our dog at 10:30 cause it's ""too late"".

Then, yet a different time, I wanted to let my aunt give me bangs (wispy long face framing strands, not a solid curtain covering my forehead) and she basically told me I couldn't, to name a few instances of her being controlling.

297,"Hi! I've had an account for awhile but this is my first post. I hope that's ok.

For awhile (probably nearly 2-3 years?), I've been kinda known as the stupid one in my friend group. At first I didn't care. It was just a small mistake, big deal. Woopsie. But now whenever I don't understand something or have no idea what's going on, suddenly my friends want to punch me because Im dumb. 

Recently I was gifted a game on Steam (Fall guys) and was exploring the entire game before I joined a lobby. My friend asked me why I'm not on and I was confused since I barely used Steam. If any I only play one game on it solo so I rarely, if not ever play with anyone else. I was confused and just asked ""where do I check?"" and suddenly he wants to smack me? After some time and using discord I understood but he kept talking about how dumb I was for doing it. At that point I just kinda snapped at him and just left the call. It's most likely a dumb mistake on my part to just snap in general but after awhile of just that happening I was sick of it.

Honestly, there's so many more moments where I just feel dumb, stupid, idiotic, ashamed. Every time they honestly say, ""I just wanna punch you so badly."" I just agree. I want them to hurt me for how stupid I am. I feel dumb whenever I have trouble doing something. I feel as though I don't matter if I don't contribute correctly. I feel like my only personality trait is to satisfy people incorrectly. I don't know what's wrong with me. I don't know what's wrong with me and I don't know if I should even keep going at this point. I just want to disappear completely and never return to this life. 

I suppose advice wise; What do I do at this point? Do I just keep going? Do I shut up? Do I talk about it to them? What happens if they just honestly dislike me?

Im so sorry if this doesn't give as much context. I've probably overexaggerated on these so I may update it when I'm not this emotionally distraught. If you have questions, I don't mind answering.

298,"I am a single father who lives alone with his teenage daughter. Her mom passed away tragically when she was 12 and took a while to recover and now everything is fine until very recently.

So one day, I was driving on my motorcycle to my sister's place and was met with an accident. Very minor injuries but got a concussion and next thing I remembered was being in a hospital bed. 

My sister took me home after the nurses filled in on her with what had happened. 
My daughter came back home that day from school and wasn't really happy with hearing what had happened. 

She began crying despite me telling her that it was nothing serious but she wouldn't listen. We both are really affectionate people and seeing her cry like that was heart breaking.

From that day on, she really clung onto me like never before. She hugs me whenever she sees me and always kisses me on the cheek like a thousand times each day. I wasn't really annoyed by this, but it was really strange given the fact that she had stopped doing all this at a younger age but I later dismissed this to be because of the accident.

Few weeks go by fine until she starts doing these strange things. She now often asks me if she could sleep in with me.
Despite having her own room, she really insists on sleeping with me with a common excuse being ""I can't get any sleep"".

At first it was okay but she continued this for like 4 days and it really slightly bugged me getting my personal space invaded. I tried talking to her about it but she would remain quiet and not say anything. I even locked the door, which may seem harsh but I wanted her to know.

This only resulted her in being in a very bad mood the next morning.

Again, last night she snuck into my room but this time she kissed me on the lips. Like she put her hands around me and kissed me on my lips without warning. 

I pushed her back in anger and scolded her. I told her that she over stepped her boundaries and she shouldn't do that but all she did was laugh. I did everything I could but she just took it lightly.

I manage to send her back to her room.

I am really confused and lost. I don't understand what to do. I plan on talking with my sister about this since she is much older than me but on second thought, I felt it might be a bad idea. 

Can anyone help me out? Or give any advice. Is it like a teenage phase or something that I am not aware about?

300,"So I’m using a throwaway account for this because my brothers both know my username.

I (16F) was sexually assaulted and taken advantage of by a family friend, I was around 8 or 9 years old and it took place over the course of a month or 2. I met the family of the boy who assaulted me when I was around 7, and my family came to meet them because we lived in the same apartment complex. My parents enjoyed having their company because we moved from another country and my parents didn’t have a lot of friends here. The family consisted of a single mom, her son, and her soon to be born daughter.

Both of our families were hispanic which made it easy for us all to get along. My brother ended up befriending the son and eventually when his moms daughter came along, I would come over to babysit and spend time with her because being so young I had nothing else to do. Her mom would always be around regardless, but I would spend time with her and I eventually began to grow attached to both the mom and daughter. To me they became like a second family, the sister I never got to have; and eventually she became dependent on me and her mood would always be uplifted whenever I was around.

Eventually, as I grew older her brother would eventually like spending more time with us whenever I was around. Usually when I went over he would be playing games or hanging out my brother, but as I grew older he seemed to want to be near me more. He (13 or 14) at the time, would always try to show his sister whenever she was misbehaving what being “gentle” was with other people, he would often use me to demonstrate and at first it started with patting on my back, hugging, or just being nice to me in front of her to set an example. As time passed most of this would escalate, and it became frequent for him to use the excuse of trying to show her how she should act to touch me. I wore skirts a lot as a kid, and he would touch my thighs, my butt, and eventually more. I never questioned it because at the time, I was young and something that made matters worse was I had a crush on him. I thought wow how lucky am I at 8 years old to be hanging out and being friends with this cute older boy.

It was darker then that, I wasn’t lucky; I was just oblivious to what was happening to me. It went on for a while before one big incident led me to believe it wasn’t right, it was one day where I had to go home late and it was just a trip to the elevator to my apartment back. His mom made him accompany me so I would go back home safe, while in the elevator he began to talk about how my leggings were such a nice material and it was so soft. He proceeded to ask me if he could feel the fabric, I thought it was harmless so I said okay. After a few seconds of him touching the fabric on my leg, he put his hand inside and started fondling my parts. He would move his hand around to the front of me and later to the back of me. This went on for a couple of minutes. Being inside that elevator at the time felt like an eternity, like I was never going to get out; even though it was only a couple of floors. When it stopped at my floor I quickly pulled his hands out and said bye, when I got home I immediately ran to my bathroom; and stared 8 year old me in the eyes crying wondering why he did what he did, what I did wrong and if it was my fault. I gathered the courage to tell my mom about it and she eventually later that night went to go talk to his mom, it ended in an eventual falling out between our two families; he ended up feeling regretful saying he wanted to kill himself and he was ashamed of what he did. 

We cut off ties, and I simply never ended up speaking to them again. My mom didn’t want me to be around them anymore, and it was understandable but I had to deal with this empty void of knowing I would never be able to see his mom or his daughter again. It hit me hard, I grew so attached to them that even after what was literally an assault, the only thought on my mind was being able to see them again; not what had
happened to me. 

It’s only recently that I began to have night terrors and struggle to sleep at night due to flashbacks of the incidents, I stay up late wondering what could’ve been if it never happened, or if I simply just chose to keep my mouth shut. My parents never addressed it again after it happened, I remember crying to my mom because I was triggered by someone else’s story; and she merely brushed it off telling me what happened to me could’ve been much worse. I don’t know what to do, I keep thinking about it and I keep wondering why it’s hitting me now harder then ever. I don’t even know who to talk to about it, I’ve been suppressing it for years and addressing it feels weird, like it’s almost wrong talking about it. I wish I could go to a therapist, but my parents don’t really talk about mental health or believe in therapists. With personal issues I usually turn to my brothers, but neither of them have any idea what happened to me so I don’t know how they would take it, or if they would be mad at me for not talking about it all these years.

What do I do? Do I tell my parents or my brothers? Should I maybe try and seek therapy?",26Aug2020,1

310,I work in a restaurant as a server for about 20 hours a week spread over 4 night and weekend shifts. I own a PC/electronics repair business but I still need the extra income until I can grow the company to a point that I am confident I will consistently make enough money with that alone. We hired a new general manager about two months ago when we opened back up as the previous general manager had taken a position with another company. I have had issues with the new general manager since day one and I dread going into work every day I’m scheduled. The micromanaging along with his need to belittle everyone and constantly assert his authority makes working there like hell. My co workers feel the same way but they all suck up and play dumb. They just accept the bowl of shit they are force fed on a daily basis. I seem to have made him hate me as well because I stand up for myself and give him shit right back. This has caused him to give me a harder time and put me in bad sections so that I make less money. My income serving isn’t even half what it was before this started happening. Tonight when I was cashing out to go home he was giving me a hard time then misplaced a credit card slip that had a $40 tip. This caused me to go from leaving with $100 to leaving with $60 on a night where most servers made almost $200. He responded by saying oh well you just lost money it happens deal with it and that’s when I told him to shut the fuck up he looked shocked and was fumbling for words. Before he put a sentence together I said stop being an ass hole and said bye. I walked to the back and clocked out not because of what had just happened but because it was time to leave. I’m not sure I should go back in tomorrow and just act like nothing happened and see if I get fired. I could put a notice in if they wanted but I think it may be time to part ways.,26Aug2020,1
311,"So. This is another one of those heartbreak stories I am sorry, but bear with me. My girlfriend left me and ended our relationship of 3 and a half years about 8 months ago on Christmas Eve when she called me on the phone. We ended (or so I thought) on good terms. She said we can still be friends and that it's not because of me. We never cheated on each other, we weren't abusive, we never yelled at each other or cursed each other out. Throughout the 8 months we've been apart, every couple or so months I would try to contact her and get us to hang out, and every time I have she has said no. She says that she was guilty for how we left things but I didn't care. I still really care for this woman, and I want a second chance. I am willing to change myself and do better and treat her better. Recently, I contacted her, and told her these things. She says that our relationship was another chapter in our life and that I need to move on. She said that she's working two jobs and planning to move out, and has a whole plan for her future and doesn't have time for anyone else. I told her I wanted to be there to support her during this time of her life (she's 20 btw and I'm 18). She still cares about me, and said that I deserve someone better and all this other stuff. She said she wants to see me happy and thriving. She says we are too different and that she really appreciates what we had and won't throw away any letters or gifts that I've given her. And it's really confusing because like she really cares about me but she doesn't want to be with me. But the thing is I love her and her only. I talked to my mom about this and she said that if you really love someone, you have to fight for them. But I talked to a friend about this and they told me to move on and that I deserve better. This stupid part of me thinks that maybe I can convince her that I can be a part of her life, and that I should keep fighting and never give up. But the other part of me tells me to just move on. We had so many memories together, throughout all 4 years of high school I was with her, and we were each others firsts. My first kiss, my first girlfriend, and I even lost my virginity to her. And It's sad now because she just doesn't want to be with me anymore and I need advice on what I should do because I have this ongoing debate in my head.",26Aug2020,1

316,"I'm a fourth year architecture student, every semester I go through this crisis with myself where I can't stop asking me if I should drop out or change majors, I don't know if it's because I believe I'm no good or if I just don't like it. I know I'm not going to do it though, because I have no good reason to; there's less than half the career left already for me to leave, the last thing I want to do is start all over in another major I'm not even sure I'd like either, and I'm actually at the top of my class even (mostly because of the not so carreer specific courses). When I chose my major I  basically didn't really even know what it was actually about, now that I do know I realized that though I find it very interesting I'm just no good for it and I can't see myself in the future just doing this.

Like I said, I'm not dropping out of college, but I just wish to find some hope or encouragement, of there being something that I can find later on, to keep me going through the now; because right now, the only reason I keep on going is to leave as fast as I can. I realized in this years that if there's something I could talk about as my so called 'passion' is learning about languages, cultures, history and so.

318,"Some sort of radical doubt has invaded my life and it's very annoying.

Every time I say something or have a thought, even a simple one, like ""I like this actress"" I suddenly start to think that maybe I don't really like her and so I say ""actually, not really"" and in my head I'm just like ""why did I say that!?"" Then I start to think I don't even know if I like her or not and I start to get really confused and I feel like nothing is real anymore. I feel like I'm constantly annoying people so I try to just stay out of their way, now. Unless I really really trust them. And even then I worry about annoying them.

I don't even have to state an opinion for my brain to second guess what I'm saying. It could be something as simple as ""it's a little cold out"" and I will think ""wait, no it's not! it's probably actually hot for this time of year, what am I thinking?"" but then I think I'm overcompensating and all of the sudden it's like I don't know cold from hot and I feel incredibly stupid and crazy.

Sometimes I start to feel very confused because of this, and like nothing is real. Not in a scary, anxiety-inducing way, like people describe derealization/depersonalization.

For the record, I do have passions and ""hobbies"" that I find immensely meaningful and fulfilling so it's not like I'm an automaton who is incapable of joy. It's just in everyday life I'm never sure of myself, or my perceptions, and I trust everyone else more than myself.

319,"Hello there. Throwaway account for reasons.

Could also be tagged as \[Career\] or \[Life Decisions\].

I just started Law School &amp; I could use some advice.

**Background:** For a few years, I haven't had a clue what I wanted to do with my life. Studying humanities in undergrad, Law seemed like a natural path to riches and success. ""Maybe I'll go to Law school"" is the answer I gave to respond to the typical family member question at Christmas, ""What are you going to do with your life?"" After I poached the idea out loud, the ball started rolling. I know they weren't trying to push me, but I often heard this line from my loved ones: ""How I'm going to become a successful attorney some day and make us so proud."" That its an amazing profession and that I could do such wonderful things. When in reality, I didn't have the slightest clue if that's what I wanted to do, but that was my public go-to. Its my own fault for keeping up a facade, not anyone else's around me. I know that.

After I finished undergrad, I told people around me that I wanted to take sometime to work before diving into Law, because like I said, I really didn't think that's what I wanted to do. Anyway, after Undergrad I didn't find many prospects in my area with my BA, which was a small economically depressed region. After a few months without finding a job or having direction, the pressure was mounting, I was not in a good state mentally without having direction or purpose. So by fall I signed up for the GRE &amp; LSAT to see how I did. LSAT scores were decent and better than my GRE scores, so I started my law applications and actually got caught up in the process. Just having something to do, felt good. It felt even better since it was something fairly prestigious in the minds of many. I spoke with several attorney's from my hometown. I asked lots of questions regarding what schools to apply to, in terms of ranking, based upon my GPA &amp; Scores, etc. They gave me good advice with regards to that, told me that 1L was the hardest year, and told me about the vital importance of summer internships, etc.

Knowing that the job market wasn't great for attorney's but seemed better than that of someone with a BA in humanities, I probed the topic with one attorney, and he basically told me that in my home area, the pond was dry and filled with tons of fish all trying to bathe in what little water was left. I looked online and saw mixed opinions about the job market in the US as a whole, but I was less concerned about all this at the time, because I didn't think I wanted to actually practice law. At the time I thought: ""If I decided I did later, then that was fine because I would have the option to and I would find a way"". I figured the degree would open up other doors, to positions/jobs of higher pay, prestige, success, stability, etc. that a Bachelors of Humanities from a state school couldn't. This seems to be the conventional wisdom from my parent's generation that a JD is an indispensable degree no matter the field. (Perhaps it still is true, but recent reading online has made me think the times have changed).

Basically my rationale was, ""I might not be interested in this but it will lead to money regardless, even if I choose to get the degree and do something other than law."" I followed the old conventional wisdom I mentioned above, that Law was a solid stable professor, and a JD was a solid degree, on par with an MD, etc. That I wouldn't be able to ascend without one of those.

Sometime passes. COVID begins, and I receive my first acceptance letters. I narrowed my choices down a between a \~T50 far away where I didn't want to live &amp; work with an okay scholarship, and several lower ranked regional schools closer to home where I had envisioned myself living and working with over half of my tuition paid with scholarships. I chose one of the lesser ranked schools.

**Fast forward, seven months later.** I'm a week into my first semester of law school. I've had some tough times in the past, but this has to be the most anxious &amp; miserable I've ever felt in my life. I've woken up in the middle of the night, sheets drenched in sweat for the past week. I usually don't break down either, but its been happening daily. I'm not hungry, just nauseated &amp; diarrhea. I'm not able to distract myself when I need a break, but at the same time I'm equally distracted when I'm trying to work. Classes are all online due to COVID. I can't keep my attention during the lectures. My only interactions with other people thus far have been over Zoom or behind a mask at the store, subsequently I have yet to make any friends. I have many case briefs and chapters to read for every class each night, which is the driest, most abstract, esoteric, crap I've ever had to try to understand in my life. Then the Professors' and their ""Socratic Method"" to test or humiliate me in class the next day, on material that doesn't click with me. It feels like every moment there is a looming dread hanging over me. 

How could I have been so irresponsible and stupid to get myself in this situation?

**Why do I waste another second doing this when, the result of all my labors and stress over the next three years is for a degree in something that I don't even want to do with my life?**

I've been honest with my father over the phone &amp; told him the truth. That this whole thing sounded great on paper, that it was a great conversation piece, that it made me look and feel good to say I would be going to law school. I also told him that I didn't look before leaping. That I'm probably here for the wrong reasons. That I don't think I can hang on for the next year, yet alone the next month. That its hard to rationalize putting up with this agonizing stress, anxiety, and work when I don't think I want to practice law, just something to make my resume stand out.

I think he believes that I have had good reasons to get to this point, and that the stress and shock of this has sent me spiraling out of control, confusing me, and clouding my judgement. Maybe he's right. Maybe all of this will be worth it in the end. He's told me that I just need to take it day by day and get through the first semester or year at least, then decide if this is for me or not. Then if its not for me, its not for me, and withdrawal. I haven't even broached the conversation with my mother, due to her high level of enthusiasm &amp; pride that I have started law school.

(To share this thought for the first time) If I'm being entirely honest with myself, the only light at the end of my tunnel isn't the prospect of getting the degree. The only thing that has allowed me to fall asleep over the past eight nights and keep doing my work is the prospect that I could withdrawal from law school and find something that I **want** to put 170% of my strength, willpower, and passion into in order to succeed.

I'm in a larger city now with more opportunity. (Although COVID hasn't helped) I've still found plenty of job listings that I at least meet the basic requirements for. It's cost a lot of time, energy, and money over the past year, just surviving, getting this far, and relocating for school but I think this is not for me. I could get a partial tuition refund &amp; I would be happy taking any job I could get with my BA in this big city, re-cooperating mentally, financially, and taking time to reassess my career prospects, by just getting some real work experience, and find that thing I could give my all.

Not only do I feel like a colossal idiot for making this mistake of leaping before looking, but I also feel like a coward, a quitter, and that I've failed. Part of me is nagging, and saying, ""Count your lucky stars that you're in law school and not getting shot, in Afghanistan. You're a snowflake, suck it up"". ""Your grandfather worked himself out of dirt poverty, you ought to be able to do this."" On top of this, so many of my friends &amp; cousins have worked their asses off for years to become physicians, bankers, brokers, finance professionals, etc. Here I would be quitting law school after a week. I don't know how to deal with the failure, shame, and cowardice involved with that. (Which is what will likely keep me in law school for sometime).

I've read plenty of other posts, about people with feelings different from my own on practicing/reasons for being there, stuck it out and still ended up quitting after their first semester or year. I have only found one post on google thus far that mentions someone they knew who dropped out of law school in their first week, without much other info given.

**So finally we arrive. Do you have any advice?:**

If anyone else out there has been in a similar situation, do you think a week or month is too early to throw in the towel. (Doesn't have to be dropping out of law school, could be quitting a job, undergrad, or other professional school, etc. More or less quitting something immediately after starting.

Am I a snowflake that needs to toughen up and at least finish out a semester before throwing in the towel? I can imagine some people saying ""Quit being a \*\*\*\*\*\*\* \*\*\*\*\*, suck it up, and do it, you aren't getting chemical weapons dropped on you in Syria, you're in law school."" Well that's what is amazing about anonymous online messaging boards &amp; maybe that's something I need to hear before I do anything rash.

If I decide to pull the plug, how do I get over this immense mistake I've made, the shame of it, and the shame of quitting after a week. How do I explain how I feel &amp; my rationale to those around me, who either don't understand how I'm feeling or have been in a similar situation, facing tougher odds, but overcame them, went on to succeed professionally, regardless if it was something they were passionate about or not?",26Aug2020,1

Did i have crushes , YES
Did i act a bit girly nervous and awkward around them ? I did 
Did i try to get them to be alone with myself before ? YES .

But when I fee like they got the clue i kind pf back off feeling I might’ve been too clingy ...
Also when we talk i alway be the one listening and advising but no matter how much i tried i cannot open up to my feelings , vulnerabilities and interests because i know i am an odd ball altogether and that they might distance themselves when they really know how much insecure I really am versus the persona they were shown .
All of this is a result of stuff that happened in childhood when i was open about my feelings and i made stuff very complicated and lost many people.

After that I decided I will not speak to anyone about my feelings 

Now I only think about them but they never talk either or take the initiative.

I'm have problems sleeping every night, and there's something new every single night, (i.e., it's too hot, the porch light is on, I wake up 4:00 sharp in a cold sweat because I got possessed) and this time my stomach hurts and I need use bathroom.

I go to the bathroom and I see the toilet has toilet paper floating near the hole, so I flush it. Immediately, it starts filling up with water and I immediately panic and then soon after, it empties itself and it does that thing with there's a only water filling the hole at the bottom.

Should I be concerned? Sorry if you find this weird...

TL;DR I flushed the toilet, and then it filled up and then drained itself and I'm wondering if I should be concerned",26Aug2020,1

327,"Hey, umm, this is my first time posting anywhere. Alright, straight to the point, recently I’ve been harboring strong feelings of blistering hatred for one of my friends.

(Bit of backstory)

He’s married to my best friend. They were bf and gf when I first met him so, by association, he became my friend too. We became friends either two years or one before they were married? I think? When we first me I thought of him as weird(my hypocritical ass) and slightly annoying, but I got used to it.

Fast forward to almost a year of us three being friends. I was still iffy about him because he loved to play around(roughhouse) and he touched me when I didn’t want to be touched. Like, I’ve never been in a serious relationship with anyone and I don’t like unwanted touching or picking me up out of nowhere. That shit pisses me off.

(The first time he did it, I had a panic attack. I was that bad.)

Then, one day outta the blue, he calls me to talk and after dodging my questions of what he wanted, he finally told me.

This motherfucker asked me for a fucking one night-stand.

You see, I’ve never done the deed, and I want my first time to be with someone I truly care for so yeah, I was pissed and shocked beyond belief. Afterwards, I called my bff and told her what happened and of course she couldn’t side with anyone because the fucknut lied.

After months passed, I finally decided to give the friendship another go, but it was only for my bff. We’ve helped each other through some tough times and I love her like the sister I’ve never had. It was awkward, and I could barely hold back a furious rant, but I did it. I didn’t have time to build up trust with him and he acted like it was nothing, ignoring the incident all together. Then, on my 21st birthday, she got him so drunk that he actually. I took satisfaction in knowing that she had cornered him in the bathroom and screamed at him until he cried. All I got from him was a drunken apology. Lil bitch.

Things have been a lot better since then, but recently my friend’s been feeling distant towards him and I feel like he’s just almost given up on their marriage. Apparently, I’m his only friend since he doesn’t care to go out and make guy friends. I’m about tired of that shit. He’s just being too damn picky and not giving anyone a damn chance. 

I just don’t know anymore...

I would really love some feedback please!!!",26Aug2020,1

331,"(Yesterday) I was at my friends house and we ended up hanging out with my friends older sibling and all of their friends. They had a bunch of friends over and I’m super intimidated by older teenagers so I felt really uncomfortable and awkward for a while. They were all drinking and smoking and offered us some alcohol and I got pretty drunk. It was good for a while. Couple hours later I started to ruin everything for myself. My self hatred jumped out and I was craving their attention or validation while my anxiety still lingered from the intimidation. I brought up my adderall prescription that I’ve had for a few months. Just a little information, I only take it once every couple of weeks because i haven’t really had motivation to take it and do anything. Pills have been building up and are left just sitting in my cabinet for weeks. Every once and awhile I think about what it would be like to sell very very low key. I haven’t sold anything cuz I still can’t quit figure out if that’s just embarrassing and annoying for me to do. Anyways I brought it up and offered it but that’s why I’m so embarrassed. I wish I had the self esteem to not need attention or validation from older people. I’ve been cringing all day hating myself for it. I had about 6 pills with me coincidentally because I was planning on taking one the next morning. I gave them out without thinking about it much cuz I thought, well I’m making them happy this is great, without realizing how low it was of me to do to myself. They don’t think I’m “cool” it didn’t do anything for me! I don’t want to be that person! The person that nobody cares for but oh, they have an adderall prescription and are dumb enough to give it out. 

One of the worst things is, I can’t tell myself “it’s fine, I think they’re so cool but maybe I’ll never see them again” BECAUSE I FUCKING GAVE THEM MY SNAPCHAT OVER THE TOPIC OF MY STUPID DAMN PRESCRIPTION. I am so embarrassed!!! This feels like self harm. Please how can I get out of this shame over? Or what is your perspective on this do they not care or maybe not judging me? I wish I stood my ground and had enough self esteem to not bring something like that up.",26Aug2020,1

338,"We are at a point where we need to give up our home and start fresh financially. We were on track after I lost my job of ten years, two years ago (primary breadwinner) and then Covid cost us both his job and my new one. He found new work but I have had to take care of kids so I have stayed home. I don’t have any family to ask advice from.

First the mortgage company’s only offer is a short sale, we cannot catch up on payments and realistically cannot see affording it in the near future. I am not sure what that is or how that will affect us if we want to buy in the future, is bankruptcy or foreclosure a better option?

Secondly we need to sell off large items such as furniture and lawn equipment, a large playground, how in the world do I know what to ask for such items without getting taken? I’m not trying to become a millionaire just need some cash to help start over.

We need to find a new place to live, we have some time (about 3 months) but for now I think we will have to rent (because of the short sale we can’t just get approved for a new purchase right?) and I’m not sure if anyone had a website or advice on locating a new rental home.

Lastly our beloved boxer. I don’t know what to do, I hate to just surrender him. I feel about worthless as it is but I have to house my children and I’m afraid they won’t take pets if we rent.

We are trying to be strong and look on this as just a new adventure. But maybe some advice from someone whose been there would help. I feel like I failed adulthood. Some days I wish I would pass away because then he could use the large insurance policy to save the house and lifestyle and they would be set. Ps...the policy has no cash value I checked.

And i told him so i could go to sleep watching youtube videos on my laptop and he said you can just watch youtube on my nintendo switch. I told him i didnt want to do that and i told him to go back to his dorm and he said let me put money in the atm real quick (on gta) then he goes to story mode and asks if i wanna watch youtube videos with him and i said whatever since i know hes not gonna leave regardless of what i say.

Then, around 10:30, I started thinking of all these things I could or should do. I wrote some of them down. But everything from working out to eating better/learning to cook sprung into my head, and I had that excited ambition that would have totally propelled me to go do these things. Except of course I work at 8am tomorrow and I needed to sleep.    

  

A few hours later and I'm still up and thinking about doing XY and Z. I even crossed one or two things off my list.   

Yet I know that when I wake up on Thursday, (My day off) I probably won't even do anything. I'll probably pitter around until noon, feel like I wasted my day, then sit around until late, maybe hang with my brother when he gets home from work, and then go to bed to get up on Friday.   

  

I've had this problem for years. First of all, I have trouble sleeping, but I'm not too worried about that, so much as I have no motivation for most of my day. (Honestly, most of my week I have no motivation, which is another problem.)

I was completely awake at the time and was really into this anime. But for some reason I just felt extremely tired and almost instantly fell asleep within a few minutes. I put up my armrest on my chair so I could put my head on it. I woke up and was still tired so I went in my bed and slept. I slept until ten, woke up and went back to bed.

347,"I've thought about making this post (different account) ever since i started using reddit. So tonight i decided to find a sub that can help me with what I'm currently dealing with. It would mean so much to me if anyone can be helpful in any way. 

For context, I've had this problem ever since I was about the age of 9, my parents had gotten a divorce around that time and I was easily adapted to having my parents deal with me in whatever way they could which was going back and fourth between their houses every weekend. Now later on my mom had been talking to who is now my stepdad, he's honestly a great guy and he respects us more than an average stepfather probably could, which is something that i'm grateful for years later. However when I was around the age previously mentioned, he would visit pretty often and it bothered me because I had no idea why a man I've never met would enter my home. I would talk to him and he would compliment my Skylanders as he walked in, so I sort of just liked him as a person, you know? What I never knew is that he was dating my mom, and I was being told that he was just her friend. Days later is when I tell my dad about him, and he seems shocked. I know it wasn't jealousy or anything bitter like that, he told me it was that it bothered him how my mom would go off and find another man before she can even settle the divorce and make sure everything with me and my 4 year old sister at the time. 
This is where the problems start to happen, I started to act up, also enraged at the fact that my mom was showing less affection and more attention to my stepdad, who wasn't living with us at the time. I began to hate him, as probably most clueless children would do. I couldn't control my feelings and before I knew it this resulted in being hit every day, it was just your typical hit with the belt, but these punishments weren't teaching me anything, i just felt pain. This might sound a bit dumb but it wasn't the fact that i was hit which bothered me, it was the psychological effects that came with it. When i was at school, I was just an ordinary child, being happy, playing, talking to other kids. This changed when i would come home to my mom's house after being dropped off by my dad. Because all i could think of was another argument, another moment where i felt lonely and vulnerable, I was weak. I though that if I truly tried to tell her how I feel about there being a stranger in my home, I would get yelled at and punished again. And every time I tried to explain what was going on with me, it happened again and again. 
Fast forward a couple of years, now my mom takes me for some ungrateful, disrespectful brat. and of course since she never explained to me what the situation was, I had to keep believing that, but deep inside me there was always some aggression towards her, something that made me want to get away from her. We don't get along because of the constant arguments, the anger that I feel, the emotions that I bottled up since childhood because I had nobody to speak to, since talking to my dad about things resulted in my sister, who didn't know any better, telling everything I said. Sometimes when I would be dropped off at home, I felt miserable. It felt as if every time I see my mother's face, i'm vulnerable again. I always tried hard to be a man, a strong person, one who ignores it and moves on. That was a mistake. 
Around the time I was in middle school I went through a time where everything felt ""gray"" if you guys can kind of understand, I once again didn't know how to talk about my feelings, or tell my mom how I wish i wasn't so upset all the time, how it just comes to me because I have no form of defending myself when all these words are being thrown at me. Every time i was sad, my mom wouldn't ask what was wrong, if I was okay, if anything is bothering me. she just says ""fix that fucking face"" it truly angers me, because she questions why I don't trust her, or speak to her about my problems. Vecause i've told her the way she treats me, the same way we've argued since i was a child, has done me a lot of damage. It brought me to a point where I just thought what if i just ended my own life, you know the typical ""who would care"" scenario, thankfully I had friends back then who cared, I was always that funny kid who would make others laugh just to come home upset, or crying. 
I really don't mean to be hostile towards her, but sometimes i feel as if my childhood memories are blocked by those times that I felt defenseless against the way I was yelled at, hit, and punished for not understanding this new chapter in our lives. My stepdad even tried to help explain things, but he wasn't really experienced in parenting so even when he tried his best, the situation would remain the same. 
About a year and a half ago, it was the same things over and over again, the shouting, the self explanation which was actually ""talking back"" although I was really just trying to explain how I constantly don't feel good, (I was picky as a child and this resulted in me being malnourished) and it put a lot of pressure on me, because every time I hear shouts, I have flashbacks of those times, where once again I was weak, and misunderstood by my own mother. It put so much pressure on me that I told her ""what if i just killed myself"" and once again, not your average response, instead of wondering why I wanted to literally commit suicide, she yelled at me in my face, and said ""only cowards kill themselves! God punishes them for that."" which only made my problems worse. Every time I've tried to open up, she downplays my issues, saying things like ""you're only ___ age"" or ""you're too young to be feeling this way"" It really sucks, she thought of taking me to a therapist but I know she'll use that against me when I do something wrong like maybe get a low score on a school assignment, i'm not the best student and sometimes it's one of the things that makes her upset. I try but i'm easily overwhelmed, and even then I know that when i mess up, any amount she pays for therapy is going against me in another argument. I've thought maybe I have problems, because there's days where I just show a lotnof affection for her and there's days where seeing her makes me overthink and get lightheaded, or sometimes i'm nice and other times I feel this rage build in me, it's almost like all the emotions I've had bottled up suddenly want to release, but I hold myself together because she's my mother. Bottling these emotions has a negative turn on me, because I start to feel really bad things, I feel upset, mad at myself, I start to remember how long this has been going on for now. It makes me feel worthless, what if i'm the bad person, maybe I'm the reason why me and my mother can't get along with each other. What if the reason why there's this cycle of negativity is because I started it. I don't know what's wrong with me or why sometimes I just want to lash out and scream at the top of my lungs and cry. It makes me feel weak. As manly as I try to be, this truly breaks me, makes me feel guilty and sort of hate myself, I don't know what to do or what is wrong with me. But I want this to end so that I can be the great son I don't seem like I ever was, for me and for her sake. I just want to be happy.",26Aug2020,1

&amp;#x200B;

A little backstory, my parents are divorced and have been since I was about six and I don't remember any of their relationship. My dad and I have always had a tumultuous relationship, he's pretty verbally abusive and manipulative towards me. We only recently started talking again after three months because I called my younger sister's tablets and they didn't answer so I figured that they must've been with him, so I called him and asked to talk to them only to find out he left them home alone again. To go over his girlfriend's house. I asked him to stop leaving them there alone (My sisters are pretty young and once he came home after leaving them there and they were just running around the neighborhood) and he started to yell at me, to which I said bye and hung up the phone. He then called me back and SCREAMED at the top of his lungs at me. 

(Me- 20, Sister 1- 9, Sister 2- 7, Sister 3- 5)

Anyway, so I finally started talking to him again because my grandmother asked me to and the same day we started talking again he offered to give me a ride home then took me to his girlfriend's house to meet her. It was pretty awkward tbh. A little after that he called to tell me they were getting married. They've only been dating three months. Then when I moved back to college he called again and kept asking if I was happy about it. I admit I was a little hurt since he didn't bother to even ask me anything about school. 

( My dad isn't really what you call a ""good"" parent. He would yell at me for really small things, such as looking out of the window of the car or having a panic attack. He currently has a one-bedroom apartment even though my three sisters live with him and he has the only bedroom, leaving them to sleep on the couch, and up until this year, he didn't even have a couch so they had to sleep on the floor. My sisters have to dress themselves or eachother, which results in them wearing clothes that don't fit or are dirty, and I'm pretty sure they've never been to a dentist. All this summer when I would let them come over my house their hair would be so matted I'd have to cut it. )

I guess I just don't know what to do. I don't want to go to the wedding next year and a few of my family members have told me I don't have to go but I've been thinking about just going because I don't want to deal with all the drama that it would cause. I'm scared that he wouldn't let me see my sisters anymore, which would be devastating, and my devastation is exactly why I think he'd do that.

355,"I had some boring experiences and one REALLY bad one (as in traumatic). This guy was basically evil scum; there’s no other way to describe him. 

Anyway, he’s gone (fortunately), I haven’t seen/spoken to him in years, and I have gotten therapy.

However, now when I try to do online dating again (after a hiatus), I just have zero desire because of this experience I had with this guy I met thru this platform. He doesn’t represent all guys, but my body and mind just aren’t drawn to this anymore because I associate it with him. 

I don’t want to feel this way; I don’t want this experience to ruin dating for me. I want to go on the app and have a positive experience. But when I match with someone, my brain just says “What if he’s awful, like X?”

356,"TW: Brief mentions of suicide threats

I have been friends with this person (26F) for up to nearly 5 years by now. We met online and we lived in different countries, but I consider a very close and important friend to me.

However, she is also severely depressed and frequently engages in self destructive behaviours such as pulling continuous all nighters and drinking too much alcohol.

I love her very much and want nothing more than to see her love herself more but I am constantly drained and tired at seeing her act that way, at seeing her disregard her health and wellbeing and continuously refuse to seek help. (Although the help available is admittedly limited)

There is not much I can do, being merely an online friend, but I am feeling very frustrated about it recently. Especially after she mentioned wanting to 'end herself' more than once over the past couple of months.

And seeing her in such a state is making me regress and become depressed again after I've managed to semi-pull myself out of depression. The fear and anxiety of wondering if she would actually do as she said is terrifying, and there is nothing much I can do about it.

She has probably read all the 'advice' anyone can give her, and has deemed all of them useless. She is stubborn against change, and trying to show concern to her would risk alienating her further and I am already out of ideas.",26Aug2020,1

We have a lot of things in common and he's really cute. Things were smooth but rn, I feel like he's slowly losing his interest. He doesn't message me first anymore and his replies are always late. But there are times when we do nothing and just talk to each other. Sometimes he talks about me meeting his family and his friends. Idk what to do bc I think I like him. Do I need to let him go now?

358," Backstory: I recently got my provisional license and I was driving around, getting used to being able to drive by myself and I was doing everything correct, but according to the officer who pulled me over I was ""speeding"". I was doing 60 in a 65 -\_-. He said he caught me on radar and questioned me and questioned me. He then asked if he could search the vehicle because he smelled a strong odor of marijuana. (I'm a 17 year old white male, who has never done any drugs in my life apart from ones I have been prescribed for back pain from a high school football related surgery). I told them, very clearly, ""no, I do not give consent to search the vehicle"". The officer walked off, sat in his car for a little bit (probably grabbing the pipe he was going to plant). He then walked up after about 20 minutes and told me to step out of the car and place my hands behind my back. I did as told, and was promptly placed in the back of his squad car. Not once did he tell me why he pulled me out of the car, even when asked multiple times. He told me there was a K-9 unit on the way and told me to tell him if there was anything in the car he should be concerned about. I told him there was nothing at all and if there is, it's not mine as I bought the car a couple days ago.

10 minutes pass and the K-9 shows up, and the officer ran the dog around the car and ""alerted"". I have no prior knowledge of what an alert looks like, or anything. I was also in the back of the police car so I wouldn't have been able to see even if I knew what the alert looks like. They told me that they were searching the car and ""found"" a meth pipe. Again, I have never done any drugs or anything like that. I'm super religious and so is my family and I would most likely be disowned if I did something like that.  

After a couple minutes of arguing and yelling at the police officer, they tell me the car is getting towed, license is getting revoked, they're calling my parents (who of course, don't believe them) and I'm getting put on house arrest until further notice. (I live in a town where Covid-19 hit our prisons and such very hard, so most people that get arrested either get put on house arrest, or sent to another prison in another place depending on the crime). I get put on house arrest until further notice, and that's where I am at now. My parents are on my side, and say they'll do everything they can to try and get me out of this situation.

Any suggestions on what to do, or what to say to the judge on my court date?

364,"Tldr: my girlfriend is going to date others while I'm on my mission for 2 years without complaint from me. But I can't help but feel depressed and be controlled by feelings that are unfounded but terrible to me. How can I cope.

So my girlfriend of nearly two years and I had a bit of a rough time a bit ago, she just kept getting upset and would randomly become distant. We resolved this when I finally got her to tell me what was going on by asking her what I felt was happening, if she was losing feelings for me. She said she was because she felt trapped, backstory here she had only been in one other on/off relationship that spanned three years and was terrible and not really ever gone on dates with people. She said she felt trapped because of this and because how we talked about getting married sometimes (maybe a bit too often my fault) and that she hadn't experienced so much and wants to be sure and feel secure that our relationship is right. She says she feels like I am her soulmate and I feel like she is mine, we honestly do have a very strong and strange but perfect connection IMO, I can't imagine being with anyone else ever. So more backstory, I'm planning on going on a church mission that would last 2 years I told her it's okay if she dates while I'm gone and she told me she wouldn't I insisted that she would feel otherwise and we basically left it with her saying she would just wait. She felt trapped due to this and I told her it's okay for her to date, and the resolution was bittersweet because although basically nothing had changed in terms of future plans I realized so much that I was ignoring. I would have to let her go and most likely never be with her again. I will not break up with her before I leave and will not treat her different. We are back to normal and happy but I can't help but get depressed occasionally thinking about how I will probably lose her. I know if we don't end up together it wasn't meant to be but obviously I don't want it to be that way. I'm scared for the future and I feel like she's just waiting on me to leave to continue her life. I feel like she doesn't think I'm the one for her and that I'm just another guy. These feelings are completely unfounded by her actions or attitudes but they're relentless. I want her to date because I do believe it will be good for her and her happiness and security in feeling like she's explored her options but I can't help but imagine her being with other guys and being happier with other guys. I don't know how to cope maybe it'll get better over time maybe it won't but I get so depressed and forlorn.

366,"Lately I've been giving a lot of thought to this. 

I am well aware that my shy/reserved demeanor makes me seem unapproachable + I genuinely don't make much of an effort to initiate contact with strangers. This I plan to change. However, difficulty *making* friends is not what I'm concerned about. 

Here's the thing- I rarely find another person's company stimulating. The same seems to apply vice versa. I get that my interests are widely considered geeky, but I am a genuinely curious person and don't restrict myself/my conversations to what I prefer to spend time doing. But I still seem to have to constantly have to talk about things that I don't consider worth of anyone's time in order to maintain some sort of a social life. I try really hard regardless, only to end up feeling drained.

The most recent friend I've made is from university. I bring her up because she seems to have a rather rich social life, and not just according to my standards. She is very kind, bubbly, funny and smart. She is also rather domineering, attention-seeking and emotionally reactive. What bothers me the most is that she has no interests outside of what she is obliged to do. We spend most of our time together picking apart her boyfriends texts, commenting mutual acquaintances or trying to soothe her endlessly fluctuating emotions. 

I've recently told her that she tends to overwhelm me, which led to her being more honest about some of the things that bother her about me. Although I do appreciate the feedback, I'm genuinely confused as to why she would choose to point out *those* things. I am pretty flawed, but I've worked hard at developing the traits she addressed and consider them to be virtues.

For instance, when her boyfriend broke up with her out of the blue, the kind of support I offered her was trying to make sense out of the situation / what was going through his head. She then said that what she needed was more along the lines of what her other friend had given her- the chance to shit-talk about the guy she was hopelessly in love with until the day before. This friend advised her to confront him by calling him out as a pussy, dickhead, bastard etc. I shared my opinion on the matter and told her that that sort of talk is beneath her and that there are ways to address his actions without intentionally causing harm to someone she once loved. She agreed but I could tell that she was annoyed. 

Another thing that bothered her was my decision not to cheat on tests during quarantine, which where being held online with no surveillance whatsoever. She called me 'insane'. 

Yesterday I called her out for making fun of my guy-friend for possibly having autism. *She* was obviously offended somehow.

People have called me out in the past for being a 'smartass' when I try to offer insight about something I'm well-informed about. I've also been called 'stuck-up' for not wanting to go along with what everyone else was doing because I considered it to be wrong. I'm a 'nerd' because I'm madly in love with the subject I choose to study at university. I'm 'condescending' for avoiding parties. I'm a 'weirdo' for often being quiet and liking my alone-time. 

**What the hell is going on?** Why do my values seem to misalign with everyone else's? Why is high-school apparently never ending? Am I wrong for not seeing the traits pointed out to me as flaws? Even if they are flaws, are they really that big of a deal?

Any insight would be greatly appreciated. Sorry for the long post.",26Aug2020,1

370,"It sounds overly specific, but I have this fear of white women bosses. It started when I was 16 and got my first job. My boss SEEMED like a nice person, but then she made a mistake, I said I was off Thursdays, confirmed this SEVERAL times, and never worked a Thursday before this, then I was scheduled for a holiday on Thursday, I noticed this and informed my boss via letter because I didn't know if I'd see her before that, or if I'd even remember, it was right when the schedule came out, so it wasn't last minute. 

I'm quite blunt, not rude, demanding or vulgar, but blunt. I simply stated that we agreed my days off would be Thursdays and that I couldn't work because I was owed my day off that we agreed upon. I'd like to make it clear I NEVER was told that there would be exceptions to my days off, nor was I told about being scheduled prior, no request, nothing, I figured that out on my own. Well, this pisses off my boss and I get called up to her office, she chews me out and claims I'm rude, but I was never rude, I simply stood up for myself and asked her to keep up her side if the agreement when she hired me on. Well, apparently that's gone on my record.

 Some people I talked to claimed that I was wrong. And I believed them. I believed that the manager knew best and that I OWED it to her to still work a day I had off. After a while I got out of that mindset and recognized that I wasn't being disrespectful, I simply didn't sugar coat it, just like how she didn't do for me, and that was the worst of what I'd done. 

Well, now I have another job, the person hiring me has curly hair, and a similar voice, as well as... Barely resembling my former manager, but it seems like that's enough and now I get anxious whenever she speaks, whenever I see her. I feel this inherent need to obey and be obedient and I fucking hate it. I feel like I'm 16 again and I feel powerless.

I had a black woman hire me and I didn't feel this sort of pressure and worry, so I think it's specifically older, white women that make me feel this way.

371,"My life(style) sucks. For my entire life, I’ve basically ate junk food, drank sodas, stayed in my room all day/night. Never exercised, never drank water, never ate vegetables;fruit, etc etc. essentially just very unhealthy and sedentary. I also have a terrible sleep schedule, most nights I go to bed at 4-5am and wake up at 1-2pm. And 2 years ago I started vaping. 

To just clear it up, my lifestyle has not made me obese. I am actually EXTREMELY skinny for the kind of food I eat and how much I eat (I’m 6 foot 3 and only weigh 125 pounds). So keep this in mind if you are going to give me advice on exercising.. I may have an easier time with it than you would’ve thought without that information.

But anyways, I want to change. I want to be normal. All of my friends live like me, but none of them have realized the long term effects that living like this has on your life. I’ve done a lot of research tonight, On the effects all of the habits I am in have on the human body.. it scares me. So I want to get it early, before I do irreversible damage to my body. 

First, I want to get on a better sleep schedule. I go to bed so late.. and wake up late. I wake up groggy and in a terrible mood most of the time.. i just don’t know how to do it. I’ve tried fixing it before, by waking up early one day and going the whole day without a nap.. then going to bed at 9-10 nearly about to pass out. But then I just wake up at 1-2 again because I sleep so heavy.. and the cycle starts over again. If anyone has advice on how to get my internal clock back to normal again.. I would love to be going to bed at like 9-10 and waking up at 5-6 in the morning.. that would be so amazing.

Next, my diet. This one is gonna be extremely difficult for me. I have a terrible diet.. a bit better lately as I have been substituting water for soda in most of my meals but I have failed time and time again to completely cut it out. I think with time though I will be able to do that. What I am worried about, is the meals. My diet not only consists of mainly fast food/junk food, but it is also the time of day that I eat that is a problem as well. Whereas most people are eating three meals a day, I’m usually eating ONE gigantic one around 6-7pm and that’s it.. this is another thing that I am just stumped on how to fix. I have to wake up sometimes for work at 7-8 in the morning and I am never hungry.. I don’t want to force feed myself and I don’t want to under-eat. If anyone knows a way to fix this, please tell me. There is also the diet itself. I am completely unsure of what constitutes a healthy diet, and if I need to completely cut out the foods I am used to eating or if I just need to minimize them and add better ones in with them. I like fruit but I never eat them, that would probably be a good one to start with. I hate vegetables with a passion, but I know I need them. And I think putting them in smoothies would help tremendously with how much my taste buds reject them. So if you have a good veggie smoothie recipe, drop it in please and also how much I should be having per day. 

Next is exercise, and in general just being extremely inactive and sedentary. I want to start exercising, but I’m unsure of which ones to do. Especially now that I have this newfound hernia in my stomach, I don’t want to be straining that so much so it doesn’t get bigger. I am stumped. Running is definitely one that I want to do, but I also don’t want my legs to be the only things getting any love. I know nothing about working out, so please leave me some exercises I can do to maintain a healthy amount without straining my hernia so much (it is right above my belly button).

Lastly is vaping. This is a stupid habit I picked up 2 years ago as a junior in high school. And this is probably the one that scares me the most. I’ve been reading online about nicotine withdrawal and it really terrifies me. And I’m unsure of whether or not I should just go cold turkey, or try to ease off of it. Of course easing off of it sounds better but I don’t know how much self control I will have when it comes to this. I just want to stop it though. I don’t want to vape anymore, I’m scared of what it could be doing to my heart and lungs and it all just freaks me out. 

Please give me advice on any of this stuff if you have experience with it or maybe a friend of yours did. I truly will take everyone’s advice and I’m going to change my ways one way or another. Thank you &lt;3",26Aug2020,1
372,"I have lived in the same apartment complex in California for the last few years. For the past year, I have been having issues with the drug addicted couple next door. Our entry doors were an inch apart and we were having issues with theft and harassment even after trying to befriend them and offering them food and help in times of need. 

Last month, I renewed my lease and moved to the other side of the complex to avoid any future issues. A few days ago, I arrived home from grocery shopping and found my old neighbor peering into my new apartment windows and circling our cars. My boyfriend (who is not on my lease) came outside to confront him. He pulled a gun on me while his gf harassed me and then he shot my boyfriend in the leg with his 45. 

My boyfriend survived and is healing but is left with a ton of hospital bills. The shooter was arrested and we are waiting on charges. My boyfriend is now out of work and does not have insurance. I am looking for advice on crime victim resources but they look scarce. 

I am also wondering if I would be protected in breaking my lease for safety reasons and fear of retaliation. The shooters family and the rest of the harassers involved in the shooting still live in the same complex where I am currently caring for my injured boyfriend. I am a road warrior for work so I have had to take time off to care for him. Long story short, I am scared and looking for options at this point. My boyfriend is currently living with me and we are hoping to move immediately but it doesn’t look good for us as we just spent everything on the deposit to move last month. Nothing was documented due to poor apt management, however, we have the police report/hospital documents to use for any tentant/law issues I expect from the apartments.

373,"Hi, I am 17 years old and I am currently working at my first job ever. Not gonna to be going into too many details. But I will say that this is all happening within a fast food workplace. One of my assistant managers who is 27 has been making me extremely uncomfortable for the past month. I can’t determine what to label this situation.

He hasn’t done anything sexually suggestive, but he has been really creepy and flirty in other ways. 

He talks to me way more compared to our other coworkers. 
He unnecessarily gets in my personal space whenever he can and asks non-work related questions. 
He tries to make eye contact with me all the time, and it’s gotten to the point to where I can’t even look at that side of the workspace anymore. 
He has texted me through our personal numbers and texts about non-work focused yet somewhat work related topics
He always places a hand on my shoulder and upper back whenever he approaches me from behind.
He once called me cute in response to me doing him a work favor. 
He always tries to be my “work hero” and never lets me do any task on my own, and he makes excuses for why he always wants to help me. 
He makes jokes and picks fun at me all the time and is never professional with me (not even to fast food standard). 
Whenever I’m not as happy as I normally am around him (WHICH HE IS THE REASON), he asks me why I’m always mad or why I never smile.

This has been happening in a constant cycle every single shift we have together. I don’t know what to do about it and I hate that I have to go through this.

im gunna try to keep this as short as possible so bear with me. i met my girlfriend a little over a year ago. we met at the dog park and instantly connected spending the next 6 hours at the dog park together talking like it was nothing. it was great. but fast forward a year later and our relationship is being destroyed by trust issues. ill start from the very beginning

i had this friend already who happened to be a girl but was nothing more than a friend who ill just refer to as friend and me and friend planned to go to the lake one day to bring our dogs to the dog park. this is a few days after meeting GF so were were talking but not like set any boundaries or hung out much at all at this point i mean its been a few fucking days lol. GF finds out i went to the lake with another girl and basically never wants to talk to me again. i eventually talk her down and actually lied to her and told her friend already had a boyfriend anyways so she had nothing to worry about. confessed said lie and GF wanted to never talk to me again, again. eventually obviously worked through that but relationship off to a bad start and i suppose that was the first thing that started her trust issues towards me which i understand i lied but also thought it was pretty crazy of her to be mad at me for going to the lake with someone else after only knowing her not even a week

throughout our relationship, GF has accused me left and right of looking at and checking out other girls. she's broken up with me on the spot countless times of false accusations. however, there has been 2 times where i actually was doing so and she caught me red handed. both times basically broke up with me but obviously worked it out. this was a very long time ago and have made sure to make sure she knows im not doing that but i still get accused left and right and treated poorly about accusations that aren't even true

there was a youtube video i watched a really long time ago toward the very beginning of our relationship of bradley martyn (fitness youtube) where this couple was in his video doing a workout and i had mentioned something about it to her and she (surprisingly to me because i didn't see anything wrong with me watching this) had a huge problem with me watching that since there was another girl in it and she took it upon herself to go through my youtube history after that finding another video of his where the title was ""how to pick up girls at the gym"" which no, i didn't watch that to learn how to pick up girls at the gym i had her and was very happy with her and would never cheat on her or want to cheat, i just have seen his videos like that in the past and enjoyed them so i watched that one too. she was beyond not okay with this and i forget what actually happened but that also led to a downward spiral of trust issues making her want my passwords and stuff

there was another video on the nelk boys personal website where it was a prank video where a naked girl answers the door to a pizza delivery guy and they get the reaction. it sounds dumb thinking back to it but she was fully censored and i didn't just go to their website to find that video. i watched a bunch of their videos and that happened to be in the line up. she somehow stumbled across this in my history while i was sleeping and i basically woke up to her confronting me about the video and how i cheated on her by watching that and she breaks up with me walking out of my house saying to my dad ""your son likes to watch other naked women"". that one lost trust obviously

so we've obviously had a few break ups (a lot and its bad) and sometimes during those break ups id get on dating apps and this alone caused alot of trust issues cause she says stuff like ""how do i know youre not on dating apps since you always get on them when we break up"" or ""every time we break up you go look at half naked girls"" etc.. but the main thing is that during one of our break ups i was very skeptical about getting back with her because if you knew all the shit i dealt with and all the red flags you'd be skeptical too. so we started talking again and during the time we started talking again i was still talking to girls on the dating apps. it was like that for maybe a day or so and then when i thought it was clear me and GF were actually getting back together i stopped the dating apps. well once GF basically went through ALL of my shit cause she knew my passwords, she found out this info and claims i cheated on her and broke up with me again (she found out months later or whatever) and thats a huge factor in the trust issues

she has trust issues because ive watched porn before during breakups. she doesnt let me have any social media besides facebook. she doesnt trust me to go anywhere in public without her because she thinks im just gunna check out other girls. she literally says i go places just to check them out. one time i went to the mall specifically to buy her a gift and when she found out i was at the mall she flipped out and she knew i was there to get her something because i told her and she still flipped out and was ready to like ignore me and not let me come see her and all that. she has slapped me before for looking at a scene on tv where this girl was on a boat in a sun dress. anything with girls in it she doesnt trust me and i just cant figure out whether i deserve this or not.

the biggest example of how she handles these trust issues was a recent event where i went to help my dad and his female work partner move some furniture. i told GF i was going to help and she instantly had a problem with it and said i either couldn't go or had to bring her. i later told her i wouldnt be bringing her along and that she had nothing to worry about. she didn't fight me on it miraculously but once i was there she was asking lots of questions and stressing me the fuck out. she asked me to send a picture of everyones feet so she could see if i was looking at her and to send a video to make sure i couldnt see her. i expressed my problems to her trying to get me to do all this and then she literally starts spamming me with video calls so she can see and just being crazy. she's telling me how its my fault this is happening since ive put these trust issues on her and how since i did that i need to build it back like this. it ended in me hanging up on her and then her calling back while i was in the car with my brother and friend headed from the uhaul place to the place where we were getting the furniture and her saying like fuck you and so i said it back and then she broke up with me ignored me for basically 3 days and treated me like shit afterwards putting everything on me like i caused this cause of the trust issues

theres a hell of a lot more craziness but i don't want to keep going. do i deserve these trust issues and the way she handles it or is this overboard? i know some of the things i probably shouldnt have done or could've done a lot better, but i really feel im being mistreated.

&amp;#x200B;

tldr: girlfriend treats me poorly over insecurities and trust issues that i don't think i deserve",26Aug2020,1
376,"Alright, I haven’t done anything like this before but here goes nothing. This will probably be quite long and I apologise in advance. 

I’ve been friends with someone for over a year now, and honestly things were pretty amazing until a few months ago. We were so close. They are studying, while I currently am just working, and I fully understand that they have less free time to talk in general because of this. My friend also suffers from several mental illnesses, and again, I am fully aware that this means they’re less emotionally available at times and have made it clear that I will do whatever they need me to in order to better support them.       

However, in the last few months, this person has almost completely stopped texting me before I do so first. I send a message checking in almost every day, and often get left on read. I honestly can’t recall the last time they asked me how I was, or even texted me first. Whenever I do talk to them, I often get a ‘blast’ of everything that’s going on in their life (which of course, I am happy to hear - I care about them!) but rarely get asked how I’m doing. They have a lot of things going on in their life which I really want to support them through, but if I try to ask how they’re doing I usually get an “it’s fine, I’m fine” - only to see them crying in front of their 500 Snapchat followers literally minutes later.       

Despite my many attempts to meet up or even call after the lockdown has ended in my country, they’ve declined each one, usually saying they’re not up to it or are too tired. This is, of course, completely valid and I fully respect their need to just relax especially considering their mental health issues. However, on multiple occasions, just hours after I’ve been declined from meeting up, I’ll see some kind of post about a ‘spontaneous lunch’ or whatever with another friend and how much they appreciate them.    

Additionally, they’ve largely stopped telling me important things that I’d expect them to. For example, when their favourite pet passed away recently (whom I was also quite close to), I found out vía a Snapchat story a day later. They later sent me a message saying how upset they were about his passing, and before I could respond I got a “sorry, didn’t mean that for you”.     

I’m quite confident my friend is not intending to hurt me in any way, but in all honesty I feel awful and so upset. It feels like they just don’t care and only talk to me when they need me, and I’m putting in all the work. I feel horrible about writing this, like I’m betraying them or something, but I just need to know - am I being dramatic or selfish? What should I do? I genuinely just want to feel cared about and appreciated to any extent and really any advice would be so appreciated.",26Aug2020,1

382,"So I live with two roommates and they're brothers. I've known them both for a very long time and I've lived with one (lets call him James) for almost 8 years. James and I get along great but a year and a half ago we invited James' younger brother(call him Dan) to live with us. We knew Dan had mental health issues, we all do. We came from some really rough homes, but we figured that since he had been able to hold down a job for about a year that it be good for him to break away from his toxic living situation since he was already in his mid 20's. So we all pitched for a new apartment. Things were going great for the first 3 months but then Dan stopped being able to hold down a job. We found out that he was spending all his money on girls over the internet and throwing himself into relationships with women he hardly knew. He started avoiding us completely. Finally after coaxing him back out of his shell James got him a new job and all was well again. 
Then Dan got dumped and turned suicidal. The cops had to be involved and he had to spend two weeks in the mental health ward where it was discovered that his obsessive personality had turned him into essentially a relationship addict and everytime one of those relationships ended, he because suicidal and self destructive. He was told in the hospital to stay away from girls for a bit, yet he met another one inside and that ended badly when they were both released. This led to his second suicide attempt where he ended up back inside. Despite everything him and us have told the doctors, they still just slap him with a prescription for depression and anxiety and send him on his way when they feel like hes gotten ""better"" 
But hes not better. Day in and day out he obsessively plays the same video game, getting so angry at it he hurts himself. He's still screwing around with girls and practically avoiding us. All of this we could put up with during lockdown because everyone in Canada was getting CERB cheques. But now that that is ending hes going to be without a job/money again and we cant afford to take care of him. James is the middle of training for a new job and once he has it there is still no way we can cover the whole rent if Dan isnt working. 
He recently did something that really concerns me. He took a shaver to his head and chopped chunks of his hair off. He completely messed it up and asked James if he thinks it would ""keep the pedophiles away"" this is alarming because he seemed to have a paranoid obsession about pedophiles in the past. They creep him out, but hes almost 30 so he shouldnt have any rational fear that they will come after him. I'm worried about these delusions. One of his brothers has schizophrenia and psychosis and other serious mental health issues run in the family. 
Before covid he was at least going to group therapy but everytime we've tried to get him a psychiatrist he ends up falling through the cracks. We've tried to convince doctors that he needs to be on disability and his welfare case worker gave him the forms but the doctors wont take him seriously enough to fill them out. We just dont know what to do right now. Like most people, we're in a bad place because of covid and we cant just move or kick him out. Any advice would be great. Maybe there's a specific hotline or phone number I can call? Im in Ontario Canada and any resources would be great.",26Aug2020,1

385,"I know it sounds crazy and that all fantasies, as long as they are consensual and legal, are fine. But it’s starting to bother me because I’m afraid of what it might mean for my relationship.

For some background knowledge, I haven’t seen my boyfriend since January. I’m from the states and he’s from an EU country. We were both studying at a European university for undergrad together. While our university experience got cut a semester short because of COVID, we also haven’t been able to visit each other due to the border situation. It is in full agreement that we’re just gonna ride this out and it is not going to cause a breakup. I am very happy, secure, and in love with him. When our relationship was not virtual, we had a really healthy sex life. It was the perfect range from loving to BDSM for both our tastes. There’s a huge level of comfort and connection between us and we’ve been able to openly discuss our fantasies and likes. 

Obviously for the past 8 months we’ve just been masturbating (we’re monogamous but even if we weren’t, theres a pandemic) we’ll do cam stuff, pics, descriptive sexting. I don’t think he’s watching porn outside of me because he’s always hated it and said porn isn’t for him. I think he ultimately needs an emotional connection to enjoy sexual content of any sort. Even if he did watch porn or use anything else to jack off, it wouldn’t bother me. He knows he could tell me something like that. I, on the other hand, am growing in the intensity of the content I need by the week. The “normal” and “loving” stuff doesn’t even do it for me anymore. I’m not able to finish if him and I are camming. I just go until he’s done and find porn or Reddit posts afterwards. I’ve started seeking really “abusive” types of porn. I know this is normal, and is pretty reflective of what I enjoy in bed too. I think my issue is that it’s the only thing that’s working to get me off. Something just feels wrong about that. I also am getting off to just some of the most bizarre fantasies in various subreddits that would just bring me shame to even mention (I ensure that nothing is illegal). I have never felt any type of sex or masturbation related shame before. So this has just been hard on me. I think it’s a mixture of everything. I think I hate having sexual thoughts that don’t include him, I think I hate how far into this realm of porn I’ve gotten, I think I hate how sterile and objectifying it all feels. I don’t really know how to get off these trends. For the first time I feel like I can’t tell my boyfriend something. I don’t like that either. I’m willing to take any type of advice. I think I just need some tips on getting connected to what sex means to me again.",26Aug2020,1
386,So this is my first real relationship and we have been going strong for about 6 months. I am 18 and he is 20 almost 21. He goes to college 3 hours away and he just left a few days ago. At the beginning of our relationship he had just moved back home due to COVID and that is how we became what we are now. At one point he had to go and pick up his things from his dorm because they decided to shut his school down. His friend who is a female also had to go and get her things so she stayed the night at my boyfriends house two nights in a row. I didn’t feel comfortable with it and she was very disrespectful towards me. Our relationship began to blossom and we fell in love and I told him how I didn’t feel comfortable with her and he told me she used to like him and confessed her feelings for him. Now that he is back in college and we are long distance they spend quite a bit of time together and I’m not sure how to feel about it. She is in his dorm late at night although he has a roommate who is also very close with the both of them it still rubs me the wrong way. I’m kind of thinking I should tell him that it’s me or her but I don’t want to put him in that predicament because it’s hard. But he seems suspicious about her. Avoids conversations about her and tries to hide the fact that he spends so much time with her. It really bothers me and I am not sure what to do. I don’t really want to sit in this feeling for a long time though and I’m not sure how to shake the bad vibe. Do I tell him if he wants to keep spending time with her he doesn’t need to call me anymore or is there another way?,26Aug2020,1
387,"TW: Child sexual abuse

If you’re gonna tell me “just go to the police,” please don’t bother. The police have failed me my entire life in this regard. And it’s not like I have evidence of sexual abuse that occurred many years ago. As nice as it would be, I know that the chances of getting him put in jail are one in a billion. 

He hurt me from when I was 11-15. I didn’t tell anyone because I was horrified of him and I didn’t have parents or anyone else who would give a fuck. 

But he just got married. From my social media lurking, she seems so damn sweet and like such a great person. A great person who doesn’t deserve to be married to a monster. If I were her, I’d want to know what kind of man I truly married. 

I don’t have “proof” but there is so much I could say to prove it. I know all of his intimate birth marks, as well as what everything.. down there... is like. Things I couldn’t possibly know without him having hurt me. I feel so sorry for her. He’s incredibly manipulative and she probably has no idea of any of the horrible things he’s done. I know it’s not my marriage. 

I’m not looking for revenge. I’m not looking to have him thrown in jail years later. It just destroys me knowing that this woman doesn’t know the man she married. No one deserves that. I know she’ll probably be in denial and not listen but.. she deserves a chance at the truth. I would’ve killed to know what kind of person he was before getting anywhere near him.",26Aug2020,1

Background:
We have been best friends since we were six years old and we go to different colleges in the same state. I have struggled to make friends and be social while she has found a good group of friends through a club that she now has a leadership position in. 

The situation:
I try to be mindful and I’ll only text her once a week maybe since I know she is very busy and has her own obligations for school. My concern is that she often can take over 24 hours to respond, but when she does the conversation fizzles out quickly most of the time. I want to continue to catch up with each other and have some sort of connection but it’s hard when she doesn’t engage when I try to. The times when we can catch up over FaceTime are great and I value them a lot since texting doesn’t work to have a full conversation with her.

But before I logged on, I knew something was off. He has never posted me on social media ever. So long story short, I had this insecurity that he would be talking to other girls.

This past weekend, he finally decides to post me on his story, so I log on to see who he blocked from seeing his story, and there was this girl he blocked.

401,"Hey guys, I’m 21 (F), you can call me Grace for naming purposes. Lately, I’ve changed my home because of my abusive step-brother and had to leave my mother to come live with my aunt who has stage-4 cancer right now. We used to be so close with her and always dreamed about living together, but ever since I came, she’s been ranting and causing fights about everything. 

For example, when I first came here, I was still dealing with the trauma, I still am but I’m getting better. I was distracted, my head was full so sometimes I didn’t hear what other people said so i asked them to repeat kindly. I barely had any B12 vitamins in me so I forgot occasionally, she had to repeat herself but 2-3 times max.

Then the fights began. She started to pile everything up inside of her and then started to let it out all at once. It’s been around 2 months now and yesterday we had another fight but it was just because i interviened as she was speaking and she shouted at me for around 4 hours, calling me words and telling me how I do not love her, respect or things like that. 

What’s worse is that I love her with all my heart, I’m here to help her too, not just to get away from an abusive household. I don’t do anything that I do deliberately in no shape or form. I love her. I really do. She keeps piling things inside and then lets herself explode at me. When I was gone, it was my aunt. She never lived with anyone else before and doesn’t have a kid herself.

I feel horrible because I don’t want to fight, which I don’t. I keep my voice low and if I defend myself she starts hitting herself. I just want to be okay but my conscious is not at ease since whenever something happens (even if I just misplace something) she says “You’re the one who’s going to kill me, not the cancer” or like “You just took 3 months off of my life” or even “I’m going to die you know that right?” 

I know all of that and just, I don’t do anything deliberately. I just make mistakes and I’m too afraid to do them. Every night after she sleeps, or before I go to bed I check everything 2-3 times to make sure everything is done and in place. But even if they are, she finds new things to shout at me about. 2 days ago it was when we are ordering grocery online and the site wouldn’t work so I got frustrated and she took it upon herself and again, called me out.

I’m just wondering if this is my fault or am I doing something wrong? I know she’s depressed and has no patience but I’m really struggling to find a middle ground. Can you help me on what to do?",26Aug2020,1

Immediately one pair was completely faulty, not working at all so emailed the company and got replacement, same day realised other two have some issues as well, working but not fully as advertised so request replacement for those as well. I provided video recordings that company asked for and they said to fill that warranty paper that I wish to replace them (paper had 2 options, on left to replace on right side to request a refund) I immediately got a feeling that they'll try to pull something off. But anyway listening to my mother I filled the replacement bit. They said they currier will come by tomorrow to pick the paper and those 2 pairs of headphones. It's been 3 weeks since they said that and haven't received phone call nor email from them.

Like now, every time I think about being 15, it makes me feel weird because the only thing I can remember of it is the thing I regret doing and that's pretty much it, I can't remember anything else even while trying and thinking about 15 me makes me feel kind of bad. Like a ""distant bad memories"" type of feeling. It almost makes me feel icky. I've had a lot of different ages where I did dumb stuff, like when I was 12 I was a idiot and embarrassing but I don't tie it up that much to bad memories. 
Whenever people talk about when they were 15 I don't want to say anything because I would only have negative things about it. I'm trying to come at peace with myself and this period of my life, but it's hard. In a way, turning 16 made me feel ""washed off every things i did"", and I don't like thinking about the ""before 16"". I wouldn't say it was a traumatic event, it's not like I have PTSD or anything, but it was bad enough in my eyes to make me feel disgusted of myself.


When a bad event happens, bad enough for you to keep remembering it, how do you manage to try to find good memories of this period of your life without thinking about that one bad event? 
I try to look back at stuff I did when I was 15, drawings, pictures etc and it's fun to look at again and then I just go like ""ha, I'm glad i grew up a bit since then"" but then my mind thinks again of this thing I did.
How can I ""shutdown"" this part of my brain to try to forget about this event? Do I have to try to be at peace with myself, or will it just fade away with age?",26Aug2020,1

408,"So a little over a month ago, I got hired at a local daycare. It's fancy and pretty expensive. They like to call it a ""school,"" never a daycare.
My first 2 weeks were absolutely useless. I didn't learn anything and was just cleaning up after the kids in my classroom. I'm in the toddler classroom. Finally, the previous teacher came out of quarantine and really helped me with everything. I learned a lot from her, not everything, but a lot. She was an angel compared to the teacher that stood in for her.
Well, she turned in her 2 weeks. And then yesterday, a few days into those 2 weeks, she called saying she wasn't coming back. It was a long day of overwhelming stress for myself and the other teachers. (It's 2 teachers per class).

Well, when I got there for my clock in, I was brought into the office where my two bosses chewed me out. They said I was negative and they talked terribly of the teacher that quit and told me I was corrupted by her and that they don't want that negativity and anger  in the building. They said they've heard ""chatter"" about me being lazy and ""complacent"" and that all I do is ""mope around"" all day.
This is so not true! And the other teachers support me! They've been in the classroom with me and see what I do with the kids. The bosses Never come in except to fuss us for every little thing, most of which we can't control.
It broke my heart to be considered so negatively. The way they were talking to me, I thought I was going to be fired and sent home. The only thing that calmed me was knowing that with 2 teachers out sick and with my co teach now gone, they were even more desperate for staff than before. We've been understaffed since before I got hired.

I'm not an education major. I didn't graduate in childcare. I have a degree in psychology. And I honestly didn't think they'd hire me when I left my interview. But they did. And I was so happy to finally have a job again! (I graduated and moved states in the middle of the pandemic.)
I feel unwanted and that I'm not doing anything right. I absolutely ADORE my toddlers and truly don't want to leave them. I also don't want to leave the other teachers in a bind after the chaos with the one quitting.
But I can't stand the toxicity of the management. I'm even backed up by teachers that have been there since this location was built!
I don't know what to do.
I have very high anxiety (and have meds for it) but I saw on the updated schedule that one of my bosses is going to be my co-teacher today. A whole day of her in my classroom... I'm terrified. I don't want to walk out and hurt the other teachers or my kids. But my mom says I should if they take out their stress on me again.


Help?

Toxic bosses took out their stress over my co-teacher quitting on me. Now I have to spend a whole day with one of them in my classroom. I don't want to leave my kids and don't want to leave the other teachers in a bind with me quitting, but I'm worried they hired me only because they had no other options and that they don't like me at all.
I have the other teachers' support and testimony that I work hard and care for the kids. But the bosses seem to only be keeping me because they're desperately understaffed. Help?",26Aug2020,1
409,"A couple weeks ago, I was setting alarms on my boyfriends phone to get up in the morning when I see that he’s texting a girl I don’t know. Out of curiosity, I opened the message. We’ve been dating for over a year and there’s never been anything to worry about, and I told myself that if he wanted peace of mind about my messages once in a blue moon, ofc he could just look at the texts and see it’s nothing/only anxiety. However, on this day, that was not the case for his phone. He was texting a girl about how cute they thought the other was, and even as intimidate of conversations about how and when they lost their virginities. My boyfriend topped their conversation off with “I wonder if we lost our virginities on the same day?” I keep scrolling. He asks when she turns 18. December is the answer. He says he’ll give her an edible on her birthday to celebrate. This is where I lose my mind. Not only is it someone else, but a minor??? Not only is she a minor, he met her from a college program where he was an RA/Orientation Leader, which is one of the only positions of power at a place like where he was at. We are both in our early twenties and in our Junior and Senior years of college. He swears nothing happened and that it was never going to go past this flirting, but I can’t get over any of it. We are still dating (posting this about a week after the event) and most of our close friends don’t know. The people that I have talked to have seemed so lost. This is out of character for him to step out of our relationship, and let alone creepy with someone so much younger than us. We are supposed to be moving in together this week (no lease required, but still out of state for me). But, I can’t get over the feeling that I have no idea who I’m dating. When I try to be more cheerful and talk to him about his life, what he does when I’m not around, etc, he always says we just saw each other and there’s not much. Is it me that’s asking too much? I just want to be able to make sense of this. I guess what I’m asking is, what would you do in this situation?",26Aug2020,1
410,"There’s a lot of details left out and I don’t know if this makes sense or is confusing cause it’s my first post. 

My dad has always been very harsh. When I was little I was degraded a lot and told I was ugly stupid and overweight very frequently. I thought that things got better when I was around 18. Since then things have gone back to that whenever I am physically around my parents and sometimes over the phone(We live across the country).

I logically know the way I was treated in my childhood was not okay and would encourage anyone who told me they were treated that way to set boundaries or cut ties. However, my oldest sister left the family for a while and spread lies about my parents. I think she needed space and didn’t know how to ask and felt that was the only way. Because of that I know that they will essentially kick me out of the family if I try to set firmer boundaries or take space as well as I will have to apologize and say that I lied if I ever want to come back. 

I have tried to set boundaries and just been told that they don’t want to spend time with me or be around me if I might later bring up something they’ve done that has upset me. I don’t like the way they treat me, my child or my husband and I don’t know what there else there is I can do. They won’t respect boundaries and won’t take responsibility when they should. I’m expecting my second child and don’t want to deal with them anymore because I’m stressed out because I’m very high risk. It feels so harsh and like I’d be an asshole but I would think anyone else in my shoes would be justified. I really don’t know what to do or how to do anything. I just feel stuck in this crappy situation or like if I leave I’ll be ruining relationships for my child.

411,"Hi reddit ,
I'm currently taking a coding bootcamp remotely and had to take out a loan for 15k and put my life on hold for 4 months to attend this course . I attended 4 weeks of my first cohort and decided to transfer to a different cohort (free of charge) due to the teachers teaching style not being fit for me and being to ecstatic . 
He tended to throw down ""fun facts"" and avoided questions or trouble shooting issues until it was after class /in return I couldn't follow along on the zoom class and was left behind with a handful of other students . 
(Let's call that teacher ""Dex"".) Myself and 4 other students out of the 23 decided to switch cohorts due to this. 

I restarted my cohort and after the first week we had orientation with our new cohort. My new teacher (let's call him ""Nate"") was explaining the do's and don'ts in class. I had asked him if reaching out for help from other software engineers and tutors was possible and he discouraged it.
 
After the first week we had a project involving Javascript and creating a quick project that would involve the user having a choice of using ""tools"" and earning money by using certain tools.  
I referred back to old projects from my cohort and reached out to one of my friends who's a software engineer to guide me in the right direction. My friend NEVER gives me the answers and never tells me how to type my code but instead tells me which syntax to look into or will pinpoint something in my notes that I should re read or consider using in my code. So that's what i did , 5 hours later my homework is complete and turned in.

On Monday, my teacher had sent me a direct message on slack asking me to join a zoom call (insert zoom call link) to ""discuss copying people's homework and plagiarism"" .
 We couldn't make that day work so the next day I joined and he had me explain every single line of code and kept reiterating over questions such as ..""tell me why this is moving to this"", 
""tell me what this line of code means "",
""tell me what's happening here and why it's doing what it's doing "",
""tell me where we start and what this line of code is doing"", ""you're wrong.  Try again.""
After a good 5 minutes of me explaining my code and being shot down after everything I've said he said he had enough and that he ""knew I didn't write this"" . 

My teacher Nate started going off on a rant about how he's friends with Dex and Dex was telling him about how I had ""failed out "" of his class and how he believed a coding bootcamp isn't for me . Nate started to say how he should just kick me out of the program but he thought that was ""too harsh"" and continued to explain why plagiarism was bad. 
I explained that I never had someone write my code and it seemed that he was bias in the first place considering how he brought up plagiarism prior to even hearing me out , continued to shoot down everything I was saying and brought up rude/unprofessional and discouraging comments that were privately discussed with a previous instructor . 
He ended up marking my homework as ""missing"" and that was the end of that.

Long story short , I had audio recorded this entire conversation and I actually cried after this zoom call. 
I've never felt so discouraged and attacked for work that was my own . I went to my student admission advisor and told her about the entire conversation and offered the audio evidence  . She was empathetic and explained that she's sorry I had this experience and that it wasn't representative of (insert school name) . I asked to not be in a zoom call alone with him in the future and she agreed that she would ensure that would not happen . 
Nate didn't show up to teach the class for a few days after I reported this until this recent monday. 

On Monday, Nate was back and he explained that we were going to have a ""stand down"" which is essentially when a teacher and a few other students go into a break out room and talk about their wins/struggles . 
Nate organized the breakout rooms and low and behold guess who I have in my break out room? Nate . 
Guess who Nate called on first? That's right, Me. 
He specifically organized these breakout rooms and while I was not alone with him, it still made me feel targeted by him.

When we came back from our break rooms we had a quick break and started back up with class. When we came back , Nate had made a slide show about plagiarism and how ""most students who commit plagiarism are unsuccessful in life"" and how he ""knew a student who plagiarized her way through (insert coding bootcamp) and was fired within a week because she had no idea what she was talking about"" 
My fellow classmates who knew what was going private messaged me on discord in shock that he was being a jerk indirectly still . 

Again, I ended up going to my student admissions advisor with these two scenarios again . 
She said she would address these to the appropriate people . 
I really just want to continue learning in class without feeling like I have a target on my back. I agreed to no longer pay outside sources for help or get advice from friends that are successful software engineers . 
This course is difficult as it is and I have absolutely no social life or personal life at the moment because of this , this is something I had to mentally prepare myself for . 
I'm struggling even more but I've found resources that have been helping me drastically! (Working with classmates for a few hours after class on homework)



Am I in the wrong ? Does anyone have words of advice here or suggestions outside of the things I've been doing? Any teachers have 2 cents ? Thanks so much.

413,"I'm sorry it's long.

I'm extremely ashamed to ask, I want the Earth to shallow me, but if I don't ask, I don't know what else I'd do.

I went for help from an elder, he told me there's nothing I can do. I have no proof, I never reported it, it happened 6 years ago, he groomed me into it until it became a relationship I never wanted. He prepared me for months, as a groomer does, until he took advantage, and at the end he made me feel guilty about it all. He was 20 years older, married with children. I was a naive, inexperienced girl.

The problem is that I wasn't underage. I'm aware that grooming is commonly known for children, but talking with my psychologist, it actually happens at any age. 

I had no experience with boys at all. I didn't know about the man anatomy, I didn't know what would happen. I was raised in a bubble of church doctrines, no sex talk. He made me believe I could trust him, count on him, be my mentor, my friend, my guide. He bribed me with gifts and money, sweet talk, compliments, taking me out. But most of all, he tried every way he could to find my weaknesses, and took advantage of them, became my family's best friend, visited often. Told me to keep quiet when it happened, and went on for half a year. 

I've been told to keep my mouth shut because he can ruin me and my family. I have NO PROOF of anything, and being a man of power, EVERYONE will believe him anyway.

416,"So basically, my friend recently has seemed to be feeling down a bit, I think. He’s always been the jokester of the group, and for years we’ve made jokes about Suicide (immature, I know, but we’re stupid teenagers). 

Recently, he’s seemed a bit more depressed than I’ve seen him be before. He’s said a few things about hating himself and thinking he’s worthless, but also laughing while he’s saying it. This leads me to wondering whether he’s exaggerating, like he’s done before, or if he really means it. 

I had a talk with him recently about whether or not he’s depressed, and he was pretty open about it. He said he was pretty self conscious, but not suicidal. He admitted to be suicidal at one point several months ago, but still insisted on being fine. 

One thing that leads me to wonder if a lot of what he says are jokes is that he does not display a lot of the warning signs I’ve seen online. He has made plans for what he wants to do when he grows up and is saving up for a car. But on the other hand, just earlier tonight he joked about laying in the road and getting run over. He seemed nervous when a car was coming, but it was still concerning. And the fact that he’s made quite a few Suicide jokes recently is the main reason I’m worried. 

Maybe I’ve just noticed them more now that I’m starting to worry, but they seem like the same jokes we’ve been making in middle school. I’ve made it very clear he can talk to me and the others in our friend group, so I can only hope he’s being honest when he says he’s not suicidal.

And if i say anything to my parents about that, they Will be but you are a girl you should do this he is a boy and he shouldnt, which i find totally unfair. He just sits around in his room and plays video games.

Since then I’ve made a stand for him to start looking after his own dog instead of relying on me.

He went downstairs last night and she had peed next to the front door. She’s a boxer so it was ALOT of pee. He hit her (She didn’t cry so it wasn’t too hard) but it’s still wrong. He threw her out and she ran away to my mothers house.

Here’s the thing, match 1, after it was complete I said, I’m not analyzing this I didn’t play good enough, I’ll analyze the next matches, I play match #2, I said even, this wasn’t good enough, I’ll try in match #3 and I’ll analyze that and so on

423,"I'm 18, currently studying to get an engineering diploma. I thought that I would be able to just go through it, get a degree and start working a regular 9-5, like most people do. However, I joined an elite course for engineers by mistake. I was told that when I joined the institution, I would find like-minded people.

At 16, I sat for my O levels, but i didnt really pay much attention to it, I disliked my country's education system and found that it added no value to my life. It was a national exam, but I gamed and slacked through it. And by some miracle, scored well. Well enough to enter the best engineering course in the country. I wasnt aware of this yet. I just wrote my name down, because hey, why settle for a B if you can get an A for no additional work? (As earlier mentioned, I just wanted to get my education over and done with. I knew I was good at math and science, so I chose engineering.) But when I came here, being in the best engineering course there is, everyone here worked hard and aimed high. I was completely out of place and found the ""like-minded"" aspect a complete scam.

1. I'm extremely free-spirited and being around people who are constantly grinding to climb the ranks made me feel like an alien.
2. I realised just how bad at math and science I was after coming here (very much regret it, ignorance truly is bliss).
3. Another reason I joined engineering was because I found it interesting, but the program i'm in, scrapes the surface of every topic before moving on. In other words, it's extremely dry because I only get to taste a portion of the topic before moving on to the next. I dont get to learn more about the topic, it's just the basics.

""Since you don't like your course so much, why don't you just transfer to another?"", thing is, I'm not doing well in this course. And while it's still better than the majority of people, it was a 0.5 GPA gap in my course (with the highest attainable as 4.0), between me and the next lowest scorer. Because my GPA is kind of crap, I plan on using my course's elite reputation to my advantage. And I'm already halfway done with the program. If I transfered I would have to do it all over again. 

A tiny bit more background information: I have a passion for writing and am aspiring to be an author, hoping to make a living out of my passion. Kind of looking for authors to tell me about your experiences about how you started, what's the journey you have walked to get to where you are, and most importantly the struggles you have when writing new books. Because I'm honestly not sure if I have what it takes to become an author. Would appreciate any inputs, ty :&gt;

So, my question to you redditors: What should I do? Persist or pursue? Or persist then pursue? Or should I just play it safe? Persist and try to secure a job instead of living off my parents?

I have a tendency to overthink and I convince myself that everyone is mad at me/I'm doing something wrong. To make things worse, I get mad at myself for even thinking those things which results in me getting even more upset and worked up. It's a vicious cycle. I know I should go to therapy but that isn't an option right now, for many reasons. I'm really at the end of my tether. 
I guess what I'm trying to ask is, how to deal with negative, intrusive thoughts? Or please let me know if there's a better subreddit for this",26Aug2020,1
428,"Hello!

Sorry in advance for my English (not my first language) and also the format, I'm on mobile.

So during the lockdowns in my area I became close friends with people I knew more or less before. Well we decided to get tickets for a festival together in hopes that we can attend (it was not decided by the government at that time if large outdoor events could be held and many restrictions were lifted). 

In early August it became clear it wouldn't happen so we requested to get our money back and go to the camping regardless since it's at a lake. I was hopeful that I could go too but I'm currently changing universities and I knew it would be a lot of paperwork.

Last week I learned that I have to start it the day we would go on our holiday and that I would have to get home early on the last day of it to be able to finish my paperwork. I told them that, apologized for the inconvenience and they even offered to help me out with that. 

Well this weekend it turned out that I would have to go in almost literally every day to do paperwork. I apologized and told them I couldn't go or I can't start this semester if I attended. I offered to pay for everything we paid for together (camping, traveling, etc). And they lost it. 

They are telling me I knew it before, I backed out in last minute and that I should've done it earlier. Doing it earlier was impossible, since the small university I attended earlier only has one person who is responsible for things like this and she was on a three week holiday (I can't blame her either) and I told them that as well. 

They are telling me that it means I want do distance myself from them and I'm ruining their holiday (but according to their posts on Facebook it doesn't seem to be a bad time). I told them that I'd rather chill at a lake for a week than do paperwork and wake up early. They call me names now and expect me to apologize for prioritising my studies over a holiday. 

My bf is on my side but I honestly don't know what should I do. They are my only friends and it feels bad that I might lose them but I don't think I should feel bad for this. 

So what do I do? Should I just let it go or talk to them? I'm attending their university next year so it would be a bit awkward but there would be many people though...

435,"I don't know where to begin or if this is the right place to do this but here goes. The scenario is this:

5th year medical student has the internal medicine OSCE &gt; gets a CNS case - stroke case, let's call the patient ""XYZ"". Exam time is 30 min. Patient XYZ has deteriorating mental state,  can't communicate. Patient XYZ unaffected hand was restrained to the right side of the bed (the bars on the bed need to be slid down to access patient from the right side). Student had to wait for a key (took maybe 10 min of exam time). Student eventually removed restraint and performed cns examination (with great difficulty), no history acquired.

Details for context: during this rona time students hardly see patients. For neuro specifically, student r NOT ALLOWED to clerk in those wards (ZERO cns patients seen). Exposure is limited... the opportunity to clerk and practice is next to nothing. Students are given enough ppe for 5 days (internal medicine is a 6 week rotation) so students  cannot even go into hospital on their own time bcs ppes aren't available. Also, the Dr that took the student into the ward for the exam had asked the nurses if patient XYZ is able to communicate and the nurses told him that she CAN NOT.

Other students taking the exam got different cases (according to whatever cases are in the wards so the difficultly level varies - no standardisation).

Question: is it fair to give a student a case as mentioned above? Keep in mind all circumstances, ask me questions for more info. 

Also, the ethical query:
During the osce with patient XYZ,  OTHER patients in the ward complained to the student that patient XYZ is neglected, she doesnt get fed, bathed etc. They said she was restrained (as mentioned above) and clearly uncomfortable. They cant say anything to the drs. 

Question: should student report this? Won't the internal medicine department think the student is just saying these things because student wants a free pass or something?


Advice appreciated! Esp if you're a dr/ an examiner of medical students",26Aug2020,1

439,"Hello,

I have been working at a company for one year now. I have come to believe that my boss is either a severe narcissist or possibly a psychopath. I work alone with him and I have been systematically abused and bullied for nearly a whole year now. I am starting to lose my mental health and I even have trouble at night breathing heaving, heart beating, and no sleep just thinking about being back with him. I actually quit the job with a three week notice only three months in. Even three months in I knew he was a monster and wanted to get out but he ended up calling a bunch of people to gang up on me through text and guilt trips. So after my notice period he manipulated me into thinking he was going to treat me better. I was aware of how common this is in abusive relationships but I was so mentally messed up I gave in. I stayed 9 months past my notice and at this point I’m starting to break down. Tomorrow I’m probably going to quit without notice because I’m not mentally strong enough to sit there and endure that for two weeks. I could even do it at month three. Am I doing the right thing? I know that two weeks is kind of necessary but I’m basically part employee and part in an abusive relationship with no one else around to help or see what’s happening. He’s basically had me cornered in a shop with no witnesses. I’m afraid he’ll try to harm me if I put in notice again but I’m at the point where I don’t care anymore. I would rather get hurt than stay. In this situation I think no notice should be okay right? Thank you",26Aug2020,1

447,"To preface this, I turned 21 last month and he turned 22 and a half in March. We have been off-and-on friends for 7 years but have been hanging out a lot over the past 2 years. I also got out of a severely abusive relationship of 4.5 years, have PTSD from severe physical and emotional abuse at home, severe bullying and watching my mother die of an OD at age 16, am suicidal and have attempted, and am at rock bottom at the moment after a sexual assault in August when I was 20 by a female, that left me ostracized and borderline psychotic after speaking up about it and being shunned, treated like shit and losing the few friends I did have because of it. I blacked out for the first time that night after she did it, and have done it 7 times since. My semester stopped and I am putting the bottle down, even if I feel suicidal 24/7 and can't sleep.

Basically, I have two options here: become nothing, or become a happy person. It isn't as easy as seeing a therapist or psychiatrist because I cannot do that due to COVID. I have to do it on my own. I started by getting off social media and exercising.

I just began my junior year and I want to major in psychology and, if I can afford this venture, get a master's. I want to get sober and healthy (my eyebags are so severe managers and co-workers ask if I'm high) and make the most out of life, even though I've been dealt a shit hand. 

My friend however, who is now 22 and a half, wants to work 30 hours a week as a prep cook at a restaurant, go home, smoke weed and take MDMA. No prospects outside of that. The weed and laziness is not an issue; the MDMA is. If you don't know, MDMA has an extremely severe neurotoxicity profile, and it's only to be taken seasonally, and with supplements. I've seen him do it 3-4 times a week, multiple days in a row, and is still doing it. I'd estimate he's taken it 3 dozen times in the past 6 months, at least.

He's deteriorated mentally and unfortunately with MDMA neurotoxicity, there is a point of no return. His ex (my friend) said she tried to talk him down (as I did) and she said he told her he's a grown man and it's what he likes doing, and that he does it because he's bored. He has memory issues, cannot form a sentence over text, is EXTREMELY irritable and pissed off, severely depressed and pretty much a zombie. He's all fucked up and he keeps doing it.

I have no idea how to be healthy because my entire life has been unhealthy. I realize now that if I don't change for the better and heal, I am probably going to commit suicide. I just turned 21 and I feel like it's too late. I don't know what to do.

I want to be away from him because I feel like I cannot heal in a toxic place, and he is most certainly toxic with his drug use. But I don't know what's right. I don't know what to do.",26Aug2020,1

I never really understood it before, but I am currently going to therapy to help get on top of my anxiety, so while talking about making positive changes, i really saw and heard what he has been saying for so long. 
I often ask to spend time together doing things, like walks, skating, being outdoors, but even though he wants to do these things and enjoys them, he says he just feels like he just isn’t bothered about doing anything, even though he says he wants to be excited and wants to spend time together. 
We do have lots of different interests, so finding something to enjoy together can be really hard work too, but we’re getting there
He stays in a lot and is very anxious around people, which is not a problem at all, but he has made it clear that he feels like he just doesn’t have strong emotions. I’ll suggest going and doing something and it’s met with an unenthusiastic ‘yeah’ or a shrug, which makes me quite sad. 
I thought he just didn’t want to do things with me on our days off, but he always says he does want to, but he can’t pretend to be excited about it, so now it’s starting to have an effect on us too. I just want to help him feel more so when we do spend time together, he can outwardly show he’s having a good time, not just with me, but in all situations! 
Maybe it’s selfish of me but I do find it hard wanting to spend time or trying to suggest it because I’ll feed off the unenthusiastic response and suddenly I can’t be bothered to do it either. 
I feel like he doesn’t really want to spend time with me, even though I know deep down he does, he doesn’t know how to feel or show it. 

He said he has always felt like this, and to him it’s normal, i just want to help him be happy more. 
I don’t really know how to put this all into words, but I suppose what I’m asking here is....how can I help him feel more about things?

My aunty asked me if I could also tutor her daughter (my cousin and practically sister) once a week in English in her junior and senior of school and of course I agreed.

I have it typed out, In bullet-point format to help make it easier and so I don’t miss anything. The Problem though is that I’m becoming increasingly nervous that my “breakthrough” is really stupid and obvious to everyone else and that I’ll seem like an idiot for having just now figured it out. I’m 32 btw, and this relates to things that happened when I was 10 or younger. Basically, long story short, there was virtually no love, comfort, acceptance, etc from my parents growing up.

462,"Hi, I have a situation and I want to ask for your opinions. My family has always been complicated, to summarize it, we're 8 brothers in total, different mothers. 3 girls and 5 boys. Some are already in their late/early 30 while 3 are in between the early/late 20. 

To put it simpler, 3 of them are sons and daughters of the same mother. My brother and I, same mother and the youngest daughter, from another mother. The other two are from different mothers as well, so 5 mothers.

So, the 3 from the same mom are gonna be A, B and C. My brother and I, D and E, the sole daughter, F and the other two G and H. 

My father made money while he was young. He managed to build a bussiness, construction work and stuff. He always had the mindset that we should get the stuff we earned through hard work. He put A, B and C under a lot of work, harsh treatment (yes, my father was.. very harsh with them when they were young). But mostly A, so he ended up as the ''head of the family''. They share the control of the bussiness and more, but like I said, mostly A. He has almost if not, all the power. My father had always favored them in a way. But as he favored them, they suffered the hardest under work and his bad attitude. Later, as he got older, he basically shared the power with A, but truly, A is the one in control.

D and E, we're separate. We never exactly did a lot for the bussiness, we maintained for ourselves. We have been through a lot, we lost our mother 3 years ago and recently, 2 days ago, our father. And this has brought upon us a lot of problems.

Money always has been a huge factor for issues between our complicated family. And in this case, since our father is gone, you guys can only guess how bad the situation could get. He had a lot of properties, houses, apartments, trucks, cars, etc. And those are under the control of A.

The issue is, between us, brothers and sisters there has always been a certain hostile air. Mostly between A, B, C, F, G and H. My brother and I never liked to gossip or start problems, we always had the inner joke of being 'Switzerland', neutral. Not favoring any side. To point out this, my father didn't exactly organize all of his belongings. So it's all up to A on what to do, and who to give what. He have the control of everything.Recently, my brother and I noticed nd their mother have been behaving kind of hostile, guarded around us. There has been a lot of warnings from A to us, about F and the others.

My father created a ghost company, to have all of us sign in it, so we could share all of his belongings. But we don't know what's in it or if they have manipulated it. To get to the point, we're not exactly sure how to proceed. We're not greedy for the money or the stuff. But, in the end, we know by right, we deserve at least a good part from the belongings. Either a car, two houses, I don't know. I live with my brother currently, we're both in our late 20s, so at one point we want to live in our respective own homes. 

So, what do you guys recommend to us? We're not looking for a fight. I don't want this to become inheritance horror story. We don't want to be apart from them, we consider them as family but they seem to be cold and guarded to us. 

NOTE: We didn't and we don't have any access to any documents they have under their power. And also, I gotta mention, A, B, and C and their mother have been a huge help to us. Especially during our mother's passing. They have helped us tremendously and we don't feel like they're bad people, we're actually grateful to them. But, in the end, they have always treated us distantly, cold and in some situations, hostile. So we don't exactly know what they're thinking and where we stand with them.",26Aug2020,1
463,"My GF and I were filmed having sex in the parking lot of my company, and I don’t want to get fired. 

I know all the mistakes I made. I don’t need any more admonitions about what to do and not do next time; I want advice on how to keep my job and stay out of jail. 

I work for a company that contracts at this faith-based hospital. 

After work, my GF was at my car. We got in the back seat and got frisky. All clothes stayed on but she was on my lap and we had sex. From outside the car no skin could have been seen (or filmed). (She had a short skirt on.) — Because of the thrusting and the positions, it would be reasonable to assume that we were having sex or that we were really good actors. 

As we finished we noticed that an angry woman had been filming us. Not sure if she got my license plate. (My plate is registered with the facility.) A security guy pulled up just as we were driving away. I’m sure the lady called them. 

So my fear is that she turned the video over to hospital security, and that they got my license plate number, and they’ll figure out who I am, contact my employer who will either fire me or ban me from that facility at that facility’s request. 

Also, I’m an advance practice nurse with a license. I worry that if everyone wants to come down on me that it could go bad. 

And then there’s the legal issue of “public lewd conduct”. 

I’m waiting to see what, I’d anything happens. This just happened yesterday. 

What’s my best defense? If it’s just the hospital that contacts me, should remain silent and let a lawyer? 

Again, no need to tell me what I did wrong. I know what I did. If you just think I should confess to everything, I don’t need that advice.

When someone says something not loud enough and I don't understand it right away, I get annoyed. When someone eats too loud, I get annoyed. And so on.

I don't mean a bit annoyed or a bit irritated, I mean just a little bit away from screaming around. This worries me a lot because I've never been that type of person. I've never been a very patient person, but I've also never been really aggressive.

This change in character seems to have come out of nowhere somehow. I haven't developed an addiction, there weren't any tragedies or anything else that usually leads to being more irritable.

The last few years, I was always stressed, many bad things happened and I almost never slept well. Still, I wasn't always on edge like I am now. Theoretically, I am in a much better place right now, I haven't thought about suicide for more than 6 months. But somehow, I've become so much more aggressive and irritable.

Is there a reason for that? What can I do to become ""normal"" again?

Tl;dr I feel like I've changed rapidly the last few months. I've become very aggressive and irritable, but I have no idea why or where it's coming from. I want to become normal again.",26Aug2020,1

Hey guys,

I'm not sure where to begin but I just want to express what's in my head. English isn't my native tounge.

There's a meetup group for people to socialise and drink in my city, of which I went with them once back in February. I learned that I was kicked out of the group on meetup.com so I messaged the organiser for an explaination and the answer was **""banned for harassing women, don't come back"".**

I was devastated and I replied **""I don't know where that came from and I never do such ridiculous things. But it's your event and I obliged. Best of luck""**

Obviously I have no intention to rejoin the group, but being accused of harassing women was too much for me!

About the evening

I tried to recall what happened that night and as far as I'm concerned, I was talking to a bunch of people, laughing, I've talked to both men and women and I left by midnight , no conflicts or problems throughout the whole evening and MOST importantly without laying my hands inappropriately on anyone.

In fact, I still kept some contact of people I met that night and hung out a few times with them! Did I ask some girls for their phone number, yes , only 1 girl just because I thought she was cute but she never replied my message... That was the most action I had that night.

It's burning my soul.

Guys, I'm truly shaken since I never had such a claims on me and my brain just cannot handle it, it's too overwhelming, I've lost my confidence, I'm afraid to talk and meet people. Mostly importantly the social group isn't big so my reputation might be at risk... (It's a big city but the expats since here is rather small)

I'm freaking out! Has anyone been through this situation of being falsely accused? What's your advice on coping with this? 

Thank you for reading.",26Aug2020,1

468,"My sister, we will call her Jane, has been married for 19 years to her husband, we will call him John.  They have three children, all girls. Ages 11,9,5. 

My sister used to travel every summer to see our grandparents the first half of their marriage, with no issues. They've since passed in recent years. 

Recently my nieces spent the night with her kids at my mom's house. It's not far from where my sister lives but due to both their jobs, Jane and John needed my mom to babysit early in the morning and Jane thought this would be easier on my mom to have the kids spend the night instead of my mom waking at five to babysit. 

John reacted oddly to this and began crying and yelling at Jane. He didn't want his children gone over night. They've had over night visits many times before. 

This week, Jane and the kids joined my other sister and her kids at a vacation condo for three days. The condo is about three hours away. This was planned in advance but the night before, John started crying again and yelling. He went through Jane's phone, he said she didn't care about him because he would miss his kids. He woke the kids up (10/11 pm) to sob to them over it. 

Jane went anyway with the kids and every night, the 11 years old called her dad two times. Every single night. 


We can't figure out what is going on here. John is 45 years old and has never had any mental issues prior.

469,"Hey, pretty desperate for some advice, I’ll give a brief run down of my situation. I’m just finding it really hard to find somewhere safe and secure to rebuild my life from.

I’m a 25m, and a full time teacher. This was my first year of teaching, and apart from the crazy ness of this year I have some mental health issues with varying degrees of severity. 

I have had depression since roughly 18, I have anxiety and was previously being treated for the onset of psychosis. I also have post traumatic stress from a previous relationship and my childhood. I have seen all kinds of therapists for years, and taking a variety of different medications, with a variety of results. Currently not taking any and really much prefer it.

Last year I moved out of home for the first time with friends, and was thrilled to be away from my parents. However this arrangement fell apart quickly due to how far away it was from my work, and other issues combined with my mental health at the time being at probably the worst it has ever been. 

I bounced around a few houses of friends and family for a few months, before finally returning to my parents. That was also short lived after a drunken violent experience. I was scared for myself and my anxiety flared to an extreme of fear of it happening again. 

I was lucky that a newish friend offered me to rent a room as long as I needed from him.

(I’ll keep this short but happy to answer questions). A professional sports player stayed with my parents for a while last year, and I developed a lot of feelings for. She also returned at the beginning of this year. She is very open that she has feelings for me too and would one day like to try dating but isn’t currently ready. This relationship alone has cause me all kinds of anxiety and issues through the year, but she is still living (in my old room) at my parents house so returning there isn’t really an option.

Just recently (last few weeks) my new housemate has been increasing drunk and aggressive towards me, and it hit a peak tonight. If reminded me exactly how living with my parents was, and I’m not sure I will be able to move on or feel safe here anymore. 

I have enough money saved to move out and rent, but I wasn’t far off of being able to potentially buy a house. I have pushed away a lot of friends and family through fault of my own and my mental health issues. I have almost no one close enough to explore renting with. I am sacred to look to rent and ruining my chance at a good financial decision and setting myself up. I also don’t know if I will have a job next year either, and won’t find out for another couple months. 

I am mentally and physically drained. I have bounced around from place to place, butchered relationships, and been stung along by a girl who has me under her thumb. My mental health is deteriorating again, and I’m not sure what to do. 

I so desperately want a foundation to rebuild my life upon but keep making bad decisions and worry I’m about to make another. Should I deal with living here until I can afford to buy a house? Am I to sensitive and should just ‘man up’ and deal with the people I seem to gravitate towards. 

I honestly feel like I’m one bad decision from ruining it all or pushing myself beyond return and doing something stupid. I just want some advice.",26Aug2020,1
470,"Hi, get ready for a long post. My SO and I have been together for almost 6 years now and go engaged 2 weeks ago, we both really wanted an engagement for a while but with Covid things got delayed. We were both over the moon excited and so were both our families. Fast forward to 9 days later his brother proposes to his gf. They face timed us to tell us the news and honestly I did not even know how to react I was in complete shock. I will be honest I just started bawling, his brother is very obviously the favorite child and it's always about him and then finally it was about us but he had to go and take that away from us.  To top it off my SO told him on July 23 his plans to propose to me and his brother went out on July 28 and bought the first ring he saw. His brother contacted him a few days after and told him it was never his intention to steal our thunder, well they did, and also told us a date they were thinking for a wedding without even asking us if we had a date in mind. Now it looks like we will have to get married after them with a significant gap as their family is from away and we can't except them to travel twice in the same month. I contacted the gf to apologize for the way I reacted when they announced it to us because it was not the best and I just said I was really taken a back and now things might be weird because we will have to discuss and almost compromise on certain things like colors and date because we obviously can't have our wedding on the same date as well as pre-wedding events. She told me she was not going to put her life on pause for me nor will she tiptoe around our plans and that she is sorry I feel that way. I am still really upset that now all the attention will be on them and that they have complete disregard for us and clearly do not care. I also know that we're not crazy for feeling this way, all family members/friends agree that he could have a waited longer so we could each have our moment. Any advice? I know I need to just ""not care"" but that is easier said then done but I also know time will do me some good. I also want to note that it doesn't bother me that they will get married before us, what bothers me is that they don't care about our plans.",26Aug2020,1

472,"  Hi, I am a 20 year old student and I've studied literature for 2 years. Last year I started to feel that the city was depressing me and something was missing and I've become such an angry person I did not attend classes properly and I started to reflect my bad mental state to my first friend here(she deserved, I have no regrets) I knew that I wasnt good because anytime I went to my room I was like ""You cant live with these people"" and I'd grab my books and would study for this exam. I tried my best to not reflect it to other people but it was killing me, I don't remember last year though. I decided to retake an exam to change my school and today results came and I am leaving the city.

I was thinking that I would feel lighter, I was aware of the fact that I had my friends here and I didn't realize the hardship of the fact that one of my friends did not have any other friends but me. 2 days ago I came to her apartment (its been a week since she came) I was going to have stuff to do with my current school and we had fun etc. Today I need to go to the school to end my relations with the school and after 2 days or so I am leaving her. I know its my future and my mentality. I am really such a different person now being here was like a torture to me and I thought I would feel lighter today but no. Now I have this pain. I couldn't even feel happy I cant look at her because I know after 2 days she'll be alone. (She might have new friendships of course and I really hope this) How can I convince myself that she'll be fine? 

 I added or deleted some sentences and it might have caused some difficulties in text. Sorry in advance.",26Aug2020,1
473,"For context I’m a 19M university student who lives and studies in a very liberal environment. The person in question is a 20M trans man who I hooked up with two times within the span of a couple weeks. 

This was very exciting for me as I’d never had a FWB/hook up partner before (or any sexual relationship at all for that matter). The second time we hooked up he said he was feeling pretty down and that he didn’t feel up to sex but that he’d like me to come over for emotional support. I came over with the intent of making him feel better but also in the hope that we might be able to have sex (I have fully accepted that this was pretty selfish behaviour). I was also a little drunk but not extremely. 

(TW Explicit Sexual Content) We do end up having sex, with us beginning to make out and me initiating oral sex. I don’t ask if it’s ok before I start going down on him but after starting I receive clear signs he’s ok with it: I’m fairly inexperienced so I ask him for advice on how to proceed which he gives to me (where to aim for, etc.) I alternate between oral sex and fingering, at which point he asks me to choke him. This takes me by surprise but I comply and do so while continuing to finger him. He finishes and laughs, I then ask him if he’d refer the favour to me. He had expressed reluctance earlier but I asked a couple times afterwards (making a few  jokes out of it), and he complied. He blew me for a while and when I couldn’t come he took my fingers and sucked on them while I jerked off (I realise this is very explicit but it’s important for later on). I finish and we stay in his room and cuddle for a while, chat, and watch Netflix for a couple hours before I go back to my flat.

The next day he sends me pictures of his bruised neck and we banter for a little bit. A week after that when we’d all returned home for Christmas break he texts me out of the blue to say he thinks I’m a really sweet guy and we flirt a little more. And then a week after that he texts me and says he wants to stop hooking up and that our last encounter was non consensual. 

I’m completely horrified by this and apologise profusely. He’s really quite nice about it and says he knows I didn’t do it intentionally and that I’m a really nice guy. He mentioned he only realised this while having a conversation with his therapist about impulse sex and used me as an example and she told him that what happened was not ok. The most confusing thing about it is how nice he is, there are some moments of bitterness and anger but at the time I think that’s fully understandable and he ends up comforting me and telling me not to freak out over it. I feel bad the next day about this freak out, feeling I made things about me, so I text him and apologise for my reaction being immature. He’s a bit more curt today, telling me it’s not something he can just get over and that he’s been hurt by this more than I have. I apologise if I’ve made it seem like that’s my attitude and he relents, saying that it’s too early for forgiveness as it is a sexual assault (the first time he’s used those words) but that he’d like us to be friendly going forward. I accept those terms as completely fair and that’s the last I’ve spoken to him in 8 months. 

After hearing the term “sexual assault” I fully freak out and have a complete mental breakdown, self harming myself for the first time in a few months. Luckily my dad, who’s already aware of the situation, is there to calm me down. After me telling him everything and him reading through the texts, he tells me that it could not have been sexual assault as there are signs (the directions on how to give him oral sex, him taking my fingers without being asked and most importantly him asking me to choke him) that clearly indicate consent on his part. This calms me down somewhat and I’m able to keep going with my life.

For the past 8 months though I’ve been unsure of what to feel. It’s true he showed these signs of participation, but at the same time I did numerous things wrong: I went to an emotionally vulnerable person’s place in the hope of having sex with them when they had expressed reluctance to do so, I initiated oral sex without asking for or receiving explicit consent, and requested oral sex from someone who had previously said they didn’t want to give it. I feel terrible about this and want to be able to forgive myself by taking accountability for what I did wrong and move on... but I cannot do that if I don’t know what precisely it was I did. Was this sexual assault, and if so how can I ever forgive myself? 

TLDR: Hook up with a guy and initiate sex without asking if he wants it but there’s communication throughout the encounter and escalation on his part including him asking me to choke him. He continues to flirt with me over text until two weeks later he says he talked to his therapist about it as an example of impulse sex and he realised I sexually assaulted him. 8 months on and still don’t know what to take accountability for and whether it WAS sexual assault.",26Aug2020,1

i only know this stalker's name and i'm not even sure if it's a real name. i don't know if they're pretending to be someone else or not, but right now they claimed to be a girl around my brother's age. i don't really know what she wants with him, but as soon as he blocked her for a reason i don't know, she seems to be everywhere and finds literally every single one of his social media accounts. these accounts used to harrass him is completely empty: no posts, reposts, likes or whatever. the only thing i found in their twitter acc was a link to a steam profile with the same username.

now this steam link is the only thing i have that has progress and posts. she plays a handful of games so i think this is the only genuine intel i have of her. but even with that, i don't really know what to do. it seems like my brother would know her personally if she's able to find his social media accounts all the time despite that he's constantly changing his usernames.

eventually she decided to threaten him and ask him to stop blocking her ""or else"". if it helps, all her accounts that were used to send death threats to my brother always start with a ""xia"" and an anime profile picture (yeah i'm serious). however, ""xia"" is not the name she gave us. i'm not actually going to say her name until she proves to be dangerous, but let's just call her sharon since it's close.

477,"Let me preface this by saying that our boiler is located in my room, leaving my legs only about 1.5 - 2 metres away from it when I sleep.

So recently we have been having issues with our pump in the boiler and as the person who has to read up on everything and handles all repairs as well as half our legal stuff, it obviously fell onto me to do something about it.

I discovered that, despite us also having several boiler problems in the past, we didn’t have a boiler insurance so, eventually, we brought a new pump and set it up, mainly because my dad has basically an obsession with repairing things and while he can do it himself with most things there are some where he can’t. In the end I did manage to convince him to get an insurance for it.

The boiler is 12 years old, which while still normal, but due to the fact that it has broken and had several major problems in the past few years would be ground to have it replaced, which is something my mom has brought up before as well.

So anyway, on Friday, an engineer came by to check on the boiler due to them being sent to check boilers before it gets cold. The engineer checked everything and my dad told him about how we have been having a problem with the pump (because it happened again) the guy said heel check it out and did then called the company to check our insurance and see if it covered the pump and that they would call us back with it. He also switched the boiler off and said there was a build up inside which would only make issues worse over time and eventually the boiler would explode, or something like that if it wasn’t all fully resolved.

It was on Friday so we assumed they would call Monday but they didn’t. This morning (Wednesday) my dad called them instead. I wasn’t in the room and didn’t hear their conversation but it ended with the lady saying that an engineer will call but then my dad disconnected and came up and switched the boiler on, he then proceeded to say he thought the engineer completely disabled the whole boiler but only switched it off which clearly means that (despite the man saying to leave it off the whole time) it’s okay to turn it on. Then, after a few minutes, when the engineer called him, he refused to pick up saying he doesn’t need to talk with them and that the engineer would only tell him what he already knew.

It's been about 1 year since I (23F) cut off my toxic best friend (22F) and I've been doing so much better.

They have been constantly fighting for the last year since I left her side. According to the friend, she is absolutely miserable but refuses to end the relationship.

492,"Hello everyone,

I think a bit of context is necessary.

I'm 16 years old, and for a little more than two years, I've been identifying as a transgender demiboy (ftm). I've told my mother about it, and it took her almost two years to accept it. She now tries to use the correct pronouns and name, and told her own mother and sisters about it. My father, however, doesn't use my pronouns nor name, and I had to give him three letters before getting a reaction from him.

Although it always did hurt, to be misgendered by my whole family, I always tried to believe that one day it will change and everything's going to be alright. However, lately, I've been having troubles with accepting myself. I often find myself thinking about scratching my chest until it bleeds or even ending it all, I hate my body so much.

I want to speak to my mother about these feelings. I know I'm still young, but I don't want to live in this feminine body any longer. I want to get a surgery for a flat chest, but I have no idea how to tell that to my mom. She'll probably just tell me to 'wait a few years', but I can't, it hurts too much and I can't stop crying when thinking about it. She's the only one who I can talk too, considering I don't really speak to the rest of my family and my father isn't supportive.

Is there any way for me to communicate my feelings to my mother ? Or at least, is there something I can do to feel a little better ?",26Aug2020,1

494,"Hi guys,
First of all thank you to anyone who will read this and will respond. Reddit community has helped me through a lot of personal a d work things. 

I (M32) father of 2 little children, am currently working as a Supervisor (Team Leader) in a multinational company that provides customer care for different services like energy, gas, package delivery etc. 
Been working for about 4 yrs in total but recently due to covid situation a lot of things happened like not having more extras, bonuses and even the behaviour of my boss that keeps asking and confronting me even for small details.

I'm feeling that this might be the end of me in this company since I heard my collague (F34) speaking with our FM (M36) (floor manager or even our boss since it's the same title), talking to each other via BlackBoard (similar to Zoom platforms since we work online nowadays) about me and my performance on work. Not congratulations, only bad words and my collague was basically being a rat and telling everything to our boss about how I was not feeling motivated in work since we got cut from extra hours and bonuses, something we shared with each other a couple of weeks ago and we both were upset and not motivated because he cut everything from us from extra hours to bonuses by explaining the financial reason the company is struggling due to Covid situation, even though this is not true because other departments are still getting payed the same way!

Anyway, I don't want to confront them since I've taken some advices from my previous post and applied for a new position to another company as Project Manager and they called me today informing me that they are interested on offering this position to me (i have 10 yrs of experience in this market) 

I'm totally scared and confused in this. Need help and advices on how to properly adjust this situation and win this interview, how to avoid the risk especially with the covid situation and financial difficulties (what questions to ask, how to respond to difficult questions etc) because the last interview I gave was for my current job and I don't remember it!

500,"Sorry in advance this is very long...

I’ve been saying this girl for two months but we’ve been talking for almost five. Pretty much from the moment we started dating it felt like she just didn’t put much effort into our relationship. What do I mean by this?

Phone calls: in our entire five\~ months talking, I believe she has initiated two phone calls. Yes, you read that right. Two. I always am the one to call. Her schedule is busier than mine, she always tells me “you can call whenever, if I’m not busy I’ll pick up.” And I say “my job isn’t demanding and I work alone, so it’s probably more convenient if you just call when you’re not busy, since I’m much more likely to be able to pick up.” Still virtually nothing. Matter of fact it’s been well over a month since we even FaceTimed. I sound like a baby, but I really held back because I was hoping she would want to initiate. Still hasn’t.

Meeting up: like I said her schedule is much busier than mine. Logically, wouldn’t it be easier for her to say “hey I’m free this day or this time” since she has more limited free time? I think so. She has never once even told me when she was free. I have to ask every time. Every. Damn. Time. It’s really frustrating.

Texting: so because she’s busy there are often delays in when we can text. Perfectly fine I get it. But I’ll wait hours for a text back and be met with a small 10 word text replying to whatever I said with virtually nothing to go off of. Since day 1 we always juggle multiple things per text, and earlier I waited like 3 hours for a text that just said “🤦🏾‍♀️ to all the above.” And tonight, we were texting and I know it was getting late so I sent her a goodnight text and snap. After 30 minutes I figured she fell asleep. I open Facebook to look at my group chats and there she is, online. 30-40 minutes after I texted her goodnight. I know she’s asleep by now, and she was awake 30-40 minutes after I texted her goodnight and she didn’t bother to open or tell me goodnight. That in itself wouldn’t be a big deal but with everything else? Man it kind of hurts. I even made her an “Open When” box for when she started school so that even in her business she could have something nice to remind her how much I love her, and she told me today “I forgot I even had those letters.” 😞

We had a fight about a week ago (our first and only) where it felt like she was pulling away from me. I had gotten kind of fed up with it and sent her a big text (she wasn’t able to call and wasn’t nearby to talk face to face) basically saying “I don’t know what’s going on, but it feels like you’re pushing me away. I have no idea what is going on but you need to tell me because I can’t pull all the weight here. I love you and I want this to work but if you can’t start letting me in then there’s no way this can work. You need to tell me what’s going on.” She got really pissed because she said I “never talked” to her about it when I literally had addressed it in a much calmer manner a week prior. Our fight was grounds enough for her to break up if she wanted out, so I’m not sure what’s going on. She obviously wants me in some capacity but the hang up is I can’t figure out what that is.

1. We’re abstinent until marriage, so she doesn’t want me for sex
2. She’s a very independent individual, so she doesn’t need me for support or not feel lonely
3. She never asks for anything gift or money wise, so she isn’t a gold digger

I just don’t know. I’m hurt and confused and frustrated. We’re just now getting back on our feet after the fight, but it sucks feeling like she’s still so emotionally distant, and feeling like she doesn’t care about me as much as I care about her. I love her, I really do. But I just don’t know what to do. Do I bring it up and potentially start another fight? Do I ignore it and hope it goes away? I haven’t even seen her since the end of July, and she’s made no effort to tell me when she’s free. I’m sure when I ask she’ll tell me she’s busy.

What the heck do I do? 😞

TL;DR: girlfriend doesn’t initiate texting, calling, or meeting up. She feels apathetic at times even. I put in all the effort and am met with none in return. What do I do?",26Aug2020,1
501,"Hi guys,

I guess most of you are far away from this calamity and you are right not to worry. One day you will just wake up and it happened. You will be old. And as you now, old people become stupid. Not just will their intelligence decrease, but their learning capabilities will slowly deteriorate into nothingness. You will never be able to beat a younger person at anything and at some point you will be too old to compete with anybody doing what you want to do.

I for myself tried many things to get places. I have a degree and I am trying to get through to an important secondary exam.

Yet I feel so unfilled and unhappy. I was always a bit late (around 8 years behind my peers) and up to a certain age my parents successfully explained to me, that it is not my fault and that everything is going to be fine. Nothing is going to be fine.

I hate the field I studied. I finished it, because I started it and I didn't want to be a drop-out. I'm still in that field and still wishing it to hell, because I think I missed out on important things instead.

I was always really interested in science, but ""too dumb"" for maths and told to do ""what I most certainly accomplish"". Also, I got manipulated into believing, that I am very handy with languages. I am handy, but nothing special to anybody else. Anyway, that is the main reason  I haven't done something significant or interesting in all my life. Something sciency. Something serious with impact, not a whole load of blabla who I have to study by heart to make other people believe I know something.

But I am too old to even consider changing anything. I have to worry about getting a well paying job, a wife and children. All of which I could do, if I just got over myself and finished that secondary exam. Yet I hate it so much. I feel also bad for hating it, because many people don't even have this chance at doing something with their lives - and here I am whining about the awful luxuries I'm in.

So my recent plan was to just finish it and then change, but I am too old for that. And if I fail, it's going to be even worse. And when I am done, I won't be able to have any children, because I am too old for that, too.

As you get older, you will never be able to learn as fast as your peers. Ergo it does not make any sense to start anew.

What am I supposed to do?

I am so sorry for this post. I just feel so bad.

502,"I work full time as a financial aid specialist at an online university, and they offer us employees the benefit of free education. Because we’re not “brick and mortar,” the offerings are a bit more limited than other institutions. I have a B.A. in English (Minor in Communications in New Media). These are the two Masters programs I’ve narrowed it down to, but I’ll take other recommendations as well:

Master’s in Humanities (M.A.) - The was the first one that stuck out to me. My prior educational experience is most relevant to this topic, and I think a lot of the coursework will come more naturally to me than in other programs. I have a passion for writing, researching, and history.

Master’s in Higher Education Administration (M.Ed.) - This path, I think, will be a lot more profitable in the long run, and is highly relevant to my current career path. I’m worried, though, that I won’t have a knack for the workload being given to me. 

I work for a great company, and would be content in remaining here for quite sometime. The latter degree will give me a leg up if I choose to move up in the company. I think it’s the safest bet.

509," Discussions with parents are difficult, please help my poor soul:

Yesterday  I asked my parents if they maybe could grant me some internet access on  saturday and sunday morning, since I want to receive voice messages,  texts and listen to music without having to use my mobile data (125MB).  They discussed it and instead of just telling me no, they decided that  it would be a great idea to limit my allowed time of being online to  170min (10min \* age, like [this website](https://www.schau-hin.info/grundlagen/medienzeiten-feste-bildschirmzeiten-fuer-kinder-vereinbaren) recommended). Let's just say I'm not happy with that.

*History of internet restrictions ( you don't need to read this to understand the post):*

*My  parents have always restricted my internet usage and up till now I've  been pretty ok with that. I didn't need the internet for a lot of things  back than. I always had 120min of internet access. On my sixteenth  birthday they loosened the rules dramatically, so that I could use the  internet between 6am and 10pm. I do not remember why, however, I was  pretty pleased by that. I finally could be reachable most of the time,  play online games with friends without the constant fear of my time limit running off and had not to take homework into account when using  the internet. A few months later something must've struck their mind and  they changed the rules again, so that the internet was available to me  from 3pm to 12pm. At least until yesterday, when the shit mentioned  above went down.*

170min might  sound like a lot but outside of this time limit I can't receive texts,  discords, listen to music (We've got no offline services and I don't  like visiting shady websites to download music while not being entirely  sure if that's legal or not), etc. Not to mention all the times I forgot  to stop my connection to the router and ended up with no internet  access at all. It's just annoying. I'm almost 18 and need to put up with  this.

When I confronted them  about this they told me I was showing signs of an addiction .-. and that  it was recommended to them by the BMFSFJ ( goverment department for  family and some other things). I meet friends, have very good grades and  don't go a day without leaving the house. Yes, I don't do sports, but  there were unathletic teens before the internet existed too.

511,"A little backstory, I (20s F) moved into my apartment earlier this year and my roommate has been living there for around 7 years. Last night we were talking and some concerning things about my landlord came up. My roommate told me that there were instances that my landlord would alert that he'd be coming over, but when he'd arrive, he'd just ring the doorbell and immediately come inside without waiting for my roommate to answer the door. My landlord (late 50s M) has done this on multiple occasions despite my roommate (40s F) asking him to wait until she'd answer the door. On one occasion that occured right before I moved in she told me that she asked him again to wait until she'd answer the door because that would make her feel more comfortable and his response was yelling at her stating, ""it was his house and he'd can do what he wants and enter when he wants."" This immediately concerned me and I asked my roommate if she alerted anyone. She said she did.

Since I have been living there my landlord has not done this, but now I am wondering what should happen if he does this again. The apartment I live in is for all women. I told my roommate that I would reiterate what she said to him the last time it happened and ask him to wait, I'm wondering if there is a law that would prevent this that I could bring up to him if he ignores our request again and has a similar response to last time. This living situation financially is extremely ideal for me so I can't really move out, but if it comes down to it I will. There are other things about my landlord that are somewhat concerning, but not as extreme as this instance (the other things are just about repairs and such that aren't major) Any advice would be fantastic and beneficial so my roommate and I can navigate this.

We get along very well and recently we decided to talk over the phone for the first time but she keeps saying she's busy or keeps declining my calls if I try call her. She has anxiety and only talks to people who she is comfortable with and she has said she is comfortable with me which is why she gave me personal details like where she lives (not specific address yet), phone number and real name.  Originally we were messaging each other everyday and now that I've been trying to call her she barely says anything. She did say she was busy but there was an occasion where she told me she was just chilling in bed.  The time difference is 14 hours, so pretty much AM and PM is reversed for us. It's just hard to gauge how to communicate with her. I like her very much and have told her that and she agreed too. I don't want to annoy her by calling everyday but it's resorted to that because she doesn't message me to explain why she can't talk. It confuses me because she's not blocking my calls or muting them, she actually declines them. I know this because sometimes it rings a few times before it declines (doesn't ring out).   


I know these things are tricky especially with the distance because I can't simply ask to go on a date or anything like that. I am trying to make this work because we established that we are similar to each other and that is why we get along so well.

(I went to his house for 2 days and for a few hours he went through all of my social media apps and looked at every single one of them)

The story I’m going to share will be what I would call, ‘the breaking point’

It’s the main thing I would like to know from people, if I should end our relationship.

(**story**) So a few days ago I went to my friends house. I stayed there for 2 days, going there at 8am and leaving at 7pm 2 days later. Honestly, I didn’t feel welcome at all. My friends little brother was excited (ig) to see me again, (because I haven’t gone there in a while) and throughout my time at my friends house, his brother was excited most of the time. I was completely fine with that and I would understand why he was excited. (His brother turned 5 1 week ago on Sunday)

The big thing I didn’t like about my friend (relating to his brother) was that he would basically yell for his younger to go away, get away, or leave me alone. I never wanted to tell my friend that I didn’t care, because he lives with his brother and I don’t know how his brother is like around the house with me not there.

So basically, my first point is that my friend gets angry at his 5 year old brother for really, doing nothing.

**The Nintendo switch**

During my time at my friends house we played on his Nintendo switch. The first thing we played was super smash bro’s. I don’t own a Nintendo switch so I had no idea how to play. He told me to press, “up b” I had no idea what in the world he meant so I looked at the controller for a second just to find where b is. (He has GameCube Nintendo switch controllers which made it so much more confusing) It seemed as if he was getting frustrated so he showed me in somewhat of a rude tone of voice, “you hold up and then b.” So I did that and it gave me whatever he wanted. He then showed me to press x to attack so I pressed x. He also showed me the shield. After he showed me the controls we fought each other. He expected me to be better for some reason, or he was just going as hard as he could on me. I honestly had fun in the beginning, then started to hate it after a few minutes. A little bit later we fought again (after a short break) and I said I did pretty good. I was a beginner and I fought him. Someone who knew all of the controls vs me, someone who just started playing that day and didn’t even know how to pick up items. I got him down to 1 life and like like 27%. He killed me ofc, but what he said I was doing was, ‘spamming.’ I have played online games before and I know what spamming is. For my first hit I usually pressed, ‘up b’ that was the thing that worked for me the most, to get the first hit. Then when he was in the air I pressed, ‘up b’ that’s the only thing I did which was the same attack twice in a row. He also said that I didn’t get close to killing him, which for a beginner like me IT WAS CLOSE!

Now later after that, he did online matches. There are multiplayer online matches, but for some reason he didn’t let me join, until his mom walked in and saw me just watching my friend player, and said that I should join in. 

A lot later in the day, (after the social media thing) we played some 8 bit tennis game. He was being very salty with it, and I pretty much mastered how to hit the ball, and he didn’t. When he finally realized how to hit the ball everything got worse. Every time he didn’t hit the ball he would just rewind the game do it again, but every time I didn’t hit the ball he would just go, ‘haha’ and then usually start spinning his character around. He was just basically very salty throughout the entire time we played.


**social media**

Where to start, where to start....

**reddit**

On reddit he basically looked at all the groups I joined, and looked at things I searched. One thing I searched was, ‘pokimane’ just so I could get 1 picture of her (for a joke for my other friend.) her official subreddit was made private, so I had to go onto, ‘pokimanehot’ he thought, and still thinks I watch pokimane now, and I ‘simp’ for her. All I wanted was whatever the top picture of her was, and now he harasses me about it. He refuses to believe that I don’t look at that subreddit, and I guess he looked in the subreddit and he saw that apparently there are a bunch of butts on there, now he thing that I looked at things like that, with butts and stuff. I told him that it was only for whatever the top picture was. He still refused to believe. I joined him on roblox, and his older brother was also playing roblox. I’m pretty sure my ‘friend’ told his older brother about what was on my social media. His brother joined in and said things like, “pronfish” and “poki..... mane.” The whole interaction with me and my friend on roblox was the whole thing that sprouted this situation back up again. I tried to ignore him (before the roblox thing) becuase whenever we would start talking again he would usually respond to my message with, “poki” or “pokimane.” Then talk about whatever I was asking.

**google** 

For some reason my friend thought he would want to go onto my iPad to go onto google. The only, ‘questionable’ thing my friend found was something I looked up. “How to not get hard when a girl touches you”. He thinks I would actually look up something like that, and I’m the type of kid that would play ROBLOX, MINECRAFT, TERRARIA. AND HE REALLY THINKS I WOULD LOOK UP SOMETHING LIKE THAT??? He was continuously mentioning that with our little conversation on roblox. It’s just so dumb...

**instagram** 

I have unfollowed everyone that was a girl on Instagram. I also unfollowed a bunch of youtubers I watch just so the chance of me getting made fun of watching them are lower. I went from 76 following (I think) to like 37. I just really don’t want to get made fun of again.

**end**

Those are all of the main points. Please dm or comment on this post if you have questions, and especially if you can give your opinion on what I should do. Am I the bad person or is he. Should no longer have him as my friend, and ignore him or should I deal with it. And also please don’t upvote this a bunch. I don’t know if he searches for anything to make fun of me or not. I don’t want this to get recognized. I just want real peoples opinions.

518,"Hey so I graduated in 2019 from NYU and my closest 4 friends all went to film school and none of them have had a job since finishing school, and they live comfortably off of their parents dime. I try not to let it bother me, but it often does. I also just feel myself frustrated when they offer me advice, or throw shade at me for say, not doing the dishes one night. I’m a clean roommate but whenever they do have any complaints I just think. Dude. I just worked a 12 hr day. You literally fed the cat today, and that’s it.

I don’t think I want to ditch them. I love my girlfriend who is heavily tied to their group, and Half of the people in our friend group ARE gainfully employed. and they are interesting, funny people. I just my very closest friends from college had jobs.

519,"Am I overworked? Do I hate what I do or do I just hate where I am?

Or am I just complaining?

I currently work salaried in an engineering role focused on cost reduction projects. I was hired to find and implement cost reductions on engineered products. That has morphed into project management, where I now manage cross functional teams to seek and implement cost savings. I'm currently managing three separate cross functional teams (10-15 people each) with roughly 30-40 cost savings projects between them. 

I'm drowning. I find myself doing mediocre work in all three, or missing meetings, or putting one team off to the side constantly. I have to manage weekly reviews between all three with monthly executive report outs on progress for each three, while flawlessly executing my assigned tasks within each three.  I just can't do that, and that gives me such extreme anxiety. I strongly believe in having strong synergy in my teams, leading from the front, and getting people engaged, but how can I if I'm juggling with so much? I seriously don't feel respected by my teams, and I don't blame them. I tell myself I'll work a few more hours or work over the weekend (I'm already averaging 50 hour work weeks), but honestly why? There's no real upward momentum in my position. Why work like a dog, slaving away, with no gain? I'd rather take care of myself while off hours.

Don't get me started on how incompetent my leadership is. Incredibly tone deaf (I have been pretty clear we have a resources issue, and the results that show it), very big on passing the blame downwards, zero lower level empowerment. But hey, TV tells me that's normal.

And don't get me wrong - I like managing teams. Sure, I enjoyed being hands on, looking at engineered parts, finding solutions, but I just got my MBA from a highly reputable program for a reason - I want to lead teams. I just think there's a limit to how much someone can do. 

I want to do a great job, I want to learn and do more, but I feel like I'm handicapped by my workload. 

I dream of cancelling all my meetings and just working. I also dream of walking out and going to a larger firm with a more senior role now that I've got 5 years and my MBA. However, the latter decision scares me: if I can't manage this level of responsibility, how can I manage being a more senior manager?",26Aug2020,1

I usually make a cut on doing this and in time I've also bought him personally things not making a cut at all.

I never minded doing this as there was always that friendship, we chatted and caught up etc.

But that has been happening less and less recently now I just get messages from him, very rarely do I get they ""hey, how are you"" now it's just ""hey, can you find me this"" when I find it and send him a link I don't hear anything else until the next thing is needed, he doesn't always buy the item. 

When I try and say ""hey, how is it"" to him I just get a good, or I'm busy and then hear nothing until he needs something else. And I get the, I'll get you your cut later when I sell the item, the last item was a ECU, I was supposed to get £30 and that was 2 and a half months ago. 

If I say something I'm the asshole as apparently I'm in a bad mood. And I'm kinda done with it now but I want to know of I'm just being an ass or if he's obviously just using me as I can ship him cheap items he couldn't get any other way.",26Aug2020,1

527,"This year I'm 25 years old. and I have been attracted to/in relationship with girls for all of my life. I had 2 girlfriends and I broke up with them for various reasons, not because of the sexual acts or anything like that.   
Right now, I'm still attracted to girls. I have boners when I see really attractive girls in porns or when I imagine about me having sex with attractive girls, or with several girls that I met in the past.   
However, only recently (a few days ago), when I watch a football match, I saw some players that took off their shirts, then I noticed their abs and I felt incredibly nervous/scared. I scared that I would become gay or bi. I know that it sounds stupid, but when I was 16, a guy sent me a DM and he suggested me to engage in a gay relationship, I refused. However, since that day I became so nervous about my sexual orientation and my parents had to take me to a doctor. He said that I had OCD about my sexual orientation. After some time, I feel ok, I had a girlfriend and I have only attracted to girls since then.   
But now, it's becoming a problem again. Maybe because I'm too lonely (I've lived alone for more than 2 years, no real gf, just short-term relationship). Yesterday I tried to look at the pictures of attractive guys and abs. No arousal (no boners), I feel like I don't want to have sex with them because I have no romantic feeling toward men. Girls have flaws, but I love girls. However, I still think that those guys are very very attractive, and I couldn't clear up the images of their abs or smt like that, not because I like those abs, but because my brain couldn't clear those images, it hurts. I become very scared, very nervous and very tired. I don't know what to do? 

So what's the problem with me? Am I gay (very low chance because I'm attracted to girls), bi or it's just my OCD comes back to haunt me?",26Aug2020,1
528,"Sorry for the formatting, I’m writing this on my mobile.

I’ll try and make this part short, but it is relevant to the situation; I found out about my brother when I was 6 years old, he was 9. Turns out my dad’s ex had his child and didn’t tell him until 9 years later. It was rocky at first however him, my sister (now 18) and I connected really well and bonded as well as we could when we would see him every second weekend.
However my brother and I grew up in very different lifestyles. Him and his mother lived (and still do) in a very bad area, his mother was and still is a drug addict and didn’t care where he was or what he was doing and was very poor. I on the other hand was raised completely different to him, where my parents could afford to buy all 3 of us nice things and lived comfortably. We weren’t rich by all means, but we lived comfortably.

Fast forward to when I was 14 and he was 16. My grandmother (father’s side) passed away of a long life of illness. She left us kids with I believe $200 each (she didn’t have much) and we got to decide what we wanted to use it for, but it had to be something of great importance. However my grandmother requested that some of the money was used for my brother to get his Learner’s Drivers Licence. My brother was ecstatic. He wanted to learn how to drive so bad, so it was all booked. However, his mother decided that they didn’t need our “charity” and refused to take him. He never made it to the test. 

Around this time, my brother was set on moving in with us. He wanted a better life, he wanted to go to school with us and change his course of life before he couldn’t. He was starting to get into drugs and he didn’t want to end up like his mother. But his mother refused, “You’re not taking my baby away from me” she would say. He wanted to live with us so badly but he couldn’t leave his mother because he loves her, it’s his mum. This was the last time I saw my brother (2013).

I turned 18 in 2017. As I was becoming the legal age, I wanted to my brother there to celebrate with me. I hadn’t seen him in 4 years and I really wanted him there to get pissed drunk with me. So I asked him and he promised he would come, so I got my hopes up. He says for weeks that he will come and it will be amazing. The night of my birthday, he doesn’t show. Not even a message. When people were turning up I would say “is it him” but to no avail. I was heart broken. A few days later my parents message him, and it ends in a nasty fight, he ends up calling my mum a drunk and other nasty names. I ended up deleting him off my socials.

This year, our father was diagnosed with Kidney cancer at only 45. We thought that it was only in the kidney, however when the surgery went 4 hours longer than scheduled, we found out that it had spread to his Spleen, Pancreas and Small Bowel. The Kidney and Spleen were removed and parts of the pancreas and bowel were also. I hadn’t spoken to my brother in 2 years, I resented him, wanted nothing to do with him. However, it’s his dad too so I decided to message him and let him know what was going on. My parents were fine with it and so I spoke to him over the phone for the first time in 3 years, first time I had heard his voice since I was 14.

He was happy that I let him know. Dad recovered really well and is back to his normal self, however my brother still wants to stay in contact with me. The rest of my family don’t really talk to him, my dad only really does when my brother randomly messages him. But i still feel resentment towards him, from the age 14-18 my family tried so hard to communicate and meet with him but he never gave an inch. I was so heart broken that my only brother stood me up at my birthday, would call and say “I’ll beat up your boyfriend if he hurts you” which was nice but wouldn’t speak to me again for another 3-6 months. Would say he’s coming down for the weekend and get my sister and I excited but would never catch the train and never show up. Now he’s asking for my number and wanting to add me on all my socials. 

A month ago he messaged me while drunk and said he was in the area and was randomly going to show up. I told him it was a really bad idea as it was 11pm and everyone had to be up early, I told him it was better to come by the next day. He promised he would and once again, he never showed up and never messaged me.

Realistically, I should know the answer. But I miss my brother. I get so jealous of those who have amazing relationships with their brothers. Their brother hasn’t been stabbed 7 times (or so he says), their brother doesn’t proclaim that he’s in the hood and he loves it and their brother isn’t so addicted to drugs and alcohol that he is accustomed to being in trouble with the law all the time.

I don’t know what to do, I want a relationship with him, I’m the only one who really talks to him, but I am so sick of it being a one way street.

533,"Throwaway account because I hate being perceived.

My family isn't quite the poster model for healthy families. I've had my fair share of physical and emotional abuse that left me with deeply rooted trauma that remains unaddressed, thanks. I've been planning on moving out for a while, and I've been looking for another job while picking up a lot of shifts at my current job. Right now, I work a minimum wage job, so my paychecks aren't really anything substantial, but I've been drafting up a bunch of different saving plans and found one that'll work for me. The issue is my most recent paycheck is a lot less than what is optimal. I have to decide between putting the full amount I'm supposed to save in my savings and live off of a fresh $15 for the next two weeks or put in a portion into savings and push the rest of what I'm supposed to save onto my next paycheck. If I push it off, that would mean I would have to work at least 40 hours next week to just make enough to put what I'm supposed to in my savings. It starts getting complicated here.

I'm starting my fall courses soon. I don't think I'll be able to keep up with my classes and work that many hours without messing up my classes which I can't do because I ABSOLUTELY need As in these classes to make it into my nursing program. That means I have to choose between overworking myself and risking my classes so I can move out at the cost of becoming a nurse or quitting work and working on my classes so I make sure I have a career but forcing myself to live at home for longer. While I might've considered that a while ago, my father is back to living at home and neither of my sisters are home. This means it would be just my parents and me, and they have already been... around me. Anyway, I really don't know what to do because things are already so tight because I had already been limiting myself to $25 a week and $15 for 2 weeks is a super drastic cut. Even doing that and working nonstop, I got through my classes by cutting it really, really close. I wasn't even a full-time student like I am now, and when I did force myself to work excessive amount of hours, they're immediately followed by a full week of bad dissociative and depressive episodes that once got so bad I literally had to be sent home for.

I'm leaning towards quitting my job because I know realistically and really thinking about my future if I don't become a nurse, I really don't know what else I'm going to do with my life. Not to mention, it's really killing me because the only thing keeping me alive recently was knowing I would eventually move out of this house. Quitting my job would also mean I wouldn't have an ""excuse"" to leave the house, and my parents would demand that I stay home. This means I would just be sentencing myself to be locked in the house with them 24/7 until I finish school. I already know this is really going to eat at me because I had a really close incident back in February and almost committed. Not to mention, I would be without a source of income, forcing me to become dependent of my parents again. All of this is... really a lot. It's really me having to choose between moving out and being a nurse is actually me having to pick between wanting to be super suicidal now or later. 

I would really appreciate some advice because it just seems like such a bleak and horrible option either way.",26Aug2020,1

We had known each other for about 7 or so years and yeah at first i had a little crush on her but I was really close with her brothers and didn’t want to Sabotage our friendship. Over those 7 years I grew really close to them and considered them like family. Last year we had fell off and became distant, earlier this year i had got back in touch with her and everything seemed normal until she had called me out of random and told me she had feelings for me. I was in shock and didn’t believe her until she explained to me you know why she felt this way about, she also had a boyfriend at the time. I hadn’t been in a relationship in years and hearing someone tell me how much they had feelings for me just made me feel not so lonely. She wanted me to go see her so i did and I should have expected to feel some type of way when i seen them together because I’m very sensitive when it comes to my feelings. After that i became very distant from her again because she never mentioned it to me anytime after and that’s all i could think about.   I would have wanted to be with her or at least gave it shot, but i felt like i couldn’t provide like her previous boyfriends or the current one. And that killed me.

It’s always been a big part of who I am but recently it’s just too much.

538,"So yeah i think the title sums it up pretty decently. Maybe a bit of backstory. I moved into this shared flat just before the whole corona crisis. During the lockdown we spent basically all our free time together. I get along with her like i do with noone else. We had tons of deep talks on the daily, watched movies and eventually also started getting physically closer to each other. Cuddling while netflixing, massaging and so on.
I'm a pretty introverted guy without tons of experience, for the that meant something. Someone i can open up to and who appreciates me. That alone seems totally new to me and off course i fell in love head over heels... And i decided to talk to her about it. Turns out, as i suspected, she sees us as only really good friends. She's just a really open person that gets very touchy and doesn't immediately see something in these things. Pretty much the exact opposite to me. I moved out for like 1 week to get a clear head. Now i'm back in for a solid 2 weeks. In the beginning it was pretty ok, we talked again and said we can work it out and we'll just not spend all our time together anymore. No watching tv together, no planning everything together and so forth. This worked out fine for like a week. It seemed to me like i could get over it decently. However Now i realize how much i miss her and the time we spent together. It fucks with me so hard... But if we spend time now i also feel shit afterwards because i immediately start imagining stuff and know it will never happen. So basically it's shit without her, and shit with her. How the hell do i get over this? It doesn't help that i'm incredibly suspicious of everything and incredibly jealous of everything and everyone. I don't wanna move out because i also don't want to hurt her, after all she was my best friend until my fucking confession happened.

I'm sorry if this is kind of a long read, i'll answer any questions you guys might have. All in all i would just love to find someone else to be happy with and get her back as a friend. I'm really fucking lonely and i think i mainly just need someone and she's the only one there for me.

After a month working there, I've noticed the radio was plugged out and wanted to plug it in again, I see there was a security camera (nanny cam) plugged in and hid behind a few books, which made me really distressed. I haven't said anything about it and asked the (one year old babies) babysitter and she said she didn't know about it.

At first I just shrugged it off and said ""maybe it's for their safety when they play there at night"" and the babysitter put word in my head that the parents don't trust me.

Ive never given them anything to worry about, I don't hit them and I'm not on my phone while working and I have no clue why they would install a nanny cam?

545,"Me (28 male) and my flatmate (25 M). so there are a few of us living together in Chicago, and there are always parties on every block even during covid because there are lots of colleges around. My flatmate Jeff has always been the kind of person where everything is done on his terms, and he never meets anyone half way (to the point where he controls everyone else's bedrooms just because he doesnt like something and dictates the common spaces) . But seeing as hes never done anything particularly bad, nobody says anything. 

Fast forward to a few months and we find out that this guy really shouldn't be around women and children, he's that kind of not nice person. Jeff has always met a different girl every week if not every day and brings them through our whole home. If that isnt bad enough, his job will probably give him covid cause of the poor regulations (and he goes out partying and drinking all the time with other college mates anyway ). Everyone in our apartment isn't ok with this and have vocalized this (considering that I am high risk and all of our families members are). But he doesn't care because he puts himself on a pedestal. Not only does he use all of the common spaces with these girls, but he also touches everything and lets the girls touch everything. For example I had my equipment in the common room and its mine and mine only. But jeff used it all and touched all of it (as well as giving the girls permission to touch everything and use it) and didnt tell me (he's done this with all my belongings that are in the common space without asking and doesnt sanitize, to the point where my stuff has gone missing) and obviously i cant put it all in my room. I only happened to overhear as I am doing other things in the apartment.

 I am high risk because I am immune compromised and have told him this many times and have asked many times to please be careful and to communicate with me. He simply doesn't give a crap. So i basically spent all of my time following his path and sanitizing it all for my own safety (and never leave my room when hes home) which sucks because i cant use the bathroom or kitchen and he is so unpleasant to be around because of his language and demeanor. But with sharing the kitchen and bathroom i cant be on top of it all the time. I am utterly terrified of getting sick and dying, but jeff always shrugs it off because people he knew that got covid were fine.  I resigned the lease because we thought he was going to move out, but then he changed his mind last minute because he had it ""too good here"" and told the landlord who let him automatically resign and by that point it was too late for me to find a new place. All of the flatmates are upset by this, but we cant kick him out. Any advice? We've tried to establish boundaries but if its for his benefit only, he says yes. however, if its for anyone else he will always refuse. our lease is 14 months and  we just resigned",26Aug2020,1
546,"My family think I'm gay even tho I'm not. I overheard them talking about it.. and I think they assume this because I never brought any girls home or because I'm a very private person when it comes to personal relationships. Words spreaded so fast Now this theory got to my friends and they have this doubt in back off they heads. I dont know how to deal with it..I've been avoiding to start conversations about this because its straight up weird. Then I brought it up while drinking with my brother and he acted like he didn't know what I was talking about. The next week I was hooping with my brother and my friends, I overheard them debating about it and they tried to play it off cool..

548,"This past new year, my girlfriend of 6 years broke up with me. This caused me to have severe anxiety and depressive states, I got some help and I am doing better now, but the first few months after it happened I was a wreck. I think what really caused the pain was the fact that it was done entirely over text, not a phone call, FaceTime, meeting, just her texting me, the reason we broke up in her words was in her view she was unsure of what she was doing with her life, and was depressed and didn't want to hurt me. Now I did object to breaking up, and I tried to meet in person to discuss this but my attempts were shot down multiple times, after some time I just accepted that it was done, hurt me but I went from talking everyday to her, to no contact.  This time really hurt, I was in my final semester at college, I almost didn't make it. In early July, I met a girl, it was the first time I felt really happy in months. I do like her, and we consider ourselves dating, but I have this nagging feeling that I don't have closure, that I haven't completely moved on, I don't think that is right. It isn't fair to myself or to the girl I am starting to date. So that comes to where I stand now, the choice I want advising on is, should I contact my ex, and request a talk for closure, I don't want to end up back in the state I was earlier this year, I just don't want this feeling hanging over me, I tried to remove as much contact as possible with her so I wouldn't think about her. But it is still there, I don't know how to explain it properly, but it's a feeling of discomfort. I normally would ask my counselor for advising, but I haven't been able to see them for a bit due to covid related concerns, I was curious what other people's take would be.",26Aug2020,1
550,"I just hate it. It's entry level, I'm in since a year ago and might have had chances for promotion but corona... 
I wanted to leave this may, decided to do so next may, save some money, be grateful to actually have a job, travel a bit and then college. 

But now I feel I reached the lowest low in my life. I don't want to get out of bed for my job. Or much else. It's 3 p.m. and I'm drunk already because just f*** it. I hate my life. This tiny thing called freedom (like..4 hours a day + chores) that's left isn't worth dirt to me. think I also changed a lot and bot only for the best as a person since I took the job. 

Whenever Im asking family or friends for advice they mock me because they had it worse or I earn too much too complain, honestly I'd gladly accept half my wage and be okay 3 out of 5 days.

Financially I could leave my job and survive for 6 months but right now I don't think it would be a wise move. I own a calender where I cross each day that brings me closer to my deadline but I'm spiralling down so quickly I'm seriously fearing for my mental health.

ANY advice would be welcome.",26Aug2020,1
551,"Okay, so I am going to give some backstory. I (16M) am pretty much the average looking person. Now, my problem is that I am very shy. I mean very, very shy, to the point where everytime I speak to a grown-up person, or actually pretty much any unknown person, my voice sounds like I am a chipmunk and I can't make up words louder than a whisper. So, of course, I'm not the type to have, um, any interaction at all with girls. With all these things said, last weekend a classmate of mine, let's call her Mary for the sake of the story, called me to a party she was throwing in her hometown, which is about 250 km away from my city. We stayed over the weekend at her place. Now, the first day, I saw this one girl (18F), a friend of this Mary, let's call her Amy, living in her hometown. I decided that I'm going to make an effort and present myself as the confident chad. Actually, I stepped in fron of her and barely managed to tell her what's my name, in that chipmunk voice. My brain told me at that moment to back the hell of, so I went back into the world of my phone, mindleslly refreshing reddit and thinking about how I, once again, managed to make someone think that I am a complete weirdo.

Didn't encounter Amy for the rest of the day, same goes for the next day. But at the end of that second day, the party itself happened. We went to the edge of a forest, where we also cooked something on the grill (English is not my first language, I really don't know how this thing is called). Music started blasting, people were having fun. Time passed, I wasn't having any fun at all (I rarely can say I have fun though). So, I said 'fuck it' and poured myself some wine. After three or four glasses of wine, the world became brighter. The music started to sound good, the people around me started to become funny and I started to have fun. And, like any drug, I craved more. The wine soon finished, so my great classmate offered to pour me a glass of vodka. A whole glass I mean, not a shot. I'm pretty sure there were also a number of beers thrown in there. Now, after that glass, I assume you could imagine that things started to become fuzzy. The next thing I remember is me passionately making out with this Amy. Not gone sexual, but it still seemed like an incredible thing for the guy who can barely say 'hi' to a girl that isn't his mother or sister. Now, that was like my second kiss ever, first one being like 3 years before during a truth-or-dare game. So I can only imagine that I somehow got nervous (though after how much I drank I was feeling like I could fight a grizzly), becuase my legs started shaking like crazy. And I mean like crazy, since it was completely noticeable thorough my tracksuit pants (I think they are called that, I'm meaning those baggy sport pants). At the moment when she pointed out that my legs were shaking, my drunkness completely disappeard, being replaced with this sense of cringe and shame. I told her that I am cold and went for my jacket, then lighted myself a cigarette (I don't even smoke, but I was mortified and I needed something, and decided that continuing on drinking isn't the wisest thing to do) and went in the woods, hoping that maybe I would encounter a bear that would eat me and leave no trace of me on this planet. The bear didn't appear and, after maybe 15 minutes, I headed back to the people and both me and Amy acted like literally nothing happened. 

Party finished, woke up the next day. My classmates were cheering me, saying that last night was the first time they saw me geniunely have fun. I was nodding, remembering how that girl most likely regrets drunkly kissing the weirdo who could not even stop his legs from shaking, and who surely is a terrible kisser (told you that was my first proper kiss, and I was so drunk I could barely control my actions). So, being Sunday, I took the train home, thinking about how I once again messed up a social situation. But I also couldn't stop myself from thinking of Amy. Reaching home, Mary posted some instagram stories where she tagged both of us, thus now having Amy's instagram. Of course I couldn't bring myself to follow her, but she did. At this point, I started thinking that maybe she didn't find the thing as weird as I did, or she was to drunk to remember what I did, oooor she just wanted to have more followers on instagram. However, still trying to forget her, still thinking about her, two days later Mary texted me, asking me if I had kissed Amy (Mary was completely wasted at the party, so I assume she couldn't remember a thing). This text came right after Amy posted a story of the two of them, so they were hanging out at the time. At this point, my mind started making up scenarios: Amy can't believe she kissed such a disgusting guy, or they just want to mock my nervousness and lack of any kissing skill. However, I decided not to respond Mary yet, get myself some time to think an answer and, hopefully, in the meantime, they would split. Nope, she started spamming me, asking me the same question. I said 'fuck it' and said that yeah, I did. Now, I was expecting some sort of mockery, but instead, she asked me if I want her instagram. Told her I already have it, and she was like 'Oh, so you are already talking then, right?'. I said nope, with her response being a 'whyyyyyyyyyyyyy'. Told her that 'okay, okay, I will text her, some day. a sunny day'. Literally the worst response to that question, as it sounded like a burden, so she just replied 'do as you wish' and disconnected.

Sorry for the long ass post, but now I really want to text her. But I don't want to look like a weirdo, unable to get over things we did while drunk, and, most of all, the last thing I need is that girl to share the story and the potential conversation to Mary, which will lead to their whole dorm knowing, and, most likely, teasing me. Can I do it?",26Aug2020,1

555,"So we are a group of friends me and 4 other guys and one of them is this guy, and let's call him Harold. He has been in a relationship with someone with somone who is toxic, yet he does not see it. My other friends are closer to him than me. And whenever they try to advise him or nurture him he pushes them away. This lady (we will call her Karen) has been controlling him yet he does not see it. For example let's say we all want to go out and he said yes let's go. Karen punishes him by asking him to pay for a nails appointment for her so that she will forgive him and has to take her in a really expensive dinner of her own choice. Another thing she does is that she demands him to pay for all the dates and all the dinners. And even for his birthday he paid for the dinner they had!!! Like seriously!!! I get the fact that you should pay for your girlfriend and never let her pay and I am that. I never let her pay but my girlfriend wants to be included in our relationship and she wants to take me out on dates and treat me like a prince just like how I treat her like a queen. And its basically mutual between the two of us. But Karen puts a lot of strain on Harold and we genuinely advised him. One other thing Harold does is that he tries to include Karen in everything. Every hangout that is meant only for men and between us. She has to come like if we plan to go for example New York she has to come too. And literally 5 boys and 1 girl. There is literally no decency. Like its beautiful to have your significant other included in stuff and always remembering them. But not when all of us are boys and she is one girl and when we go out all, they always end up fighting and arguing and it makes it awkward. Later his parents tried to advise him about the situation and talk to him. He stopped talking to his parents. Like literally not even look at them. But then they had to accept her because he forced her on to his parents. His life and decisions are based on Karen. He has a beautiful soul and says yes to everything she asks. A long time ago Harold cut off his closest bestfriend since childhood just because he told him that she may not be the right person and he had a long conversation with him about her but he cut off his friend. And was close to cut off his parents. And now me and my friends are slowly losing him. And I just want to have our old group back. We cant get through him or talk to him about her because within a split of a second he will cut us off and favors her. P.S. they had broken up so many times and gotten back together and the biggest one is. She planned to break up with him on New year's when the clock hits 12 midnight she will break up with him and which she did and then about 2 months later the got back together. We all care about him and I have lost hope in having our friend back and that's why I am here. What should I do to help him? Am I wrong in anything I said? Should I take some actions? Please be honest. I really dont want to lose our friend.

556,"I'll keep this short. I have an online friend we'll call M. I've only known M for about 2 weeks maybe? He's one year older than me always putting himself down.

 He always says he's never had a gf, he's not attractive, no one will ever love him, etc... M lives in another country so our time zones clash. Meaning, for us it's 12 am, for him it's around 4 am. He always stays up and never gets enough sleep, like ever. Even though we always try to convince him to get some sleep.

My friend and I, we'll call her B, she's the same age as me. Whenever M is going on about how much he sucks we'll always hype him up. But now its getting a little excessive and it's kind if weirding me out.

Whenever we hype him up he always responds with another thing that cancels what we say. Like we would say ""you have lots of friends"" and he would say ""only because I'm on the leaderboard for [game]""

We would say ""your accent is really cool!!"" He would respond ""no its not""

Or ""I don't love myself, what do I gain from doing that, etc..."" Or when we tell him to go get some sleep he says ""Make me""

Or when I said he should get some professional help he said that we could just help him.

It's getting really weird for me but B still hypes him up bc she feels bad for him. 

Am I just being insensitive? Or is M actually acting strange?

TL;DR My online friend always puts himself down no matter what we say, and I'm getting a little weirded out. Am I just being insensitive?",26Aug2020,1
557,"i know the title sounds assholeish, 
but there is this guy named mike and he is just a friend to me. we met through a mutual group. 
he’s from abroad and im a citizen of my own country. 
initially we used to talk about our past relationships with other people, i realized it was sort of like talking to somone basically to vent and i didn’t feel it was fair because it takes alot out of people mentally. 

But i (24f) was ghosted by this guy and so i talked to to mike just to understand what went wrong, so he could perhaps give me a guy’s perspective on why this could have happened. 
but instead he always shifted the conversation to his life and what happened to him with this one girl all the frikkin time and it got so annoying that i basically stopped looking for a perspective and just started to heal by myself. 

It got to a point where he sends me memes that would remind me of the pain im going through, initially i would say “dw just have hope things will be okay” and he starts to rant about his ex, then after he started to do this i stopped and i wouldn’t respond in a positive way  (laugh at the meme) or say anything much about the meme because then he would just start talking about his trauma and then in the end tell me i should drop the convo since it would “take a long time to discuss such things” and that pissed me off since he starts it. 

All of a sudden since past few months i don’t know what i have done, but he starts to flirt with me, send me memes that are a bit inappropriate about people in relationships. One day he told me how he talks to this girl everyday and that since she talks to him everyday she must be interested in him and he asked her out and she agreed, and i was like “oh nice thats cute!” and then suddenly he said “maybe ill take you out on a date” 

and i was taken aback, i was so so shocked and didn’t know how to respond to this, i told him that : “ mike, im not in the head space to even think about dating somone, im getting over a 2 year relationship regarding a guy who ghosted me, im not sure what i possibly could have said and done that made you seem like i was interested, but im letting you know where i stand and it’s just a friend” 

and then he tells me to : “relax, and chill and said it was no “big deal” since the “topic came up” ( which it didn’t he just took his opportunity) and i should just think about it and “take my time” this pissed me off so much and i felt like i was being gaslit when he tells me to chill! and im not going to “take my time” because i am in NO WAY interested. i was already annoyed that he tried to make me an emotional crutch. 

i know this sounds assholeish but ive been avoiding his texts and messages and whenever they come i delete them, i know ghosting is wrong but i don’t even know what to say to mike.
i feel so so so uncomfortable talking to him and i just dont want to deal with him anymore, and honestly i just don’t want to message him.

My mother was with this person for a long time and to make a long story short, he bled her dry financially by lying his way through the relationship and promising to pay people back that helped him out with money, eventually we found out he lied about many things and found out he kept repeating this same behavior in many of his relationships and once he got what he wanted he moved on to find his next target. This person still owes my family and my fiance and many other people lots of money and recently I noticed that he proposed to another woman and I recognized a repeated pattern of behaviour. I tried to reach out to this woman directly but failed to do so, so I tried contacting her friends and they told me they would warn her about him, nothing came of it, that's when I noticed he proposed and I didn't want to see her life ruined like ours was. Eventually I found someone linked to her online profile and it turns out it was this woman's daughter. I told her everything my family and I experienced with this man and told them in a very kind way to be careful with their money and to make sure to not give him any money or assets so that if something happens she can get away unscathed. After I did this, the daughter confronted her mom about it to warn her after thanking me for doing so, the next day this man sent me a message saying that he is going to sue me for defamation of character for slandering him that way. I told him that what I said is the truth and he can't sue for defamation unless what I was saying was false. He didn't even deny what I was saying and told me if I don't stop contacting those people he is associated with he will sue.

He started out super chill. We’d talk sporadically throughout the day. He wasn’t creepy or overly sexual, and we vibed well on many levels. Then the texting became more often. Instead of texting here and there, he’s texting me from the time he wakes up until he goes to bed. I work and can’t use my phone too often while on the job, so it’s a bit much.

And he’s started getting a bit.. off. Saying he gets attached to people easily. How he feels like we have amazing chemistry on every level, even though we haven’t even met in person yet. When I said it takes me awhile to open up to people because of my dating past, he says he’ll never give up on me. He says he feels like a teenager and is extremely invested in every text and reads it in my “beautiful, sexy voice” every time.

I tried to tell him I need boundaries. I asked if getting attached means knowing where I am all day, texting me every day, can’t go a day without seeing or hearing from me. He said yes, not necessarily choosing my friends or telling me I can’t go somewhere or anything like that. But I’m still seeing the red flags pop up like crazy.

How do I tell him I’m uncomfortable and no longer interested without hurting his feelings? He’s SO invested and I feel bad if I led him on. I really thought he was cool at first but his creepiness has only just started coming out.

One of the main things I hate is having to take over for ther person im with tonfinish myself off. Its humiliating kills the mood and half the time it puts so much pressure on me i cant relax enough to finish. So I've gone a week without cumming ive gone different periods of time in fact but to no real result. I've tried toys of multiple kinds wondering it i need something bigger something curved more something vibrating. No nothing still qnd since my goal is for it to be totally hands free using other toys on like silicone masterbators or vibrating rings feels like cheating. Second issue i try to do those hypnotic tranches videos or those ones were they instucr you on how to mentally cum hands free but i have an issue. Whe I was younger and started experimenting with myself i always had porn. There was never a time when I let my mind run wild either, it was just thoughts of this feels nice qnd then boom porn took over before my mind could develop and find it own stimulus. So naturally when they say to relax or close your eyes and get hard its just difficult and I have trouble clearing my mind qs well to think of anything. Qnother issue with this is I am on hormones so I dont know if its even possible to get aroused enough without some type of stimulus. I feel like a failure unless its done a certain way qnd every time I beat myself up to the point that im so depressed. I feel like less of a woman because I can't.

Even though i know i don't want to and shouldn't. Why is it so hard to just let go and finally feel happy and how can i let it go?",26Aug2020,1

572,"He's the most thoughtless, violent guy I know. He ruins people's lives through his aggression and manipulation. He already carries a knife and loves to wave it around. 

But his record is clean. He's never been to therapy because he doesn't believe in mental illness, so he has no psychiatric history. He's friends with a lot of cops in the area, too, and is trying to become one.

Now he's trying to buy a gun legally. We live in NJ so our gun laws are already restrictive, but the odds seem in his favor right now. 

Do you have any idea how I might legally prevent him from getting a gun? If I called his local police station just to give my opinion, would that work (I have no real ""evidence"" against him)? I also need to make sure he doesn't trace this back to me, because it would lead to all sorts of problems, as you might imagine.",26Aug2020,1
573,"So, please note that this from my perspective. I never know both sides of the story

According to me, my child hood was OK. My mother and father separated when I was around 3 and from then on I've seen my mother with multiple men and have even seen then doing it one time when I was little. Anyway, I felt like my life was pretty normal considering others have it worse. But recently my sisters (both older then me) have told me that our mother who I saw in a godly light was worse then I thought. They say she's was super abusive when we were younger and would even hit us when we were younger. Now, I'm not saying my mother has never hit us, of course she has, but I've never seen her do it so violently. So because of all of this, my family is falling apart. After listening to my sisters more, I've been having dreams of me when I was younger with my mom shouting and hitting me. I haven't told anyone about it but I don't know what to do. Why am I having these dreams? Is my mother actually a evil person? Should I believe in what my sisters are saying? Should I shut them out and believe in my mother?

574,"I’ll try to summarize this as quickly I can. My next door neighbor and I got pretty close this past year, began hanging out almost daily. I would often notice some nights his ego come out in ways that were kind of petty. Like he would boast about the past. One night he mentioned his batting average in little league was the highest in the league, but he quit the team mid season. He kept bringing it up though like 4 or 5 more times. At that time I was just sitting there not that impressed, bc to me that reflects how you feel about yourself in the present and future. There are other times where his ego would come out like that. I know I can’t tell him certain things either bc he won’t react well to it. His dad worked at nasa and they are like a nasa family I guess, when I asked him what his sister did for a living he was noticeably upset when he told me she worked at nasa. So that’s the type of attitude he has and his ego is constantly getting triggered and bitter. 

One day we got in a small disagreement about footwork in tennis. I had a knee injury a while back and I told him that tennis is one of the only sports I have trouble playing now bc it is so much in and out movement and heavy on footwork. Idk why but he got triggered and was saying tennis is for old ppl and doesn’t require footwork. I thought it was pretty ignorant but I kept my cool and explained tennis players usually retire in their early 30s. I didn’t get mad at him or attack him in any way. When we got home (we were in the car) he stormed home. I had just got a waverunner and we were planning on putting it in the water for the first time behind his house bc he has a boat ramp. He ignored my texts, I had even bought dessert earlier that day that was in his fridge. He ignored me for over a week, which sent a really cold  message to me, like I am just an unbearable human being is the message I got. I was really confused bc we didn’t even argue or say anything personal. So I contacted him again and said do you not want to be friends anymore? And he replies and said he overreacted but that “I can be opinionated sometimes”. After this, I would say I became less fond of him as a person bc the complexes were more apparent, but we started hanging out again. He never let me use his boat ramp though and that bothered me to be honest because we had hung out so much and it was a small favor to ask. When I brought this up to him in a text, he got mad at me. I didn’t regret what I said, based off his personality I am inclined to think he had some bitter reason why he wouldn’t let Me use the ramp, like he was upset I had got a waverunner. 

I messaged him like a week later and no response. He hasn’t spoken to me in about 3 months and he is my next door neighbor. When I wave he doesn’t wave back. I have literally never done anything to the guy. So why is he acting like this?

Here is what I think is going on. He is 35, sells weed and hasn’t really applied himself to build any kind of career, even though he’s smart and college educated. I am a business owner and I try to encourage ppl to start their own businesses, even ppl with successful careers. I have tried to encourage him to start a business and I do think I’m coming from a good place bc I’ve offered to help him also. He also recently broke up with his gf, but it looks like they might be back together now, but that hasn’t changed his feelings toward me. Not sure what 

I think that something about me makes him feel inferior and his ego just couldn’t take it anymore, so he is now ignoring me completely and building me into a despicable character in his head. I think he knows talking to me will force his ego back into reality and he doesn’t want that. 

It literally makes no sense to me why he is ignoring me and being so cold and hateful other than this theory. Honestly based off how he behaves, part of me wants absolutely nothing to do with him, but another part of me wants to deliver a message to him in hopes that he can snap out of it, bc I think his way of thinking is going to lead him to bad places. I know I have never disrespected him or wronged him in any way. I am confused bc I have never met anyone who behaved like this. I guess after typing this out it becomes even more apparent that I shouldn’t associate with this guy. He has helped me with things around my house though. We have bonded. But now he wants to hate me for no reason. What do you think?",26Aug2020,1

584,"Background: One of my supervisors is leaving at the end of the month. I've been in this field (Catholic Church) for 9 years and am interested in the leadership opportunity. I've also been trying to change careers into Human Resources but so far I haven't had anything pan out. I just finished my Bachelor of Science in HR Management and I'm working on my Master's Degree in Management and Leadership (with any luck I'll be done by the end of the year). Once I finish this Master's Degree I'll also be going for my MBA. If given this opportunity, I'd be willing to stay in this field longer to gain supervisory experience. I do love my job, but the field is getting to be a tax on my mental health, among other things. I also don't have many advancement opportunities (as a woman) in this field, this opportunity would really be it.

585," 

In my old school, there were more than a 100 students per batch with 4 sections of approx 25-30 students each. In grade 4 I was in 4-B. The Class I wanted to be in was 4-A. Five classmates teased me by using my fears against me. Three guys would take advantage of me because I was too soft. I would lend them papers even if they wont allow me to borrow their stuff because I felt I had to please everyone. They broke my ruler 2 times one time and I didnt tell them off. I knew this had to stop. However.........I was afraid to stand up for myself because I felt like I would be hated by people if I report them. I didn't want to be popular or anything....I just wanted to be in good terms with everyone and not receive hate. I don't like the cold look people give when they hate me and I didn't want that. There was a seatplan in my class and I was between two of these guys. I didn't want the feeling of a cold look from them. I felt like I was in the wrong section and wanted to change to another class but the school doesn't allow that. Because of a grade 4 nightmare I became a try-hard at making friends grade 5 and I got alienated cuz no one likes a try hard. I eventually switched schools at grade 6 where the bullying stopped.

As I grew up I realized I will never be liked by everyone. There will be people who will hate me for no reason or badmouth me when I give equity. I reported someone for plagiarizing my work when he initially asked me If I can send my HW to him for ""Guidelines of How to write the paper"". Not only that I argued with an adult one time when he cut me in line. I even gave some of my friends the harsh truth when they needed it. However at times I am constantly reminded of Grade 4 and I hate it and feel guilty about it. I will always be with Jerks but I will give them what they deserve even if they will hate me for life.

TLDR: I was afraid to tell on people who would take advantage of me and tease me because I didn't like getting hate and giving me the cold look. I feel guilty of not standing up.",26Aug2020,1

591,"For the past three years I have maintained a virtual friendship with a guy on LinkedIn. I am a techie nerd with coding skills, and this guy asked me to code up an idea awhile ago. The project never worked out, but we have kept in touch. We formed sort of a group of techies, and since this guy was in my network, he asked to joined and was let in. About a year ago, he announces a new project idea, and he invites the group to join him, coding for equity and not for cash. Some of the group join in. I didn't because he was a bit too bombastic and unrealistic in describing the project.

In the meantime, he is using LinkedIn like Facebook (his marriage fell apart and he married a much younger woman from Eastern Europe who works and supports him while he schemes to start a unicorn and get rich). His wife got pregnant to seal the deal with citizenship and that's when he started to fall apart mentally.

He started to rant and rave about the project and only he knew the whole picture because he compartmentalized it from everyone else. He started giving bits of the project grandiose names from mythology. His language in communicating with the group descended into foul tirades with the f word used in every sentence. A lot of the group quit, when he started spouting off about his secret knowledge that the CIA wanted and was trying to kill him to get it. (This is for a tech project). He is starting to talk about guns, kill shots, and really dark memes involving death and murder. It is totally inappropriate behavior in terms of norms.

That scared almost everyone off. He has no more workers and team members. Since I am not part of is project, he is trying to woo me to join. I am not sure how to respond. I would hate for him and his irrational self to turn on me. Do I:

1) Just ignore him?

2) make some excuse that something has come up and I am unable to join him?

3) gently point out that he needs mental health help?

4) try to alert someone about his sanity degradation?

I've never been in this situation before. Since he is only a virtual friend, and lives 1000 miles away, I feel no imperative to help him personally, but what if he becomes dangerous to others?

I think about what I did and said about this person everyday. I think about how much trauma it might have caused him and it makes me sick because before this he always treated me with respect and helped me out in times of need.

I know I’ve changed from this- I’m a new person now. My life is completely different now than what it was 1-2 years ago. And despite me knowing I’m a changed person and that I would never do anything like that to a person again, I still hate myself for it.

601,"A few weeks back I celebrated my birthday with my friends. Because I turned 20 and it’s a big deal where I’m from, I planned to celebrate it with all of them, but because of covid I only invited my 3 best friends and someone I expected to vibe with them.

The 4th person is a social boy who’s a year younger than me but I could always talk to really well. I will call him “M”.

M and I usually can chat for hours without a break. We seemed to be on the same wavelength... turned out that wasn’t the case.

I thought because of our similar interests and them overlapping with my best friends as well, they would get along, but he suddenly just stopped acting nice.

He started shutting himself out, while we as a group constantly tried to involve him in the planned activities like card games and karaoke. I thought maybe he felt shut out so tried to spend some time alone with him to involve him some more, but it then suddenly started.

M begun to bash my music taste despite us having a similarity in it and me spending hours to create a playlist everyone would enjoy.

I also was sure to share everything equally, but this guy had 3/4th of the snacks and drinks I put out. He took stuff from my friends without asking. And afterwards he didn’t even help to clean it! He sat in the corner of my couch and just watched the other 4 of us clean.

It’s horrible manners, but that wasn’t what made me the most angry.

This guy changed in my room (which is okay, I offered because I wanted him to know he has his privacy), but as he changed I heard my closet slide open. When I got in later it was still the case.

Now I know I’ve to push a little hard to open my closet, since it won’t open easily. So I asked him: “M, why is my closet open?” And he looked me in the eye and answered with “eh.”

I am still so confused? Why would anyone randomly open my closet? If it was an accident he could say so (but like i said it doesn't open easily)? And even if he wanted to peak he should've just asked?

On top of that “changing” for him meant wearing his boxers and shirt only. He’s gay so maybe it didn’t bother him since he was surrounded by women, but it did bother us.

My best friends ethnicities are all tied to different parts of Asia, me included. I am very much used to the western standards, but this couldn’t have been a culture gap? (He's white) I’m bi so it definitely wouldn’t be homophobia or something like that, my best friends are very open minded and kind.

Who in the world sits on someone else’s couch in their underwear when they’re at someone else’s house for the first time. PLUS he put his sweaty feet on a pillow... i told him not to do that and washed it after he left.

He was really testing my patience that day. But what annoyed me most was when he started to talk shit about one of my best friends, after mocking and stereotyping our cultures. But still no matter what nobody comes for my fucking best friends they're seriously so important to me who tf does he even think he is.

I faked an emergency so he left. I really wanted to yell, but didn’t for the mere reason of one of my packages arriving at his place. (I already paid, we ordered the same item together to avoid higher taxes).

Is there any explanation why he could would act this way? How can I explain to him I didn’t like this without offending him? Do I still talk to him at all once my package arrives? I feel kinda bad and responsible since he's a year younger than me.",26Aug2020,1

My friend, which we'll call Jamie (who is bi, btw) was looking really sad and no one else in my friend group really noticed so I asked her about it and we left the group and talked about why she was sad. She told me something (which I won't say because it's not important to this story) and then she also told me that she wanted to say something else but it was too embarrassing (later she told me it was about love) to tell me. Jamie later looked really stressed and tried to talk to me when we were alone starting each sentence with ""I"" and then not being able to say anything else, after a while Jamie asked me if I knew this guy who I'll call Jake I said yes and she didn't say anything else. From what I know she doesn't know Jake very well and this may have been added in to confuse me because once I asked if the thing she won't tell me is something related to Jake she was speaking in slightly aggressive and sarcastic tone telling me ""yes it's about Jake"" after saying that ""I don't think that it is about Jake"" she changed the topic and we had a few more of her starting to say ""I"" and then not finishing it. At this moment I was thinking that she either likes me or Jake, then when we were alone again she was really close to telling me what it was and said ""I need to talk to someone about this or I'm going to do something I regret and that you (talking to me) can't bring it up again unless it's important"" but stopped at I. I could tell she was really stressed so I told her not to worry and that she can tell me later. Towards the end of the day she was trying to explain why she couldn't tell me and she said ""if I tell you you'll probably never talk to me again"" when earlier she said ""you probably won't even care"". When I look at the ""if I tell you you'll probably never talk to me again"" I can't think of how that one may be related to Jake as I've never said anything bad about Jake and she knows I don't think he's a bad person so it confused me as the ""you probably won't even care"" would make sense when talking about Jake because she knows that I don't have any strong opinions about Jake. If any of you have any advice or help interpreting what she may be talking about please help.
TL;DR: My best friend is contradicting herself and may like me or this other guy.",26Aug2020,1
605,"I'm being  harassed by my landlord. 

My landlord sent an email  attachment containing a rental assistance flyer that was written by someone with the  same name as me except  their last name was ""Faith"".

I replied to the email explaining to my landlord that I felt the name  ""****** Faith"" was made up to harass and  bother me. I told the  landlord  I didn't know  who  exactly was responsible or who was involved  but I asked them to  stop doing things like this to  harass  me.

606,"Hi! I’ll try and keep this short. I (20, F) have discovered a decline in the amount that I am eating. I can go a whole day without eating, before I would eat at least 4 times a day. I used to be 150 pounds in January, now I can’t even get myself to 130. (I’m 125). I’m kind of happy, but the rational part is a bit concerned because I don’t think it’s healthy to only eat when I smoke. Food isn’t appealing to me anymore even if I am hungry I go in the kitchen and I automatically lose my appetite. (I can eat 2 full course meals when I am high and there is definitely an increase) 
Multiple of my friends and family members have stated I’m losing weight, and it’s very noticeable. 

Edit: I do have an issue with my weight, I sometimes believe I am fat, even though I keep trying to tell myself I’m perfect. I’m always weighing, and exercising (just to make my waist smaller and my butt bigger) 

Has anyone experienced this? Is something wrong with me? Any advice?",26Aug2020,1
607,"So I just started my first semester of college. This isn't my first attempt, though. I tried to do college last year in the spring but I dropped out two weeks in. Everything was just too confusing and stressful and my suicidal ideations came back tenfold. 

I had dropped out my junior year of high school because I went to the mental hospital and, when I came back, they tried to send me back. 

I've never liked school, I've always hated it. I dropped out of seventh grade because I was constantly dissociating.

Well, now I'm trying online classes with college and it's even more confusing and stressful and I just want to lay down and not get up. I have personal projects I want to work on but I'm so unmotivated to do anything. The only reason I want to do school is because I get paid to go. My dad is a disabled veteran so I get this awesome opportunity to avoid debt and advance my education.

But school just makes me super suicidal and I hate it. Is there any way to make my college experience better or should I just drop out again?

Sorry that this is so heavy, I just don't know what to do anymore.",26Aug2020,1
608,"On 2019 I met a girl when I got to college on another state, which I genuinely feel comfortable with, lots of fun, lovely moments, couple jokes. We were kinda in a relationship up to the start of 2020, when I returned home to holidays, we just stopped talking until we met up again when I returned to study. Again, we spend some days together, go out on dates. 

This lasted until the start of the pandemic, due to some personal issues I ghosted her and kept everyone away from me, even tho she understanded that I shouldn't do that to her, she even helped me during my worst days. Recently I've managed to balance my life, and we just started talking again, from distance, each of us on different states, I thought we were going back on track, to meet up when the pandemic is over, but turns out she's a lesbian now.

When she told me I acted proud and chill about it, but I couldn't sleep all night thinking about it. I still love her and I'm so sorry that I pull her apart for months, throwing away a potential relationship with a woman who read me as a book and still loved me. Now that we seem to be just friends I can't keep quiet about it, should I tell her how I feel? I don't want to bother her recent sexual orientation with my pity, that sexuality deal seems important.

610,"Hi everyone :) i'm new here and english isn't my first language so maybe some spelling mistakes happen &amp; i'm on mobile.

First for you to know: I know everyone dreams when asleep. But most people don't remember their dreams. Furthermore it's said that with dreams you process what's happening in your life. 

Well I remember my dreams often. Like more than normal people ( i would say that 'cause when i was talking with my friends about dreams, they didn't remember as much as me, like for i week i could tell them everyday my dream from last night, whereas they remembered like two times). For me this is not the problem, mostly the dreams are about situations that had happened in my life (maybe they're a little bit modified but thats it) and I often don't remember all details just the story plusminus. 

But there are also dreams that kinda creep me out. They're always strange and i have no idea how my brain comes up with stuff like that. 

Okay so often I'm in those dreams with people that are part of my life (thats not the creepy part). And those dreams happen in different places. But during the dream I realize that I know this place already. Like I visit the same places again and again in my dreams. For example an island is often in my dreams or a specific cave in the mountains. Those places don't exist, they're made up.
Secondly what kinda creeps me out is the energy those dreams have. They're always stressful even if the place is nice. They all got like the same tension, and when I wake up I'm also tense or stressed. Also next to the people I know I dream also of complete strangers and all those people have also a weird energy surrounding them. 

I actually told a friend that this dreams are like my life in another dimension (as a joke). But somehow I find it quite weird that I dream from the same places again and again and that I realize that during the dream and also this energy those dreams have. 

So my questions are does someone experience the same? Like do you also dream of the same made up places again and again? And are you also always stressed out after dreaming?

Sorry for this long post, i just wanted you to explain why i have this questions. Because I just started to think about the possibility that those dreams are something more than just dreams, like maybe they're a cope mechanism or idk. But maybe it's like normal and other people experience such stuff too so that I don't have to be creeped out by those dreams. 

I'm looking forward to some answers. Have a nice day everyone :)",26Aug2020,1
611,"Hi, I’m a 21F and to let the reader know this might be triggering to some, I’m going to talk about some heavy topics. So, for a while now, about five years consecutively, I’ve been a cannabis user. I’m in a state that’s legal and have a card, I smoke or ingest daily. I have Major Depressive Disorder, Anxiety, and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PSTD) for various reasons that I won’t get into. I’ve never had great coping mechanisms for my wellbeing. At the time of my diagnosis I was in a long term unit for adolescents for my suicidal behavior and self harm. I was drugged up on many antidepressants, to the point I was getting poisoned everyday. That’s a whole thing in itself but I was on almost 1000 mgs of numerous antidepressants that I had to take, I’m only 5 feet (152cm) and at that time probably weighed 130 lbs. After a month of taking them I couldn’t even keep water down and was put in isolation constantly because they thought I had a flu or something. The place has barely a one star review on Google, not a great place but did help me back on my feet. I wasn’t in there more than three months and as soon as I got out I stopped the medication they gave me, cause like I said I couldn’t keep even water down. I took about a year being unmediated and working on healthy coping mechanisms they taught me. I then starting smoking cigarettes cause it helped with certain stresses in my life. I quit for a year and then picked it back up but this time also starting smoking cannabis too. And this is were my title comes in and my main point. Has this happened to you? I was smoking cannabis, it was relatively new to me at this point, maybe about a month into smoking consecutively. I was with my brother and soon to be boyfriend smoking and watching Workaholics, when I started to feel uneasy. I thought maybe I just a little anxious or something, and that’s when it hit. It was like a train of emotions and horrible experiences hit me all at once. I would close and open my eyes yet it was like a scary movie I couldn’t pause. Everything bad in my life was happening before my eyes like a projector, didn’t matter if I had my eyes opened or closed it was going to play out all my bad memories vividly. I couldn’t stop crying and for about two hours I was freaking out. I’ve never dealt with my PTSD because it’s always too hard for me and they’re are still things I have bottled and repressed to this day. It was like my brain said I’m done holding all this in and let it all out in a form of vivid flashbacks. It’s (cannabis) has overall helped out a lot over the years and I haven’t had this situation happen again since. I truly think it was my way of coping or understanding my subconscious emotions, I’m not sure what happened. If you’ve taken the chance to read all of this, let me know if this has happened to you and overall how you feel in general about cannabis helping with PTSD. I have found a little more anxiety in my day to day, I’m not sure why and it’s embarrassing, when I’m talking to a person at a register or in general my hands start to shake because my anxiety. It might be due to a daily cannabis intake but cannabis helps with my other mental health issues. So, overall what’s you’re advice on this and let me know if you’ve had similar things happened with your cannabis usage. No one in my personal life understands and maybe someone here might. So thank you guys for reading this far and sorry for the tangent!",26Aug2020,1
612,"For some context, I'm 14 and have alot of insecurities about my height and weight. My father (51 years old), tries to make jokes but hurts and worsens my mental health. His jokes include things like taking my plate away from me during dinner because I ate a bit more than usually and telling me ""Stop eating, you'll get fat if you don't"" he goes quiet for a second gives me back my plate and laughs. When he does that I always stop eating because I feel like it's true (even though I'm actually underweight). He then proceeds to shout at me asking me why I won't eat. He also jokes about the bags under my eyes I have because of lack of vitamins, saying things like ""Those bags under your eyes are as big as the USA"".

616,"I’m using mobile so I’m sorry for the format.
Just some background, last  year my grandma was diagnosed with cancer, so my mom let her boyfriend of 3mos move in with my mom, sister and grandma to help take care of bills. My mom doesn’t work, she has been trying to get on disability for over a year because of her broken ankle. 
Fast forward a bit, after 5mos my grandma finishes her last round of chemo, she did really well and things seemed okay so I moved back to live with my boyfriend a couple states away.
I use to visit home often, at least once a month sometimes more. Every time I came home my mom and her bf were fighting, they would be in their bedroom trying to make things right and I wouldn’t get to spend any time with her. It made me mad and not like him at all, especially when I heard the things they would fight over. (A lot of jealously over the simplest things. Like my mom getting game requests on trivia crack from a male. Wtf?) and these fights would last for days, he would threaten to leave and she would beg because she doesn’t want to “die alone”
Also my 15yo cousin has walked into their room to find him chopping up drugs. My grandma finally cracked, after them using her (because instead of him helping with bills he found out my grandma gets SS checks, so he quit his job and they have been taking from that which resulted in the electric getting shut off occasionallyuntil he borrowed money from his mom to get it turned back on.
Anyways a couple months ago he cheated on her, outed himself on Facebook. She didn’t see it but her friends texted her, she tried leaving and he got physical in front of my sister and his son.  She moved with her best friend for a couple weeks, then moved back into her exes moms house. (Again WTF) she just said she was staying there until she could get her apartment.
Yesterday I realized that she  was back with her ex. I texted her and told her I wanted to take my sister. I told her I couldn’t believe that she had no respect for herself or my little sister. 
She is neglectful when it comes to being with him, they will argue and lock themselves away while my sister is having to do her own thing. I suffer from mental illnesses, and it all stems from my fucked up family. I don’t want my sister growing up to be the same, to be around unhealthy relationships, drugs, and neglected her whole life. 
I want to adopt my sister, this is the most stable I have been in three years. My boyfriend and I are making plans of getting married, we both work good jobs and could take very good care of her. But if I tried getting custody I’m scared my mom will kill herself. 
(More background) when I was thirteen she made me move out of my grandmas house with her and her (different ex) a few states away. I was r*ped. I wanted to commit suicide, I couldn’t call my grandma without him yelling at me, he would tell me I was embarrassing and my mom wouldn’t do anything. I had no friends and no family. I had a mental break down, I called my grandma from a random store crying hysterically that I couldn’t live anymore. The ladies at the store took care of me until I was picked up, my mom gave up and I ended up moving in with my grandma. My mom broke up with him later that year after he stole her car. When I was 18 I told my mom what happened and she freaked out. She said she was going to kill herself because she obviously isn’t a good mom. I told her I loved her and if I’m still here she has to be also. Every time she feels as if she fails as a mother she just wants to commit suicide. It makes me mad, because she can be a good mother. But when she is in a relationship, she will put the man before anyone including her kids. 
The same is going on with my baby sister. It boils my blood. I haven’t stopped shaking. I have have been blowing up her phone since yesterday and she replied saying she fell off the porch, has whiplash, a concussion, torn ligaments, and a broken elbow. She also started to defend her boyfriend. I was at work, so I didn’t get to reply for 30 minutes even though I’ve been waiting all day for her reply. I told her I wanted to take my sister and that I was so sad and disappointed. I also asked if she fell off the porch or if he pushed her while they were fighting. She hasn’t replied. I’ve been calling and she won’t answer. I’m going crazy and I don’t know what to do. I talked to my grandma last night and she told me I couldn’t tell my mom anything because she will always do what she wants but agreed I should take my sister. 
I care about my mom, she was my best friend, but now seeing how pathetic she is being right now I am absolutely disgusted. I am heart broken. I don’t know why she is doing this. She says she doesn’t have anyone but him and my sister. But her best friend got her a job and was letting her stay at her house, with her kids and things were going well. But she moved back with her exes mom. Why? I don’t know what the fuck to do.

620,"So I'm from India, I did my Engineering from Electronics and Communication. I passed out from college in 2019 and took a year gap to prepare for GATE. Although I qualified the exam, my score was not very good and while I was preparing for the exam I was all alone and so many things started to hit me. The coaching schedule was so hectic and I came to realise that I've so many family issues. My mental health became worse as exam started to come near. I was panicking but I didn't gave up on my studies, I used to study regularly and somehow I gave the exam and I was so disappointed with myself. It felt like nothing really mattered, I worked so hard and I guess the hardwork was for nothing. And as soon as my exams ended, the Covid-19 crisis began and I came back home. And I don't think I'm in right mental state to live with my family because my father keeps pestering me to go for government jobs but I'm done with it. I don't want to, for me mental peace and happiness is more important than some stupid government job. I told him I don't want to waste my time preparing for government jobs and all he does is either taunt me or make me feel ashamed of myself. I really tried hard for the GATE exam but I was not able to score good and I can't go back again and start studying for it, I'm not mentally ready for it, I just can't. All he does is ask me to prepare for government jobs and if I disagree with him, I've to listen all the taunts. I'm losing my self confidence, he makes me feel like I'm a worthless piece of shit. And he's very controlling and he wants every thing in the house according to his wish. Recently I'm having so many fights with him and I don't want to take it anymore. I want to move out of the house because I can't take this shit anymore. I don't want to live in a house where my opinions doesn't even matters. 

And he's told me specifically if you're gonna prepare for government jobs only then I'll spend money on you else go on your own. Amid this pandemic I can't even go out of the town I'm living in and I have no source of income.  I'm starting to hate him now because he's too much controlling and has serious anger issues. He doesn't even listens to other's opinion. My opinion or my wishes doesn't mean anything to him because according to him  ""If you're not able to get government jobs then you're a loser. ""
I wanna go out of this house, I can't live in this place anymore but there's a guilt feeling as well that I'm abandoning them. I've been putting up with whatever they want for too long, killed my wishes to fulfill theirs but not anymore.

626,"Hey advisors, 

So, I am a married 29M currently in graduate school. Currently, I am pursuing a DVM. It just seemed like a relatively low stress, easy career after school that has a good salary and good job security. I am pretty good at the sciences and hate computer related work (programming, installing, IT, etc.) so vet school seemed like an easy and well-paid job.

My wife ultimately wants to be a stay-at-home mother when we have kids and then work when they're in school (she has a job she enjoys but it does not make very much money, this is totally fine with me she can do whatever she wants)

The issue is, there isn't really anything I want to do. I have worked in construction, at restaurants, was in the military, customer service, as a network installer, etc. I have done a lot of jobs and they all were just a way to afford things. I went to school for computer science and then for physical sciences, I didn't particularly enjoy/like either (I was just good at physical sciences).

I feel like I am just doing things out of necessity, habit, or routine. I work because I have to work to pay the bills. I am in school because that is basically what is expected of me? I guess? I will say that I feel guilty about going to school (it was really competitive and only 6% of applicants got in, I took a spot from someone that probably dreamed of becoming a vet).

How can I find something to be passionate about? I don't really have any hobbies that I do, generally just things that make time go by faster (drinking, video games, working out).

I’ve been doing my job a long time and I should not be making errors like this.  Shit happens but I’m not very forgiving of myself. 

Any advice on how to approach my boss with an apology?  What should I say?  

I’m really beating myself up but truly, this should have never happened.

Does anyone else get in a major funk after screwing up????",26Aug2020,1

633,"So my cat is wonderful. I love him to death, I have had him for 14 years. He looks like a lion with a magnificent mane. He normally sleeps in my room over night on my bed with me and it has never been an issue. 

However recently I have been awoken at 5am several mornings to a mass slamming into my head from my cat jumping directly on my face. My bed is kind of by my desk and windowsill. He literally batista bombs me every morning now and it sucks.

If I don't let him sleep in my room he will claw my door begging to be let in. How do I stop his reign of terror?",26Aug2020,1
634," A little back story: A few months ago my boyfriend and I moved in together into a home with 2 stories and a basement. My boyfriend has a dog that is not fond (or rather too fond) of cats and so we decided that while they got used to each other's presence we would keep the cat on the second floor with our bedroom, office and bathroom while the dog would be downstairs with the kitchen, living room and outdoors access. They would be divided by a baby gate. My cat is 14 years old and has lived with other cats and dogs before (only small dogs), and the dog is a 6 year old Aussie that has lived with a dog before but isn't really good with dogs or cats in general. The first month this worked wonderfully, and we started letting each of them explore the others' space while the other wasn't present - then while the other was present but kept distanced and supervised. This has actually gone quite well- as long as we tell the dog to ""leave it"" he doesn't chase her, and she has stopped hissing at him. They aren't getting along but are coexisting with some tension.

2 weeks ago the cat, Lily, was hanging out downstairs while being supervised and ended up going into the basement after I finished some laundry down there- which is sort of a finished basement. It is safe for her to be down there, but pretty boring. For some reason though she has become ADDICTED to the basement. She always wants to be down there and when she is down there she meows for someone to join her. When I go down to see what she wants she seems to just want loves or something else??. I have been letting her be down there as much as she wants (except at night when we can't monitor them), because I thought it was one of those ""I want it because it is new/forbidden"" but after almost 2 weeks she is still crazy about the basement and I can't figure out why. The dog also goes down there occasionally, so it isn't a non-dog space, and there aren't any signs of rodents or anything (a couple of spiders is it). She doesn't like to be around the dog, yet risks walking right past him to go to the basement, and to come up from the basement to meow at us to come down.

I just don't understand this behavior - she is meowing like she is out of food, or has a dirty litter box, but is just sitting down there. I am unsure what to do, should I put a litter box, and bed down there? Should I restrict access? I know she is potentially stressed because of moving and living with the dog- but this doesn't seem like a logical stress response since it forces her away from her comfort items (beds, toys, food, etc.) that are upstairs, and puts her near the dog and in a cold basement with nothing to do.

I just want my little lady to be happy, so I have been letting her roam to her hearts content, but she seems upset when myself or my boyfriend are not in the basement with her (which, we don't have much of a reason to be down there, there aren't any seats/desks for work and it's pretty chilly). Does anyone have any advice or similar experiences?",26Aug2020,1
635,"Hey I live in the uk and I have a Pomeranian 9 years old she’s been suffering with dry itchy skin all her life she tends to pull her hair out and bite her skin creating open sores on her back. This usually happens every summer I put cream on the sores and that usually helps But lately it’s got worse she’s pulled all her hair out on her back and made it all scabby and very red.

Cream only seems to be working to take the redness away but not solving the problem I’ve tried everything flea and tick treatments, nappy cream, itch sprays and brushing her daily nothing. So I was thinking maybe changing her food to a tailored made dog food for sensitive itchy skin to see if that works but I wanna know what’s the best brand or if anyone knows of a good one that’s helped their dogs.

Please pm or comment any treatments or dog food that you can think of that may help thank you.

636,"I work in the veterinary field, but have been trying to get out for a long time. It's a physically and emotionally exhausting job with little pay and most hospitals are severely understaffed, so we have to work twice as hard to keep up with the volume. When lockdown started, our practice exploded. For months, there were only two of us working at a time to minimize exposure, and I was one of two full time techs working during the worst of it. 

  
There were so many days that it was ungodly busy and I was running myself getting pets from their cars, assisting with their appointments, doing tech appointments, helping reception because there was only one receptionist and three phone lines that never stopped ringing, etc. During the worst of it, my boss would leave for the duration of the two hour lunch period, leaving me there by myself for the first hour, and no tech on at all during the second. There were many days where I *couldn't* take a lunch break because the phones were going crazy and I didn't want to leave our receptionist to deal with all of it on her own. Not to mention, often the calls were from owners asking questions about their sick pets, etc. Technicians need to talk to these clients to ask questions and advise the clients whether their pet needs to be seen, go to the ER, etc. During this time, I lost at least 20 lbs. There was no time to eat breakfast in the mornings because it was always so busy, and I hardly ever got to take a lunch break, so I would try to grab food whenever there was a quiet moment, but those were few and far between. 

  
Since COVID started, our assistant has taken a week long vacation to another state, my boss took a week long vacation, several doctors have gone on vacations, one tech was on furlough for three months, and the other was working a very limited schedule (2 days a week or so). Since COVID started, I've had a total of 3 days off. I felt guilty calling out 2 days because I just needed a mental health day, but always made sure to do it on days when we had relief techs working so they wouldn't be extra short handed. The other day off, I begged for because we had a relief tech coming back and I was near burnout. 

  
Things came to a head a couple weeks ago when I found a lump in my breast. My doctor is understandably booked up, so I had to schedule an appointment about a month out. This has obviously been taking a toll on me emotionally, which makes work a little more difficult, but I try not to think about it. With this added stress, exhaustion, and being in physical pain from work injuries, I broke down one day when I was head butt very hard in the side of the head by a 130 lb dog. I went outside to breakdown and cry for a bit. My boss came out to see how I was and I told her everything that has been going on and how exhausted I am from months and months of non-stop sprinting, not eating during the day, and now worrying about my health. She, to my surprise, did mention the fact that everyone else has been able to take their time off to recover during this, but I've been powering through and deserve time off as well. Unfortunately, because she keeps us barely staffed and there's no way I can call out without fucking over the entire team, I'll have to wait a month before she can give me a couple extra days off. 

  
Every day walking into that building, I feel my heart sink, my back starts hurting, my head starts hurting, and I'm immediately in a terrible mood. It's severely impacting my mental health, and I already have so much on my mind. I am so tempted to put in my notice and take out a loan to pay my bills for the next month or so until I can find something else, but obviously that's not an option because I need my health insurance in case this lump turns out to be more than just a fibroadenoma. I don't know what to do. I can't keep going like this, and I'm so tired and burnt out. There aren't many options for therapy for me because of my shitty insurance and the fact that I wouldn't be able to afford it regardless. I'm doing the best I can and trying to keep my head above water, but I just can't keep going anymore. 

  
I think I just want to vent more than anything, but if anyone who has been in a similar situation reads this, I would love to hear your thoughts and experiences and how you were able to get yourself out of a toxic work environment despite being broke as hell. I just want time off. I want to be able to recover and focus on my health rather than busting my ass for a company that doesn't even care enough about me to make sure I have a chance to eat during a 10 hour shift. Sorry for rambling, but if you took the time to read this, I appreciate it. And if anyone out there feels the same as me, you're not alone.",26Aug2020,1
637,"TW: mention of sexual assault / rape 

If this isn’t the right subreddit for this kind of thing, please let me know. The rules don’t seem to have anything against it but I’m just not completely sure where to go here.

Let’s get into it: I have a friend who I’ve known since before I can remember. I’ll call him D in this. We’re not very close, don’t go to the same school, don’t see each other very much, etc. but we’re friendly for sure.

D was accused of sexual assault / rape recently, and there were receipts posted which makes it pretty clear these accusations are true. D never denied it, was met with a lot of hate and ended up deactivating some social media and privatizing their other platforms to varying degrees.

As for me, I wasn’t involved with this situation in any direct way. I don’t know the victim. I certainly don’t stand for sexual assault, and I don’t feel comfortable continuing a friendship with D, but explaining to him how I even found out about this situation to him would be really tough. I’m torn, morally, by feeling an obligation to stand up to a predator and by feeling like it’s not my place to get involved. 

I have a couple friends who also know about this and who I’ve been talking to. This was recent and we’re all still pretty freaked out by it, so I would really appreciate any rational advice from an outside view. What should I do?",26Aug2020,1

643,"All of us are in the same friends group for few years now. She was his first love and I remember I always thought they were perfect for each other - even if you just saw them together, you couldn’t help it, same energy, vibe... And I honestly very rarely see someone as “made for each other” and when they were dating our whole friends group could just agree they indeed looked like that. They broke up year ago and she completely broke his heart. 
5 months ago we started being FWB, later he asked me if I would like to be his gf. Everything is perfect - I love him, his family really likes me, I could never find more perfect bf, he do everything he can to show me how much he loves me. 
So... here’s the problem. Even thought I know I mean a lot to him and he kind of hates his ex for what she did, I can’t help it but compare myself to her. I was never jealous in my life, but when I think about her I just become insecure. She is my friend and indeed character and body goals. Like she have her mistakes but just amazing person and friend. And ever since we accidently got to coffee together It’s even worse. They aren’t doing anything to make me insecure (they don’t even talk) but I still feel like she is way more perfect than me and he loved her diffrently. Then there’s overthinking who would he actually rather choose (if she wouldn’t hurt him)... Idk why but I almost see her as my bf soulmate and that hurts because they aren’t even doing anything to make me feel that way. 
Any tips how to help it? I never felt insecure about something like that before.",26Aug2020,1
644,"***TL;DR***: Evacuated due to a fire, now stuck in a very unhealthy situation with family. I need out. I have the money to rent a room, but no credit or references.

I've been stuck in a very unhealthy situation since the lockdown started, and the effect it has had on me has made it difficult to seek out housing elsewhere, look for a job, or return to school. I have been working hard to learn everything I need to function in everyday life - I was in a peculiar situation which did not sure me the opportunity to learn these skills for many years - but I'm still learning a lot of things, and having family in my daily life makes it difficult in the best of circumstances.

I've been evacuated from a fire and wound up with extended family. It is an unhealthy situation for me both because family can trigger PTSD-like symptoms and because they and many people in their local group of friends are taking risks like traveling, exposing themselves to an extended friend group, etc while taking zero precautions. I knew they were seeing a few friends in their community before I came, but did not imagine the extent of it. I'm finding out now that many of them have fallen prey to outlandish far right conspiracy theories.

I need advice on finding a place to rent, temporarily or long term. I may be able to return to where I was staying in the next few weeks, but the situation wasn't significantly better, aside from COVID concerns.  I have no credit or references, and I have little idea of how to navigate the process of renting a room. I learn quickly and I am self sufficient once I do, but I have no one to teach me. If not for COVID, and now the fire and my current situation, this wouldn't be so hard, but right now I need a little help to get started.

645,"I happened to notice an odd looking bruise on my breast a few hours ago. I don’t remember bumping it. I made a drs appt to have it checked tomorrow. I feel fine in every other way. I don’t have breast cancer in my family and I’m somewhat healthy other than my Diet Coke habit that I’m trying to break.

Anyway, I think the thing that has me most concerned is that after researching online bruising on the breast seems to be a sign of an an aggressive form of breast cancer! So my fear is that it might be a real deadly cancer! 

I spoke on the phone to a doctor friend and he told me that it could have been caused by improperly fit clothes...which I do have problems with my bras fitting right or taking too much ibuprofen since that can cause easy bleeding and bruises...and I have definitely been doing that! I’ve been taking lots of ibuprofen lately. ...so maybe that’s it? I just wish the bruise was not on my breast though since that’s the part that has me most concerned.

Well, a week after that post, my grandfather (m60) and legal guardian had to be hospitalized because he fell and was unresponsive for a good minute or two. Turns out it was because of covid and his oxygen levels were extremely low. He's stable now, but as hopeful as I am, his survival isn't guaranteed. 

A day after that, I and my family (grandmother (f55), sister (f17), &amp; me), who've been having flu-like symptoms previously, went and got tested. Well, turned out we all had it. But it wasn't severe enough to land up in the hospital just yet so we were told to just ride it out at home. Today I'm doing a lot better, but this morning (well it still is morning at the time I'm writing this) my grandmother felt extremely weak and had to go to the hospital. They said she's dehydrated and will probably be admitted into the hospital,  and regardless, I think she'll be fine too, but you never know.

Well, onto the part that worries me the most. My family has had severe financial issues since I was a child. If my grandfather dies, we'll be left with even more debt from the medical bills (good ol' America) and will probably be homeless. My grandmother can't work either &amp; nor can I because I don't have my license yet and I need to focus on school (homeschool). If my sister manages to land a job, it will be a minimum wage job that won't be enough to support us. And if my grandmother gets financial support, it won't be enough for us to survive either.

661,"I’m 23 and I have schizoid personality disorder. I don’t understand feelings that well and don’t have many. I hate people as well. I have always been different (my opinion good) and liked the idea of inflicting pain on someone else. 2 years ago I went on a night out with my friends. I got pretty drunk, had a fight and I ended up getting stabbed. I sat there watching the blood pour out of me and I will tell you now that blood looks absolutely beautiful at night. Surprisingly it didn’t hurt actually and I laughed my way to the hospital in an ambulance. 

Ever since then all I’ve wanted to do is hurt people. For example, I had a dream about cutting the throat of someone and watching the blood spill on the floor. I admit I have very, very little empathy. I keep playing the image in my head and puts a smile on my face. I have had therapy before but that stopped after a little while. I personally don’t think anything is wrong. After all, everyone is different. I only have relationships when they benefit me or if I feel like manipulating someone for fun.

My friend says I need help but I haven’t done anything and everyone has a weird fantasy or dream here or there. Do I need help???",26Aug2020,1

663,"I'm a 19 (20 in December) years old computer science student (on my third semester right now, the course has 8 semesters) i have some experience with programming, and i think i have a good amount of theorical knowledge about programming, computers, and math in general. But the thing is, i have a huge lack of motivation, i just can't complete a project without rage quitting in the first major difficulty, i am a really shitty programmer just because of the fact that i can't deal with my frustrations and i drop every single thing that i try to make.

The worse is, i know how to make stuff, i know how to fix the bugs that fucks me, i know exactly what to do and how to do, but i prefer to not continue working in a project because i know that in the first minor problem i will rage quit. I have no discipline and i am lazy as fuck and don't want to deal with problems.

To be fair, when i have a job to do or a school project, i can work and motive/discipline myself and finish the project that i am working. But if it is just a project for myself or an idea that i think it's worth it, i just can't discipline myself and deal with my frustrations. When i have to make something for someone else or if i have to deal with punishment if i don't complete (school stuff/work stuff) i can discipline myself.

How can i deal better with my frustrations? I think that i am a shitty programmer and i will always be if i still act like this, i can't study what i want because of this shitty fear of failing, and the worse is that i can't make projects and show stuff that i did, because essentially in 3 years of programming i did nothing relevant.

Sorry about any grammar error, English is not my first language and i am typing this on a cellphone. If you didn't understood something, just ask me and i will try to be more clear.

669,"Long story short my bf and I have been dating for 5 years. We are both brown but we're from different cultures that have a long history of hating each other. Both sets of parents are aware that we're together but they have always encouraged us to break up because of cultural differences. We don't really care about that stuff and we got engaged last weekend.
 I don't know how to tell my parents especially now because my brother is suddenly having a traditional cultural engagement (probably in a month or so and there are a lot of events leading up to it). Everytime I talk to my parents they talk about my brother's relationship and meeting his gfs family and I feel like it's a bad time as they will probably just discredit my engagement or throw a fit or possibly even make it seem like I got engaged to ruin his moment. 
Side note they have refused to meet and talk to my bf until this point because they ""don't know what to say"" when I really pushed they would just stall and push it off.
Honestly I just want this to be drama free. My bf wants to meet my parents badly and he's suggesting that I call them and give him the phone and let him tell them.
What's the best way of doing this? Would it be so bad if I texted them and said I got engaged and left it at that?
Should I wait until my brother is engaged as well?

Honestly it's frustrating to know they're practically out in my yard idling for so so long, these are gas vehicles it can't be good for the environment. 

Besides the fact that it's starting to creep me out coz it's none of my business to ask why they're parked and idling on a inner neighborhood street. Could be a private investigator, inspector, dealers, renting wifi from someone?

My anxiety is definitely up when these dudes are parked. I've been trying to get to my homework but I literally can't help myself to peer out the front door window.

Hey guys, I'm a grad student (23 F) currently living in NYC with 2 other roommates (27 and 30 F)- let's  call them Sarah and Hally.

We get along very well and mesh well together as roommates. 

We recently got a new, bigger, apartment with Sarah's classmate, Hally. Sarah and I are sharing a room while Hally pays more for rent for her own. I was fine with this arrangement until lately, as I've  started feeling like I have no space to myself. I still enjoy living with Sarah, and I'm  slowly working my way to being comfortable with Hally, but I can't  just help feeling this nagging desire to just live by myself.

I’m gonna start by saying I’m 14 years old and I will soon need to come before state police in order to try to get them on my side, I guess. Recently (about a week ago) me and two of my friends entered a university building in my hometown of Potsdam New York and vandalized a chalkboard. We were exploring the building, as we had found an unlocked door leading into the basement level and we made our way up from there through the whole building looking around finding cool biology stuff like fossils and reptiles, having a good time, until we found an open classroom with a chalkboard and chalk to write with. Us, being the stupid fucking teenagers we are decided to write on the chalkboard. My one friend drew a penis, and my other friend wrote “bruh”. What did I write you might ask? I, the astronomically stupid fucking retard that I am, wrote “FUCK THE POLICE” in all caps. We then left the building and came back a few times after that to look at our writing, at one point some other person had written “damn right, #ACAB” in reference to my writing. Now before you start to call me out, I don’t actually believe that all of America’s police are pieces of shit, in fact most of the ones I know irl are pretty chill, but I’d seen a video on police brutality earlier that day and decided to write about it because why not. I now realize this was a terrible mistake because prior to the writing of this post I learned that camera footage in the building had caught me and my friends and that there was now an active search by university police to find us. I understand the gravity of the situation and I am aware that I need to come clean which I plan to do, even more recently I learned that police would like to meet with me and my friends and speak to us about our actions, but what I’m worried about is that the university police in my town are New York State police which means that if they so choose, they can arrest me or send me to court. I doubt I’ll end up in jail but I’m worried about the consequences of my actions and potential legal repercussions.

Because of rona (our area is still in stage 4 lockdown) and our mental issues none of us have jobs atm so we’re living off of benefits. We live okay splitting bills between the 3 of us but with only 2 it will be rough.
My partner’s sister was apparently planning to stay until the end of the year at least. We’d had this conversation only a few days ago and it seemed like she understood that we’d need notice if she wanted to leave. We thought she was with us for the next 5 months. And that we wouldn’t have to worry about money.

Turns out she’s planning to go back to that stupid toxic ass household with her new boyfriend. That household with her toxic, abusive “parents” and her sociopath ex boyfriend/stepbrother. She hasn’t even told us any of this. Another housemate from that place told my partner that he overheard that’s what her plans are. 

This could very well be those parents doing whatever they fuck they do (somehow take people’s words and make them something else, and then tells that to everyone). And it could be what she’s actually planning. I wouldn’t put it past her. And she’s not being open about it. She’s doing it behind our backs.

But my partner obviously feels used by his own family once again.
I feel used. I’ve given this girl so much of myself.
She knows we have so many debts, and that we’d struggle without her input here. So if she’s going to go, like fine but at least give us some fucking warning you know? Let us prepare.

And I just can’t see the reasoning behind it. She has a good support system here. We don’t do drugs. We’ve made our home a sober one (no drugs or alcohol) for her benefit because she’s the one that abuses those substances and we’re the ones that have to clean up the mess.
Like, I’ve had to tell her off for eating my food without asking 3 times in the past few weeks and she doesn’t like all of that so she’s going home to her abusive and toxic family where they encouraged her substance abuse. Okay? 
She’s going to ruin all the hard work she’s put into getting better.

And we won’t be here for her if she decides she doesn’t like that either. We’ll be going low contact and when our lease is up we’re getting the fuck out of this shit hole.

Update:
The information we were given was slightly incorrect. She was given the option to move back to that place because her parents are moving out and her ex bf/stepbrother and friend need a third person there, and she’s seriously considering it. She told us yesterday and we came to the conclusion that whatever she wants to do is fine as long as she keeps us updated and gives us notice before moving.

Today however she just left the house to go hang out with her ex/stepbrother  and is staying the night without telling us or even asking. 
The reason this is a problem is obviously because we’re under stage 4 lockdown and strict restrictions. It’s illegal for her to go there in the first place. But I am also high risk. She is aware of this. The other members of that household are aware of this. The members of that household have continuously broken restriction laws.
They’re showing such blatant disrespect for my health and potentially my life. 

Recently tensions have been a little high around our house due to other things (like her damaging our rental and her stealing food and such. She doesn’t like being told off for it either. She’s been wanting to break restrictions the whole time she’s lived here.) but after all of this shit has happened I just want her out.
You might have noticed that we sound quite strict here, and that is a reason she wants to leave I think. However we have these rules in place for all of our benefits, and although it might not feel like it to her, especially hers. She was meant to live with us so we could take care of her and help her get better. We’ve done that to the best of our ability but you can’t help someone that doesn’t want to be helped. She’s young and immature. I’ve lost so much of my respect for her.

And right now I’m extremely angry at her. It’s been 5 hours since I found out she left and I’m still fuming. I want to tell her to not come back at all, that she’s not welcome here anymore, blah blah.
I did send her a message saying that she’s breaking restrictions, our rules, and that I feel really disrespected but I got left on read.

I don’t know what to do about her anymore. I just want to go off at her, to scream at her. Even though I know that won’t solve anything. I just feel so fucking angry about it. That I’m making sacrifices and haven’t seen my own family and friends for at least 4 months, I don’t even remember the last time I left the fucking house and she decides she gets to go wherever she wants whenever she wants with no regard to my health and safety whatsoever. Fucking hell.",26Aug2020,1

697,"Hey. So I've been really struggling trying to unpack why my relationship actually ended.
I (23) had a really rough start with my ex (25) girlfriend, I basically waited a year for her to actually date me. (She was only seeing me and I was only seeing her) she was just unsure. She wanted me to change a lot about myself due to religion but eventually we started dating and she started to accept me more. I had a really close friend through all this who had feelings for me but was respectful of my relationship. When I started dating my ex, I stopped hanging out with this friend because my gf was worried. 
My girlfriend and I were arguing a lot, and we never saw each other and I know now her request for me to not see my friend wasn't unreasonable but it felt controlling cause it was other girls too, and this person was a really close friend. Amidst all this I started to miss my friend and was getting mad my gf wanted me to cut people off but wouldn't hang out with me to fill that lonely void (Religious stuff again about being alone, no sex etc) and we didn't message much, I felt annoying when we talked. I started to feel like I had feelings for my friend because we were more compatible and I think it was just cause i missed them. This all eventually lead me to break up with my gf after 4 months of dating. She wanted to get married and that scared me cause we barely knew each other cause we could never hangout and then I had these feelings. I felt sort of relieved after, but also sad because she was the first girl to not cheat on me. 
After we broke up I hooked up with my friend a few times and admitted I liked her but wasn't ready to date again yet. After a few weeks of hanging out I cut her off, realizing I wasn't over my ex and needed to sort through that and I knew she wanted more than I could offer and I felt as if I was using her. I sorted out my feelings for a few months and realized I wanted my ex back so I told her I missed her and when she found out about the hookups she was angry so I left her alone for a while. I tried again a few months later and she was more open so I waited.
Fast forward she knows I thought I had feelinga for my friend and hooked up she has forgiven me. I feel like we broke up and were fighting because of my friend more than because of our issues. I dont know if I left my gf for the right reasons and I feel guilty even if I've spent a year trying to make it up to her. I'm afraid I left her for my friend rather than because we weren't working maybe im overthinking, and feel undeserving of this second chance.
Advice please:(

698,So my friend has always had low self esteem and is very self deprecating but for the past few months she’s attempted to force herself to eat less and when she accomplishes that she prides herself off of it and how long she can make herself go without food. As the mom friend I try to constantly tell her why that behavior isn’t ok and isn’t going to help her but she doesn’t listen to me. She thinks that that makes her strong and I’m really scared for her because her parents don’t care if she doesn’t eat anything all day. Sometimes she goes as far as only eating a bagel and a few tomatoes in a day. I just can’t help but be worried.,26Aug2020,1

My fiance had blood clots and real bad cramps and she showed the doctor picture of her blood. It is called production of conception in which cases mostly lead to miscarriage. This sucks so much. We had a vision and was going to buy a puppy so that the pup and grow with our kid.

701,"I’ve lost all confidence since last summer. I had been talking to this girl and things got pretty serious. We would talk alllll the time, imo too much which is why we didn’t work out. Regardless, it was really nice having someone who chose to care about me and genuinely did. 

During this time, I was transferring schools and was therefor losing a good chunk of friends other than those I would personally reach out to online to keep in touch. During the last week or so of summer, she said she wanted a break. I was pretty sad. We had a good thing going, or so I thought. 

Its been a while now, almost a complete year, but I still feel like i’m missing a piece of my life now. I try and try to remind myself it’s in the past and that i lived without her before, but it’s completely changed my lifestyle. I sit around at home on my computer all day, not like I can do much cause of covid anyways, but I was doing this pre-covid as well, other than school. When school came around last year I was a complete shut in. I did not talk or reach out to anybody, and instead sat in the corner on my phone. I hated it because I felt left out but it was really a reflection of my own choices to not go talk to others. 

I’m now at a place in life where I feel I can look back on this year and decide that if/when I go thru another breakup I won’t let it destroy an entire year of my life. I’m now in the process of trying to regain courage, confidence, and a better sense of reading people, but I really don’t know how to do any of those things.

Has anyone been through something similar, or can give some tips on what to do in a situation like this? Any reply is appreciated, thank you.",26Aug2020,1
702," Hey Reddit, I'm going to a HS with a uniform for the first time. I went a couple days ago to buy a uniform bc school is starting soon. Uniforms are obviously overpriced, they didn't fit me well and looked awful to say the least. I don't care that the uniform looks bad, I'm not going to a fashion show. My mom on the other hand, went insane and stomped out of the store. She refuses to buy me a uniform because they are expensive and it looks horrible on me. She wants to buy me shirts and pants that are the same color from another store. I explained to her that I don't want to get kicked out of school on the first day. She says if they do, she will transfer me to another school. I called the school to ask if we can make a comprise, like pay over time for the uniform (?) But, nobody answers and it  goes straight to voicemail saying to check the website blah blah. Everyone I know that has an extra uniform doesn't even close to fit me. Believe me, I've tried everything and I'm all out of ideas. All help is appreciated

706,"I’ve been getting to know and meeting up with a guy for a month now who I met online. I was looking for pals and we started chatting. 

Sometimes our conversations would get lightly flirty, but we’re both single, so I played along because it was fun and I genuinely liked him and noticed he had lots of great qualities. I also wasn’t opposed to romance in the future either, but we never directly talked about anything of the sort.

Since the beginning of our conversations, we had spoken about watching movies together, as I wanted to introduce him to a lot of stuff he hasn’t seen. This week he invited me (the same day) to watch movies at his place at night. I was excited to go, but wasn’t sure if he was expecting a “booty call” despite not explicitly talking about sex, due to this being a common expectation when people invite others over (especially at night). 

Thus, out of curiosity, I asked him about his intentions and he said “movies and kissing.”

I talked it over with a friend, since I was conflicted and unsure if he wanted to steer this into a FWB situation. The more I talked with my friend, the more it seemed he wanted sex and I was sure I didn’t want to go there, especially so quickly and not knowing how he felt about me. So I replied that I didn’t do sexual stuff without any strings attached, but was okay with cuddling. He messaged me some time later asking when I was available. 

I was a little stung because all this time he seemed like he truly liked me and all of the sudden he was interested in just watching movies alone in his room. Or so I assumed. Afterwards I responded that I simply wanted to be just friends (even though I’m unsure of that) and for him to let me know if he wanted to do something else besides watch movies.

But I am now regretting it. I did like him. Had I explicitly known how he felt and wanted, I would’ve known how to act and would’ve said how I feel. 

Is it too late to express that I regret declining the movies and potentially making out/ being a little more intimate than before? Is it even worth it or will I seem desperate and confused? Is there a chance he just wants sex out of the equation and doesn’t truly like me?",26Aug2020,1
707,"[*Some basic info before we jump into it. I'm currently a sous chef in a small but popular cafe. I have 3 years kitchen exp, 1year at my current place.*]

So during the past week or so I was unhappy for multiple reasons. The reason can be sumed up to im board and sick of cafe food and want to move on to ""real"" cooking. So I decided to reach out to some high end kitchens. I wasn't exspecting much but, I got alot back. Almost all of them want me in for test shifs in some way.

Unfortunately my current boss found out (its a very conected industry and eveyone knows everyone) and offers and imitate counter offer. 

**1)** Pay rise effective on next month, but lose one day of work. (Worded as an exstra day off, or a day to do spend on no.2)
**2)** Guidance and training form one of the two major restrant head chefs in my area (ether an award winning French resturant or a ultra high end award winning hotel) unpaid during days off. *NOTE: I also have interviews with both locations. I also have no way to know of this will really happen or if he's just bs-ing.*

My current boss knows how to pull my strings, he knows I like high end chef work and aspire to work at that level. But due to how I entered the sector knows I also lack knolage and training.

During our conversation he said that I dont have much to offer these places and should look to volunteer in return for training. (Not uncommon in this industry) but the loss of one day a week would put my finances in danger, even with the payrise. I'm not sure im ok with that. He also mentioned that I haven't been proactive in my own development at the cafe since I havnt put any dishes forward to him (I think this is due to my lack of knolage, henc why I need more guidance or training)

I do agree that at my current level I couldn't offer these places much other than time availability and dedication. I also don't belive that any of the places would offer the same hours at the rate im at now to ensure I can afford my rent. 

**I really just don't know what to do; **

If I stay and don't take the new offer I look like an ass and I won't enjoy my work.

If I take the new offer I get what I want but won't be able to pay rent. 

If I take another job they probs wont offer me the same pay and I might fail the probation time puting me in massive financial danger.

708,"Some backstory: We met online when we were 12 and continued being friends until we were around 17 (it was kind of on and off). Eventually, I realized she was a really toxic person so I decided to drop her.

I wished her the best of luck and I blocked her. I was tired of her insulting me (i.e. saying things about my acne) and my drawings, copying everything I did and wore then accused me of ""copying,"" threatening to k\*ll herself if I didn't do what she asked, and etc., that's why I dropped her. Nowadays, she's continuously harassing me on social media. Just today, she used a throwaway account to send me a Tik Tok with her doing her make up and the caption read ""You wish your face was as clear as mine ;)"" The other thing she did was indirect me multiple times on her Twitter saying stuff like ""I know all those little relatable things you retweet are about me. I'm not the insecure one, you are, hon!"" and the one that worried me was when she messaged me ""Nobody would care if you drowned.""

715,"So my father has always been a shit talker and an egotistical guy who always ""knows everything"". He always wants everyone in my family to do what he says even when what he says is bad, more than that he starts berating us for literal hours when we do anything differently even if what we did was better.

I met my girlfriend around a year and a half ago and he instantly hated her, he is the type of father who always tried to teach me why women are the root of all evil, why I should only stay with a girl for sex and then leave her etc. The problem is that I hate guys like that and have never done what he taught me, obviously because I haven't done what he said he had hour long arguments with me regarding this subject every couple days.

Me and my girlfriend had an altercation with a woman last year because said woman was the aunt of an ex boyfriend of my girlfriend that she had a 2 weeks relationship with him 4 years ago, ever since then she hated her, her ex is a lying cunt that always shit talks everybody, much like my old man.

After that altercation, that prostitute's pimp chased me and my girlfriend for about 12 streets. He wouldn't quit so we hid in a bush and called some friends which decided it would be a good ideea to call my dad, my dad came with those friends and had a fight with the pimp.

Later that night he told me to break up with her, I refused and about 3 weeks of daily beatings from him occurred, he also broke my phone so I couldn't call her. I came with a plan involving my grandma to go to a friend of hers to call my girlfriend there so she could call me back on my grandma's phone (which had no credit so I couldn't call from it). I talked to her and we came up with a plan to stay into hiding at her parents' house for a few days and then board a train to a nearby city and find a job (We were both 18 at the time but hadn't finished highschool yet). We did just that, I turned off the security cameras and left on foot with a lot of baggages at 4 a.m. (pops is a paranoid freak and installed cameras to monitor me, my mom and grandma while he is not at home). Fast forward a few days of non-stop calls and searches and I was in another city working in a restaurant.

We made up after a few months and I came back home to finish high school (fast forward around half a year and here it goes to shit). With the baccalaureate around the corner my dad would have me work every moment in his service with him, I ended up failing at maths and he blamed my girlfriend for ""convincing me to fail so I could marry her and move instead of going to college"". My girlfriend was always supportive and would talk to me every night when I would break down because I had no time to study and always helped with everything she could. My father made up lots of lies during this year and a half about her so he could separate us but I always found out and now he did it again and I can't take it anymore.

He has this girl best friend he used to date, and she wants him back, and she hates me. they talk all the time and she’s constantly inviting him over. she’s really sneaky and i’m worried and almost certain that she’s in his head and she’s gonna take him back from me. last night he and i got into a spat because he started insulting me and my hygeine because i shower once a day and apparently that’s not enough to him lol and i don’t use lotion which is crazy to him because he was raised to always use lotion. so i assumed he was already in a bad mood because he usually doesn’t insult me and it wasn’t like i only shower once a week or anything crazy, and when he was fed up with me trying to understand why he was insulting me and being so upset, he just got pissed off and said “she was right about you.” i’m almost certain that the person who said that to him was the girl best friend and she’s in his head making me look like the bad guy so he’ll leave. i really don’t know what to do because i like him, but i haven’t seen him since before quarantine began and we started dating during the pandemic, so i haven’t seen him since march and the last time i saw him we were just friends. i have trust issues so sometimes it’s hard for me to not think that he’s cheating on me or that the girl isn’t gonna steal him back, and it hurts him that i can’t fully trust him but i’ve been hurt before and i’ve seen far too many others get hurt in situations like the one we’re in. i really care about him but i just don’t know what to do. if she’s trying to take him away from me, i can’t just ask him to stop talking to her because it’s his best friend and he knows we don’t get along but talks to us both anyways. she sends him nudes but he still accepts them and he has a nude collection and last night after our argument he was talking about how he wanted to fuck a celebrity and i don’t think he realizes how much that hurts. i’m saving myself for marriage which he says he’s fine with but he’s done it before a few times with a few different people and is horny by nature, i’m worried he’s gonna do things on the side, especially with this girl because they’ve done it before. it really really hurts but i care about him and he cares about me. i’m really just lost, and i need some advice. any input welcome.

721,"Hello everyone, 
I’ve been working for this company for two months now and I’m so confused... I need advice on how to outsmart the office bully. 
Basically during the pandemic I was called for a job interview and the boss told me he intended to replace someone in the office because she did not speak German. He told me she wasn’t particularly unfit for the job but the language thing was really getting in the way. He told me he wanted to be discreet as not to let this person (let’s call her Karen because she is one) know that she was going to be replaced. I assumed She’d be gone by the time I got there, which turned out not to be the case. Fast forward a couple of weeks and I soon begin to realize that not only she hadn’t been fired but she is basically the worst person ever. She immediately begin to belittle me (I have a PhD while she’s a high school dropout who thinks she’s supposed to my job but she was initially hired to clean the archive) and involve me in the office drama. I do not ever speak about the fact that I’m way more qualified than her so I don’t sound annoying in any way. Aside from lying about her high school diploma her main activities include:
-absolutely not doing any of the tasks she’s assigned while blowing every little thing she does out of proportion to sound busy 
- bullying the engineer (who is the sweetest girl) and convincing the bosses to hate her (spoiler: she succeeded) 
- talking shit about everyone (especially the engineer) and texting the boss who likes her the most about everyone’s every move 
-laughing out loud for hours with a coworker she’s friends with 
-plotting revenge by messing up people’s schedules while coming in and out whenever she wants 
- chatting with the boss, who said he really appreciates people who take frequent breaks to tell jokes and gossip. He scolded me for not chatting enough but at the same time Karen reported to him that I chat to much with the engineer

Somehow Karen  (she really is worse than she sounds) managed not only to sound smarter than the engineer but she even convinced them she did things she’d never do (like shopping online while working and stealing) even though she has no proof. Many people are tired of her constant trash talk but are not in the position to report her. 
I’ve tried to talk to the bosses but not only they told me that they threatened the engineered because she complained about Karen,  they’re also not sure they want to fire her anymore. 
Also she doesn’t like the fact that I’ve become friends with the engineer. 
The boss who has a soft spot for her says he likes that she’s outspoken and and rude because he thinks that’s a sign of strength and justifies everything she does. 
She’s suppose to testify in court for a case the company is involved in, but I don’t know if that counts because she was supposed to be fired anyway. They only dragged her contract because they temporarily needed her but she was basically useless. 
Ps: we are all women in our early 30s 

I know I’m going to be her next victim but complaining about her hasn’t helped...What should my next move be ? 


TLDR : Office bully was supposed to be fired but somehow she now rules the company.

I have to have a video conference with the Dean now.

I don't care if I lose my scholarship, I don't care if I get a zero.  I handed both essays in at once, but he's treating it as two separate events.

Nothing about this deserves empathy, but just know that I am a very capable student and want to continue my studies.  How do I get this behind me?

726,"So, first I’ll tell the back story. She made some TikTok video of her arguing with some guy over text. I don’t remember what it was about but the guy was texting a bunch of slurs that go against me and other races because he was saying how he like grew up saying them or something?? I don’t really remember but I know it was very wrong of him, but he’s irrelevant in this. So she says those slurs aloud in her voiceover thing and she was like “it sounds like he just made up a bunch of random words and called them slurs.” It kind of hurt me when she said that, because it was very ignorant of her- she could’ve just did a 30 second search and educated herself.

732,"Hi i'm a new freshmen in highschool and ever since quarintine my friendgroup has been icing me out. I'm not really good at reaching out to people idk why it's just hard for me. I also admit i was really toxic in 8th grade, and we had a big blowup in march that i thought i was forgiven for. I apologized with the longest paragraphs ever. 

I later tried to reach out and get together but nothing ever came of it. I feel avoided and sad, it's distracting me from school and it's giving me stress. Right now im on the brink of tears. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've even asked 'hey we good?' and they always say yes, but the way they respond to me in the groupchat is so bland and almost condescending. 

&amp;#x200B;

the reason this all started was because i body shamed a girl which i now feel awful for. she was like 'op i could beat you up, you weigh like nothing' and i said 'well you have the body mass of a whale whats your point' i feel so bad for saying that. A week later she told me she didnt eat dinner for 3 days, so i proceeded to apologize profusely and told her how beautiful she was. then about 3 months later it all blew up in my face. A girl who we will call AH heard what i said and just came at me and yelled at me. She told me that people didnt like me and no one wanted to be friends with me. They jsut felt bad for me. god, people have been friends with me because they felt bad for me 3 years in a row now. 

I've been trying so hard to make amends with people, i love this group. The main issue is that there is another girl 'M' who joined our group in january and she just kinda messed up the dynamic. I never really liked her and i told a few people, she joined our group chat and she always talks about random strangers she meets on omegle. Then she adds them to our group chat, that why i dont really like her, she's inconsiderate. However, 3 other girls love and adore her so to keep peace ive been trying to get closer to M.

 I feel so awful, and this is all my fault. If i could just keep my mouth shut this wouldnt have happened :/ anyway, does anyone know how i can make amends with these people?

738,"Hello,  


I am a second year B.A. major with a sudden roadblock called ""What am I doing all of this for?""

I struggle to see myself use my degree in the future. When I picture myself using my B.A. degree, I envision myself sitting in a grey, dull, cubicle, working with many different documents, amongst many other people sitting in the very same kinds of office cubicles. I struggle to see myself succeed in this setting as I have ADHD and love to be on the go. Whether it would be driving to other places, doing business trips, or getting to be on the go in some way, I would succeed there. I also struggle to see myself be interested in what my employer wants me to engage in or talk about. I fear that my lack of interesting in my college classes now may follow me into the real world and I will forget to do something for my boss and inevitably get fired for not showing enough effort or skill. I want to be a successful, strong, good asset to whomever I am working for. I want to be on the go, not sitting in a cubicle or dreaded office space that Mr.Incredible had done in The Incredibles. I want to be happy, I am great at communicating with people, but struggle heavily sitting down and maintaining my focus for a subject (especially things like accounting, sales, diversity.. which is all business...my degree) but I want to be on the move. 

I earned a 3.9 GPA during the spring semester after applying myself heavily with math resources and skipping out on a job to focus extra hard on making sure I don't fail out of my classes. I struggle with math, but succeed in writing. I have good social skills and love to listen to people explain things that they're doing, working on, concerned about. I was originally an HR Management major, but just decided to switch back to B.A. as B.A. gives me a much broader variety of careers I can try out. I haven't enjoyed much of my classes lately and I am concerned about how my grades will look. I have talked to my girlfriend and parents about this. I would like to hear from those who have graduated from with a Bachelor's Degree and ask: Is the light at the end of the tunnel? Am I going to make it? Am I going to be okay in real business settings if I struggle with my college education heavily? Do I need to take so many classes that I can't really be socially active and have no job?   


Some of my friends take 19 credit hours, still work 20 hours a week, and still can spend time every night playing video games or hanging out with friends. I can't hangout with friends often, I can't work, and I struggle to be happy at the end of every night because I can't tell if what degree I am working for will have the resources I need to find a great, on the go, active job.

I need to know what people felt like during college, if this is normal, if I'm going to be okay in the real world. I have a fire, but man, right now it's felt like it's been put out.",26Aug2020,1

I've done everything I can do, I even scraped the floor underneath out pet section that had dead insects underneath because the health inspector got on us last year and it got me hours. It took me over a year of picking up shifts, learning everything in the store, getting the best numbers in all areas they track you, and consistently good with the customers just to get them to give me 40 hours a week most weeks other than 4 weeks out of this year where I got 32.
Last year in December they hired this kid that was 18 at the time and he did everything I did, but his numbers were actually a bit worse.

741,"So, I’ll (f16) start this off by saying that i have never been to a therapist nor been diagnosed with any sort of mental illness or depression or anything of the sort. Though, I am generally sad all the time and I believe i have body dysmorphia (but can’t say that in all certainty). I used to think that i was temporarily sad because of something that happened. but as the last two years have gone on, i realize that nothing necessarily wrong even had to happen for me to be sad. i’m currently going through several issues right now along with the stress of my very prestigious and toxic-ly competitive school. During the day I dont think of my problems too much, but instead ignore them and distract myself with other things. During the night, however, i feel my feelings. I cry a lot at night or just feel like shit in general, not only hating the problems i have but hating myself and my life. People tell me to share my problems and talk about them because it’s supposed to help, and I used to do that all the time. I would talk about my problems to anyone who was willing to listen and to who i trusted. now i’ve broken up with my boyfriend, which has taken a serious toll on me as well along with the other problems. after this breakup, things have changed. even before we stopped talking, things had changed in the relationship and i had changed as well. 

I no longer like to share my feelings. Not because I don’t trust people, but because sharing them always makes me feel much, much worse. I feel like an attention seeking bitch who doesn’t even have it that bad and can’t handle her problems. I feel like i’m a burden on people and that people won’t like me anymore if i share my problems. I guess part of this is the way my ex recently responded to some of my problems by saying that he had it worse. I’m not sure exactly why i have changed and why all of a sudden it makes me feel horrible after sharing my problems with someone, or even just receiving sympathy. now when i’m sad i’ll either keep it to myself or vaguely say i’m upset/sad to my friend. Even when i’m not talking to someone, i feel guilty for being so sad about my problems when i know that there are people who have it much worse. 

There are some major events that are happening in my life but i know for a fact that it could be much worse. When i’m alone and crying, it’s no longer just being sad, it’s feeling guilty too. I don’t know how to feel like my problems are valid. I don’t have anyone now to tell me that they’re valid or even just to listen. I generally only spent time and talked to my ex and now that we’re broken up, i basically have no one. I talk to one person about my problems but i feel a lot worse when i do and usually avoid doing so. anyone have ideas to help me? i’m just starting the school year and need to somewhat get my emotions under control as i’m going into junior year, which will be stressful for me. 

TL;DR: after coming out of a relationship, i feel like my problems are invalid and i feel guilty when i’m sad. I need help to figure out how to avoid that feeling as being sad is bad enough. I start school soon and want to have my emotions somewhat under control.",26Aug2020,1
742,"I’m on my phone, so sorry for any errors. And I’m very sorry for the lengthy explanation. 

So I’ve had a crush on this girl for a few years but have never felt comfortable about saying anything to her because we used to work together before she quit to work somewhere else. We stayed in contact but since I’m very socially awkward we didn’t hang out that often and only texted occasionally. I thought about maybe saying something after she quit but I still didn’t feel comfortable because I didn’t know how she felt exactly. (Also, I’m terrible at making the first move). 

Anyways this kind of contact continues and I just figured I missed my chance to ask her out and just kind of settle being somewhat distant friends with her.  

But then we matched on a dating site. (I don’t really use it that often and don’t really contact anybody on it unless it seems like we would really click). We start talking on there but it’s pretty much the same on what we text to each other regularly. I wanted to say something since we both matched in a dating site but I talked myself out of it because I wasn’t in the best headspace at the time(we’ll get to that in a second) Anyways... our conversation in there kind of dies down and I’m a little bit disappointed but I figured we’ve known each other for over two years now and if it has t happened yet it probably never will.

During this time, I should also note that I was ( and still am) in a deep depression. To the point I was contemplating suicide and couldn’t get out of bed for several days. I’ve been suicidal in the past and I knew I needed to be hospitalized. So after laying in bed for several days of not talking or contacting anybody, I admit myself into the hospital and stayed there for over a week. 

If you don’t know, you’re only allowed a few personal possessions when you’re in a place like that for suicidal ideation and this does not include your phone.  So my only contact to the outside is the phone at the nurses station. 

After I was released from the hospital, I quickly found out that a pipe in my apartment had broke while I was away and mold had started growing on my walls and carpet. So, after a lot of fighting with my apartment manager, because they had to shut off the water to my apartment while they fixed it and it would take about a month to fix everything, I finally was able to move to a new apartment this past weekend. 

So anyways, haven’t had a lot of time to socialize with anyone between all of that and work so I didn’t notice the notification on the dating app until today. I opened it and saw that she left me a really long message where she confessed she had a crush on me but never said anything for basically the same reasons I never said anything. 

I nearly threw up when I realized she left it over a month ago,  a few days before I went into the hospital!!!

Now I’m panicking because I don’t know what to say to her! I really really like her. She’s just really cute and everything. And I just wanna immediately ask her out and hold her hand and everything. 

But, obviously, I’m still not in the best headspace. I’m still actively dealing with my depression and anxiety. I don’t know what to say! I really like her. But I know I’m not in a position to start dating anybody and I don’t know when exactly I will be. But I really like her. 

ALSO IM REALLY PANICKING BECAUSE I LITERALLY HAVEN’T TALKED TO HER IN A MONTH AND SO SHE PROBABLY THINKS IM IGNORING HER AFTER SHE CONFESSED HER FEELINGS!!! AND I DONT EVEN KNOW HOW TO START APOLOGIZING FOR THAT!!!

I just don’t even know where to begin or how to reply to her!!! Please! Any advice for this mess would be wonderful!",26Aug2020,1

744," 

So, I was working at this startup and when I first joined, I told them I was a psych major and they said that they would teach me everything I needed to know to succeed as an account manager at the company. Under the impression that I would learn as I go, I worked here for 2 months as an hourly worker. As they gave me more responsibility, I asked for a raise (they had said they’re re-evaluate my pay after 2 months so I figured it was time to ask) and they put me on salary. 2 months in on salary now and they told me they needed to let me go because I was too expensive and the company was growing too fast and I wasn’t really qualified for the position. I tried to explain that they told me they would teach me as I went and they said yeah but now is not a good time. 

We have another account manager that’s living in and is from Ecuador (only been here 2 months) who is only receiving 1k a MONTH as salary so they told me, if I was that cheap, they would’ve kept me. Then they said, “I don’t even think it’s legal in California to pay you that little so we’re just going to let you go.” They then hired someone more qualified for the position and basically told me she was worth much more than I was and they couldn't financially keep both of us so I had to go. 

They won’t be paying me severance or any PTO that I’ve acquired because their excuse is that they are a startup and they operate differently. Honestly I’m really just hurt and lost and I’m not sure what to do. I made financial decisions (buying a car, for one) based on the impression that I would be at this job for the next year so I’d have a steady income. I don’t even have a job lined up and especially in the job market now, it’s really hard finding anything. 

I'm honestly depressed and every time I think about not having money (I have a little bit saved up from working here but really, how long is that going to last?). I have student loans to pay as well and car loan payments, and losing my job on top of that is honestly making me crazy. It feels like everything is coming down at once and I don't see a way out at this point. 

I don't even qualify for unemployment benefits or even for the COVID-19 relief package, 1. because I was claimed as a dependent on last years tax return and 2. I'm a permanent resident, not citizen of the US.

746,"This is something that’s been weighing heavily on my mind. My sister and her husband got secretly married when she was 18 after only knowing each other for three months in what we believe was an act of rebellion against my family (she has a long, long history of stuff like this). They got married while we were in the process of moving over seas, so we didn’t know about it until we were planning to come back stateside, and that’s when my sister revealed her marriage wasn’t going well at all and after a year she already felt they were about to get divorced because they felt like they didn’t really know each other at all, and how he wants kids but she doesn’t, and all kinds of stuff they should have figured out in the three months before getting married. 

My mom tried convincing her to just go through with the divorce, but my sister cut contact then suddenly came back pregnant. She’d told everyone it was an accident baby, but everyone believe it only happened to save her marriage. Cut to three years of us barely hearing from her except to hear about how terrible of a father her husband is, how stressed she is dealing with the dogs he wanted and how being a stay at home mom was terrible. So we encouraged her and her husband to move out near us so we could help them out and so they could both get jobs and live near us. It wasn’t until she moved in we realized how bad everything was. 

We were horrified to see what state her baby was in when they arrived. Her baby, now a three year old, can’t talk, he only screams, can’t tell you his name, refuses to listen to anyone, acts out, doesn’t recognize colors or numbers, and still wears diapers 24/7. We were really confused because this entire time she’d been telling our family how much work she’d been doing with him and how advanced he’d come along for a three year old. We were really shocked about it, until we finally saw what kind of parent she was. All she does is lay around, watch tv, text on her phone, and lock herself in her bathroom and let him run wild with their two large dogs (more on them later). She won’t make him breakfast, refuses to change his diapers, and just makes us do everything even though she didn’t work yet. Now that she’s working, she makes us wake her son up and put him to bed, doesn’t tell him when she’s leaving or coming back home, and just acts like he doesn’t exist anymore.

Things came to blows almost two weeks ago when my sister took her dogs out. Protocol in our house is that the dogs can’t be anywhere near each other, so when she takes her dogs (an Akita and a pit bull boxer mix) upstairs (she lives in the basement) we lock our dog (a Boston terrier) in another room so they don’t confront each other. We do this because our dog is very territorial, and because for weeks we’ve noticed that her pit mix has been getting really hyper and refusing to listen to people. Our only problem with this system is my sister is notorious for not telling us when she’s back inside and has secured her dogs, and on the 11th after an hour of no word from her we let our dog out and it lead to her pit mix breaking through the three baby gates containing him and attacking and almost killing our dog. This lead to a giant fight in our family, especially about the fact she didn’t even try breaking the fight up and then yelled at us for demanding she get rid of the dog. We were furious about the fact that she hasn’t been crating these dogs up like she claimed, and that she’s been letting her three year old play alone with this dog for weeks. She just keeps telling us this wasn’t anywhere as bad as the last fights that dog had gotten into, and even though our dog was seriously injured, she told us at least his throat wasn’t ripped open like the last dog. We were furious with this attitude and demanded she get rid of the dog, he’s obviously violent, and instead she’s decided to move out. 

She made this decision without her husband, who was furious because they aren’t in the financial situation to move out, and he’s been wanting to get rid of the pit bull since they got the dog. This has lead to a giant fight between them, because he’s the main one that works (he pulls 12 hour shifts while she works 5 hours only a couple of days a week) and now he’ll have to get another job to support them, because they only have one car (that she’s afraid to drive) and buying a house won’t allow them to get a car anytime soon. 

According to my sister this is only another major fight they’ve had, and he’s pretty much stopped talking to her, won’t eat with her, and won’t go to be at the same time as her and hasn’t since. She’s telling us she’s seriously considering asking for a divorce because they just aren’t happy at all in their marriage. She’s also told us that if she asks for the divorce, she’s going to fight for full custody and that’s what scares me. Right now she doesn’t even watch her kid, and that’s while married and living with us. I can’t imagine how badly he’ll be neglected if she moves out and has no one to force her to take care of him. But loving with her husband wouldn’t be much better, he can’t financially support the kid, knows no one down here, his parents are six states away, and he’ll be working all day instead of being able to care for his kid. He’s a great dad, but it would ruin him to be a single parent. As soon as my mom told me my sister was planning to leave him and take the kid, the first thing I thought was I refused to vouch for her in court. I would actively speak against her because I don’t think she’s a fit mom at all, and I told my mom about this but she just got really quiet.

I agree the kid shouldn’t go into the system, if this happened I would probably look into taking the kid myself even if that meant leaving college. I have a partner who’d happily help me take care of the kid, and I would want to adopt him myself besides being a bit young to adopt a kid. 

My mom doesn’t like my plan, and wants me to stay out of this, and said I’m just looking for more drama. She said she’d be the one watching the kid for my sister all day, but that’s my point. She won’t watch her son and he’s suffering because of it, and I refuse to leave that kid alone with that pit mix (she’s moving out so she can keep it). My mom just says that I’m openly using my childhood bias against her because I’m still mad about how she treated me as a kid, and that my sister will grow up eventually and even if she doesn’t, my moms here to watch the kid. 

So, 

Would I be the asshole if I actively went against both my sister and BIL in court for their child? Am I really just stirring up drama? What do I do? How would I even go about this if I go through?

748,"(Both 20 F/M) He reached out over Instagram the other night to have sex. I broke up with him just a few weeks ago because he was trying to hook up with other girls and he just never cared about me/made time for me/acted like he even liked me. When we broke up he talked about how he knows he's not mature enough for a relationship and he needs time to figure himself out.

I don't want sex so much as I want another person to be with. I just moved into an apartment by myself and I've felt so anxious and isolated. I left my friends behind when I quit my job and my family hasn't been supportive or present in a long time. I've been mourning the good parts of the relationship even though I ended it, and so when he offered I didn't think and I said sure.

It ended up not happening that night and we made plans for the next but then cancelled again. In the meantime we've started talking more. This went from a one-off hookup to us texting each other again regularly and I don't know how to feel. I still have feelings I've been trying to let go of. I'm inclined to look out for him even when it's not reciprocated. It's hard to separate caring about him as a person from missing him or wanting him back. Maybe I want to be his friend. I don't even know.

I feel like I need to grow the fuck up and just leave this shit behind but there's a huge mental barrier I don't know how to deal with. Any help is much appreciated!",26Aug2020,1

754,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. I don’t go to therapy and truthfully just need people to vent to/advice on how the fuck to get over this. It’s hard talking to my family and also just really weird to me.. 


Anyways, my dad was my best friend truthfully but he’s done some weird things over the years that honestly has always made me feel uncomfortable around him, but I never fully thought about it until now. 

When I was younger I remember wanting to climb into his bed to just sleep next to him one night (he was the only parent present at that time and sometimes I just wanted someone to sleep next to, my mom slept with me for YEARS until she left so I think it had most to do with that), he usually slept naked which I didn’t know at the time because this was the first time I ever tried to climb into his bed, and I remember him taking his hand and putting it on a very inappropriate place. I’m not sure what his intentions were at the time and I’m pretty sure I just walked away and slept in my own room. I’m just now starting to REALLY think about how fucking disgusting it was.. I also would not have continued to want to sleep next to him if he was naked but either way I feel like my dad shouldn’t be making me touch him when all I wanted to do was sleep in his bed next to my parent.. :/ 

Another time he’s done some creepy shit was he messaged my best friend when we were younger, like YOUNG. and asked for pictures of her naked.. and pretty sure said something along the lines of wanting to “have fun”. My best friend was kinda “slutty” back in the day but she would NEVER in her life do anything with him, she actually showed me the messages and I just can’t believe I didn’t say anything sooner.. I just feel so bad for her because I know that she loved my dad like he was hers and he was just trying to take advantage of her at that point.. I’m sure it made everything so much awkward for her. We’ve never talked about it again but I’ve always thought about it.. 

I remember bringing this up to my mom the first time and she said that things were going around in my family way back in the day about either my dad or his brother doing some weird shit involving a little boy .. she didn’t go into details but I can kinda assume what went on. My grandpa also never believed it was my dad and never thought he would do such a thing .. 

The second time she brought it up she told my sister and my sister cut off ties with him. I felt so bad for him and he knew why my sister stopped talking to him but he would deny it. I stayed in touch with him but lost contact over the year and he eventually passed at the start of this year. He mentioned suicide at one point and I can never get over it. 

I wish that he was man enough to admit the things he’s done. I always shoved it to the back of my mind but it’s just bothering me so much lately and I just wanna put his urn and picture in a box and forget about him. He was my best friend for my whole life though and it kills me to even think he would do something like this. I defended him in my mind for so long and i’ll never understand why he would do those little things and make me feel uncomfortable so much, to the point where I thought it was totally fine. 

He would also do things like not knock on my door before entering which doesn’t say a whole lot but he’s caught me having sex and changing multiple times. I never thought anything of it and I was broke as hell back then so never thought of getting a lock.. and adding my young ass friends on facebook when they were like 13-14 at the time. I feel embarrassed knowing he might have been weird towards them because I always felt like that might’ve been the case. 

TLDR; my dad asked my friend for naked pictures when we were younger and he made me touch him in a very inappropriate place when all I wanted was to sleep next to him. He made me feel uncomfortable a lot but he was also my best friend and supported me and was a really good parent to me.",26Aug2020,1

758,"Hi! I cancelled my wedding because of COVID-19, and am getting married in a small chapel later this year instead. My sister is my MOH, and I recently spoke to her about doing a mini bachelorette of just me, her, and two friends.

We would be renting an Air Bnb with a hot tub or pool, and stay there, drink, do fun games, and order in food. She said she was down, and I got excited looking for activities/items/outfits.

764,"Our parents are close friends and we traveled together once where we became close friends.

I'll explain a little about what we did while traveling.

While in the hotel, we would invite each other to the other's room to play at night with our younger siblings and one day he invited me to his and his younger siblings fell asleep and we started spilling stuff we wouldn't have spilled otherwise.

I absently told him about how much I would prefer having blue eyes and he replied seriously that my eyes are the most beautiful he's ever seen, that's probably when I started crushing.

We also went swimming, pranked each other and chased each other for a photo.

We had no other person to talk to during the long trips anyway so we got really close.

We stayed in contact and he asked me out later on and I agreed while we kept it secret to our family, pretending to just be friends. 

He's a funny guy who has a lot of charisma and I like him.

We've gone no further than kissing and hugging.

Now my parents convinced his parents that my school is good and he's transfering.

He's carefree and very open about his feelings (I wouldn't be surprised if he brought up an inside joke or exclaimed, 'I love you!' from the other side of the class) and is already enthusing about how we could sit next to each other in the backseats and how we could hide in the recess and do homework together.

I'm having a real time here. My family is always telling me how I'm mean, immature, and constantly playing the victim. Meanwhile, I'm constantly trying to support them and connect, but all I get back is criticism. ""Why are you talking like that?"" and whenever I ask ""like what?"" they always get annoyed and just say ""nevermind.""

Or ""Why are you wearing that?"" When I'm just wearing a flannel or something?

Or ""Why did you sigh like that?"" When I'm BREATHING?? They're constantly making me explain why I do EVERYTHING and I feel like nothing I do is ever good enough.

Or I'll say something really plain and up-front like ""I need some space."" and my mom will take it to a whole other level and reply ""So you don't want to be a part of this family anymore???"" while being completely serious and acting completely betrayed. This little interaction literally happened last night.

And when I try to tell them to leave me alone or tell my younger sister to stop screaming (at me, at our mom, because she lost in a video game... it's almost constant. it's driving me insane.) I'm screamed at. I don't get it.

I try to offer my siblings advice, and then they snap at me and tell me I'm not their mother. When I don't offer advice at all they all get pissed at me for not trying to help. When I talk too much I'm told to, y'know, stop talking. And then laughed at. When I don't talk at all, my family gets angry at me because I'm 'being so quiet.' It's like that with EVERYTHING I do.

Things have gotten so bad that I just use my customer service voice whenever I'm not in my room. I'm working on finding a job and moving out, because I just can't take it anymore. I'm so tired of being yelled at all the time.

771,"A while ago, I went on a date with this boy. We went back to his place, and we started to fool around. I made it clear that I didn’t want to go all the way, and he said that was fine.

Halfway through, he started pushing me to have sex. I told him no again, but he was being kind of pushy. Not anything super aggressive, and I didn’t necessarily feel threatened by him... more just uncomfortable. 

He was being kind of pushy still, so eventually I gave in and we had consensual sex. I’m going to stress that he did NOT assault me. He pressured me, yes, but at the end of the day I decided to give in to please him. At the time, I felt that if I would’ve insisted, he would’ve backed off eventually (even if he pouted about it lol). 

Now, I have a history of sexual abuse, so my view of sex and love is kind of warped. I sometimes feel like I’m in danger when I’m not. 

I recently started having extreme anxiety over this encounter. I’m anxious about the possibility that he would’ve raped me had I not said yes. Again, my perception of sex is pretty warped, so I have trouble assessing situations like that. What if I had insisted we didn’t have sex, and he would’ve kept going? He was a lot stronger than me. He was being pushy. He crossed a few lines when we were fooling around, but mostly because I was too awkward to clearly tell him what was/wasn’t ok (so my fault for not being clear). 

I can’t stop thinking about this. I’m anxious about how close I came to re-traumatizing myself by having this encounter. I’m also anxious about the possibility that I could’ve said yes just because I was afraid of being assaulted... so saying yes to take control back into my hands, even if I wanted to say no.

773,"I never doubted my relationship until recently. We've been together just short of 2 years, meeting the first day of college. He had something close to a nervous breakdown June-August last year. I was more than happy to comfort/listen to him for a month or so, but this was *everyday*, eventually I snapped and told him the relationship would become unsustainable. Especially cause his anxiety made him confess everything to me, whether it be some weird porn he looked at 7 years ago or finding someone we know hotter than me, some of it hurt me a lot. For the most part this stopped, until May this year. 

Outside of his mental health issues we have a great relationship- best friends, similar taste/hobbies, no fights, always surprises me with thoughtful gifts like a present related to inside jokes etc. Our parents assume we'll get married because we act like an old married couple etc. We happily chatted about moving in/getting married in our late 20s since 6+ months into this. In the last 3 months, since his mental health took this further downturn, I've gotten easily frustrated. He confesses to something probably 2 or 3 times a day now. I've cried over stuff he confessed. He cannot relax until he confesses. I pushed him to do a few free sessions of therapy lately. He only did it to make me happy and he won't go to a doctor/psychiatrist for a real diagnosis. 

About a week ago, I was crying over something he confessed over the phone, and I was hit with the thought ""what if somewhere out there, there's someone just as good as my BF minus his illness"". I feel terrible.He really loves me and I love him, he just has a terrible illness. I've considered waiting another few months just *in case* things improve again, because when he was fine, that first year before the illness and the months in which he was OK, were by far the best in my life. The thought of him not being in my life as my BF and best friend makes me feel so sad and empty, but I also don't think he is *the one* anymore. What should I do?",26Aug2020,1

778,"So how do I start? I'm a little shy to post sth here but I really need an advice. 
First of all, english isn't my first language so I hope there won't be too many mistakes. 

Over a year ago I've met this guy online. We started by texting first and pretty soon started talking on the phone. We actually talked nearly every evening and started to have a really good vibe between each other. 
I once told him (don't ask me why I just did) if I would be next to him rn I would love to kiss him and he responded that he would be happy about it.
(I don't have much luck when it comes to relationships but even my friends were convinced that this time it could work out). 
So we talked for some more weeks before I asked him what he's doing on new years eve and as he responded ""nothing much, most of my friends are busy"" I asked him if he wants to meet. 
He hesitated a little but said ""yeah sure why not"". 

So the days went by and as new years eve draws closer he started to distance himself from me more and more. It actually got to a point where we canceled the contact to each other. 

So life goes on and all of a sudden, over a year later I get a text on my phone from a number which isn't saved in my contacts, saying ""You know, I really miss you""
Obviously it was the same guy who stopped talking to me. I was suprised and told him that but said I missed him too. He started to text me how much he missed me and stuff but I was a little hesitant cause I was afraid that I might be his second choice after it didn't work out with someone else. As I told him he said he can guarantee it's not that way.

So a few days after his first text he wanted to call me. I was pretty quite cause still afraid it's all a bad joke. And he went on telling me what things reminded him of me and that he would have regretted it if he wouldn't have texted me again.
Then he said he thought a lot about everything and can understand me and my feelings way better now. 

So we got back to the point where we talked a lot and he even started to flirt with me and call me ""baby"" which is quite unusual for him.

But now... Idk, I barely hear from him. Even if I text him sth I either get no respond or a really late one, like two days later.
So a few days ago I texted him that this is making me upset cause I thought he would understand me better like he said. 
A day later his answer was sth like ""Wow, you overreact, I am just busy, why do you have to put every action I do under the microscope"". 

I haven't responded yet and waited some time cause I thought he might wants to talk things out on the phone. But... Nothing. 
It's 3 days ago now and I really don't know what to think of all that. 

For me, it feels like he just needs someone he can talk to till he found someone better. 
Cause if I am really interested in someone then I text that person maybe everyday or every two days or so. Not even much, just wishing a good morning, asking how his day was or something like that. Just to show my interest and that this person is important to me. 

Am I overreacting with wanting to hear from him more often? Should I just wait till he's texting me? 

I really don't know what to think of all that...

780,"Hi everyone, I need some major adulting advice. Since a few months my grandma’s throat has evidently been swelling and is now twice the size it was originally and is lumpy. Her doctor prescribed thyroid tests. Now, let me explain the family dynamics a bit. She has three sons, the eldest being my dad and I’m his eldest child. Since day one, my father has paid for her finances regarding anything and everything in life yet she chooses to look down on him and lives with the youngest as revenge. 

Since the beginning of this year her thyroid has been swelling yet her sons who live in this city refuse to get her tests done solely because they’re pricey but keep in mind that all three of them are very comfortable financially. My dad lives halfway across the country. 

Recently I visited her and learned that not only has the swelling increased but she’s also fatigued all the time and has been sleeping for increasing hours so I begged her to come to the hospital with me tomorrow even though she was very rude to me. I even called my dad and he begged her to get tested as well. She brushed me off saying she has other plans that she can’t drop. I did tell my uncles off for being exceptionally irresponsible with her health.

Either way, I don’t know why she’s being so cold and rude to me even though I’m trying to help her. So the advice I need is on how to deal with this situation? Should I force her to go get the tests done or should I let her be? Please note that my family has a history of thyroid disease and cancer.",26Aug2020,1

788,"Hi Reddit this is going to be my first post like this and probably my last, and also on a throwaway. 

I just needed a place to vent and write down my thoughts because I really have no one else to talk about this without feeling guilty.

First let me preface this situation by giving a little bit of context. 

About 4 years ago my mother caught wind that her brother (my uncle) had been homeless for a few weeks and sleeping in his car. He had recently split with his spouse who had kicked him out of their place. My mother being the nice person she was let him stay with us rent free until he got back on his feet. At first there were no issues, but immediately she made the mistake of never setting down hard rules for how long he could stay. He ended up moving into our garage, setting our address for him to receive mail, uses the internet, TV, and utilities all without paying a cent. As time went on, weeks turned to months, and months turned to years. At first it was only my uncle living here, but then about 2 years ago there was a legal battle for custody of his kids with his ex. Without getting too into specifics (because I really don't understand the legal reasons) the court said for him to get custody of his kids they needed to have suitable living conditions. My uncle SOMEHOW still being broke could not afford his own place so my mother let him extend his stay longer for the sake of his children. He eventually won the custody battle and now has his two children (17 &amp; 15) living with us. Which led my family and I to our situation now. My mother has now grown a resentment towards my uncle and asks to talk to me in private about him. She tells me that she's tired of him and wants him to leave. When I question her on why she doesn't charge him rent she tells me, ""NO! Because if I charge him rent he will think he is living here!"" This answer has always pissed me off. The first time, sure it made sense, but now after not charging rent for over 4 years, it just sounds idiotic. Both my parents have allowed this to happen and are bending over backwards for my uncle and instead resort to talking behind his back instead of a face to face talk. 

What is worse is that just recently my uncle told my mom that he doesn't have a phone because he didn't pay his phone bill... I am 22 and going to school to hopefully become a nurse, and sometimes he knocks on my door asking to borrow money. The situation is such a headache to think about. How can he live somewhere, not pay rent, and still not be able to pay a damn phone bill or ask to borrow money. My parents are too afraid to say anything or threaten to kick him out. It's even harder now because of this pandemic. I just feel bad for his kids who have to deal with all of this.

I don't know what to do and how to tell my parents to stop being spineless.",26Aug2020,1

791," We really so underestimate the power of meditation. A month ago I was stressed out from work, depressed and even Corona Virus made it worse. i used to go to the gym often before that, then one of my gym friends realized that i had stopped coming. He then made a follow up and realized I was generally down so he said I should try meditation, I was skeptical because I had tried it before. Then he told me I was using the wrong tactic, he tole me that the average person who is interested in meditation goes to youtube to look for channels who already have a lot of views and subscribers. I told him that was the best and he said to me that the small channels on meditation have more quality and soothing sounds because they are trying to get more people which the big channels already have and it made massive sense. He then told me to check out one youtube channel he discovered called Nature Inspired Meditation.

795,"My dad cheated on my mum a few years ago and ever since we’ve had a very rocky relationship. I made the decision a year ago now not to speak to him anymore as he made me feel self conscious, insecure , failed to deliver on his promises, is a liar and compares me to his friends children. I could go on and on about the reasons i choose not to speak to him, however in this year I have grown so much as a person and am very confident now and basically feel like i have flourished without him in my life. Last Christmas, i sent my gran (his mum) a message wishing her happy christmas and i got a really dry reply back, she never got me a card or a gift and didn’t send one for my birthday either. I assumed that she had taken his side and didn’t want to speak to me anymore and that his whole family had too as i never got any birthday wishes off them (i do normally). This was fine until my sister who is still in contact with my dad said to me today that my gran is sick and was apparently crying because i don’t speak to her making me think that she could be seriously ill. I’ve never had a problem with her but it just seems to me that ever since i stopped speaking to my dad she’s not made the effort to see me and she lives about 15/20 min drive from me and i don’t drive. My sister said i could have phoned but she doesn’t phone me either. It seems that people think i should be the one making all the effort but she’s the adult and i’m the child. Up until yesterday, I was certain that she’d made her feelings with me clear and that because i didn’t speak to her son, she didn’t want to speak to me and that was fine. However now my sister has said this it’s made me reconsider. I don’t want a relationship with my dad, but my gran gave me some great memories throughout my childhood and has always been very good to me, i don’t want to do something i regret and it’s too late before i realise my actions  but i don’t know what i would say to her because i feel like she’d just try to make me speak to my dad which i have no interest in. 
What should i do?

796,"Hi all, I really need some advice.

I (f20) have been with my bf (m20) for 6 years. We started living together over the past couple of years and some issues have surfaced. For the sake of making this short I'm gonna go ahead and just list them

\-i always have to ask for him to get household chores done. i do everything but when something has been needing to get done for days, he will not just do it, i always have to ask. and he always says ""you don't have to ask me to do it you just feel like you do"" (note we both work full time and I go to school as well.)

\-i asked him when can we sit down and talk about how we are going to divide up the house work/chores for our new apt that we are getting soon. he said ""we don't have to pick a time to talk about it it will just get done""

\-skips brushing his teeth in the morning unless i ask him to (this one is really hard to deal with for me you guys. and he seems to get irritated when i even ask him to do it or ask if he's done it. he has bad breath often and i think it's because he never flosses either and doesn't brush very often so it even smells after he brushes sometimes. and it has led me to telling him to go brush after he actually has done it because i genuinely didn't know; and i think that set us back in progress on this because he got irritated. i'm really sad about this because i miss kissing him all the time. i want to kiss but its not as fun when im holding my breath or whatever)

\-doesn't wear deodorant

\-skips showers, gets straight into bed after work all dirty and sweaty (i've actually managed to fix this one by telling him that he will NOT be getting on our new mattress after work if he does not shower-he does it now every time)

\-doesn't acknowledge that he would be better off getting a GED (didn't graduate)

\-forgets about things for long periods of time. i suppose these ones don't affect me as much, but 3 other sub-bullet points right now are that he still has not done his taxes this year (they were due in july) and last time i reminded him about it he made a comment about how i think he's a fuck up. i literally just want him to file his taxes so that the irs doesn't get on his ass. #2 is that he leaves parking tickets unpaid for weeks until the fees build up, then decides to pay it. #3 the reason he is getting these tickets is because he hasn't had car insurance in almost 2 years now and therefore cannot renew his plates. this one does affect me in other ways because i always have to drive my car when we go somewhere, we can never ride in his car. not to mention i don't want to ride in it because it's dirty and messy as FUCK and smells bad in there.

What is he doing in the meantime, if none of this stuff, you may ask? video games. turns on the console literally the moment he wakes up and plays all day if he doesn't work or doesn't have anything else he HAS to go out and do. barely even eats while he's doing this, never drinks water. only gets up to use the bathroom.

honestly there might be more but these are the main things on my mind right now. idk if i just sound like i'm nagging, but i'm seriously stressed out and if i'm being sideways just let me know please. he has told me before ""ok mom"" or said shit about ""stop acting like you're my mommy"" and literally i would LOVE to if only you would stop acting like a child who needs to be told what to do?! his upbringing was very unstable and i think how he is now is a result of that. he doesn't want to get therapy so i'm just wondering what i can do at home to help this situation. i love him so much and i want us both to be happy so that i don't have to stress on this and just focus on school.

thank you everyone.

**tl;dr:**  he has bad personal hygiene and doesn't even do 10% of the household chores despite us working the same number of hours and me going to school. a video game addiction and/or unstable childhood may be factors at play.",26Aug2020,1

i am a (14m)kid with parents that are harsh and sometimes (most times) not the greatest parents, i mean dont get me wrong they have been decent parents until i was 10 or so, but now things are very different.

 ill start with my dad as he is the more mundane one of the two. now he is quite a hard worker. he worked for a the same company for 24 or so years *(he has moved on)* and he slowly climbed the ranks into one of the highest ranks in the company *(slightly below the CEO).* He came from very humble beginnings. his father made very little and the family of four lived in a home that was pretty much free as his dad worked a gov. job. Now he is quite well off *( not bloody rich rich but better off than the neighbour kind of rich)* and he occasionally acts like so. like he is super scared of online games as he thinks people can hack me and get the money from his bank account *(im not even kidding)*. this is just a start btw. not even scratching the surface.

now my mom and i could write a war and piece size book on her but u guys would probably die by the end of it. ill do a quick list she is very ignorant, she thinks me,my dads,and my sis's opinion's are worthless. she doesnt care about my studies *(she litteraly asks me to skip class for her gain)* yet she thinks i should get the best marks becuz my sis did *(she got a lot of support btw).* and alsoshe has ocd, like a very weird version of ocd where she has to mop the whole house daily and very thoroughly, she also hires a maid pretty much purely to help her *(the maid also makes food)*.she is very delusional and she is in an MLM that is not good.

now a few common traits. they are both kinda religious but not for personal reasons like genuine faith but for society sake. and they silenced my sister and removed her from her dream college *(which she earned after a lot of hardwork)* because she said she was atheistic. Also they dont really care about me anymore. i mean this is gonna sound petty but they forgot my birthdays 2 yrs in a row *(2020 birthday and 2019 birthday)* also they forgot my 2018 birthday but they hid it quite well. my sister did remeber them to be fair. and also i always remembered their b-days and got a small *(the best i could with a pocket money rate of less  than 2 dollars a month and often not paid and stolen from by my parents)*  surprise ready for them almost every time. 

now im almost definitely gonna run away or something once im 24 or 25 (after i get a degree to fend for myself).now i am genuinely contemplating telling them that i am also an atheist so i dont have to mess with the religious bull crap i have to do. i also dont know if i should run away or not anymore. i also feel like crap lately. not suicidal i think. but burnt out. probably from the countless hours of studying i put into each and every test and get results to show for. i dont know what to do anymore.

I have a friend I met a three years back in middle school. She’s a very closed off individual and is really talkative but just never talks about herself, and what she does say about herself end up being lies. I met her after I got meddled into a toxic friend group and we ended up being friends. She appears to be really bubbly and kind hearted and blends in wherever she is. If you talk to her you would never suspect anything and but instead envy her for being so carefree. But I just feel like somethings off, she would come to school dressed in long sleeves and perhaps she may be cold but I live in A desert area where honestly even wearing a short sleeve is incredibly uncomfortable. She’s even mentioned how excruciatingly hot it was temperature wise and still refused to take off her jacket. But during physical education where we have to change I noticed multiple bruises around her body and bandaids covering her wrist. There’s to many coincidences and I’m genuinely worried about her. She refuses to talk about her personal life at all and I’m starting to get worried. She’s never joked about suicide/depression or even mentioned anything about it. She has no social media or any other ways for contact. Am I just overreacting or should I just not meddle with her issues?",26Aug2020,1
810,"I'm a 26 year old living in California. I have a degree in English because it's the one subject that has always come easy to me. I figured I should be a teacher, but I often feel like I'm copping out. I am pursuing going into the medical field and being a PA, but I'm beginning to have doubts.

I just got back from a year of teaching in Japan and loved it a lot, but missed my family. I also felt like it wasn't really a ""job"", but more of a fun exchange. I didn't have as many responsibilities as the Japanese teachers, and mostly got paid to babysit the students. While I was happy, I did think about how pointless my job was and how I wasn't really doing anything productive for the long run.

I'm not sure what's wrong with me. Being here, I feel like nothing I do will be satisfying, or I won't be able to succeed. I have a lot of interests, but I have no idea what I need to be doing right now. I feel like I don't have any experience and won't be able to get any job. Also, I feel like with my age, I should have a full time job and be making a salary, but I'm not. I'm taking some classes online from the community college, but even those feel like I'm just trying to look productive and wasting time.

They refuse to give their money to a ""normal/average college"" (as they call it) and only accept top colleges like Stanford or UCLA or else I would be going to a college in my own country which I don't want.

About 8-9 months ago I downloaded reddit and discord without the knowledge of my parents bc I was feeling depressed, and I wanted to have some fun. I met some people on there and have actually met some decent people and I also made an online boyfriend whom i will hopefully meet when I go to college. 

Then my parents found out about me making some online friends (but they don't know about my online bf tho) and they were mad at me for a while but then they gave me permission to have fun with it until school starts (which was this week Monday). Then they told me to delete everything and just cut those people off.

The problem is that I don't want to let go of the people that I have met online but I cannot do this secretly either since they know me too well and also know when I'm lying or not (I tried, they caught me in 2 days).

Ever since quarantine started, my family has had to stay home. We've began to adjust, but I'm worried about my moms mental health as well as mine. My family consists of me, my younger brother, my baby sister, my stepfather and mother. 
My mom works on the computer at home, cooks, cleans and takes care of my little sister. My stepfather will occasionally help, but I feel he doesnt help enough. He does have work at night and is tired during the daytime, and did take care of my sister for a year or so by himself so I cant blame him. I appreciate his work immensely. But this leaves me and my mom to take care of my sister. Which has become increasingly difficult, because of 2 things.
 My sister wants only her mom and dad to take care of her, so it makes it difficult  for me to help feed her, shower her, anything. The second is my stepfather. Dont get me wrong, I love and tremendously appreciate the things he does for us, but I cant help bit feel bitter to how hes acting. He does do some chores, like take out the trash. But he's rude at times and I feel he makes excuses to not help out with my sister. And not to say my father doesnt do much, but my mom does alot. She cooks every night, takes care of my sister all through out the day, and cant really relax. I feel like I'm not helping much either and I fear she'll be even more stressed when school starts up again. Is there anything I can do to help my mom?",26Aug2020,1
815,"Alright, so there's this sub I browse on an alt account (I have 4 others, long story), r/BustyAsians. So recently there's this girl who's Indian and she started posting. Technically India is in Asia (although a good number of northern Indians are actually Caucasian but whatever) so she and I got into a bit of a spat over it, I lost some karma, ended with a come back that gained some karma, and that was that. But now she's essentially spamming the sub.

What should I do now? I can't report it since I can't technically find any rules against this (the spamming is low level so it may not break too many rules), I don't want to get into any more arguments, the first one was enough. I know that Indians count as some form of asian but still, they don't look the same as the East Asian girls we look for in that sub.

And one of my friends took the link that I sent to out wats app group (the guy who got added in is not in this chat) and he took this link and gave it to one of his random friends. He doesn’t know this person in person (every one in the gc (group chat) except the guy who got added are from the same school, and we are all about 14-15. And without any of our permissions added this random guy (rg) so, this isn’t a big deal, (this chat was just created and I don’t know everyone’s discord usernames, so I’m under the impression it’s one of my friends who got the link form the watts app gc) so I ask ‘hay!

“I am everything, and nothing” 

Me: ha ha, but seriously, who are you

Rg: why do you wanna know lmao 

Me: ok...

I’ve pestered him about “who are you” and “ no, really who are you and “dude, I’m not joking” plenty, and I’m starting to believe what I thought from the beginning this dude might be... a bit of a ‘nonce’ per say.

818,"Kind of a weird question, but how do you even date someone?

I grew up super isolated as a kid and never had the chance to date or make friends. I recently matched with this guy on Grindr. At first, thinking he's way out of my league, I messaged and never even expected a reply. He did, we ended up talking a bit and went on to get some food.

Now the meeting part went well but I kinda had no idea what to do afterwards and it kinda ended awkwardly but we kept on talking. It's been a while now, we've been snapping each other pretty regularly and were thinking about meeting again. The guy ended up saying that he's kinda nervous about me being a virgin and assured me he's interested in going 'all the way with me' He did say that I seem way put together and stuff, and I really appreciate that.

Now, firstly I have no idea how to go on that date. Idk what to say, what to do, do we kiss and when and how to initiate that. Secondly, I really do wanna go into the relationship thing and don't know how to bring that up. Thirdly, my family is catholic and so is the school I go to so I need to keep this down low until a bit.

Last but not the least, I used to be a sugar baby before so I'm not a virgin. I'm a guy and have had experiences with both men, women and couples. So all this put togetherness and rich family look came from sugar daddy/mama cash. So I've definitely gained the art of sending flirty pics and seducing. But I feel its gonna be awkward if I turn into stripping on a date ( which is what I usually did with my clients) Also I have this in the back of my head that I'm ugly in real life and only look good in my pics due to angles. I've left that behind and it hurts me that what I did might ruin my chances at any relationship ever. I didn't use it to splurge on surgeries or designer clothes. I just set myself up for my rent and college expenses in a prestigious university I got scholarship to as well.

So over the quarantine my best friend met a guy and they have been dating for 4 months strong and she decided the week before we move out for college that she is going to stay at his house, and say that she is at my house for the week cuz her dad would flip his lid. I’ve never seen her happier in the entire time we’ve been friends because she just feels so free and her boyfriend makes her so happy.

What do we do?? He can’t punish her because she goes to college tomorrow, but she does need his signature for the housing license as she is still 17, and he might hold that over her or prevent her going to college.

Changing names to the aliases below for privacy purposes. I apologize for how long this post is, but I feel their is a lot of relevant detail here. 

Boyfriend - John
Boyfriend’s friend - Bobby
Boyfriend’s friend’s girlfriend - Brooklyn
Creep - Matthew

I began dating John in college, during which he was associated with Matthew via their fraternity. Matthew is a misogynistic creep. For example, he would take pictures of women in public without their knowledge (i.e. at the gym), and constantly belittle women for the way they look, despite the fact that he looks like Shrek himself. He is a known liar. He has no respect for anyone else’s privacy or dignity. 

John has a friend named Bobby, who is engaged to his long time girlfriend Brooklyn. They are to be married next year. When Brooklyn and Bobby first began dating over a decade ago, Brooklyn was in high school. 

Several years ago (Less than 10, more than 5) I found out that Matthew has naked, underage pictures of Brooklyn in his possession. And of course, he regularly liked to share and show these pictures to his peers, even after graduating college when Brooklyn was STILL in high school. I do not know how he acquired these pictures, but I do NOT believe that they came from Bobby. I cannot say for sure, but I would not put it past Matthew to hack into his Bobby’s phone or computer to get them. What I do know for sure is that Brooklyn has no idea that Matthew has these pictures of her in his possession.

I feel immense guilt that I didn’t say something right away. It would have been the moral thing to do, but when I first found out I had never even met Brooklyn. Now I have, and I feel like I can’t attend her wedding where Matthew will be present without saying something. What do I do? I also have to consider that saying anything could really jeopardize John’s relationship with his college circle, which is why I’m leaning towards informing her anonymously. Matthew is the main culprit here, but I know the pictures were shared with several other wedding guests, some of whom are even in the groomsmen party — some of whom are married. If I reveal this information, it has the potential to end several relationships.

It seems really wrong and messed up that Bobby and Brooklyn have no idea. Is it possible that Matthew deleted the photos? Maybe, I guess. But I unfortunately have no reason to believe that he’s changed. I would bet money that he still has them. At the very least, I have confirmation he was holding onto the pictures for four years MINIMUM.

Happy to answer questions to clarify any aspect of this if needed.

TLDR; I’m attending a wedding and I know another guest has shared naked/underage pictures of the bride with other guests and members of the groom party. The bride and groom have no idea. How should I reconcile this without causing a huge mess?",26Aug2020,1

I would normally never agree to this but as he was kinda broke at the time and a good friend of mine I agreed. So the next day I message him and ask where he wants to meet, and he claims to have been arrested and the acid has been taken.

Basically my sister and I found a kitten near our building sometime in July and we took him home. We already have two older cats and they were really not thrilled with a small cat catching their tails, so we were planning on finding a forever home. We took him to the vet, got rid of fleas etc etc and we posted on a local rehoming (not sure if that's the word) page that a kitten was found and looking for home. Nobody answered for about two weeks, and we thought he would just stay with us, we didn't really expect somebody would be interested after awhile. We also kinda fell in love with him, he is the sweetest, most grateful cat I've ever met. 

Anyway, after about three weeks or so, some lady contacted us if she could take him. She seemed like a good fit, so we agreed and today she picked him up. And ever since she left I just can't stop crying. I miss him so much, I keep expecting him to show up, or hear him catching his little mouse. He used to sleep in the bathroom and every time I enter I expect to see him and I break down in tears when I realize he is not there. 

I know he went to a good home, and I should be happy but how do I deal with this for now? Do I just wait for it to pass and adjust to not having a kitten suddenly?",26Aug2020,1

844,"One of my best friends is very spoiled, we are almost 30 and she still lives at home with her enabling parents ( who she constantly complains about). They don't ask for rent and pay her insurance, food and all bills. 

She has more money than I do

I'm beginning to hate her for taking advantage of my hospitality. She makes herself food without asking and helps herself to alcohol and other drinks. She doesn't clean up after herself and never brings anything to my home despite staying there almost all the time.

 She doesn't seem to mind opening new things or using almost all my food. She has ordered meals when we are out despite not knowing whether she has enough money with the expectation of others to pay it for her (she only mentions this after she's eaten). She also drinks a lot at my house (my alcohol) on purpose so she can say she can't drive home.

She'll pay for holidays but doesn't have enough money to pay me back, she overstays her welcome and doesn't seem to take hints I want her to leave. She spends ages in the shower (like an hour) and takes forever to get ready despite not wearing makeup.

She's very manipulative and attention seeking and controlling with her boyfriend also.

I can't believe how entitled she is sometimes and she must know what she's doing. She once came to my birthday party empty handed then proceeded to eat loads of my food and drink. At our friend's last birthday she said she had no money so our friend had to pay for her food, she then bought herself drinks after so did actually have enough.

We are in the process of planning a party for our other best friend but it's down to me to plan everything, and pay for it and I guarantee she'll not get our friend a present despite having money.

We've fallen out once before and didn't talk for a year due to her losing her temper with me because I wasn't giving her the sympathy she was fishing for.

I do enjoy seeing her but when we spend too much time together I find it hard to not feel resentful.

She's aware I have to pay for all of these things and does the same thing to her parents. She spent all her money on a month long holiday recently  and now her parents are giving her 'loans' to live on.

How do I address this without her blowing up/hurting her feelings? I've tried hints in regards to her cleaning up after herself, some of which worked. But if I ask her to bring alcohol to my place she'll say she's not in the mood to drink ( but is happy every other time to drink half a bottle of whiskey ).

She is incredibly greedy and selfish and I'm not sure she will ever change. She also lies about things like having 'psychotic episodes' but I've known her for years and have never seen her have one. They seem to coincide with people not giving her enough attention.",26Aug2020,1

849,"Hello everyone,

   Last week I ran into a very unfortunate situation. I was playing soccer with my friends and I kicked a shot that went over and nailed a brand new Audi’s side mirror off that was parked near the field. The side mirror was hanging by a wire after the shot. I did the good (but very difficult) thing and I left a note with my name and number on the car. She got back to me and was very nice about it but definitely wants me to pay for it.

	I am a college student and I do not have the kind of money to pay for a Audi mirror and installation that will cost me $973. I asked if we could look into used parts options, but the Audi dealer said that it was not a good idea (of course they did they want $$). I am willing to contribute $300 which would easily cover a used part, but she still wants to go through the Audi dealership. 

	Am I being a bad person by not paying for the entire new mirror? I really do not have much more to give as that would pretty much wipe my savings. I told her already that $300 is pretty much all I can give. Bad things happen to cars sometimes like storms, falling tree limbs, repairs, and I am honestly shocked that my ball was able to do all that damage.

Let me know what you all think and I thank you in advance.",26Aug2020,1
850,"Hey! This is one of my first posts here. Writing this on phone and I don’t know how to structure this

So I’ve just started school again (in a new town). I guess you would call it high school (ages 15-18 ish). This is my third year because I couldn’t decide what to do and then I moved to the capital. I’m still in year “one” with younger people now. 
So to the point: Second day someone talks to me and complaints me on my septum. We talked for a bit but now this person has been clued to me. After every lesson, even with 5 min breaks she runs up to me and non stop talks. I have a hard time letting people down and I’m a pretty good listener but I think this has given her the idea that I’m interested. 
Fast forward now: one week later
She told me how she want me to be her best friend like in the high school films and how it would be like the films. Shit! Btw I’m currently not interested in having friends. This is my third year in the same year (cause moving/depression/indecisiveness) and I’m done with it. I want to finish up and go to UNI ASAP! I’ve got different priorities.

Also: She tells me a lot of personal things about her and how she has an abusive family etc and I don’t know what to do with this information. 

And also: I’m not so comfortable talking about families since I’ve isolated myself from mine because of abuse reasons.

Any advice? I’m currently clueless and don’t want this to go on cause it’s making me depressed.

852,"I don’t know what to do anymore. My parents are African so of course the strictness is already there, on top of that they are “Nigerian Christian”. They are impossible to talk to. They think some of the dumbest things are sins and try to shame fellow adults that they talk to (They run a church that was handed to them in Nigeria…it’s a long story). My siblings and I have been raised in North America and the cultural differences are absurd. They have the mentality of people from the 1940-50s and just think so backwards sometimes. They give my sis lungs and I a hard ass time every time. They are just 2 ticking time bombs. Then, they complain why we don’t have a good relationship with them. I genuinely think they think they are perfect people. In school, we are scolded for not getting the highest grades instead of encourages. My parents will also link possibly not doing well to some shit that doesn’t even have to do with the situation. I’m an athlete and recently have been doing a lot of workouts; I feel sick not too long ago and my mom blames it on the workouts. Her reasoning was some of the dumbest stuff I’ve ever heard. She then proceeded to tell me I always argue (oh yeah…she thinks every disagreement is an argued) and that I have only lived a certain amount of years on earth compared to her and that what do I know. Another thing is my parents will get some bogus info from WhatsApp or from watching the news 24/7 and then it will start impacting then freedom of my siblings and I...some of the dumbest things too. Some of the biggest issues though are understanding, reasoning and compassion. They are just way too quick to anger. Another thing is they are judgmental of everyone and think that they are the most holy people on earth. For example, my mom will see a guy in church wearing his hat backwards and say that it’s a sin or something like that. It’s bad because she’s running the church in nigeria and feeding the members with these lies and more. These are the people the church members go to for advice. Once my mom told a woman that a solution for her daughter who is getting checked out by boys and stuff is to beat her. Are you kidding me!? Another thing. I’m an athlete and I have to work at m sport hard to be the best I can be. They fail to see understand since they have no sporting background and grew up in villages. In essence, they don’t understand the grind. Sometimes I feel like I won’t have the support from them through my journey of pursuing sports. Another thing is I’m trying to play college sports. I feel like they will be on their shenanigans and ruin the recruiting process for their egos and try to get me to go to so and so university instead of the one I believe is right for me. They also have a tendency to argue with people that are doing their jobs or people that don’t do what they want in public. One time my mom argue with a taxi  guy for 20 minutes because he said he couldn’t carry all the bags she had from the airport. Moving on, my dad has  even said if we disagree with him in the future or something, he will discipline us and an exchange in fists may happen is need be (he has fought my mom in the past). What the actual heck! On top of my dad being a “pastor” in Nigeria, he also works in a bank in a office. He has VERY little patience, with a sense of entitlement (he also may link the entitlement to being Christian and saying “oh I can do this that and the third because of this”)and has tendencies of treating people like his workers (for example his wife,children and day-to-day people)outside of his workplace. He also says to my brother and I “be a man” whenever we get dressed to go anywhere since we take a bit of time to get ready. He also says that since my voice is a lower tone a little quieter so I have to put more effort into sounding louder(it’s not even that quiet though). He’s constantly calling me out on it and then says “I hope this isn’t what you do in school” and such. They also don’t understand teens make mistakes and also go to extremes. My dad has threatened to pull my sister from university a multiple occasions(she went out one night and a few people, excluding her, got alcohol poisoning, but my sister being the good decision maker she is, she didn’t part take. She told my mom this thinking she cold trust my mom with this information but instead my mom FREAKED OUT and has lost all trust in her, even though she didn’t do anything). Now I’m about to share a little about the past. My mom was the one that raised my siblings and I for most of our lives while my dad was working in Nigeria. Simply because they wanted to be different and have their kids in a different country. This came with a lot of downside. ‘TIL this day my siblings and I still aren’t very comfortable with our dad (also our mom because she’s too strict but more so our dad) simply because of how little we were around him when we were growing up. My mom also complains why we don’t talk to him as much as her (it’s kinda funny how she seriously doesn’t see why). Another thing is whenever there’s a problem at home, my mom gets lazy and instead of parenting, she calls my dad (the agressor) to handle the situation and now from a different country my dad won’t know what’s happening but soccer he’s been told to get mad at us and do something to us, that’s wat happens. On top of all this she SERIOUSLY wonders why aren’t close with him even after she clearly and constantly refers to him as the aggressor. Another thing, they won’t let my sister in university have a boyfriend even after my dad told her that she could talk to him if she starts liking anyone. They also believe that women shouldn’t be working and that a man had to do everything in the house. Also that a man is the leader in the house and a woman doesn’t have a say. My mom goes long with it but my siblings and I can see right through it that she doesn’t quite agree. There have been several occasions where we have needed money for certain things and that we have suggested that she gets a job but we believe that she has become so comfortable with not working (although she did have a job at a bank for a couple years when we were younger) which is why she somewhat agrees that a woman shouldn’t work as hard. She also makes my sister constantly sweep and clean whenever she’s home and says no man will like her if she doesn’t constantly cook and clean(don’t get me wrong we believe in a clean house too but what my mom does to my sister is sometimes extreme and nonsensical). They believe that the way to love a child is through materialistic things. They do buy us quite a few of the things we ask for but whenever we start we don’t feel loved, they refer back to them buying such and such and proceed to call us ungrateful (which is not true at all). The problem is they don’t know that and refuse to listen whenever we sit down to have a family meeting about anything. THEY LISTEN TO RESPOND, NOT TO UNDERSTAND. Last thing I’ll say (although there’s much more) is that earlier today I had made a request for some shoes that were quite expensive (although he did have a history of expensive purchases which is why I asked…and also my mom told me to ask him) and since they were expensive I would understand if my dad didn’t want to purchase them but instead of simply say “no they’re too expensive” he went on to say that I don’t have wisdom if I’m thinking about buying those shoes, even though my intention was to buy and resell. He then said I shouldn’t even be focused on making any sort of money and only focus on my books and school work...but aren’t we in school to get educated for a job in future to make us money and I haven’t I found a outlet for money through resale? I swear some parents would love to have my siblings and I as kids because of our qualities but my parents are jar so stuck on THEIR way or THEIR ideals or how THEY want things to turn out. Anyways, I have made up a couple solutions and stuff for coping with this long term(like try to be financially dependent on myself as early as possible) but I just want to know if ANYONE has any advice for me or any comment, questions or concerns. 

Ps:
It took a really long time to right so I’d appreciate if you responded...thanks!!

855,"The current situation has forced me to leave the country I was working in as an expat. I was living in a big city which I loved but the job I did left little room to grow and improve, the salary was not great and I had no friends there. The reason I loved the city there was because it was diverse, had nice architecture, tons of bookstores, museums and theaters, events and restaurants etc. Not that much is happening now with everything but still...I loved it.

While I lived there me and my partner did long distance and after the pandemic hit I lost my job and forced to leave the city to move in together. And although I love my partner and I am happy not to do long distance anymore, I am not particularly fond of his small town where the language imposes a barrier, the people are rather cold and there are few events or exciting things happening. Everyday I miss the big city I left behind and I fear starting to resent my partner even though he did nothing wrong but kindly welcome me to live with him.

857,"I tried looking this up but all I got were results for jealousy and abuse. Me and my friend are late teen girls/early adults. 

I just wanna get it out of the way that I’m not jealous of my friend, she’s always been considered more attractive than me especially in our area where white skin automatically makes you more appealing than dark skin. I don’t need or want attention from strangers and seeing it happen to her solidifies why. 

We almost never get to hang out because of our schedules, so when we do we really try to make the most of it and it’s incredibly irritating when we’re out walking and talking and we get interrupted sometimes multiple times in a row by usually much older dudes stopping us to get her number. 

She’ll just get catcalled at random times and it stops the energy we’ve created between us. 

Not to mention while I don’t wish to get catcalled myself it is still blatantly rude to me that the guys will start a conversation with her and completely ignore me, like I’m just awkwardly standing there waiting to hang out with my friend again. 

What confuses me is that I can’t tell if she likes it or not, I don’t wanna be labeled as that friend who scares away all the guys because I’m jealous, I just want to protect my friend. 

But it’s tough when you can hardly tell the difference between when she’s also interested or she’s just being polite and doesn’t know how to say no. She likes being spontaneous and having things to tell to people later but I don’t think she knows how frustrating it is for me and I don’t wanna hurt her feelings or limit her. 

Sometimes I do wish I could get hit on just so at least it could feel like we were in it together. 

I just don’t know what to do, ignore it and let her handle it when it happens or talk to her about it or what. 

I don’t want to make her insecure or feel like I’ll stop being friends with her if she talks to guys, I just don’t know. 

TLDR: my friend keeps getting hit on when we go out and because we hardly get to spend time together it gets on my nerves, but I don’t wanna tell her what to do.",26Aug2020,1

860,"Oh God where do I even start. So basically I'm a 18 year old guy from Canada  who's about to start his first year in university. I am really excited about this new chapter in my life, but there's this one thing that won't let me concentrate on any of my tasks. This certain topic is that, the friends that I had in elementary school are drifting apart from me really quickly and I'm having a difficult time accepting it. So for a bit more background information this friend (we'll  refer to him as ""A""), i met ""A"" when in grade 4 when i switched to his school as the new kid. We didn't get along at first becuase we had this big fight between each other where he started bleeding and his parents also got very upset with me. After that until grade 6 we had no communication, we would sometimes see each other in the hall and say hi or whats up. And then in grade 7 me and him and a couple of other kids got transferred to a brand new school, becuase this new school was closer to our homes. In grade 7 me and ""A"" got very close and become very good friends, after school we would go outside play soccer, cricket or just chill at the park. ""A"" would always help me out on any type of assignments or tests and would sometimes volunteer to be my partner in group projects (""A"" was the smarter one in the friendship). And then in grade 8 we got some new students, me and ""A"" got close to them also and the whole circle got bigger and everything felt amazing. And then it was time to go to high-school. So basically the middle school which I went to always told their students to go high school ""1"", however high school ""1"" was to far for me, so my parents made me go to high school ""2"" which was right in front of my house. And I had no choice but to go to high school ""2"", while ""A"" and the other group of friends all went to high school ""1"". In grade 9 I was very upset about this, becuase I had though that the friends I had made in middle school would be my friends forever and I would never need anymore friends. So as time went on in grade 10 and 11 I had actually managed to find some great friends at my high school and was actually happy. During this period of time, me and ""A"" would always hang out in the summer and play our usual games in the park. But everytime I would ask him about the rest of the friend group, he would always say that everyone drifted apart from each other, or how the whole group found another group of friends. And also how ""A"" had a fight with some of the old friends which led them to cutting each other off. Which was shocking to me becuase I thought that they also had the same thinking as me, but I guessed wrong. Upto grade 11 mine and ""A""s friendshship was fine. But as we got to the remaining online half of grade 12, I started to notice that he would act different. I started to notice that whenever we would text he would take longer to reply than usual, usually we reply to each other instantly. And whenever we would meet in person to ride our bike or whatever, his way of talking also changed. Like idk how to explain it, but it seemed as if he was trying to drift apart without directy saying to me. So drift apart indirectly. I think a reason for this maybe that me and him are going to different universities which are really far apart, and he's going to be living on campus while I will be commuting. And I feel like he's just trying to make himself forget about the friends he has at home so he doesn't get distracted at university, which is smart but I didn't expect to happen towards me also. And also becuase some of his friends who he went to high school with are coming along with him, so he might to just keep in touch with them. And now Idk what to do becuase I'm on of those guys who gets attached really quickly to their friends, and takes a long time to get over a friendship. So what are some things I can do or think of to help me get emotionally stronger on these types of topics?",26Aug2020,1
861,This is really embarrassing to admit and post but I'm doing it anyways. So I've always been the ugly and weird friend until freshman year.

So basically, my 15yrs old sister was on holidays abroad with a good family friend of 40years. There he introduced her to some of his friends one being this 65ish old retired plane pilot. Now she is back home and she is recieving text messages from him. One of those goes somewhat along the lines ""i am too old to be with you"" 
My mom says that she sees no wrong happening here. She said he was being ""flirty"". 
Note they (my sister and the predator) spent a couple days together on holiday (they were never alone together god be thanked) she does not know him at all.
I told my mother that there is something clearly wrong with this guy. I see no universe where it would be acceptable to communicate with a stranger who is 50yrs younger and underage. I said to my mom he is clearly a predator and that my sister should immediatly cut all contact.
Am i right? What should/can i do? How to solve this situation?

I miss uni so much

I only graduated a few months ago but I already miss uni so much and I’m also full of a lot of regret because I feel like I took it for granted and missed a lot of chances at things. I really wish I could go back to being 16 and doing proper research about degrees and careers so I could choose different A-Levels, choose a different degree (a STEM degree) and I wish I made the most of opportunities at uni because I basically did nothing outside of going to class, studying and joining a couple societies. I just feel so angry and upset and I wish I could turn back time and go back to being a fresher but of course I can’t so I guess I’m just looking for advice on how to get over this feeling and move on with my life (and no, I don’t want to do a masters or anything).

Hi everyone, apologies in advance for the long post.

I'm in a really hard and difficult situation currently and I'm not sure what to do. I'm in my dream job, something I've always wanted to do and I used to love coming in everyday. However I'm being bullied by other coworkers and it's making me hate it here and my anxiety is consistently bad and I always end up going home at the end of the day feeling shaky and tearful. I work with a senior training officer who is required to help me with training so I can be competent and qualified to do my job, and I started around the same time as another girl. This girl and my superior coworker have spent so much time doing training and one on one time with each other and my training fell behind so quickly, to the point where management was asking why I wasn't on the same level as this other girl. I basically had to train and learn how to do everything myself with no help and finally reached the same level as her, and since then I've been sent and seen messages about me from him to her (they ""accidentally"" sent an email to me instead of to each other and it was saying awful things like, ""She's a stupid c\*nt and I wish she'd just quit"", ""Watching her try and do her work makes me laugh she's so f\*\*king incompetent and useless"", ""She's a fake c\*nt""), etc. I've never had any complaints, if anything I've had nothing but praise from management and other colleagues about my work so I know I'm not actually incompetent.

I recently had a breast scan done and waiting on results to see if I have breast cancer, adding to my stress. I overheard him saying to this other girl, ""It probably won't be cancer for her. Too bad"" and then laughing about it. This made me feel so distressed I was physically sick in the toilet at work. 

The training officer, he's in a position of authority over me and other trainees, however unless he's talking to the other girl I work with, he's almost always in a bad mood, yelling and swearing (he told me to f\*\*k off for asking him a genuine question), and he treats my manager the same way, but nothing really gets done about it other than a brief meeting about his behaviour. Others in the past have left and even gone to my local newspaper about the bullying that goes on here but again nothing was done and he's still able to work here and treat everyone (except her) badly.

I've been screamed at to the point where I had to go home because I was so upset and shaken, and I've tried taking it higher but they say they can't fire him because it's multiple offences, not the same offence repeated. On the days he isn't at work, I'm absolutely fine and love it.

Please help me I don't know what to do, I don't know what else to do for work, and financially I cannot just up and leave my workplace (rent, etc). My family and partner understand my stress but they think quitting is a bad idea and I should just tough it out.

Please help me I'm at the end of my rope and I don't know how to cope anymore.",26Aug2020,1
868,"We live in a duplex apartment. We have the entire bottom floor and have 4 people living above us, on the top floor. 

They are so inconsiderate. We share one recycling container in the back and they pile trash and other non-recyclables into it, while leaving trash and paper shreddings all of the hard. 

They are often loud, stomping around really late at night when we’re trying to sleep. Sometimes at 2 or 3 AM. 

They have a designated handicapped spot right in front of our house, where only they can park. We have street parking and it can often get really congested on our street. You have to know how to parallel park. Because of their handicapped spot, we’ve lost a whole parking spot, which wouldn’t be a big deal on a less occupied street but ours is crowded and we often have trouble finding parking spots. 

In addition to that, when they first moved in upstairs they have 3 vehicles but only drove 1 regularly. The other two sat for months taking up space on our busy street. One was towed away last year and the other one got towed away yesterday, after an officer left a pink slip on their vehicle saying it was going to be towed. That car hadn’t moved in over a year! 

These are just a few examples on how disrespectful they are. When I saw someone dump a huge bucket of soapy (chemical filled) water from their back porch onto our back porch, which is directly underneath theirs - it PISSED me off. 

Btw- they’ve now dumped about 5 buckets of soapy water since then. Our entire back porch is wet and they know we sit out there.",26Aug2020,1

For example, last week I went to the orthodontist and when they told me my insurance won't cover what I need done instead of saying okay and having the conversation about what options I have like a normal person, my eyes immediately started to fill with tears and I had to leave as quick as I could before I started full on crying.

So I (m15) getting pretty close to a female friend a few months ago and we started to text each other daily (we went to different schools) despite the fact that she doesn’t socialize with people frequently. 

Anyway come summer break and we start texting less and less. I dont know why, probably because i was getting busy with all the corona stuff as well as other stuff, but eventually we stopped talking altogether and me being an awkward guy, was too embarrassed to text her after a few weeks of not talking. Now its been basically 3 months and we still havent talked

I decided that i missed talking with her and texted her just a “hey, hows it going” in hopes that we could start talking again. Its been a day and she still hasnt texted anything back. I feel guilty for stopping talking with her in the first place and cant help but think that shes mad at me. Am i being paranoid or something. What should I do?

So I have dreams that kinda creep me out. They're always strange and i have no idea how my brain comes up with stuff like that. 

Okay so often I'm in those dreams with people that are part of my life (thats not the creepy part). And those dreams happen in different places. But during the dream I realize that I know this place already. Like I visit the same places again and again in my dreams. For example an island is often in my dreams or a specific cave in the mountains. Those places don't exist, they're made up.
Secondly what kinda creeps me out is the energy those dreams have. They're always stressful even if the place is nice. They all got like the same tension, and when I wake up I'm also tense or stressed. Also next to the people I know I dream also of complete strangers and all those people have also a weird energy surrounding them. 

I actually told a friend that this dreams are like my life in another dimension (as a joke). But somehow I find it quite weird that I dream from the same places again and again and that I realize that during the dream and also this energy those dreams have. 

I'm just asking myself if someone does experience the same? Like do you also dream of the same made up places again and again? And are you also always stressed out after dreaming?

Sorry for this long post. I'm was just wondering if this is normal, because I just started to think about the possibility that those dreams are something more than just dreams, like maybe they're a cope mechanism or idk. But maybe it's like normal and other people experience such stuff too so that I don't have to be creeped out by those dreams.

TL;DR: How do I reveal a huge lie to people I care about? How do I brace myself for the consequences? How do I go about telling the truth to a guy Im seeing? My cowardly self thinks I should just stop seeing him tomorrow, tell him he deserves someone better than me, and move on without real explanation. But he also deserves the truth. I know after I do tell him, I’ll stop seeing him. 


I have been lying by omission about being employed for the past 5 years. After college, I entered my dream Master’s program, which I didn’t finish. At the time of my “taking a break”, I thought I would go back, but I just never did. Already, in the program, I was slowly falling into a deep depression and dropping out of the program suddenly just sunk me deeper in despair. I never told anyone (not friends or family) whether I had graduated. They would ask how the program was going, but I always said I didn’t want to talk about it. Eventually they stopped asking. I think some of my friends assumed either way about what happened, but never really asked up front. I told one of them that I was thinking of dropping out (when I had already done it), but I don’t know if she remembers this. Which I kind of appreciate it, but it just made lying easier. I slowly started distancing myself from my network, from friends, family, just keeping connections here and there so I wouldn’t completely lose my sanity; to attempt to be a good friend. My closest friends just stopped asking personal questions about jobs or schooling because they knew they wouldn’t get an answer from me anyway. This whole time I’ve felt incredible guilt for not being upfront with my friends, but I figured it wouldn’t hurt them since it didn’t affect them. 


Fast forward to last winter. I met a guy, friend of a friend, at a party. I don’t know what compelled me to go to this party as I haven’t been socializing much for three years. I also haven’t been dating anyone, *specifically* because of all the mental health and financial problems I have. I don’t wanna burden anyone with those. But so I met this guy and we got physical pretty much right away. I kept it going because I figured I could keep the distance, and I wasn’t going to get emotionally serious with him (that’s been my policy this entire time). We had a discussion too—I said I couldn’t be in a committed relationship because of the awful place I was in life, that my health is crap. But over the months we kept talking and growing closer (mostly by his effort because I tried to keep the distance). I kept checking in with him to see if he was still cool with the casual arrangement and every time he said he was on board. Now, months later, we’re closer than ever...as close as you can be with someone who is a depressed liar. We’re still not together in any official capacity at my insistence (although it feels like we are). He is so wonderful and if we had met 5 years ago, we would probably be married by now (which is crazy to say because I’m very much against those kinds of traditions). It’s just so ironic because we tell each other how crazy it is that we just met but have grown so close so quickly—it really has felt magical. But he deserves better than me, I know this. 


I feel the incredible guilt again. I don’t know how to tell him that it’s not just this year that I’ve been unemployed, but for 5 years (counting the two years of my failed masters). I haven’t even told him that I was in a masters program once. When he asked me what I used to do before being unemployed, I vaguely told him I worked at a local non-profit (I was in connection with them because of some meetings I went to, but I was never working there). When COVID hit, I was kinda relieved because unemployment was more “normalized”. It’s not that he would be judgmental about my past (he is very open about his and thinks shame is useless), but once I reveal the truth, he’ll definitely stop talking to me—*as he should*.

880,"Hello everyone, I don't know if this is the right sub, but hopefully some of you are good with kids.
I'm 21f and I'm teaching English as a second language to a 10 year old girl.
I started about 3 or 4 years ago, but for the first couple of years her mom asked me to just speak English to her while we played together. So I was more of a friend than a teacher to her.
She was always a bit hyperactive and very easily distracted, but as long as we were only playing it wasn't that much of an issue. As per her mom's request though I had to make her read some easy books for about 15 minutes every time, which was challenging because she never wanted to.

Fast forward to now, because of the pandemic and all, we now do online lessons, and her mom wants her to learn to speak English. So I thought it would be a good idea to have her talk about any topic she wants by making her do power point presentations about it. (I know it sounds tedious, but I thought if we did it together over Zoom it would be a little better than just me questioning her like an interview)
She likes talking about Kpop and of course I'm more than willing to listen but I've noticed she will do all she can to avoid speaking (she'll just say ""look fake_punk!"" in English and point at what she wants me to see). Of course I try to engage and support her as much as I can, but lately it's gotten to the point where we don't actually get anything done and just waste the whole half hour.

889," Hi, I tried posting this to r/Writing and r/Writingpromts but they took it down and I'm not sure if this would be the right place to post but I'll try. 

Recently I saw my GF was reading on an app called Wattapp and I found it interesting people could write and read their own stuff on this app. And there was several different genres you could advertise yourself as. My problem with it however is this, and maybe it's just that I'm slightly shallow about the genre, but it looked like EVERY story was tied into a romance story or was the focal point. I don't have anything against romance in terms of someone liking it, it's just not what I'd reach out to read.

Even in Webtoon where I put my comic series I notice there's a lot of romance stories but I like that I can choose ""comedy"" and know it's comedy. But for apps like Wattapp I'd have to read stories and comment to get people to read mine, I hope this doesn't come off as shallow and I appreciate that the people who write there range from decent to great writers, but I personally don't want to go through a mountain of romance stories or write romance (unless I really want to) to get into the habit of writing again and maybe gaining some following.

I guess the TLDR is what app can I use to write and read stories that definitely have different genres that doesn't focus on romance primarily? I've been wanting to get back into writing but I feel like I need an initiative to keep me going other than just because I enjoy it. I'd like to write something that I know people enjoy. Like nowadays I'm writing a TTRPG and I love writing the lore to it and having my players involved, much like any GM/DM in any TTRPG. I figure an app might be a good start.

895,"I'll try my best to keep this as brief as possible, sorry if its a mess.

Basically my personal laptop is trash so whenever I want to go on websites restricted on my school tablet, I use my mom's laptop (I'm 18 I just don't have access to my savings acc to fix it/get a new laptop, since I need to save up for college). She was fine with it so I never really thought about me using her laptop as invading her privacy because she would barely use it anyways or at least I though.

Turns out when I opened the laptop earlier today I saw a series of emails on this website ""mail.com"" talking about an assignation and this guy saying how much he loved my mom (same name different last name) and how he understands why she has to go straight from work to home today. So yeah definitely not what I expected when all I wanted to do was check out Reddit.  

What should I do exactly?? I have my SAT on Saturday but I really can't focus. I've been crying a lot (bc I suck at handling stress) which is no fun at all. I tried chugging water and running to distract myself (which usually works for me) but it hasn't really helped. 

Should I confront my mom about it? Idk if she can really take a confrontation because she's a really timid and nice person even tho she really sucks balls for this. My dad is in between therapists so he's not really on his normal meds (anxiety and depression) so idk how he would take the news.

I can't even talk to my sister about this because she recently moved away for college and she has to retake her business placement exam (I think that's what you call it) so there's no point in telling her without putting her into a similar situation.

I gave up my phone for the week so I could focus on my exam but now I can't talk to my friend about this :(.  I also couldn't even take a picture of the emails so I dont really have evidence per say. I finally fixed some of the restrictions on my tablet so I could use Reddit so any advice would be appreciated. Please help :(((",26Aug2020,1

899,"I moved to a new area in late 2018 and just picked a dentist that was conveniently located with good hours and decent reviews. In June 2020 I had a filling on a molar. It was the most painful filling of my life, didn't feel right from the start. After a couple weeks I went back and the dentist was really rude about working on it again it, as if I was inconveniencing his schedule and I decided that's enough I'm going to a new dentist. A couple more weeks pass and still in pain so I went to new dentist which local coworkers referred me to, they reshaped it again quite a bit and says it didn't look the greatest but should be ok. Since then it's still been painful so I went back to the new dentist today and they looked at again and said everything looks good visually and on xray. He then said go back to your original dentist and have it redone they have your original x-rays and know what they did so they can fix it easier than us, plus insurance won't pay to redo someone else work. Great, so I call my old office and no answer. I look online they are now a part time office, lots of recent bad reviews. I am at a loss, do I go back to the dentist that screwed my tooth up in the first place and demand he fix it or pay out of pocket for a new dentist to have his best guess at fixing it? I feel like I burned the bridge at my old dentist, he knows I am leaving I cancelled all future appointments for our whole family. Am I supposed to go back to him say I got a second option and the new doctor said it didn't look good and should be redone?",26Aug2020,1
901,"My sister has always competed against me, especially when we were younger, She always thought that if I could do it she could do it better. I had a ""special"" sport I guess you could say, That I did from the I was practically born, and I practised a lot when I got older, And if anything any other mother or daughter knew I was very much an expert at What I was doing, and it showed when It came to awards. I had been 14 at the time when my sister (10 at the time) decided she wanted to compete as well, My parents were surprised but let her do it, for her to practice she hardly did and whenever she had the opportunity tried to make out I was not as good as her, Well when It came to competition time, anyone could tell she was not as well polished as a lot of other kids, but she just thought she was the bomb, When it came to awards she expected a big title, she didn't get one, I (Not trying to brag, sorry) won a top title, she then literally cracked a tantrum in front of everyone in the room, my parents were embarrassed and had to pick her up and take her out of the room. From that moment on any sport or activity I did in school she tried to compete about and a lot of activities weren't even competitive she just felt like she had to do it.

By the time I reached college anything I did I kept a secret from her because I knew she would try to compete more, Me nor my parents or brothers have no idea where this came from and she never wanted to stop doing it.

When I had my first daughter I decided to put her in the same sport that I did, I always made it a thing that at any age she decided she didn't like doing that sport that I would remove her from it, It's been 10 years she loves it, both my other two daughters love it as well. And before the pandemic they all competed and practised regularly.

My sister's two daughters never have competed as much as mine and my sister doesn't really have them practice. I feel bad for them because I no they love doing it but they feel discouraged when they don't win as big as their cousins, There have been times where my sister will whisper in my 5 year old daughters ear that if she messes up in her routine she will reward her, This always upset my daughter, and when my 5 year old doesn't listen her aunt and wins a big title, or any of them win a big title, My sister will wait until she thinks people are out of ear shot to bitch about my daughters not deserving their titles.

My nieces are very sweet kids and I love them to death but recently have been very nasty to my daughters and it's upsetting my kids, I've told my sister and all she says is everything would be fine if my kids weren't trying to compete about everything.

If anything she has done this our how life with me, my kids started doing this before her kids my kids practise regularly with their coach while my sister think she can make up a random routine teach it to them once and it'll be a winning routine. To me her doing this to her kids is only going to make our kids friendships worse, I feel like like she's instilling the ""I can do anything better"" into her kids now, and feel like this will become difficult for them when they get older.

Should I just leave it and let them continue to be discouraged or do I try to make peace with my sister?",26Aug2020,1
902,"My friend got out of an abusive relationship in February. He was manipulating her and clearly using her/forcing her for sex.

Now she has a new boyfriend (19M) and I think he's another kind of abusive. Manipulation and being rapey isn't an issue, but he's violent and I think it might be getting worse over time. I had a bad feeling about him from the start but my friend disregarded that.

He gets mad over stupid little things and specifically with her. Like, she could ask him if he needed any help and he would get mad. She could ask him if he would clean up his litter and he gets mad. Today he literally punched another girl in the face for asking him out (a stranger, she couldn't have known he was taken). No, he didn't let her down politely first, just straight up punching. My friend said ""yeah but that girl could also not ask him out"".

Also, he met me only once for 10 minutes and hates me. He wants my friend to cut me off completely. Obviously she didn't do that. I think he knows I'm onto him.

My friend disregards everything I point out and she's just really afraid of being alone. She said multiple times she would rather be with me (we have some history but agreed on being just friends - initially her idea. I don't have romantic feelings for her anymore and she knows that). I feel like she doesn't really want to be with him, but thinks she doesn't have a choice.

How do I get her to see the red flags, or better, how do I get her to break up with him? I already told her all my worries and that I'm not looking forward to going to the police again (which I did with her ex). I want her to be happy but she's clearly not.",26Aug2020,1

907,"So before I get started, I'm a 17y/o female and I've been in therapy since I was 13.l, and I've gotten very good at telling what my anxiety is just making seem like a problem and what actually is a problem. I have an 18y/o boyfriend who's just started college, and weve been together for two years. So, as you know, we're both starting to learn how to be adults. Trying to learn how to do that in this world makes life seem a lot scarier at times

That being said, since my boyfriend is going to a new school, that brings along some fears for my anxiety to play around with. Its easiest described as an argument I have with the other voice inside my head, the other voice being anxiety. It's like,  i tell my anxiety that he loves me and that hes with me for a reason and that he chose me, it comes back louder with ""yea but what if"" because I'm also scared that I'm not as good as those girls at school. And he says hes with me bc of our connection and my anxiety says ""yea well hes still young, theres plenty of like minded people, especially in college, that he could experience a connection with"" and it just really sucks bc I havent had a problem with my anxiety in so long and now I'm also scared I'm getting worse again and I'm scared that if it doesnt go away hes gonna leave me for someone normal, someone who doesnt need him to reassure them over the same thing hundreds of times. And I'm scared to bring any of it up bc I dont want him to think I'm losing faith.. I'm not.. I argue with that voice every damn day and it's so hard and tiring. I tell that voice things like ""hes been with you for 2 years with no signs of leaving"" my anxiety will say something like ""yea but what if this whole 2 years was a big joke"" so I'll say ""it's not, hes not like that, and he wants the best for you and he loves you"" and etc. 

I guess I'm just asking on advice to help deal with my anxiety, other than simply ""therapy"". Trust me, I've tried that. I know he loves me, and he would never do anything to hurt me, but that doesnt make the things that the voice says any less hurtful. And I know advice on this kind of thing is hard to give if you dont know how the persons anxiety works",26Aug2020,1
908,"I am a self styled Donkey Robin Hood, I've basically been scamming criminals online and giving the money in small increments to donkey sanctuaries.

It started about 2 months ago, I was online dating and I noticed there were a lot of bots and fake accounts. I started messing around replying with silly comments. Some of them would give me details to chat on encrypted messenger apps. Out of boredom I took it further, created throwaway accounts and strung them along a bit for fun.

They tell me the same thing every time, send me x amount for pics and vids. I'd ask for a fully clothed selfie with my name written on paper and to my surprise a lot of the girls were legit and I just apologised and wished them well. But MOST of the time I would be sent one or two underwear shots and say I need to pay for the rest. They start at 50 and it eventually goes down to 10. They always send an e-mail to transfer money to PayPal. They're extremely persistent.

All the pics after a quick reverse image search reveal Instagram models or amateur pornstars with big albums of pics. At first I joked that I'd hacked them and sent them all their nudes they were gonna send me back to them, for a laugh. Some of them actually believed me which was hilarious.

Fast forward a bit, I did this one night and the person got really angry and I decided to take it a bit further. I took a screenshot of their e-mail and said I know you're a scammer using fake pics and here's what's going to happen. You send me $200 or I'll either make this go viral, contact the models and tell them you're making money from their copyright content, or tell PayPal you're committing fraud and they'll contact each and every person who paid you and you'll likely be sued by a lot of people.

This guy started grovelling and begging and adrenaline pumping I pushed it further and said I need the money in the next hour. I set up a Venmo and he actually sent me the money!

Over the past few weeks I've done this every night. Maybe one in 10 falls for it and I've made well over a grand. I'm donating all the money in small increments to various animal charities but mostly donkeys because I love the donkeys. I think donkeys have such a hard time and they're such gentle animals. I don't want to keep the money because it feels like bad karma.

I've almost become a bit addicted to scamming scammers, I have no sympathy for scammers but is this legal? Could I get in trouble?

I will be coming out of a 6 year long relationship, that I really just want to get up and go. 
That’s a long story, so I won’t get into it. 
I know that I can afford the rent, (TX,$700) (WA,$850)
But being that it’s not 1/3 of my income is that going to be an issue in the renters eyes?
My credit score is rough (mid 500’s), and I know I will probably have to put down extra money and I am fine with that. 
I want a new place where half the damn town doesn’t know me and know my relationship. A clean slate, per say.

$120(monthly)for phone bill 
$157(biweekly)for my cars engine I owe $2700 left on it— snap finance
$147(monthly) personal loan for my car $2000 left on that
$120(monthly) for car insurance
And that’s it
What I can do is sell my car, I currently have an offer for $4500 and have no loans and $5300 in savings
But then I wouldn’t have a car, and I’ll need a car so I can buy a $1000 beater to get me to and from work

Long story short, my husband passed away and I'm going through trying to clean up our home a bit.  He was an IT guy and somewhat of a computer/tech hoarder.  

The closet of our shared office space has no less than 5 computer towers in it.  All the way back to an old Tandy that belonged to his grandparents.  It was always his intention to recover any files off these old computers then dispose of them.  He had started the process but then he got sick so it was put on pause.  

I am modestly tech savvy but probably not enough to recover data on 1990's computers.  It's probably just pictures and his music etc.  I would like to get these files out and... put on a flash drive?  Something?  It would be a nice gift for his mother as well.

Same day when I headed back from my last class, a group of older guys kept saying ‘Does he know what a barber is?’ Or ‘Look at that kid’s weird hair, he looks dumb.’ I had never met those guys before, they just picked on me while I was passing through.

Hi everyone. So I’m in my third year of uni and I’ve received an email today saying that my first term of uni is going to be completely online.

Also, I was looking to work at my uni because due to covid and my mums anxiety around it, I wasn’t able to work this summer.

I have a really close relationship to my mum and sometimes suffer separation anxiety when I’m away from her. When I mentioned coming back, she quickly dismissed it as she’s not happy with me travelling on public transport. I’m just so stressed and upset.

Any advice/reassurance would be much appreciated ❤️",26Aug2020,1

933,"I have really active tourettes syndrome, particularly echolailaia (copying peoples movements/sounds), and one of my teachers is constantly waving his hands, clapping, snapping, etc.

It really sets me off, and I'm in the front row. Everybody watches me wave my hands with him, clap with him, and so on. Plus because my movements are involuntary so they're more jerky/rigid, and I know it looks really stupid and weird. 

Not to mention my TS (tourette syndrome) comes hand in hand with a lot of sensory issues. After his class I sometimes need to go to a dark room and tic for 30 minutes or so because it really strains my brain when he does this. 

The thing is, its an elective class. I chose to take it knowing he does this, if it was a core class I might've asked him to tone it down by now.

934,"Hello. I'm crossposting this because, frankly, I'm at a loss and don't know where to begin.

I attended a state university in the USA from 2012 to 2016, being excluded in 2016 after numerous academic interventions (supervision,warning, probation) until finally being excluded. I'll put it bluntly- I just stopped going. Again and again until I just wasn't given an option to attend. I wasn't in the frame of mind to be in school, point blank. Every passing semester I would convince myself that I could turn it all around, and the tasks at hand became increasingly daunting while in theory not being that difficult. I didn't use withdrawals like I should have, a point that evades me presently, but I simply can't go back change it.

I'm the first in my family in this country to attend college so you could see how that would be deeply important to my parents. So much so that when I let them know that I wanted a break, a semester, a year, *anything*, it was an outright tragedy. I get it. I didn't insist and it got progressively worse. This is all leading to this: I want to go back, but I don't know how. I'm in a much better place as far as being able to be focused and responsible goes, and while I have a job that takes care of me financially I'm just not...fulfilled. I'm finally realizing the carefully crafted idea that I've recited to myself, the one where it's too late for me to go back is just not true. I might have to start from scratch, which seems daunting but still more hopeful than idly letting opportunity slip by.

In 2018 I appealed the exclusion and got denied. It's one thing to drop out, but to just fail semester after semester, I couldn't explain that easily. So, that means the credits are lost unless I can appeal again, which I'm trying to figure out if that's possible. If I start from the beginning, how do I go about that? I'm 26, it's been 8 years since I graduated. Do I have to retake anything? I don't know. It's overwhelming at times, but I thought I would reach out here. Any help is appreciated.

Thank you.",26Aug2020,1

936,"I’ve (17f) had the same friend group since elementary school. I don’t want to sound prestigious or anything, but they just don’t satisfy me anymore. All they talk about is shopping, food, or school gossip. The most basic, boring small talk. I want to talk about philosophy, how the universe was created, books, dreams, video games, literally anything interesting! I try to bring up these topics but they look at me like I’m crazy and imply that they don’t care. They do the same stuff, eat salad and go on diets, vacation on the beach. I want to climb sketchy rooftops and watch the sunrise from a highway. Our friendship seems fake and forced. I don’t love these people unconditionally and they don’t love me unconditionally. 

The biggest problem I have with then is that they’re judgmental. Even worse, they make it so obvious that they’re laughing at someone’s outfit or looks. They’ll say something rude loudly while someone’s in earshot. It’s so embarrassing. They talk about foreign waiters/waitresses and maids like complete shit and you can just tell that they think they’re so much better than them. One of the girls in my friend group left to use the restroom, and another girl literally started gossiping about how she gained weight and how her outfit isn’t flattering. Like... what the fuck??? That’s so disrespectful and I can only imagine what they say about me (someone with a more dark/alt style) when I’m not there. I’m in such a toxic environment and I can’t believe I only just realized it because of quarantine and the absence of their negativity and backhanded compliments.

I want to curl up and cry. I feel so lonely. I can’t test out making any new friends because my “friend group” literally judges everyone that isn’t part of our clique. I don’t want to drag other innocent people into their mockery. I also don’t even know if anyone I’m interested in being friends with would want to be my friend.

938,"Soo... 

After 2 years of trying I finally got what I worked for.

I got into art school! 

Its one of the best schools in my town. Grades have to be high, and you have to go through exams and shit, and I passed all the tests and got high enough grades to be accepted.

And yet.... Im not fucking happy about it.

Because of this stupid change in Polish education system, kids from 2004 and above will get 1 or 2 (depends on a school) bonus years in schools.

Now, Im from 2003 BUT I already graduated 1st year of high school this year, because im still in the old program befor the education system change.

In short... because this is the fucking art school, I have to repeat 1st year (cuz i would miss out on all the art basics) ... and do a bonus 2 years of grades....

And I feel soo fucking alone in this. 

I will be 22 when I finish HIGH SCHOOL. 
THATS FUCKING INSANE. 

PEOPLE FINISH COLLEGES WHEN THEY'RE 22. 

People that I ask for advice always tell me, taht time shouldn't matter to me, BUT IT KINDA FUCKING DOES???!?! 

I don't want to be left behind by my friends. I don't want to be this old hag in my class that should be more mature from others bcs of my age. I don't want to feel alone around people. 

I also worry about getting a job, or mt own apartment or something. Because who is 20 and still in fucking highschool. 


Despite all of the above.... I really want to fucking go there.

I have dreams I want to achieve. I want art to be a part of my life. I also wanted to go to this school since I was little. Its literally what I craved for, not my whole life, but the big part of it. 

but I feel like everything is against me....
I don't really know what i did to deserve to be treated like this by the fucking world

Im sorry that this is so long, its just.... feels like no one is being honest with me, so maybe you guys will be. 

Is it really weird to finish high school at 22 or am I just making a big deal about it?

If there are any spelling mistakes, I apologize. English is not my first language

941,"Hey y'all, just wanted to hear some other opinions on something weighing on my mind and heart. Sorry for the length – I've tried to be succinct and tell it as a story, so hopefully you enjoy reading.

I used to be really tight with this girl, let's call her Jane, who I met in high school. I've always been a pretty solitary guy (still am, though I'm more at peace with it than I used to be) so it was a huge surprise when she barreled into my life. Jane was absolutely charming. She was beautiful, she was charismatic, and she had a great sense of humor. She was a straight-A student... not because it was easy for her, but because she was incredibly ambitious and hard-working. She got better grades than I did, because even though I found school easy, I didn't have her work ethic. I admired her for that. I tried to be the cool guy in high school (what 17-year-old boy didn't?) but in truth she amazed, enthralled, and intimidated me, all at once.

I skipped the crush phase with Jane, and one day I just realized that I was in love with her. She was the first (and so far, only) woman I ever really fell in love with.

In retrospect, I think she had feelings for me, too, but I'd taken too long figuring that out and basically missed my chance. Jane dated a lot of guys in high school. I look back on those days fondly, but I have no illusions about how I felt seeing her with a long line of other guys – pretty much my entire senior year was like having my heart waterboarded on a bed of burning coals, while having scorpions poured down my pants. Y'know, like metaphorically.

High school ends, and we part ways, not on great terms (I was young and hurt, and there was some tension between us that made us avoid each other). We both go to college in different states, a world away. Somehow though, the distance actually helps – with some space to cool down and no illusions about the possibility of romance, things are better between us than in high school, and our friendship not only survives but thrives. Through the next three years we're slowly growing up, and as we grow up and time goes by, we slowly grow closer.

Over the following three years, as I let go of my illusions of a relationship, I started to see that Jane was no longer the same girl as she was in high school. I always knew Jane had a ""stormy"" home life; what I didn't know was that her parents were in an incredibly-toxic, co-dependent relationship. That both of them were alcoholics. That the money was running out. That her father was nothing short of a monster, for reasons I don't think are mine to share. Even her school was extremely problematic – though again, I don't think I can share that side of the story, Jane suffered harassment and abuse from a male professor at her school, and without parents to support her, she'd had to fight it alone.

A lot of bad shit happened to her after leaving high school. While college was a time of challenge, moderate loneliness, but overall success for me, for Jane, it was the worst time of her life, and it'd made her bitter, hard, and hurting. Jane suffered from anxiety and depression, and whenever I consider the full scope of how hard she struggled, it gives me a new appreciation for just how strong she was.

At this point, it's been years since we've last seen each other, but our relationship is stronger than ever. Though every day is a battle for Jane, I believe our friendship was a source of stability and joy for her. We're texting every day, sometimes calling. One day she tells me, almost shyly, that her feelings towards me may have gotten deeper, and just like that everything's changed.

We start remote dating, and it's great. Though we say we'll go slow, our relationship takes off like a rocket train, blasting along at terrifying speed. Within a matter of weeks, we're talking dirty to each other and it feels like the most natural thing in the world. Within a few months, she flies up to my home for winter break. At this point, we haven't seen each other in person in more than three years – the last time we saw each other, we were just children – but within half an hour we've rented a room in a hotel and are having sex.

I was 22. I'd never been in a real relationship before, and I had no idea what I was doing, and somehow I sensed that the rocket train was going way too fast, but I just closed my eyes, put my faith in the universe, and dove in head-first.

It's hard to cut open a relationship and figure out what went wrong, what killed it, though I've done the cutting many times and gone over every piece of it. I wasn't faultless in what broke us. I know that. And I know she was a good girlfriend, just like I was a good boyfriend – we sent each other little gifts, and did small, nice things for one another to show we cared.

Our relationship lasted six months. Somewhere along the way, the laughter died between us. We'd changed – or I think more accurately, she'd changed, and I hadn't changed enough.

Jane no longer had parents – none that she acknowledged or respected – and she'd moved out of her childhood home forever. I still lived with my parents, and our family was very tight and full of support. Jane could only afford to go to a local school of ill repute, where she'd been harassed and had had to hire a lawyer to defend herself (not even joking). I went to a large, opportunity-rich university where my father and grandfather went. And though this may sound like it's coming out of left field, I think this is the most true of all, and cuts to the heart of the issue: Jane had been hurt by men, white men of enormous privilege. I was a white man, one who was extremely privileged.

I don't say that to imply that it was a conscious part of our relationship, but I think it was in the subtext. She wanted me to get a vasectomy, and was furious when I said I wouldn't. She accused me of being a sexist when I made minor politically-incorrect slip-ups (obviously that's a matter of perspective, I just felt that her reaction was *waaaay* overboard). And the thing that bothered me most, is she would assume (without even asking or talking to me) that I took an opposing viewpoint to hers in most things philosophical or political. All that to say: Jane seemed determined to view me as ""the bad guy"", when I can't think of anything I did to make her think that way.

Ultimately, this is all speculation on my part, and I suppose it doesn't matter now. If that's the way she felt, I don't blame her for those feelings – I think she's more than justified for her resentment towards the establishment. In any case, we broke up after our six-month run. We both knew it was coming, and even though it crushed me, it was a relief to both of us.

I'm 23 now. It's been more than a year since we've broken up, and we haven't talked since.

So that's the end of my story. I want to reach back out, maybe send a letter and ask her how she's liking grad school, how her life is going, share a bit about my life, but I don't know if it's been long enough. After we broke up, she said we could still be friends, but that she needed space – I haven't heard from her since, besides a random text once where she showed me a new game she got herself (one we'd talked about a lot).

Is a year long enough to bury the past? This girl was incredibly important to me – I've moved on, but I still care about her, and I don't want to let three months of suckiness to ruin five years of friendship. What do y'all think?",26Aug2020,1
942,"Hi, 
My friend (14) is well known to be a trouble maker and everyone in our friend group kind of just found it normal. I also did until recently when I connected everything I was kind of disgusted. 

Her entire family is messed up and even though I tried understanding everything, I couldn't. But she has a few brothers and her parents have an extreme divorce. So that made her suicidal for a while (I don't know if she is better now) and probably the fact that majority of the people in our age find her weird. So she hangs out with a lot of-mainly guys- who are 17+ with them she does all kind of things like, smoking, drinking and drugs (I don't know which ones)
On top of that one of the guys she hangs out with sexually assaulted her a while ago. I don't know how bad it was or how it went. I know she doesn't want to go to the police because of the lack of proof and she doesn't want to get her reputation ruined.  

My best friend (who is closer to her) told me he believes she is gone and she can't be helped. And even if she could be helped she is extremely stubborn and she probably won't listen. 
I want to reach out to her but we have fallen out and the only reason we remained friends was through school. She never texted and when I texted her she replied with a conversation killer.
So idk she is quite imitating to me and I am sorta scared to speak to her.... 

Anyway please tell me if you think she can be helped and how to help her cuz I am scared...

So my girlfriend and I (17) have been going through a whole bunch of stuff during our long distance relationship. We live about 2 hours away from each other, and while young, it’s hard to know what you wanna do in life and if what you’re doing is the way you wanna live life. 

Anyways we have both fucked up during relationship, and here goes the story:
I kissed someone else on a school trip, while drunk. I know, I hate myself as much as you do. 
I’ve regretted everything and both me and my girlfriend have moved on. She has also leaned from her mistakes in the past. 
This was in February.

Let’s jump to today:
So at school, and some girls I was in a group with asked if I was still together with my girlfriend (they asks me this almost every day)
I said yes, and someone in the background mentioned the fuckup I did in February.
These girls kept asking questions about it, and I was very uncomfortable with it, because I still feel very bad about the situation, and I feel so sorry for my girlfriend.

The situation escalated, and more girls gathered around me. Some started saying that I never told my girlfriend, which is a lie, and suddenly more lies started to appear.
I apparently had sex with the girl I kissed and now I got confronted about a ton of lies. 
It made me both sad and angry, that these girls thought that it was okay to spit out personal questions and confront me if I didn’t answer what they wanted to hear.

I’m not saying that I aren’t guilty, I know, I’m just asking for advice on how to cope with the lies and the verbally-attacking girls. 

And since I don’t feel comfortable talking about the incident in February, how can I handle future situations where I’m asked a whole lot of questions.",26Aug2020,1
946,"Sorry this is going to be a whole ramble (theres quite a lot of context), im just feeling really rubbish and could do with some help!

So on the 20th i received my GCSE results, i did so much better than i thought i would (3 9's, 5 8s and a 7) and was genuinely really proud. It was the first time i actually felt proud of myself for a long time. You see ive suffered from anorexia for 2 years (with horrible depression and anxiety), and live in an emotionally abusive household (narcissistic father, enabling mother, im the scapegoat). School became too much for me and i ended dropping out of a private school ( i was forced to go to) to do online schooling for year 11.

So i guess i was so happy that even though all that crap happened i managed to do well :)

On the day i got my results i showed them to my mum and she read them to my father. He just said well done, but my mum was kinda ecstatic, like hugging me and looked on the verge of tears haha. I also phoned my grandma who was really pleased. My dad then called my mother into the front room and talked to her quietly, i thought it might be because they were planning on eating out to celebrate or something (ill get back to that later). 

But it never happened. I was expecting them to take us out for dinner that night or something fun, and felt a bit disappointed when we didn't. Its normal for our family to go out for dinner to celebrate, so it surprised me when we didn't. Me and mum went paddle boarding the next day, but no mention that it was as a celebration. 

We got to the 24th, and my parents said we would go to a restaurant for dinner, but put HUGE emphasis on the fact that it was just 'to get out of the house, for no other reason'. Because of my anorexia (im in solid recovery, this was just a big challenge) i feel incredibly uncomfortable eating in front of my father, the entire night was miserable and i didn't say a word for the 3 hours we were in the restaurant. I was so stressed about it and cried multiple times. 

I guess i realised that this was probably to celebrate my results, however the fact that it wasnt even mentioned made me think otherwise. What made it worse was that we waited until Monday so the meal would be half price (if you live in the UK you'll know about the eat out to help out scheme!), again emphasising how my parents didnt want to pay the full price on me and im just a waste of their money. 

The next day (25th) i felt so rubbish. I was really upset the whole day. In the evening i managed to talk to my mum alone, and told her how upset i was about the fact we hadnt celebrated my gcse's. She suddenly went into 'panic mode', saying how she was so proud of me and how she felt soo guilty for not celebrating and didnt mean to upset me. Apparently our family eating disorder therapist told them not to celebrate my academic achievements as it put too much pressure on me. Which i guess i understood, but my GCSE's were a much bigger deal!! So when my father called her into the other room and talked to her apparently it was to tell mum to calm down and stop celebrating my results. Mum then said her and dad were confused as they didnt know what to do, and that in her defence she had payed for my hair cut and paddle boarding. Bare in mind the hair cut was just a routine thing and the paddle boarding wasnt really expensive or a huge deal. 

one thing my grandma gave me a well done card today and it made me cry lol

If you've made it this far, thank you!! I just really need some advice: I am angry and upset and i dont like asking for money to be spent on me, but for once i feel i deserve it? Is that just me being selfish? And any advice for how to deal with the emotions? I cant even think about the GCSE's without crying, it felt so good when i received them but everything has been terrible after :(

I also couldn't get help regarding these problems since I didn't have the ability to think about them, try to understand them or put any of this into words which a professional could work with.

Since I didn't know how to communicate, for the last 10ish years I've secluded myself from people including friends and family from back home. I did see some people once when I went back and I've tried keeping in touch but that was only a few messages over the last decade. I didn't have the social competence and mental stamina to keep these conversations going. I've ignored most attempts to connect with people like when I'm messaged on my birthday.

So after awhile, I hung up the phone. Overall we were both toxic and I was glad that I owned it up and moved on. 

The next day they called me and was pushing for us to hangout like “I’m going to come get you at your house.” As scared I was, I politely said “No.” And they hung up the phone. Few minutes later they texted me “I hope Karma gets you.” Which scared me when people wish bad upon me. But I didn’t let it affect me later on. 

One year has passed and this current day, my ex-friend’s ex significant other reached out to me countless times about his verbal abuse, stalking to her house and work place. They eventually broke it off. Some people requested her to put a restraining order on him but she politely just moved on. 

Recently my ex friend is now acquaintances with my sibling and best friend. Once I’ve asked them to not mention him to me, they respect my boundaries and I respect theirs. But there was a decision I had to make whether I tell them what happened in his previous relationship. So I ended up telling them and they were confused because they heard his side and he mentioned that his ex significant other was the crazy one. The same thing happened to me when I told my sibling that he kept on calling me with different numbers, and my sibling told me that I was the one that was doing it to him? Like what? I didn’t screenshot my call log because that was on my old phone. 

This isn’t the first time my ex friend has done this. I don’t want to be around the same space as him or people mentioning him to me. I just want to move on with my life.. but at the same time I want him to be put into his place. 

I know there’s a time for forgiveness and people can change.. but if there’s still doing it.. I just can’t express much words right now. It’s like how could this person get away with a lot of things from his behavior? Why do people tolerate his shit like this?",26Aug2020,1

I feel like I am at a crossroad in my life right now and have no idea which path to take. I am near the end my didactic phase and is starting to look at clinical phase and the stress level is just overwhelming right now. The reason I went into med school was because I originally had an interest in medicine it but throughout the school year, I feel like I lost it. I didn’t have the motivation to learn new material like my friends did and barely scraped by each test. My motivation and interest level was lukewarm on most days. Looking ahead at clinical phase where everyone says things change/improve dramatically, I just don’t feel that excitement. Maybe I’ve just become so burnt out in didactic. The people I’ve spoken to seems to attribute how I’m feeling to being burned out and that I should just stick it out then get the job so I can make money. It makes me feel like I’m not being heard and just makes me even more sad and stressed because then I start thinking about how much debt I’ve taken out to get to this point.

I keep bouncing between taking a leave of absence to re-evaluate my life or just dropping out all together. Truth be told I do value building wealth and have been distracting myself by looking up random jobs and things I can do if I didn’t finish school instead of studying like I should be. I can say the spark for learning about making money is shining brighter than the spark for learning medicine right now. And I think that spark was alway there but is being brought to the forefront of my mind because I am struggling so much with school. I just don’t know what I’m doing right now. Anyone who’s in clinical phase or is working please give me some advice.",26Aug2020,1

I am a student who was just enrolled in a University abroad, however, due to the pandemic, the country is closed, and I am going online for this whole academic year. In Egypt, as a male, you have to either go to the military at 18 or if you could prove that you are enrolled in a university it could be postponed until you are done with your studies. The problem, is that the Egyptian government does recognize online learning at a university online? meaning that in a few months when  
 I turn 18,  I will be forced to go to the military even though I am enrolled in a University abroad, 

 What have I attempted: Get a student visa to 2 possible countries, those being the united states and Canada, however, they cannot accept any student visa applications from Egypt to my knowledge, I've tried many times. the embassies of America and Canada are closed to anyone that is not a citizen of their country, so even if I get the visa online, I still need to go to the embassies to get the visa stamped on my passport which I cannot due since they do not accept visa appointments.

959,"Sorry, very long scenario post:

I am a 33m who has been dating my 31f  girlfriend for a little over 10 years. We have lived together the last 6 years. 

My girlfriend and I are both on the same page about marriage; that we both want to be married. We have been discussing marriage for at least the 6 years we have lived together.

Before writing this, please keep in mind that just like any couple, we struggle with lots of issues that I won't be listing here, as it's nearly impossible when you've had a relationship for a decade. 

Our main struggles have been my terrible communication (I was raised in a home of people who don't communicate well, she was raised in a home of people who communicate too well) and also my avoidance of conflict. She gets angry easily and often, but that has generally increased in recent years and we aren't sure if that's just because of the water under the bridge with us or if it's simply a ""her"" issue. We have also discussed the possibility that I might fall somewhere on the spectrum of Autism after watching Amy Schumer discuss her husband's diagnosis. I have not been tested or diagnosed, though. 

There has been this repeating issue that goes on, where I know I should propose and start thinking on how/what to do, but then I just either chicken out, or we have a big fight, or I feel scared we aren't on strong enough footing. 

I have a belief (as foolish as it may be) that everything needs to be perfect at the time that I propose and we get married. I understand nothing is ever perfect, but for some reason, I just can't get past it. 

She says the main issue is that I tell her it's coming (only because she hints at it or asks) or I have a plan or it's not far off, but then I just don't do it and she gets unbelievably angry with me. So we have a big conversation about it and the cycle just repeats itself. 

Clearly, we have trust issues, and that's mostly my fault. I've made lots of promises and not followed through, I have lied in the past about things... almost always out of fear of conflict. She tells me I am not a man of my word. 

We have recently been doing a self led counseling course. The verdict is still out on that.

Here's my main question, though:

A couple of months ago, she hinted again about marriage/proposal to me and I told her it would be within a certain timeframe. She told me that if I did to her again (I have done this countless times) what I keep doing in the past (telling her and then not actually doing it), that she would be ending it with me because she can't trust my words and she respects herself too much to stay with someone who doesn't want to marry her badly after 10 years.  During that timeframe, we planned a trip to visit my family in Colorado. I decided I would either propose in Colorado (September) or in one of our favorite towns in October when the leaves are changing (the little town means a lot to us). Neither of these dates were within the timeframe I promised her, but soon after. I was afraid she'd be upset if I explained to her that it wouldn't be happening in the timeframe I promised and why. I let it go for a few weeks, knowing that I had an alternate plan and I guess hoping she wouldn't say anything or ask. She learned that because of COVID, she's not going to be able to travel to Colorado with me because of her work. Now that the timeframe is coming to an end, she figured out I would not be proposing like I'd promised. When I told her the truth, she got unbelievably angry and told me that I should have done as I'd promised OR I should have just approached her with the truth and reassured her it was only because I had an exciting alternate plan. She told me I'm a coward and have terrible communication skills. I know that she's right, but I just was afraid if I did that she would be angry and end it with me. 

She told me to move out. I clam up when I'm flustered, so I just shut down. It seems like her mind is made up. I don't want to break up. She says that she made it very clear previously that if I chose to not do as I'd promised that the consequence would be the end of this relationship. She keeps telling me that I chose this knowing it would be the end, not her. 

I don't know why I feel the need for everything to be so perfect. I know she'd say yes. 

We already live like we are married, anyway. I know I want to be with her for my whole life. It has nothing to do with being confident in us or not. I'm confident in her as a life partner. I know in my heart I want to only get married one time, so I put so much pressure on it to be perfect. I wanted to have all the other issues we face worked through before marrying, not because it would change if we stayed together or not but because I wanted to go into the marriage with the strongest foot possible. It's not a question for me about her being the right partner for me, it is just that I felt like we needed to figure some stuff out first. Because marriage is so sacred and since there will be plenty that comes our way, we need to have the other issues figured out before walking down the aisle so we would be on unwavering footing. 

It's really not only just the fighting/unwavering ground, but I also just... lose track of time. I'm happy go lucky by nature, and I'm pretty happy with the situation we have. Like I said, we already live like we are married anyway. She says she gets embarrassed when people ask her why we aren't married yet, because she doesn't know what to answer. It's not her, it's me. She also doesn't understand why we aren't married.

She gets frustrated because most of our issues stem from my avoidance and bad communication and she says I don't do the work to correct those issues. So she says that it's frustrating to hear me say I want to fix what we have before marrying when I don't do anything to fix my issues. 

She says she doesn't understand why I put everything else in front of marrying her, so she says clearly she's not the one for me or I wouldn't be doing that. She says that people who are with the right person and believe in marriage wouldn't put anything in the way of marrying that person, especially after 10 years. She says that she would have married me through any of the crap we've gone through, so she wants to know why was she willing but I wasn't? She says if I didn't want her at her worst, I don't deserve her at her best.

Does anyone have any advice for this situation? I know I'm not phrasing it as an exact question, but what should I do? What should I say to her? What should I be feeling that I'm not understanding? I'm just all up in my head and flustered. 

Please feel free to shoot straight with me if I'm being a dick in this scenario. It takes a lot to hurt my feelings.",26Aug2020,1

Yea as the title says, she did not.

But im not here to blame her.

She has been giving me with flirty looks for the past weeks, she has been bending in front of me for stupid reasons, she has come to sit in the next table to me at the beach. I have a loooot more signals that she was attracted (?) by me but it will take me a lot to write.

If you interpret all these signals, 95% you'll come up with that she likes you ( i belong to the rest 5% i guess haha)

I have seen her friends checking me out too, but i have no idea what they're saying and if its about me or not.

I am not a creep, i don't hold eye contact with people i don't know for over 2 seconds.

I haven't even creeped by staring her body at the beach. Neither other girls'.

My heart beats so fast when she comes close to me or passes by, i can't even spell a goddamn word. I am shaking even by the  thought that I'll go talk to her in real life .

So i decided to follow her on Instagram so as to start the conversation which would be easier to me

But 24hrs have passed, of course she has seen it but she hasn't followed back.

What do you suggest?

1) Write her a DM - Start a conversation with her, despite not being followed back?

2) Just remove the follow and move on? 

I don't know if she does not give a fuck (99% its this thing) or she is kinda ""playing"" with me (1% lol).

How am I supposed to act in the beach?

 Should I lock eyes with her? I guess not, i mustn't look at her.

Should I just don't give a fuck and enjoy my time with my friends, and if possible other girls ( so that i can show I am having a good time without needing her validation)

( I have extreme feelings for her,I love her a lot, despite her probably not knowing it).

Hello Reddit

This is my first ever post so sorry for grammatical or formatting mistakes.

I  (20M) live with my Russian parents (50M and 47F). We as of two years  ago moved to Texas from New Hampshire where we lived for 11 years, and  before that we lived in Australia. I have a weird history that I won't  go into full detail here. My parents lived and grew up around the Moscow  region before having me and we moved around a lot when I was younger  and we ended up here in America (thank the lord that we did). After  living in New Hampshire for 11 years my Dad found a better job in Texas  which while I was going off to college for the first time my Mom and Dad  moved together to Texas. Leaving a place we considered home for a long  time we had to leave all our friends behind. I find it fairly easy for  me to make new friends if I ever want to find more; however, the same is  not true for my parents. After this whole COVID-19 ordeal it is more  important than ever to find and make friends with people. I fear my Dad  might be slowly becoming depressed and my Mom is also seemingly on the  sadder sight lately. I attribute this to finding it rather hard to make  new friends, being locked inside all day, and other people keeping a  social distance of 6 feet with each other. The internet is not for  everyone and that is true for my folks. They aren't as technologically  inclined as me so they don't want to and find it hard to use the  internet to make new friends. So as the title suggests and asks, how do I  help my Russian parents living in Texas make new friends?",26Aug2020,1
968,"I have been very closed up ever since I was young. When I was 12-13 I used to have very bad panic attacks and was very sad all the time but I internalised all this. It still affects me sometimes but I think I'm better at handling it. At least that's what I think but my family and friends kinda disagree? 

Anyway, because of internalising all my sad emotions and sometimes my happy ones, I cannot communicate with my friends. I have one friend whom I dearly love, like a lot. She was there through thick or thin but after covid, I couldn't talk to her much. We used to talk on call for hours almost on a daily basis, even during exam seasons. 

I want to talk to her but I know I've hurt her by telling her I couldn't speak to her ( she used to call me in the evening but after march I had to do some chores almost at the exact same time and I could talk then) this happend a few times and she stopped calling. 

I know where she is coming from and why she would stop calling. I am the type of person who never calls anyone else because I feel like a burden. This is so bad that my best friend of 12 years has to assure me that I can call her if I want to talk almost regularly. I feel very anxious and still don't call her vey often

So I want to talk to her but how? The few times I've tried to call her, she was busy and we talked for a few mins so my confidence is already down. I know she must feel the same way that's why I want to extend my hand this time. But how.

969,"Basically, I’ve been friends with this girl for like 1 and a half years, and at the start of this year, we made this group of me, her, her friend from childhood who goes to my school, and her best friend from her school. It started off well, meeting up most weeks and just hanging out, but then quarantine hit so that stopped. 

And in like June time, I started to make these jokes where I would just take the piss and try and turn everything into a sexual joke. It lasted like a month but I’ve pretty much stopped now cause it started to not be fun anymore. But I think that’s where it started with her (the best friend from school now) not liking me cause our relationship before was alright, but she didn’t like the jokes, as in didn’t find them funny, but neither did most people, it was just fun, so I looked past it.

But when we started meeting again, I gues I got more, handsy, like I started to be more ‘touchy’ irl. It’s just how I was raised, like I’ve always been physical with people, but she started to have a problem with it so I stopped with her. She didn’t tell me directly either, she got another friend who joined our group a little while back to do it and I had to ask the original friend what it was about. Then it just got further and further with it being obvious she doesn’t like me or consider me a friend.

This hit me hard cause I thought we were decent, but for her to almost blatantly say she doesn’t like me, like it’s obvious and she knows she’s getting the message out there, but like, idk it just got to me. 

She mentioned when somebody else said that they liked me and my jokes (in general) and shit like that, but she said it’s different for her cause she’s a girl. I didn’t pick up on it at the time but like, idk what specifically it is about why she doesn’t like me, and I can’t ask anybody cause that would be awkward as shit and could even make things worse. Like she hiding text channels from me in discord so I can’t see them, voice channels and shit. And I just, like I wang is to be good friends but I can’t cause she doesn’t like me and idk why or how to fix it.

There’s another person in the group she doesn’t like which is even more of a mystery but idrc. I just, fuck I think I might have a crush on her but I’m not sure. It’s just difficult cause there’s this girl in America as well who I love, and loves me, but we both said that we couldn’t get into a long distance relationship and we’ve both told each other to find someone else but every time we’ve refused. It’s just, so difficult.

But that’s not the reason I want her to like me, I just wanna become friends with her cause I genuinely like her as a person, like she’s funny, interesting and all that shit, but she doesn’t like me and I wanna fix that.

I loved her. I put her in college. I took her in. She nursed my dying grandma. There was good! But we are falling apart.

975,"SO! Here we go.

-Back story-

~ Part 1: So I’m back with my ex of two times 
First time was on her part, and we agree it was due to stupid people saying stupid things and distance. Second time. Was me. I lied about a stupid thing and my college anxiety got to me. We agree this time we have both grown up considerably. Each time almost a years gap of distance. Neither of us had any other partners during.

~ Part 2: so things are beautiful! We are super understanding of one another and are very very happy. At least I hope so. So this is where I’m needing help.  (Help portion) : so every time we have dated something has been consistent. Clingy. Not too extreme but we enjoy being together whenever we can. Our parents don’t know about us dating again obviously because it’s awkward rn with them. So we used to sneak away a lot to spend one on one time together (no problem) 
We used to text all the time and face time a little at night just before she goes to bed (maybe 30mins to an hour) so she can tell me about her day and vise versa. 
We both admired to each other that sometimes we both are VERY poor texters. I mean we do better with speaking. Typing sometimes just doesn’t go well and we both live fairly busy lives. 
So we both understand that we won’t always be talking a lot over texts.
So recently. Iv been texting her a good amount. Just wishing her a good day 
Asking about how things are going (she appreciates checking in and me looking out for her because she’s pretty bad at it lol) 
But I rarely get anything past a “it’s good” 
And I pour my heart out sometimes. Which I can overlook. That’s fine. But even phone calls and face time. We used to call after a hard day but whenever I call she never seems to be available. And when it comes to face time she usually is way too tired to talk all too much or sometimes doesn’t want to or needs to face time another friend. I get it but sometimes it feels like she’s avoiding me. 
Even when we do get a chance to be together. Lately it hasn’t happened. And when it does it’s very short because she has other things to do. Or we just run errands together. 

(Small edit) 

I would talk to her about this. But I’m afraid it’ll come out wrong and it’ll be my fault and I’ll upset her or force her into pushing herself to be more active. 

I love her more than anything but man I’m lonely af. 
We both have full time jobs so it’s understandable we are both tired. 

(So question) 

Someone tell me I’m acting stupid. Idk how to approach this because she’s happy with me so it seams but my anxiety gets to me and gets into my head space 
Maybe someone can explain why she may be acting this way? 
Or give me advice how to calm my mind?

976,"I started at a new college this Monday, and I'm living off campus with two girls- both Juniors, my assumption is that they're 20. I'm a bit older, and much awkwarder- I'm 22, and started at a community college 2 years ago.

 

**If you'd like the full context, that's here**\- if you'd like, you can skip to ""I could use some advice in a couple places."" Thanks!

I'm not a perfect roommate, but I try my best. I'm overly cautious when it comes to noise, and respectful of my roommate's classes and belongings.

The two girls are polite, and we chatted a bit during the first couple days. I tend to stick to myself, so that's died down a little. (After last night, Girl B has not spoken or made eye contact with me, though.) They don't mind that I get up at 5 + 6am, and if I snore, they haven't said anything. 

The tiny red flags I wouldn't mind alone:

1. They bought everything b4 i signed the lease, and told me not to bring anything for the kitchen or living room. When I explained that I already owned a vacuum from another apartment, they asked that I leave it in storage.
2. They use 4 of the 5 pantry shelves, and the floor. They bought 2 more shelving units for themselves that use all the available space for shelving units, so I can't put my own in the kitchen.

Slightly more bothersome:

1. They're using 5/6ths of the fridge. My groceries are stacked like Tetris so Girl B can give her strawberries room to breathe.   
All of my items in the fridge + freezer where there before they went shopping.
2. Girl B vacuumed the hallway during one of my remote classes. Girl A helped. I was talking *while they turned on the vacuum*.

This is all stuff I could probably look past. 

The final straw a la ""driving me to reddit"": Girl A woke me up an hour after I went to sleep to ask if I'd taken Girl B's makeup bag. Girl B found her bag under her bed *while* Girl A was asking me to look through my room. 

They apologized for waking me up. I had to get up at 5am for work today + have a lot of issues sleeping, so I said it was fine and tried to minimize the impact on my sleep schedule.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

It's the following day now, and I have no *idea* how to bring up my concerns. I'm obviously pretty bothered by the dig at my character (the bag was far too large to grab by accident. If I'd taken it, it would've been intentional theft,) but I understand. It's the blatant lack of consideration that really concerns me. You can't even *look under your own bed* before pounding on my door at night to ask if I've robbed you? 

It feels like such a blatant disregard for my needs that it casts everything else, which I was viewing as uncomfy compromises, in a different light. Are we compromising, or are they living in their 2-person apartment and waiting for me to use up my eggs to take advantage of the fridge space?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**I could use some advice in a couple of places:**

Should I only bring up the things that really bother me, or everything? Everything that's bothering me would show how much I'm willing to compromise, but only bringing up the really bothersome stuff (fridge, vacuum, bag-incident) would come across less nitpicky, right?

Am I being totally unreasonable? There's a possibility they don't know I was sleeping- It was only 10pm. I honestly have no idea what normal roommate fridge rules are. I'm only going off an apartment I shared with friends when I was 19.   
Or: Do I need to grow a spine and demand access to the space I'm paying rent for?

And finally... how the heck do I bring this up? I met these girls less than a week ago, and we hardly talk, and I'm, like, *unimaginably* awkward and non-confrontational. I really don't want to make things tense, but I do want some reasonable house rules.  

&amp;#x200B;

sorry for the long post! 

tl;dr: my roommates woke me up to ask if I'd stolen from them before checking their own rooms, and use too much fridge space. Is there a way that I can bring this up without making things tense in the house?",26Aug2020,1
977,"My crush did not follow back on Instagram

But im not here to blame her.

She has been giving me with flirty looks for the past weeks, she has been bending in front of me for stupid reasons, she has come to sit in the next table to me at the beach. I have a loooot more signals that she was attracted (?) by me but it will take me a lot to write.

If you interpret all these signals, 95% you'll come up with that she likes you ( i belong to the rest 5% i guess haha)

I have seen her friends checking me out too, but i have no idea what they're saying and if its about me or not.

I am not a creep, i don't hold eye contact with people i don't know for over 2 seconds.

I haven't even creeped by staring her body at the beach. Neither other girls'.

My heart beats so fast when she comes close to me or passes by, i can't even spell a goddamn word. I am shaking even by the  thought that I'll go talk to her in real life .

So i decided to follow her on Instagram so as to start the conversation which would be easier to me

But 24hrs have passed, of course she has seen it but she hasn't followed back.

What do you suggest?

1) Write her a DM - Start a conversation with her, despite not being followed back?

2) Just remove the follow and move on? 

I don't know if she does not give a fuck (99% its this thing) or she is kinda ""playing"" with me (1% lol).

How am I supposed to act in the beach?

 Should I lock eyes with her? I guess not, i mustn't look at her.

Should I just don't give a fuck and enjoy my time with my friends, and if possible other girls ( so that i can show I am having a good time without needing her validation)

( I have extreme feelings for her,I love her a lot, despite her probably not knowing it).

Please i need help.

Thanks in advance and stay safe!!",26Aug2020,1

I had a thought actually to maybe text him and plan to meet up with him, be intimate and pretend like I want to go back with him and then go no contact again, jus so he can feel what I felt during our relationship. I jus really want to get him back for all the pain he put me through! Plus I want the hot steamy sex we would always have one more time? He was a narcissist btw.

982,"Hi

So recently I’ve been very apprehensive about attending college this semester as a freshmen. When I initially applied to colleges last year as a senior, I was very picky and only applied to a select few that were reaches. As a result, I was rejected from a fair amount and I am currently going to a backup in a location that I hate. I have strong high school grades and I received a large scholarship, but I am dreading attending that school. Recently, I’ve been considering withdrawing and reapplying to other schools next year to broaden my horizons. Additionally, this gap year would allow me to work and save money for college. However, I also don’t know if this would be irrational and if it would be better to try and transfer after a semester. Any thoughts?",26Aug2020,1

My gf next to me got really mad and glared at them, while i did nothing and looked at the one guy that was talking at us, since the other one i knew went back and sat down. I didnt do anything, didnt even acknowledge them speaking, i acted as if they werent there, didnt even glanced at them.

She makes random puuring sounds and talks to animals like kids. 
She torments the dogs in our naboirhead by scaring them with hissing loudly to the point the dogs start running away. 
One time during second year or freshman year of highschool she saw some girl talking to her crush who was also her freind and she became SUPERHUMAN Like she flat out ran there like a fucking tiger and almost scratched the girls eye out in a second.

She used to have really sharp smelling before she got into a firework accident. 
 
She also stretches like a fucking cat and sleeps alot. 
She's been werid yes but somtimes it gets too werid. Plus she can tame almost any cat? Some hate her though.

985,"As the title says , my mom is incredibly easily offended. I believe it comes down to her lack of self esteem. Growing up she would constantly slip into conversations how she’s “ a bad person” people think she’s “ stupid” and how ugly and horrible looking she is. She has an unshakable sense of deep worthlessness. Growing up around this, made me become a parent myself.  I would over function and try to help her emotions by saying stuff like “ you’re not “ and try to offer help. 

I’ve learned the hard way that that only expends my energy and she can’t really be helped sadly. She goes to therapy, but she hasn’t really improved largely with her confidence. I also since moving out have reduced my contact with her. We even had a falling out once and I didn’t speak to her for months. We have slowly built a sort of relationship and I’m comfortable with our level of contact which is, very very occasional visits and just once weekly calls. She can be pleasant to talk to during these talks, however I do find it frustrating since as her character always has been that she is incredibly easily offended. 

I asked her today “ are you looking forward to visiting me ?” She got defensive and asked why I’d ask something like that. She then said that often I have an “ aggressive tone” and she then put it down to something wrong with how I said it. I said I was sorry that she felt that way, and then she got annoyed saying “ I didn’t ask you to apologise, but I just don’t know what you mean sometimes.” I asked her to clarify what she meant by that but she just changed the subject. Thus as explained even though it’s a completely neutral non fired question, it turns into a defense and part of her narrative of “ worthlessness.” 

I find it hard to navigate and find it hard to say when basically most neutral , non negative stuff is mostly taken offensively. I became very over compensating in my everyday life always adding clauses to everything just in case someone took offence, which I realised only minimised my feelings. 

I was wondering if anyone had any good deflection techniques or phrases I could use for those situations? So far I’ve just been saying stuff like “ sorry to hear that you feel that way, that was not my intention, I’m not annoyed I’m just making conversation.” However I’m wondering if there’s a more effective way to communicate? I’m not asking to change her and I’m well aware her behaviour emotionally is similar to a child, and always has been and probably always will be.

It still scared us a lot since it never happened before.

I'm 100% sure she saw them, and didn't even bother to fully close the lid of the box they were stored in. This has always been a problem, especially while going through puberty.

995,"Some background: I grew up extremely privileged even though my mom was a single mom. She bought me my first vehicle when I was 16 and when I was 20, my vehicle was having major issues so we traded it in &amp; she paid most of the difference while I paid the 6k remaining so I wouldn't have to do payments. My vehicles have also been under her name insurance/registration wise since I was 16 as well.

When I was 18, I started working for a department within my country's federal government and was employed with them until I finished university last year. About a month after I graduated, I was offered a salary position with this same department.

She was seeing an intern therapist on and off (for other reasons) for the last year. Intern therapist is overseen by senior therapist. Senior therapist happens to be head of disordered eating at our hospital. 

My daughters new therapist has been tardy to every single one of her appointments (all via video) First session was 16 minutes. Second session was 30. Today, after 40 minutes she called my daughter to say she was pushing her appointment back to 3 pm (her original appointment was at 1 pm) 

I am enraged. This can not possibly be appropriate etiquette for a mental health professional. My daughter is already on the fence about having to attend therapy, so the fact that this woman can’t even show up on time for her sessions is making her feel even more depressed.

I'm going into my 3rd year at uni, where I'm from only your grades from 3rd and 4th year count toward your final grade.

- Her sending an ‘apology’ voice recording. After listening to it, you can actually hear he doing sexual acts and my ‘friend’ laughing in the back and mimicking her ‘crying’ my name
- She always used to convince me to get get some sleep so she can text guys when I knock out 
- She used to get me really high and take advantage in many ways, e.g. few times she tried to convince me into a threesome with a ‘friend’ while we all were smoking up 
- She used my anxiety against me, e.g. she knew I can’t handle public attention so she’ll always raise her voice when argue to get me anxious and quite down 

Honestly these aren’t even the worst things she has done to me, the list goes on. I’ve been counselling but it just hadn’t helped me with the trust issues and moving on part.

I don’t want it but these terrible memories keep popping up. I’m still mad at everything that’s happened, like why didn’t I do anything about this sooner, why didn’t I confront her sooner, why didn’t talk to someone sooner, why me? 

I was suicidal and self harming thoughts were there but I’ve moved on from that thankfully.
Can anyone advise me on how to move on from this and build trust again? I just want everything to back to normal and be happy again.",26Aug2020,1
1009,"This is a message to the people who need this. Please read if you can. I know it’s in the middle of image weekdays but still.

Today, a girl that moved to Florida from my school committed suicide due to depression. I have a message for all of you.

I know it’s super cliche but there are people that care about you. They may not be here now, but they will come across you at some point. Life is super sucky sometimes as we all know, especially now during this virus. Do not hesitate to take a step back and look at your life to see what you can improve upon to make your life better. 

I’ve always heard of people committing suicide due to depression and things like that, but I didn’t think that it would ever affect me. Her and I were not close, but we went to the same school before she moved and had some classes together. 

Even though we weren’t close, it still hurts me to know that her parents and her friends have to go through knowing that she is now dead. 

Just know that no matter how bad life may be, it’s ok to just take a step back and try to improve something that will make you happy. Don’t ever give up on life, and PLEASE IF YOU NEED ANYONE TO TALK TO, DM ME! I love helping people and would be willing to talk to you.",26Aug2020,1
1010,"As the title says, I cannot stop living in the past. I have really bad anxiety and depression because of it. And it’s because I’m afraid my past will come back to get me. When I was younger, I also had depression for a different reason, and I would take my anger from that out on Twitter and video games. I would say hateful, ignorant, and stupid things all the time without consequences. My parents didn’t really enforce the Internet or watch what I was doing really, so I could say whatever I wanted. It was definitely the worst in video games and I was perma banned from multiple games. Which ended up being the best thing for me.

I eventually grew out of that phase of my life and I’m a much better person now. Like complete 180. I’ve tried to make as much as I can right. And apologized to who I can potentially apologize to. I’ve gone through and attempted to delete some past things I’ve said on Twitter, but I can’t seem to get over the fact that one day something might come up that I missed. I have over 20k tweets. Or a developer releases chat logs. I’m terrified one day all of these things I said might hurt my future. Yes, I know I’m a nobody, but I do want a career in media and think if any of this stuff shows up it would hurt my opportunities. I’ve thought about just deleting my Twitter account entirely, but I still enjoy using it in a different way. Idk, I’m probably just overreacting but it’s gotten to the point where it’s affecting my life so I’m not sure what to do. Thanks",26Aug2020,1
1011,"My sister and I never got along. Let me just start off with that. She has hated me since she turned 13 and I have no idea why but she just does. 

For the last three months, she was nice to me and made it seem like we were happy siblings. I have done everything in my power to help her when she needed it (taking care of my niece and nephew, given her advice on how to handle her ex-boyfriend, etc.) And I honestly thought we were going to be like normal siblings for once. 

Then a couple of days ago she started being mean to me again. I guess today I just finally snapped and I yelled at her. To which she punched me. Now my mom wants me to apologize to her, but I really don't feel like I should have to. She has said so much worse to me and about me than I said to her when my mom isn't around, and sometimes when she is. She always picks her side, so it doesn't surprise me that she feels like I should apologize to her but I really don't feel like I should have to when she has been abusive to me all of my life.

This can potentially help me advance in my studies and get a job earlier instead of struggling of getting a job in this field  Lately i had been really stressed because of this class and I'm not really getting the material so I had been rethinking my decision.

I'm thinking of changing the class to video game programming which peeked my interest when I was 10 years old but i don't know anything about it. I always dreamt of making my own game and making people happy. Even if my first game was trashy i would come back and improve it. I always loved playing video games by myself or with others and want others to experience that too.

I find this to be such an annoying trait in my personality and i really cant stand myself anymore

I just started college and I will start having a schedule that is not everyday from 8am to 3pm. Some of my course are from home and some of them are on the campus.

Here are the around that I have to wake up to be on time for my course, from monday to friday: 8:50, 10:50, 7:00, 8:50 and 6:00.

I have to make a decision concerning my sleep schedule. 

I have two options: I wake up everyday at 6 am, do my homework if I don't have a course  and go to my course when it is time or should I put an alarm everyday at the hour I must wake up maximum (even if I know my body won't stay sleeping past 8:30 anyway). Of course, I will always go to bed at the right hour to achieve my 8 hours of sleep.

If it can help I am 17.

I (22M) was dating someone (21F) for about 9ish months. Long story short she was a rape victim, the sex died really early on, around the 4-5 month time I started getting rejected a lot more often. I was okay with all of this I knew what I was getting myself into ( or so I thought). I loved her enough to know that we can make this work. Issue is, when I asked her to be my girlfriend around the 7 month mark she said that she liked the way things were as they are and that she wants to get to know me even more. Mind you, we’re both in the Army and I asked her to be my gf right before I had to go on a mission to NY for this whole COVID shit (March) So she rejected me taking this to the next level. Btw, she was schedule to deploy to Iraq in July-August for 9 months. Thing is, I had met her family, been to her house many times spent the night had long conversations with her mom, dad her sister. They all loved me. She even said at one point I am the man she wants to marry one day. We were like best friends. She even hinted that I should ask her mom about making her my gf when the time comes. I did all of that. She was the first person I ever dated so I made sure she had “the perfect man” as much as I could given her past and her failed relationships that all ended up in the guy cheating on her. While I was in NY it went even more downhill. It’s difficult to communicate what we even were now since she rejected me. I guess we were still dating. I come back from the mission, we talk, she wants to be friends. But here’s the catch, when she’s in Iraq she said she’s going to work on herself so when she comes back she could REALLY be with me. I took this kind of hard. I said yes at first. Couple weeks go by, she is almost deploying. I don’t get much reassurance from her, I basically say I can’t be her friend. I can’t. I can’t do it, not with her being gone for so long. What if she doesn’t get better which I know she probably won’t because this trauma never truly goes away. The trauma is still fresh, it’s been two years since the incident. What if her feelings change. Too many variables so I told her that I am just going to move on. She blocks me on all social media after I say all this. Two weeks later she’s gone to Iraq. Don’t know if I’ll ever see her again. This hurts a lot. My heart aches for her every day. I just don’t know if I did the right thing or not. When she comes back from deployment I’ll be in Colorado (in TX right now). I wrote her a letter with a picture of us and gave it to her boss to give to her on the plane right before they left. I saw her on her last day but it was shitty. I tried talking to her and she basically said “why?” In an annoyed tone. Tried again later but she was in a rush to grab her bag that she left up front.

 So me and my husband decided to start trying for a baby and in the meantime I would start looking for a new job. 
Last week I had two job interviews and today I got hired at once of the two company's. Since it's really hard to find jobs these days I'm obviously very happy. I'll have to work in my old job till the end of September and will start my new job on the first of October. I'm supposed to come in next week to sign my contract. 
But.. yesterday I found out that I'm already pregnant. On the first try. I didn't expect that at all but I'm obviously very happy. 
When I have to start my new job I'll be 9 weeks. I want to build a trustworthy relationship so I have the best chance to get a solid contract and keep working there after I have the baby. 
So do I tell her next week at 5 weeks pregnant when I sign the contract? Do I tell her at 9/10 weeks when I start working there? I don't want to wait too long cause they might think I lied and only wanted a contract. That won't build a good relationship with my coworkers at all.

1019,"So about a month ago I [16] came out as trans nonbinary to my grandma. But the circumstances under which I had to come out weren't the best per say. I used to be super close to my busia (grandma) but around 2016 she started reading conspiracy theories online and she lived her life by them. If she wasn't talking about God she was talking about how the world was going to end and start anew in less than 10 years.

4 years later and the only thing that's changed is how far down the rabbit hole she is. During quarantine she must have been online looking at stuff all day because when I went to spend the night she talked for 4 hours straight about how there were 12 foot people living in the moon, that we've already been to mars, every president, vice president and speaker of the house has 3 clones of themselves, Trump has 6 because he's special and speaks a secret language only 7 other people have ever managed to learn (that's where ""kofefe"" or whatever came from), and Obama, Tom Hanks and his wife along with the pope have all been executed for crimes against humanity. Then comes the kicker. Michelle Obama is trans and she's trans because she's a satanist and all trans people are trans because they worship the devel. I wanted to screem. I wanted to run. So I did.

I ran away and walked in a not so good part of town trying my best to stay calm but I couldn't so I just walked. 2 hours later she called and found me then demanded to know why I left. So I came out. And got another 2 hour lecture at 3am why I was wrong and would always be a girl no matter what.

And now that it's my birthday along with my mom's, dad's and sister's she wants to come over to have dinner. (All our birthday's are within the same week)

My parents grounded me because I ran away and lately I have not been able to get back on their good side. So I'm worried they'll make me stay for dinner and talk to my busia again. But when we passed her house the day of mine and my mom's birthday I thought for sure we were going to stop and I nearly had a full blown panic attack because of that. Just thinking about being in the same room as her makes me feel sick. I want nothing to do with her anymore as awful as that sounds.

I just don't know how to handle this because I dont even know when the dinner is heck it could be tomorrow or next week or even next month but my parents haven't said a word to me (I only overheard their conversation about my busia). Should I just ask that everyone but me goes to her house instead of her coming here? Should I ask to go to a friend's house that night? What if they say no and I have to go to dinner theres no way I'm not going to have a panic attack the moment that car pulls in the drive way and she comes out asking for hugs. I don't know what to do anymore so if you have ANY suggestions I'm desperate for a way out of this.",26Aug2020,1
1020,"

So I’m 15m and really confused about my sexuality I don’t want to be given “just give it time see who you like.” Or something along those lines because even if you mean well I will not stop stressing about this till I can come to a  definitive answer.  
When I was 12 would have been my first experience being sexually attracted to someone it was in the swimming pool changing rooms. some older guys walked in started getting changed and I remember looking over and getting turned on then rushing getting changed and leaving kind of embarrassed/ confused.
Then when i was 13 I remember seeing a naked women for the first time out of curiosity and felt nothing and remember being upset and frustrated as to why wasn’t I.
I know that screams gay but there’s more. 
Since then I have only really experienced  sexual attraction towards men, but before I even had any of these feelings I had several crushes on girls when I was younger before I even knew what sex was. And even after those experiences I’ve had a couple crushes on girls I think? Like I wasn’t sexually attracted to them but I could picture a relationship in my head that I liked the idea of and I could see myself kissing them. I’ve also felt these feelings with guys to maybe a stronger extent but I’m not sure. 
On top of that I don’t find a women’s body like disgusting or anything and I often hear straight guys talk about how they would need a fairly large amount of money to do anything gay and obviously find the thought of it disgusting so applying that logic to me if I was really gay shouldn’t I find the thought of having sex with a women disgusting?
Like I don’t find them sexually attractive but I could see myself sleeping with one I think. 
And when I was a lot younger i would only have fantasies about relationships with women. They wouldn’t be sexual but I’d have day dreams of growing up and having a wife and family. 
Not once did I even think about guys then.

1023,"I'm 15, male and suffer from intense pain, throughout my entire body for every waking hour of my life with no end to the pain in site. 

I'm absolutely at my wits end as to what to do. I'm at the the point at which I utterly buckle at the thought of suffering from this for the rest of my life (it is likely only to get worse). 

A bit of context:

After touring UK's doctors over the last couple of years, I have been diagnosed with severe chronic migraine without aura. For that I have extensively tried practically every treatment in the book - including travelling to great Ormond street hospital for monthky injections of a cocktail of steroids and numbing agents. Currently I I'm trying amitriptyline daily but its have practically no positive effect. The only direct painkillers that put even a dent in the pain is a combo of the max quantity of ibuprofen and naproxen. 

I likely also have fibromyalgia, however as its symptoms and treatments are almost identical to that of migraine, there is practically no point in having another tour of the uks hospitals to have it officially diagnosed. Especially with current events in mind. 

I also live for the 30 seconds. My only pleasure is helming high performance sailing boats, easily capable of speeds over 30 miles an hour. Without the little sport that I can do, my life would be utterly dire. But every time I sail, I do so in the knowledge I will be in massive pain the following day, possibly to the point that I will be practically unable to function entirely. But without that, I would be confined to a life cooped inside trying to distract myself from the constant, unwaivering pain. So it is a choice I make. 

Thanks to the combination of extreme activity and long periods of little exercise, I become badly injured often. As I write this I have an utterly ripped angle of louis, confining me to my house in significant pain, ontop of constant general muscle and joint pain, tiredness and an intense headache. 

Also as a result of the life I have to lead, as well as the fibromyalgia, the muscles around my spine are very unstable, which leads to almost constant back pain. 

And, being 15, I will have to sit my GCSEs in less than a year 1. After spending nearly half of my gcse course not in school, due to the chronic pain and now covid. The stress of the upcoming GCSEs only makes matters worse.

The only way I am able to put a dent in the pain its through painkillers then doing stupid, risky things. This is, for obvious reasons only serving to make the pain worse in the long run.

I have found that if I utterly immerse myself in something - generally a video game, I'm able to distract my brain so am able to practically ignore the pain in the short term. However sitting around playing games only makes the pain worse in the long run.



To sum up: I'm a 15 year old, with the pain of a crippled 80 year old unable to do anything about it and only watching it get worse. I really need some advice.

My wife and I have been friends with this guy for over 15 years. He was the best man at my wedding and I love the guy like a brother. He would do anything for me and has always been there when I needed him, whether it be fishing or helping with a project at my house. 

We have also been friends with his gf in the same manner, great friend and always there for us. Like a sister to us.

Recently, my best man was busted and is in prison facing a crazy amount of jail time (Realistically 10+ years). I had no clue about anything he was doing. Neither did his gf or my wife. 

His GF decided she wanted nothing to do with him. Obviously because she is hurt and that’s understandable. Phones were tapped and her life was recorded for almost a year (mine as well, I talked to the guy every day).

I have kept talking to him in jail to offer support and be there for him when he needs it. Still do.

My dilemma is when he gets out of prison in 10 years. How can I manage being friends with both of them without causing a problem? Should I stop talking to my best man and best friend?",26Aug2020,1

Fathers day, i got him a good bottle of rum... only this time i thought id call him in the evening; but i just get a 'the footys on, i'll call you back.' And he never did. 

So I decided that I was not going to be the one to instigate a conversation with him... id let him call me. Anyway, it is almost September and I hadn't heard from him until I finally called him yesterday to tell him about my sister expecting another baby. But what am I met with? ""OMG 'he' *finally* calls... why haven't you called...i feel like we are drifting apart.""

And so I start telling him how I'm not the only one who can make calls. How he needs to be the one to try more. But then he tells me that i'm ashamed of him which is why I didn't come back home for the lockdown. Im not ashamed of him but I cannot live with him, I can't cope with his lifestyle.

* Smoking in the house (i'm asthmatic) and other drugs.
* He rarely cleans his house.
* His friends use my old room as a guest room so I always come back to cigarette stumps everywhere, unclean and cigarette holes in the bedding.
* Has mostly junk food in his cupboard.

1029,"I had a breakdown a couple of hours ago and was in a really bad spot mentally. I was this pretty close to attempting something. Whenever I'm in that situation, I tend to self sabotage.   
My first instinct was to reach out to some of my online friends but in an attempt to stop myself getting help, I left all of my shared servers with them and unfriended them all, blocked their numbers and other social medias. Sure, I could have just disconnected my phone, but the temptation to ask for help was really strong and the embarrassment of sending friend requests was stronger than that temptation.  
Several hours later, after my brother found me and forced me to watch a movie with him and I'm less upset, I want to get back into contact with them because I know they're worried. But I'm embarrassed and scared.

Until September 8th, I am stuck in my house AGAIN with my family that I cannot stand and am not close to. I have very few friends and rarely get to talk to or see at all. I love my job but it's extremely social and I have horrible social anxiety and I'm basically the reject of my entire work group. So it's misery but at the same time it's the only thing that gives my life any sort of meaning. There's a person at my work who I'm basically in love with but I never get to see her anymore because our schedules are different now and I'm afraid our friendship is just going to crumble. I have time early in the mornings to visit her but for some godforsaken reason, my anxiety and stomach issues are the absolute worst in the mornings and I can't even manage a conversation with her without looking terrified and/or dry heaving. It's horrible, it's unfair, and it makes no sense. I miss her so much and think about her a lot. She probably doesn't even think about me. She likes me as a friend (I guess, I think) but not at all like I do for her. I'm sick all the time and I don't know why. For nearly a week now, I've been extremely nauseous and I don't know why. I can't even see a doctor right now because apparently they're not accepting any sick patients which doesn't make any fukking sense but fine. I just hate everything right now.

1032,"Heya Reddit! I’ve kind of hit a dead end. I was on a public discord for a while, made friends with a young school mate friend (high school,) (it was a popular YouTuber’s discord,) 

And so, I’m stuck in a situation. My online friend I’m pretty sure is being mentally abused by her mother. Her mother is threatening to send her off to a place called “Gateway.” Where it:
•Deals with Anger management 
•deals with Poor Grades
•Keeps a person until they’re 18, 
• Has an associate with the last name of “Moore.” 
•”Things get very violent there.”

I’m pretty sure her mother is ABSOLUTELY trolling her... but she’s been pretty convinced. I’ve done a lot of digging, but I can’t seem to calm her down . I can’t find a SINGLE place by that name that fits that criteria, but I figure maybe Reddit was the place to go??? 

This sounds so outlandish, but I just want to help her out here. I’m also thinking *I’m* getting trolled too. Maybe for attention. I really don’t know. But if there’s a place like that, can someone let me know??? Or even just tell me what I could do in this situation? 

I really appreciate the help here, Reddit. even if it’s me getting yelled at abt how I’m dumb for believing this. But it is what it is. 

Thanks!!!",26Aug2020,1
1033,"Throwaway account because I'm just a paranoid person and sorry for my awful formating in advance!

To give you some background, my country is holding an election this sunday and I took the job of giving away flyers to people for a certain political party so I can earn some daily wages. Even though I'm not a big fan, I would've voted for said political party anyway because the situation here got pretty bad and the biggest goal is to just over throw the current govnerment. 

Now, for the sellout part. I can't escape the feeling of overwhelming disappointment in myself because I'm publicly encouraging people to vote for a certain party. Don't get me wrong, I would proudly talk about importance of voting as I do already, but to put things in perspective, imagine as if I was American, I would vote for Biden because I want Trump gone, even though I'm not overly excited for Biden being a president. Now imagine me wearing shirts and going around town sharing flyers of someone I don't even fully support. Point blank, I accepted the job because I needed money, but now I can't comprehend how I didn't even think about who I am representing. I just wish I took a job as a waitress (which I've done already) or any other job if I needed money. 

The important thing which I probably should have mentioned at the beginning is that I am very left and very liberal, so political stance really matters to me. But even more important, even if you take politics out of it, I feel like I didn't do the right thing which I just can't get over. I'm aware I sound so overly dramatic but in the literal sense I feel dirty and like I betrayed myself. Also, I was kind of looked down upon by my friends for doing this job. I just don't want to paint myself as some moral high ground because there's obviously a social aspect to it and I hate feeling judged. 

My question is what to do now, after I've done the wrong thing and can't take it back. I already decided to spent the money (miserly 100 euros) on my family, but still, how can I ever get over the fact that I've DONE it. This obviously isn't the first mistake I made in my 19 years of life, but I definitely could avoid just pissing on my ideals and my reputation.",26Aug2020,1
1034,"So we've been friends for 2 years and we got pretty close. My(24F) best friend (25M) is still a virgin because he's scared of intimacy. During the time I knew him he went in and out of relationships that started and ended too fast (longest was his recent one and it lasted for 3months) he didn't have sex with any of the girls because, als he admitted to me, getting intimate with them or naked around them freaked him out.

Lately he told me he would like me to be his first because he feels comfortable around me. I'm single and I've been single for a very long time by choice and I don't know how to react to that.
I'm afraid this will ruin our friendship and I cherish him too much qto lose him. But at the same time I would be lying if I denied that I'm not tempted to accept his request.

I am starting university this upcoming Monday the 31st and I am about to work full-time at the same time because I do not have the money to pay off university without these jobs. Alongside with that, I am also doing my courses in French since they do not offer them in English due to where I live. I am good at French, but I am afraid that I will have some difficulty understanding. I am also having problems with my social life (a guy who I love decided to let me go and find someone else even though he ''loved'' me too, my friends dropping me and not even listening to my call for help and ignoring me when I really need advice). It sucks because when they need me, I am always there and always take my time to listen to them.

1049,"Hi, throwaway because my friends and family use reddit. (Sorry if it’s a bit of a long read)

The relationship or FWB started in my senior year. I got close to this person in my friend group and we began talking a lot and played video games together quite often. I’m not out of the closet and neither is he, but he would often flirt with me and I did the same. But one day, he invited me over to his house and he made the first move and that’s how our secret FWB relationship started. 

Over the school year I would occasionally go over after school and we did stuff like make out and cuddle and a bit more than that. I was really happy and I trusted him a lot. We got even closer playing video games a lot and talking about personal things. He told me he loved me but we never officially started dating, it just continued with the secret casual fun up until March. I would consider our relationship at that point FWB but I always wished it was more since it felt like more. We both cared about each other a lot. 

Once schools closed down (because of corona) and got moved online, I found that I always had to be the one who initiated the conversations and when I did, I would get left on read most of the time. I communicated to him that I wanted him to talk more to me and not leave me on read but that never happened. So I just stopped trying and played video games a lot to distract myself although it always bugged me waiting for a text from him. I missed when schools were in person because that’s when he actually treated me like a normal friend. 

After my final year of high school was over, he did finally message over the summer, it was usually because he wanted to come over to my house and have some “fun” with me. Eventually he started flirting with me a lot again and we made plans for him to come over. However, he only came over once before our friendship changed. 

He had asked out a girl on a date not even a week after he came over and eventually they started dating. He didn’t tell me they were dating because I found out through a friend. I expected him to, but I guess not. 

I got really jealous and hurt because I had asked him if he wanted to hang out with me during the summer but no effort was made. I guess it was always just for fun. Seeing the way he treated me compared to how he treated her that made me really sad. He treated this girl with all the things I had asked for in the past. Seeing that hurt me a lot. 

Anyways, I haven’t talked to him and I don’t plan to. I’ve been trying to get over it but I don’t want to be hurt if I message him about it. What would I even message him? I barely even understand his feelings and what happened. I know that we weren’t officially dating or anything but I thought we had a really close connection/friendship. It sucks how I can’t tell anyone about this too. I’m just confused how fast he moved on and basically left me like nothing. I never got any closure. 

I’ve been contemplating on what I should do because uni is starting soon (and I want to focus on that instead of him). I’m trying to get over it, but it’s always annoying me when I think about it. So, any advice will be helpful, thanks!",26Aug2020,1

She's friends of family and lives in a certain country that contains many threats to her quality of living as well as her families. Truth be told, I liked this girl a lot when I was much younger and within the past few years we reconnected through facebook as it became available in her country. The reality is I never forgot about her as I care for people who affect my life significantly, regardless of how much time has passed. I know that I have always been attracted to her and that some of my feelings come from memories when I was a teen visiting frequently her country which is my parents home coutry as well.

What I'm asking is this, am I doing this for the right reasons and should I persue this even though I myself am struggling to keep myself afloat?

I apologized countless times and even got to the point of tearing up because I was so upset with myself and my actions.

6 years ago this weekend it will mark the day my friend drowned at sea , it was in a freak accident and the body was never recovered so we never really had closure and we couldn’t have a burial so there is no grave for him. 
We often go to the beach which the incident happened however as this is a public beach we cannot place a headstone or memorial area. As the years have gone by, less and less people have joined us on our yearly journey to the beach as a group to remember my friend and last year it was worse than ever before, instead of being a day where we remember happy memories and come together as a group it was a day of sorrow and no shows which I know really affected both his parents mental health this past year more than ever.
We did actually start a charity and we collectively raised over £200k for a skatepark in his name and donated the rest to the RNLI however this was completed a few years ago and not a lot has been done since. 
I want to do something just to let his parents know that we all still care and think deeply even if people have moved away/got busier with adult life.

I’m not sure of what to do and I have never been the creative type so I’m just hoping for some idea’s or guidance or if anyone has been in a similar position as his parents, what helped you?

I am still able to contact the majority of the group but know asking them all to travel from one side of the country to the other for a single day just may not be feasible especially with Covid and it being the bank holiday.

1064,"Sorry for the long post. In UK if this is relevant. Any advice will gratefully be received.

I’ve been very fortunate to keep a job in recent times. Unfortunately work has been terrible and my mental health is abysmal. We lost some senior people who were never replaced (pre-pandemic) and have lost a lot of expertise. Tons of urgent COVID related stuff coming in, having to cover other teams under furlough, and the area we manage is effectively being doubled in size meaning double the amount of calls. We also had a new manager join, brand new to the business, no knowledge of our work. 

We’ve been encouraged to pull together, take on extra stuff in the short term, learn new things and help each other out. Meanwhile new manager has been learning what we do.

Me being the never say no, helpful idiot that I am, have taken on tons of additional stuff, while a backlog of lower priority stuff has built up - Manager was aware of this. I was under the impression that we were all under the same amount of pressure (all working from home so less communication with the team). Turns out no, people have been taking advantage of the situation, grabbing easy tasks from themselves and volunteering others for harder problems. Manager is now slowly resolving the issue.

Aside from one other person (and Manager) I have been in the team the shortest amount of time. My role is the lowest paid, because it is meant to be straight-forward data entry work. I’ve learned new stuff quickly, I contribute a lot in team meetings while others stay silent, am most knowledgeable about the wider business and am proactive in solving issues before they happen.

Manager has shared their vision going forward - I take on even more responsibilities, things that are completely out of my skillset (project management, which I have no experience of). In the meantime, my usual straightforward boring data entry work will be handed over to the rest of the team. I will be expected to train them. My backlog of work will presumably take care of itself while I do all this. There has been no mention about increasing my pay, which at this point I would actually reject because I want no more responsibility and no more stress. All this is bonkers to me. I want other people in the team to take on the work, people who are paid more, more experienced and are meant to be more qualified (if not in reality then at least on paper). Whether they are actually capable of the work is another matter. I feel like I’m being punished for doing a good job while others are being rewarded for doing less (I am still young if you couldn't tell).

I have politely tried to reject this vision several times, but Manager keeps bringing it up as a given it will happen. What I want advice on – how do I communicate this to Manager in no uncertain terms I won’t take on more work? How blunt can I be? Is there even any point – should I cut my losses and try move on elsewhere? Leaving would definitely be beneficial for my mental health and I have savings considering jobs aren't exactly bountiful just now, but it would be putting my team in an even worse situation (some of them are nice).",26Aug2020,1
1065,"At the start of this lockdown, I would take my dog out for a walk every day around sunset. It was honestly the best part of my day and it felt so nice to get out of the house. These walks also kind of helped with some mental health stuff, it was a nice break to be alone in the fresh air. Recently though, it’s been too hot for my dog (she refuses to walk) and as a result, I haven’t been able to go out anymore. I’ve been trying to persuade my mom to let me leave the house alone for years now, and she won’t let me go without the dog. She’s scared I’ll be kidnapped or harassed, things along those lines (I’m a 15 yr old female). I understand there is always the possibility that these things could happen, but I think it’s very unlikely given our circumstances. I’ve lived in the same middle class neighborhood filled with Mormon families and old couples my entire life, I know a bunch of friends and people my age in the area that go out everyday for hours at a time and nothing has ever happened. I’m a very observant person and I’m good at picking up on when things seem off, and I usually would see at least three other people on my walk. The route I always take puts me in front of someone’s house for roughy 80% of the time and takes me around 40 minutes, I don’t go very far. My mom still insists it’s too dangerous though.

1066,"I (F25) work in a very small family-run apparel wholesale/e-commerce company where I am pretty much the in-house...well... everything. Marketing Strategist, Social Media, Product Design, Graphic Design, PR, Distribution, Web Maintenence, Sales (informally). I should say that they have treated me very kindly and are very understanding of my needs. 

Before the COVID-19 outbreak, I was feeling underpaid because the person who worked before me did not have to deal with the maintence of a running e-commerce site, social media, public relations, nor management of a digital marketing team with the same exact salary. (I only knew this after I asked my predecessor what their salary was).

I was going to bring up to them that I needed a raise until...COVID HAPPENED! All of the 4 people I work with are family/lifetime friends and all but one are over the age of 70/immunocompromised. So I posed a huge risk being in the office because I am more likely to be a vector and infect them. 

Since COVID-19 outbreak, I have been working remotely doing everything except for handling distribution (taking orders, processing, and handling merchandise which I cannot do because I am not in the office.) They have managed on their own since its not a huge company with a huge scale. And I was asked to go on unemployment but still work for them in the meantime. Unemployment covered my salary and I essentially worked for them for free for the last 5 months...

The owners sold a couple of their properties and rented out a huge warehouse office space. They're really excited about the space and the idea of me working there. When I went in to help a little around the new place while masked, I saw service people not wearing masks properly around my boss who wasn't wearing a mask at all! 

Today, they told me that they think I really need to start working in the office especially as the fall months roll around and we get more orders coming in. My concern is that I have already felt I was underpaid and I believe it is better for my productivity and their safety that I work remotely, especially if they are not actually paying money themselves for my labor. 

 This is my first experience negotiating for terms at a place of employment and I need help framing these terms to ensure my success. 

**My terms are as follows:** I want a **$2000-$4000 yearly salary increase** if I am to work in the office. The justification is that when I work in the new office my responsibilities will increase and I need to be compensated for the extra value I have brought to the company even before COVID-19. I will also require everyone to maintain social distancing and I will definitely not be around the most immunocompromised worker. Furthermore, I saved them **over $15,000** by being paid by unemployment while I was risking myself legally to provide them free labor and value for 5 months. 

**If they refuse,** I would like to remain at the salary position that I'm currently at but I will work remotely and come in only when they direly need me to under the condition that the most immunocompromised worker is not there. 

**This is what I need help with:** How do I phrase the aforementioned terms to not make it seem like I'm threatening them with having me work remotely? These are really nice people who probably just want facetime with me because they think it's better for their company. I need help adjusting my tone so they'll want to give me a recommendation in the end and so that we can avoid any litigation if they decide to just fire me leaving me with no unemployment when I worked for them for free for 5 months. I really don't want to throw that they broke the law in their face but I am extremely uncomfortable with going into work at the office unless I feel I am being compensated justly. 

Also, I know with a raise from an ultimatum, they may resent the work I do or hold it against me to do better so I am planning on looking for a new job under the radar starting today--so I am okay with those consequences since it's my first job and I want to move on to a company that reflects who I am more. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; I need to figure out how to express to my boss that I either will continue to work remotely at my current salary rate supplemented by unemployment (i know...) or if I am to come into work, I need my salary increased and my terms for staying safe in COVID respected. I am going to look for a completely new job under the radar regardless of what they choose.",26Aug2020,1
1067,"Bit misleading title, i dont necessarily want revenge I just want to feel like the person that sexually assaulted/raped me gets punished.

He was my first kiss at 16 and a good friend. A night before it happened we kissed again (i was now 17) he asked me if i wanted to do more i said no. The next night was my borthday party, i drank too much, got blackout drunk, only thing i remember is him having my panties and telling me to put them back on. I dont even know if i was awake, i woke up drunk the next morning and immediately went home.

I stayed friends with him for years, because i believed he was drunk too, later he admitted to getting girls drunk so the chance of doing something with them was higher. Half a year after that i found out he was planning to touch someone that night.

In my family i only told my mum, she said he had been going through a lot. He's still friends with my siblings and comes over to the house sometimes.

I just feel so powerless and im afraid to tell people that he knows as well. I'm sick of it ruining some of my nights, when i cant stop thinking about it and panicking and crying.

How do i get that to stop? How do i live with the fact that he's gotten away with it and will never be punished in any way?",26Aug2020,1

1070,"Hello!  
I'm a brazilian student and I'm seriously considering studying in Italy. The course I want is Law, and, if we sort it out, a friend is coming with me and we'll share a place. She wants Medicine, by the way. So, I'd really appreaciate if anyone has any insights about studying in Italy, or even any other country in Europe that doesn't have abusive student fees or something -- public colleges recommendations would be perfect.

I researched about Università di Bologna, and it's my first option and I'm also considering Università di Trento, but as far as I know, Trento doesn't have a medicine course.  Besides that, I'd like to know any opinions you might have about how difficult it is to get into these unis, being a international student.

She hadn’t texted me in a few days and she usually wants me to text her just to check in. Today I did and she replied with that.

I’m in my room all day no job no school no car no friends in a relationship but feel single and he pays more attention to insta than he does to me so I don’t really reach out to him but how do I get her to just leave it alone because she’s always wondering and if I tell her I met someone she’s like 😒,26Aug2020,1

1075,"well. i (17m) moved away to uni a few weeks ago, and ever since moving i’ve been thinking i may have made a mistake. i’m a year early and i thought that this was what i wanted. my roommates are great and i enjoy living in a city, but i still dont feel happy. i’m on the west coast. i miss my family on the east coast. they have told me many times before i left that i could come home at any time, but i’d feel so weak and stupid to come home now. (oops additional information, i live on campus but all my classes are online so moving would not impact my education)

i don’t know what i want anymore and i’m so confused about everything. i think of the future and it’s completely blank. i ask myself what i’m even living for and can’t find an answer. i just wanna go home... and yet i still enjoy being here. my brain keeps pulling itself in opposite directions and it’s just really hard. earlier today i found myself googling flights back home and it felt like a mistake, but i still want it. i tried to call my mom to tell her, but couldn’t bring myself to do it. i don’t even know if this is the right decision. 

how can i tell my family i want to move back home?",26Aug2020,1
1076,"This is gonna sound terrible, but I've been with him for 2 years (since we were 19). He has basically been my life since then. He is an amazing guy- has never insulted me, travels every week to meet me, calls me every night, always surprises me with thoughtful gifts, we're best friends! Im so comfortable with him and he is crazy about me. We've happily talked about getting a place, traveling and getting married in our late 20s. Our families joke about us getting married some day even, we are that cute together. I never really doubted this, I have loved him since the first month or 2 of dating. 

Now the issue- he has serious anxiety, probably OCD (an online therapist I made him talk to said it was and he matches anything I've read/watched on it). This was a serious problem for us June-August last year but I made it clear I was sick of playing therapist  after 6 weeks of constant confessing to gross/weird sex things he has done/thought or finding Rebecca hot and feeling bad over it etc. He couldn't rest until he confessed. This stopped for the next 8ish months and now it's back and super annoying. He won't go to a doctor in real life and he needs to. He is still confessing, sometimes even 4 times a day and most of it is innocuous but very annoying. Some of it has really hurt my feelings. He doesn't mean to, but it does. I've cried over stuff he told me. I don't wanna leave my best friend but in the last week or 2 (maybe partly cos I just turned 21?) I've been wondering if this is it. I was delighted at the prospect of him being my future, but now I can't imagine dating him for more than a few more months unless, he magically recovers and I can forget the crap he said.

1078,"My friend has been very quiet and unmotivated for a few years now, I just heard today from somebody that the reason he dropped out and never went back to school was because a teacher said to him that he will never account to anything, whilst his sister got praises from the same teacher of a successful life ahead. Typical asian stuff anyways... I really want to help him find his motivation from within and do something. He has no academic qualifications though and I don't know how to advise him on a path since Im using university to secure my life. Ive been very focussed on myself during these years and it breaks my heart that as I waited, he has made little progress in adulthood. We are both 21 He has been out of school since 17. We are in the UK and I dont think he is elegible for free education anymore plus on the outside he seems quite sure that he doesnt want to return to education but I know how important it is. He was never an academic type but he is extremely creative and can draw amazing things, He wont even draw anymore despite how amazing I say his drawings are, and Im being geniune.

It angers me so much that his teacher said this to him and it could be the reason he dropped out. I want to support him in anyway I can that isnt at the detriment of myself. Advice?",26Aug2020,1
1080,"Sorry This is a bit long

When I was younger (19) I am now 22, I was hanging out with my friend and he asked to kiss me and I said no but he kissed me anyway and because I felt powerless I kissed him back. When we stopped I tried to refuse but he guilted me by saying that I had already done it once so I could do it again. I remember feeling that it was not what I wanted but did it anyway because I was afraid of losing his friendship and I was really feeling powerless. I later went to school and started learning about consent and I realized that what had happened wasn't right. I tried to talk to him about what happened and he didn't seem to understand why I felt violated after everything happened. I don't entirely blame the guy because I should have had a firm no and my body language shouldn't have said otherwise. I am not victim-blaming myself just accepting that I gave mixed signals. I also felt that he should have made sure that I was okay with him kissing me. So fast forward this year, I wrote about my experience in a blog while talking about how consent can have blurred lines when you don't know much about your rights as a woman and when men think that kissing girls just like the movies (even when they say no) is cute. I had my friends read it to make sure it wasn't biased and I didn't use his name. He came across it now he feels I demonized him in my story and has been harassing me to remove it. I feel entitled to tell my story as I felt it and I told him to I am sorry he felt demonized by my story and should examine himself to understand why he feels attacked by a story that just comments on how consent can be blurred and that it wasn't my responsibility to make him feel better about what happened. Here's the article I wrote:  [http://calmwildness.co.ke/blurred-lines-in-consent/](http://calmwildness.co.ke/blurred-lines-in-consent/)  So Reddit do you think I am the asshole or give me perspective why he feels demonized because I have asked my male friends to read it and they didn't feel that way.",26Aug2020,1
1081,"This is nothing to serious, but my parents want to shut everything off on me and my siblings phones so that the only things we're allowed to do is call, receive calls, and use our alarms.

This will happen (roughly between 10PM- 6AM when school starts. I know this doesn't sound bad, but I wake up and go to sleep at different times ( depending on how much I have to do at night) and I read until I fall asleep (on my phone) if I don't im awake just laying there for a few hours and have trouble falling asleep. Plus if I end up waking up early I spend that time reading.

They say that they want to do this so we get a good night's sleep for school, but I'm always on time for school and getting straight A's with the occasional B. My dad said their doing this because my 9 year old brother constantly stays up past midnight and waits until last minute to get ready for school, and although it wasn't said, my older sister doesn't get the best grades.

1083,"Hello, I’m posting this looking for advice. So first a little backstory, I (14M) have aspergers and this mainly manifests in a lot of sensory issues and some mild social anxiety. However, what this means is that I need to leave class 5 minutes early to avoid the big rush when everyone leaves class. I do this alongside one other girl in my class, however recently I’ve started noticing strange behaviour. 

Due to this week being the first week back at School for me most classes have involved choosing seats, but the girl keeps on sitting right beside me and moving seats to sit beside me even when I deliberately try and pick a seat after her. I’ve begun to notice her following me around school even during break and whatnot whenever we don’t really need to be together. It’s made me awkward around my friends knowing that she’s standing right beside me.

However today has been the last straw today while I was walking home with my friends I looked behind me and saw her quickly dart behind a tree. I became anxious throughout the rest of the trip because I knew she was following me. I know this wasn’t her just walking home because I know roughly where she lives and it’s the complete opposite direction of where I live. 

I’m slowly becoming more and more worried and was looking for advice. I was wondering if there was a way to say I’m not interested in her due to me already having a girlfriend.",26Aug2020,1

I am having a bit of a crisis here, much like my fellow young folk. I know Reddit isn’t the best place to ask these questions, but I have no friends and my wife can’t help me with this. You guys may not be able to either, but it’d be nice to get some unbiased input. 

I am 25 (male, if that matters), I have a useless associate degree in “business communication” or something to that effect, and I do not know where to begin to lead myself to a better career. I currently work for the post office, which is a decent job but I’m not too certain of the future of the company. i’ve tried numerous times to get on with UPS, but no such luck. I have been contemplating going back to school, but it’s going to take YEARS, like well into my thirties to get my bachelors in computer information systems. I kind of want to do something sooner but idk where to begin or what to do. I am interested in technology, but according to the internet, it’s hard to find an IT job with an associate degree and no experience. I wouldn’t mind pursuing the bachelors degree but 1) I am going to have to backtrack a bit [I forgot some college algebra, itms been a while since i’ve been in school :( ], 2) it’s expensive, 3) I have to take a lot of courses that have nothing to do with my degree focus. I wouldnmt mind looking into other careers or degrees, I just want to do something that I like and that will pay me enough that, combine with my wife’s salary, we can live a decent, middle class life. I am looking to be in the 45-50k a year range. Do you guys have any suggestions? If no suggestions on what to look into, any suggestions of how to decide what to do? 

I am working full time so going to school full time is impossible. I can manage two classes at a time, which adds to the overall length of my education.
