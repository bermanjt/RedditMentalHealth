1,"(Basically AITA) for cheating in my exam? (Character count in AITA is 3000 pls lmk if there’s a better sub for this post :) )

I’m 16m and I recently sat some exams. I revised a decent bit, more than a lot of people and less than a few people. I’m in my last year of secondary school however I’ve only been in this school for one year because I had to switch schools last year. This means a change of syllabus and so I have lots of gaps in my knowledge and I have to teach myself things as there is little to no support from the teachers so I am heavily disadvantaged compared to the other people.

I’d done most of my exams and it was the third to last exam (out of ten) and it was maths. A couple people who are my ‘friends’ were talking about writing formula down on their hands/wrists/whatever. I already knew all of these formula but because I’m an idiot I thought, what if I forget them in the exam? Better safe than sorry and I right down two of them on my hand. One of them could come up and the other one I knew wouldn’t come up but I wrote it anyway, again because I’m an idiot. I go into this maths exam and I get about halfway through the paper. I decide not to use the formulae a) because I already know it b) because it’s cheating and despite writing it on my hand I don’t really want to cheat c) none of the questions actually needed the formulae. Then one of the teachers that I don’t know comes up to my desk and asks me to turn my hands over and I oblige and he obviously sees it and tells my head of year. He’s pretty nice about it he’s like ‘nice try’ and then says just carry on. I finish my paper feeling pretty confident I did well and didn’t even cheat for it.

I leave the hall and then I wash the formulae off of my hands. I tell people including my friends and they all just say it’s unlucky etc etc. later that day, there’s another maths exam and the head of exams tells me I need to go see her in her office afterwards. I go to her office after not ‘cheating’ in that one and she’s like: 

(T=teacher M=me

T: How silly are you?

M: very silly

T: why did you have writing on your hand

M: revision, the formulae weren’t in the exam but I know I’m sorry

T: okay well these exams don’t matter we don’t care about the grades it’s what you do with them that matters. For the record you’re not allowed to write anything at all on your hands in the exam so don’t do it in your real exams.

M; yeah of course not Miss I’m so sorry

T: okay thank you for talking with me have a good afternoon

I leave her office and I walk home very much in fear. I walk through the front door and my mum looks furious and my dad is sitting on the stairs staring at the floor. They essentially start screaming and shouting at me calling me a liar and a cheat, they say my moral compass is completely skewed and essentially that I’m a terrible person and neither them or the school can ever trust me with anything again. They say I’ve ruined my life etc etc. my dad gets slightly physical and they just accuse abs accuse and slag me off.

Finally when they’re done I go upstairs and just carry on revising for the final exam. They’re still furious, they told me that ‘no one cheats, and the tiny amount of the people that do are low scumbags and they’re failures in life. Then, today (day after) I go out to the opticians supervised by my mum (she no longer trusts me I guess I’m doing bad shit now or something) and I’m wearing a new face mask for COVID. She asks me where I got it from and I say school, she asks if I paid for it and I say no C (name of friend) got it for me. She starts yelling in my face in the middle of the street calling me a liar and not to treat her like an idiot and that I’m a horrible child etc. I tell her that is the truth and what does she mean? She yells more and doesn’t let me speak she says she doesn’t want to know and that I shouldn’t lie to her. 

After blanking me she asks if I want to tell her the truth, I tell her it was the truth and she yells at me again and then I say just listen to me. The school canteen sells face masks and I forgot mine but since C gets free school meals he gets a free face mask so he gave one to me. My mum starts shouting at me again saying that I wouldn’t have caused a scene if I’d explained it in the first place?

How is that fair? Is it? How bad is it really to cheat on a test? I swear most people do it? I haven’t really before but I know loadssss of people who would write something down or copy someone’s paper etc. Is my moral compass fucked? Also my parents want to ‘talk to me’ about it further and they want to sanction me most likely by taking my phone, going out privelages, maybe my money and my Xbox which I think is just stupid. I’ve learnt my lesson and it’s only a stupid test.",18Nov2020,1

4,"*content warnings sexual assaults, child sexual assaults, rape?, suicide attempts, depression

I (F28) was sexually abused as a pre teen /teenager by an adult. It went on for multiple years and I repressed it for a long time, when it finally flooded back I called the police but they couldn't do anything.

At 14 I dated a 16 year old guy who pinned me to a  couch and ripped my clothes telling me ""I don't care if you're not ready, you're my girlfriend and this is what couples do"" thankfully I ran out of there to a freinds house nearby and she leant me some clothes.

At 15 I dated another guy who i had been doing sexual acts with but I told him I didn't want to have full on sex. One night he told me he wanted to tie me up and tease me. I liked the idea until he had me tied and told me ""this is my chance to f**k you whether you like it or not"". He pulled off my underwear and grabbed a condom from a drawer. I started screaming and his dad ran up the stairs. He stalked me for a few years after that and had a female friend try to intimidate me and engage me in a fight. Thankfully I had many friends to protect me.


I lost my virginity at 16 (with consent at first) to a 23 year old guy who liked to do things rough, but didn't warn me before hand, even though he knew it was my first time, I asked him to slow down and stop but he wouldn't. I ended up bleeding for a week afterwards. (He also turned out to be a murderer and was cheating on me with my 13 year old cousin)

I was sexually assaulted in university by my freinds flatmate who dragged me into his room and assaulted me with his hands, he tried to pin me to the bed but thankfully I wriggled free, ran out the door and got myself home. I called the police but he was released the same night without charges.

And more recently (last year) I worked as an escort due to my physical disabilities making it impossible to find employment and two of my clients refused to stop or slow down when I was in severe pain, one of them left me bleeding for a few days. Thankfully my now husband took on my bills so I didn't need to endanger myself anymore.

This has all affected me psychologically for a long time, I became hypersexual from a young age, I've had hundreds of sexual partners (not even including my escort work), I had slept with over 100 men and 50 women by the time I was 20 and attempted suicide twice due to my severe lack of self worth, depression and anxiety. I had some counseling as a teen but never mentioned any of the assaults, because due to being a minor the counselor told my parents everything I disclosed. 

I start therapy for this on Saturday and I'm terrified, I've never trusted mental health professionals due to watching a family member get sectioned for 18 months against their will, (after going in volunterily) due to lies told by other family members. And after my suicide attempt my mum tried to have me sectioned, so I lied and said my attempt was unplanned. And finally the last time I tried to get help I lost custody of my youngest son for a year and was only allowed supervised visitation. So yeah I'm scared out of my wits!

 Please give me some advice to get through this, every time I try to talk about my issues to a professional it brings everything to the forefront of my mind and I become increasingly depressed and suicidal and I'm so scared. Xx

P.s please be kind and don't share this anywhere",18Nov2020,3
5,"Me and my brother live together. We're both bipolar. He, whenever something frustrating happens, vents about it, swearing and screaming and hyping himself up to get it out of his system.

This stresses me out. I hate tense situations and really feel like he should get his anger out in a more constructive way. However I feel like telling him to express his anger more healthily just stresses him out more.

What should I do?

7,"I’m 0 or 100 and it’s the worst feeling when you’re placed closer to 0 then 100 by someone you want to be 100 to. You come last to the games, the friends, the family. I’ve been talking to someone for what feels like forever and I have this thought that if I could just meet this person things would change; he could see the emotions in my face and eyes. Maybe he wouldn’t be so selfish but I think we all know how it ends. 

Regardless, I don’t want to be myself or true to my nature. It gets me hurt more than I care to admit. I don’t ever let myself get attached to people, especially men, because they just leave anyways. But, I did this time and now I regret it. How do you get over unhealthy attachments? I’ve added a side business/ hobby to my life and have been going out with my friends more and hiking which I’ve missed lately. I just feel like I’m pouring energy into people or things that don’t give me the same back. Granted everyone shows things in different ways and it can take some time but it’s been plenty of time. Now I stress over the situation and feel like I’m not a priority and I’m being taken advantage of. I don’t know how to shake this",18Nov2020,2
8,"So I have an irrational fear of always thinking I have sent a wrong text/photo or anything related to texting to someone somehow. Like maybe I’m scrolling through YouTube and I’ll think shit I sent this video to them or maybe I’m talking to a friend and they’ll send me a text and I’ll think shit maybe I sent a screenshot of this on another group and I’ll end up checking my texts for a long time, just to make sure I haven’t sent anything to anyone by mistake. I know this is classified as checking OCD and it has one root cause: sent a wrong text on a family group once 2 years ago. 

My point is, I need advice to understand why this is irrational, from all you normal human beings out there and to understand why are YOU not scared of the same all the time like me. How does One think about this rationally. Please help me understand why my fear is stupid, and why you don’t have it basically. 

Tldr: have an irrational fear, need help understanding from your pov on why it is irrational so I can work on it. Thanks :)",18Nov2020,1
9,"Im 17, this guy is 29 and we'll call him J for this story. Also, age of concent in my country is 15 so yes it's weird but technically legal. He stopped being my teacher this july. We had been talking over instagram and fb and getting along, i was the favorite student you see.

In the beginning of November i did it, i confessed to him about finding him very attractive. Well, i didnt straight up say it I just found an opportunity to drop some hints and he was getting the memo. Surprisingly he said he felt the same. Idk this all felt so exciting in the begging but now im a bit like????

He supported me sm with school and was so nice to me. He was this mysterious figure that gave me attention and was there for me. Plus he wasnt that old and is good looking.

In this period im also in a relationship and havent told my bf about this which makes me feel super bad. I couldn't not tell J though cause i wanted closure and him feeling the same and going after me just fucked me up. He also knows im taken and ignored it. Ik im horrible for doing this to my bf but the situation with j was too much for me. It felt like my innocent teacher crush turned into something a lot more real and i wasnt ready for it.

I just wanted closure and now idk how to act.",18Nov2020,0
11,"So my ex and I dated a few years however due to him being unfaithful we broke up. I met his friend while we were dating and to put it very lightly the moment I saw him I strongly liked him. I felt very strange about that because I had already accepted that I would never feel that way about anyone and just strongly latched onto anyone I tolerated very well. I don’t mean to sound like a mental case but I just accepted I wouldn’t feel THAT feeling ever. I did have therapy regarding that and multiple things for anyone who expresses concern there.

Anyway- so my ex and I aren’t together but I still feel weird about even liking him. There’s a big taboo there and I feel incredibly guilty because I knew I liked him the moment I saw him but chose to remain loyal to my (ex)boyfriend at that time. 

There are some other factors here such as; I am a handful years older, was told by my (ex) bf who at that time wasn’t dating me that he was a virgin and probably didn’t even like girls and that I probably wasn’t his type (I expressed interest in him early on and confided in him)

My question is what do I do? I asked a friend and he said just ask him out but I honestly don’t even know how to digest these feelings let alone express them properly. I just genuinely accepted the fact I’d have to rely on good sex to maintain my relationships previously but.. I don’t even think about that with this guy. I just.. ugh

I’m so sorry if this is worded badly.. I don’t know how to talk about this.

I have a major crush on an ex’s friend but don’t know if or how to go about navigating that. I also feel really shitty because the whole homie hopper taboo",18Nov2020,1
12,"Soo with out getting in to too much detail ive been sending a guy who's married nudes for over a year , the reason I'm doing this is because I want to suck his cock and he's well aware of this , I don't see him much in person but the few time I tried to talk to him about it he gets like I wanna say nervous and changed the subject or just walks away😂 but over text he swears he wants me to suck his dick ""soon"" as he always says I've also told him multiple times that ill leave him alone he just has to say the word and well never speak of it again but he always says nope I kind of wish he'd just tell me to fuck off because I'm not just gonna leave him alone I dont have that much will power... I want to know whats in his pants ...sometimes he ignores my messages for a day or 2 and then when im like wtf he plays the game messages me for a day or 2 and we do it all over again I got him alone once and showed him my boobs and he said he'd see me later then ignored me for 2 days so any guy on here does he not know how to tell me to leave him alone (I'm in no way Physco I wouldn't ruin his life id go in peace he knows this)  is his cock small is he nervous ???

13,"I want to note that if I'm ever in an argument with someone, it makes sense to me to sit down and figure where we went wrong and apologize accordingly. 

But this is a completely different case when it comes to my dad. My dad can never admit that he's wrong about anything, and it is especially worse with me because not only is he my dad (an authoritative figure) but he's much older than me (quote his words).

My mom has come to me incredibly distressed multiple times because my dad is unable to control his emotions and takes his anger out on her even if she wasn't the cause of the problem. 

It's rare that I ever fight with him, but when we do, it's complete hellfire. 

We have an enormous age gap because my parents had me late and they're immigrant Asian parents. So you can see where this is kind of going. 

We began arguing about politics, which is probably never good in any circumstance. I'm completely free to listen to why a person believes in something, and we can have a civil conversation about it. 

With my dad, he's quick to anger and starts blowing insults. The first thing is always: ""I have more life experience than you, and you don't know anything. Research doesn't mean anything when you have life experience."" Then came the rapid-fire of: ""You're a dumbass. What do you know. You're crazy."" 

I want to also note that I was advocating something that strongly affected me as a child. I've experienced sexual abuse by a family member, and to my recent knowledge was completely dismissed by my father. The anger and frustration bloomed out of his idea that ""Just because a person sexually abused other people doesn't mean they're a bad person."" When I promptly asked him if someone had touched me if he could support that person. His answer was ""That has nothing to do with anything."" 

The idea that you should silence yourself because it's a sign of respect to your parents even if they aren't correct is something I stopped abiding by. If I felt something was wrong, I would try my best to explain why I didn't agree. This is completely fine with my mom. If we disagree, we hear each other's thoughts and explain why we think the way we do. But of course, this isn't possible with my dad because he says any of my thoughts are invalid. 

The right way to approach this is to definitely communicate in a calm setting on where we went wrong. It makes complete sense to talk it out and figure out how we can understand each other's feelings. But I truly snapped this time. I'm not proud, but I couldn't sit still. 

When he finally told me to ""Shut up"" and ""fuck you,"" I retaliated back and said that he should shut up. Now I don't believe that fighting fire with fire ever works, but I want to believe I was allowed to be mad at that moment even if it wasn't the right action. 

I hope that this doesn't sound like I'm whining because I know that several people experience much worse verbal abuse from their parents. 

He was so dumbfounded that he stopped the car and freaked out all over the place. His reaction was of course ""How dare you speak to me like that? You're so ungrateful."" 

My dad has always been the type to say things he doesn't mean in the heat of a moment, but he'd never admit that it was wrong of him to do so. 

Given what my mom has experienced several times, I want him to learn what it's like to be responsible for your words. 

He is incredibly stubborn and holds his dignity by a strong fistful. Not only did he say that I didn't know anything, but that my entire education meant nothing. He said that I'd never understand the world like him and that I needed to ""grow up."" I am in fact an adult by the way.  

Even if I wanted to settle down to talk about what happened, he'd take it to the grave with him. 

I ask my mom here and there how he's taking the whole thing and she tells me that he's still fuming mad about it all. He says that he'll no longer see me as his daughter and that he regrets doing anything for me. He says he'll never forget the way I talked to him. 

I want him to come to the realization that he's said those very words to me. I want him to understand how badly hearing those words hurt me. 

I know for a fact that he won't let this go until I apologize to him. I do feel bad that I yelled back at him that day, but as this situation ages, I feel more and more heartbroken. 

I wish he understood the weight of his words. 

When my mom told me today that he regretted ever doing anything for me, it pained me so hard. I sympathize with my parents and their difficult journey of making a living in a country that doesn't speak their first language. I know that they're strong and have suffered immensely to give me the best life. I keep this thought dear to my heart but even if I tell them that, in their eyes, I am spoiled and take things for granted. I don't blame them because I've received more than I could ever hope for, but the thought that they think I don't have a single care for them truly breaks my heart. 

When I heard ""I regret doing anything for her"" it felt like a simple ""I hate you."" And logically I know that he said that because he was mad and not thinking about what it meant but it affected me so much. 

I want to be petty and bring those words up to him. I want to tell him that I will take those words with me to my grave and will forever heed by those words. I want to tell him so bad that I ""acknowledge"" that he doesn't care about me. 

I think that it's right for me to apologize for the way I acted, but I want him to understand why he hurt me. 

I don't ever want someone to try to look down on me like that ever again. If a child is supposed to respect their parents, why is it okay for them to eat away at their children? 

At this point, I wonder if it's a better idea to write a long letter explaining how I feel, but since I'm not fluent in their native language, I don't know how I'd go about doing that.",18Nov2020,1

15,"I'm in a program where only 20% of applicants are picked every year. At the beginning of the year, the boss briefed us that it's a program where it'd be best to help each other rather than competing. I thought all my classmates were on the same page, but recently I've been noticing signs of competition. Like no active help to those who had to take a personal day off, or simply not sharing new info from the teachers.

I get it. One should seek help, but I find it important to be compassionate, considering the field we're in... Besides, how do you ask about something if you didn't know about it to begin with? They were talking about how they refuse to send notes if the person didn't ask them for it. That mentality just doesn't sound right.

I know they withhold information, especially when it'll make them look better. I'm just at loss here. I'm not the brightest of the bunch, nor am I the fastest learner.

Professionally is normal, casually is normal, but as soon as someone the same race as him tries to make a sexual or romantic advance, it is a clear separation from how I treat other men. I notice that I shut down being ""hit on"" quicker and firmer with his particular race, situations like that.

24,"I didn't grow up in a perfect environment, and that made me have quite a bit of flaws. From a skewed moral compass, to a tendency to partake in illegal activities, I think I exhibit traits of a sociopath. 

Another thing I've come to realise about myself is that because of the emotional trauma I went through growing up, distraction and dissociation became a common recurrence. At first it was masturbation, which in turn led to emotional neglect. Then it evolved to dissociation to help cope with the overbearing feelings. 

The next thing was compulsive lying. My parents were extremely strict and overprotective, and my mother was perhaps a narcissist. Because of that, I found life easier to live if I lied to avoid any potential fights or arguments. And from there, I became good at lying. Got called out by my parents as a pathological liar once or twice before. 

But right now, I'm so lost. I don't know if who I am is even who I truly am. I am good at lying, even to myself. Because of how often I find myself distracting or dissociating, I'm not in tune with my genuine emotions. I can lie and convince myself of my belief so that I can breathe a little easier knowing that I'm not that bad of a person. 

And the scarier part. 

I don't know if I'm truly in love. 

What if I actually am a sociopath? I have exhibited many traits of selfishness, a tendency to path towards illegal acts, self-serving behaviour, etc. 

What if I actually managed to convince myself that I love my partner, and all my current behaviours, things I do and say are just a facade to cover up the fact that I might be a sociopath so that I can tell the world I'm in love? That this persona of ""caring and loving"" for my partner is all an act, and I'm living a lie because I've become so good at convincing myself of false truths?

What if this whole time of spending my life trying to be a better man than my father ever was, I strayed down a darker path and ended up becoming someone that young-me would have been disgusted at?

What if instead of loving my partner, I end up hurting her in a way far worse than my dad ever did to my mom?

But that was the good side of my life. My parents split up when I was 4 so i mainly lived with my mom, having these aforementioned issues there. Then was time at my dad's place.

26,"Last night I received an email from UPS notifying me of an import charge of $103.43 CAD due on an incoming shipment. I was confused because I haven’t ordered anything. Upon further investigation, I find the sender. It’s a persons name, and the address is a home address from the US. Still confused. racking my brain, it suddenly dawns on me that I know who the person is! We’re friends on Instagram (before I deleted it over half a year ago) and we originally connected on Reddit years ago over a common interest. It’s been a while since we’ve spoken and I don’t have any other contact info of hers. I only know her first name so it didn’t occur to me that it was her at first. 

She had been saying she wanted to mail me some artwork of hers, a painting for my new place. This must be the shipment I’m suddenly expecting! I’m very grateful for this person’s kind generosity, but I did not expect to pay duty charges, let alone over $100 on this gift.

I want to talk to her but she’s so standoffish and has no expression. People can only get one or two words out of her and it’s usually “yeah” “oh ok” The most she’s said to me is “I’m (name) it’s my first day” while almost hiding behind the reception desk wall.

31,"TL;DR

My ex cheated on me with a friend and I confronted him now my friends hate me for it.

&amp;#x200B;

This story starts back in February on the night I was introduced to my Ex. I had two friends living in college dorm rooms together and I would go there to hangout and party with them. One night my friend's (we will call him Steve)  girlfriend at the time's room mate thought I was cute so she got him to introduce her to me, and we hooked up the night we met. We talked over snapchat for two days or so after then she suddenly wouldn't talk to me which was wired because I thought things were going well. A few days later after I hear from Steve and he's telling me to stop talking to this girl (we will call her Sarah) because she was apparently going to have a three way with him and his girlfriend. This was an obvious lie because Steve is known to be a pathological liar and to have an ego problem. I had no interest in getting involved with his dumb drama so I basically just told myself whatever and moved on. Two weeks later he dumped his girlfriend and started to have a thing with Sarah however they were trying to keep it lowkey because they didn't want the roommate (Steve's now Ex) to find out. I am of the belief that Steve did this just to try to out ego me as a ""whoever he can fuck I can fuck"" kind of thing. He is known to not like it very much when his friends get involved with girls which I will get into that later.

In late March when it became obvious to Sarah that Steve was using her for sex we started talking again. Steve does not like this at all. He tried to prevent us from getting together by telling me things like ""You two are my friends I just want you to be happy"" and at the same time guilt tripping Sarah and telling her that he cant trust her. In order to stop this in April now I gave him a call one day and nicely asked him to stop what he was doing. I told him that I didn't care if they were friends or if they talked and to just stop putting himself in the middle of us if he actually wants us to be happy. He took this well over the phone and me and Sarah start dating. A few weeks into this Steve is furious and is trashing me to everyone we know (everyone we partied with became super close). At the same time my friend Ethan started to have a thing with Sara's best friend (we will call her Shauna) who happened to have dated Steve in the past (not the same Ex from earlier in the story a different person). This relationship ended after Steve cheated on her TWICE (Sarah did not know Shauna when they had a thing). Steve successfully prevented that from happening by using the same manipulative tactics he tried to use on Sarah. As soon as he senses things are sensitive in a relationship of one of his friends he goes to the girl and says things like ""Is everything ok with so and so?? you aren't acting like yourself"" in order to try to get with them. He has done this countless times before to his friends. Over the summer he was going for Shauna until Ethan was entirely out of the picture and he told her that he just wanted to be friends. Everyone thought he was a scumbag for doing this, and he gave a huge sob story about how he hates how everyone thinks he's an asshole and made everyone feel bad. I saw straight through this but many didn't. 

In September when things got icy between me and Sarah he did the same ""you aren't acting like yourself"" manipulation thing he does. I warned Sarah and told her that he's very manipulative and not to let him get in her head if he finds out we are on ice. She got very defensive when I said this rather than reassuring which was a huge red flag to me. The next few times I saw them together they were acting quite flirty around each other and it was not just me that noticed this. Sarah usually pretended I didn't exist when there were people around, like not even eye contact and would flip out when I would address this so the fact that she was totally ignoring me wasn't wired to my dumbass when it should have been. When I asked her about the filrty behavior I was again met with a super defensive response. I dumped her at the end of September for several reasons. It was eventually brought to my attention by Shauna that her and Steve had been hanging out pretty much daily and she had been lying to me about it. It might be a stretch to call it cheating but in my mind it's obvious what Steve's intentions were and she wouldn't have lied if she had none. Sounds like a date to me. They never ended up hooking up but I am fairly certain that it's because I told everyone they were sliding around if they asked why we broke up. Sarah claims this never happened and told a bunch of people that its not true. This sounds like a person trying to cover their ass to me. Sarah is not the kind of person who cares if there's a rumor about her. The story then changed to ""I didn't want him to take me and Steve hanging out the wrong way so I lied"" which is the dumbest shit I've ever heard in my life. That doesn't explain why she went out of her way to lie to multiple people. I am not blaming Steve for the breakup if she was really the one anything Steve was saying wouldn't have mattered to her. It's the principle behind 

I stopped hanging out with everyone for a while. The next time I saw Steve was at a party in October (within covid restrictions) so I took him aside and started sternly talking to him. My intention was never to change his morals but to scare him and let him know not to screw me around again. He raised his voice at me so I raised mine as well. This lead to him screaming in my face so I pinned him to the wall. I let him go and shorty after people who overheard came in the room. He crying as soon as they came in to make me look bad. I know I could have handled this in a better way. Since then I have basically been outcasted by all of my friends. I don't get invited to anything and nobody talks to me anymore. If I ask what's going on they will imply that I am not invited. Even Shauna who I was very close with until this happened. The logic here makes no sense at all to me. Steve literally cheated on Shauna twice, used her best friend for sex to get at me, tried to sabotage our relationship, ruined Shauna's thing with Ethan, absolutely hated the fact I was with Sarah the whole time we were dating, then had a hand in our breakup. Given all of this shit he has done it makes no sense why everyone would hate ME for basically just getting in a yelling match with each other, after he screwed ME over AGAIN. I do not know if Steve has told an outrageous lie about what happened or everyone is just spineless and willing to sacrifice their principles to stay in this stupid clique. I would not be surprised if either were the case. Am I the one in the wrong here? Are they all just fucked? Is there something I'm not picking up on in this situation? I would really just like other peoples take on this story because it is causing me a lot of distress.",18Nov2020,1
32,"Hello everyone.

I'm 22, male and I live in the UK.

I have an anxiety disorder and I have been living with it since 2015. Lockdown has meant that despite graduating from University earlier this year next to nobody is hiring and when they are they would be more interested in someone with better qualifications than me.

In my life there is only 1 friend of mine who I consider to know the ""true me"" or at least a close approximation of the true me. Most other people, including my family, I hide my hobbies, interests and passions from, out of fear of being mocked for them. When I do talk to my friend I feel incredibly embarrassed to talk about what I like, I feel like I'm a burden to him. He's his own person going through his own things and he doesn't need my problems too.

Everyday my mindset seems to change and I seem to be different to who I was yesterday. I try and set goals for myself to try and improve my mental state but the next day a different me wakes up and scraps those goals for new ones.

I've always been overweight and recently have managed to lose 30 pounds but I've recently got stuck and am struggling to keep the weight loss going.

I can't speak to people at all. I end up just mumbling and I can't get the words out, sometimes something cracks and I can speak to strangers and I feel great but the next day it's gone.

My sexuality changes day to day between Heterosexual and Asexual (to be clear, not Aromantic).

Even when I have no reason to, I lie about my motivations or past actions to hide what I was actually doing for no actual reason. I even do it online and I did it while writing this post before realising.

I have literally no sense of self at all and struggle to find anything meaningful that defines me. I have this weird form of Synesthesia (maybe, I dunno if that's the right way to describe it) where I see colours in people but I can't do it for myself.

I want to get better, I want to get back into the world, I want to stop being such a fucking loser but every step just gets reversed when I wake up and decide I just want to be a loser again.

I know how this reads, it's mopey and sad and maybe I do feel a bit sorry for myself but I don't really care. Since it can go hand in hand with these kinds of emotions I just want to say specifically that I have not performed any self harm upon myself, nor have I thought about it.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to find myself. I want to accept who I am, whoever that is, but it's difficult when everyday that person seems to change. I want to meet new people and show them the real me, but I'm trapped in my house and I'm too scared to meet people online.

I feel I have no outlet to be me. I'm tired of being alone. I just want to find myself.

&amp;#x200B;

For anyone else who has struggled with their sense of self, any advice would be really appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I feel like I should say what sparked this post now. I recently had a conversation with my mother (I'm living at home right now till I get a job) where I told her I felt like a black sheep. She asked why and I told her I don't feel like anyone in the family understands me or wants to listen to me. She asked me what I felt I needed to be understood about and I had no answer at all. I don't know what i feel so misunderstood about but it's there and it's real and it hurts.",18Nov2020,3
33,"Alright so the reason why I am making this post is because I(15m) and having trouble with a friend that is a girl so my apologies if the title is somewhat misleading. This girl is strictly a friend, but we do things like cuddle while watching a movie and being personal with eachother but not sexual. There is a slight problem though. I am somewhat interested in her and whenever we are doing something like cuddling I get a stiffy. Now, I am fine with us just being friends (although a little disheartening) but I cannot stop getting a hard one and it makes everything pretty awkward for her and I. I'm wondering if any guy on here knows a way to stop this from happening by either changing my mind or mindset, or if i'm doomed to this eternal damnation. Just please something.

46,"I (23F), like many other people have had to give up a lot during this pandemic. Last year I was hospitalized and have since suffered from anxiety when dealing with my health; this pandemic has only worsened the anxiety (don’t worry, I’m fine a lot of the time). I don’t go out, I lost my job, and I have online classes. 
Here’s the story: 
My uncle (24M), who I consider more like my brother since were so close in age and grew up together, is getting married in March. His fiancée (let’s call her Amy (24f)) is nice, she’s a little different from our family but that’s not a big issue.  They’ve been together since high school so there are no personal issues between us. 

With all this pandemic stuff, they’ve had to rethink their wedding and promised that if things were still bad they’d just elope and go to the courthouse. Well, the day is getting closer, my county is in the most restrictive tier, and they aren’t budging on the wedding yet. They don’t even talk about “what if’s” they say that since the venue is outside and in private property that they can still go through with the wedding. I believe it is selfish to have a wedding in the middle of a pandemic because the way I see it is that they can get married and have a party later, they’ll still be married in the eyes of the law and other entities.

The rest of my family has given up some pretty significant celebrations as well, except that these are once-in-a-lifetime celebrations. I didn’t get to walk the stage to get my degree (first gen graduate), cancelled my grad party, my little sister cancelled her Quinceañera, and my dad cancelled his 50th birthday party. We gave these things up because we knew we couldn’t have these parties and risk people’s health, and our health and safety is more important. The cancellations still hurt. 
During this time I was also doing interviews and applying for post-grad programs but have had to put that on hold due to crippling anxiety.

But “Amy” is still planning her wedding as if everything were normal, she even said most of her family will not be wearing masks because the reception is outside. This just isn’t sitting right with me. Not to mention my grandma, the grooms mom, has asthma and is vulnerable. 
Believe me, I understand the importance of weddings and why people have them, I’m not against the institution of marriage, I just don’t think they NEED to do it during a pandemic. 

So, without getting too much into pandemic politics, am I wrong for thinking having a wedding in a pandemic (judging by the status of the pandemic currently) is selfish? 

Note: my issue isn’t with my uncle since he’s not really involved in planning, it’s more with his fiancée since she’s planning everything.",18Nov2020,2

But if I leave friend A and go to study with Friend B, Friend A will be alone because all her friends already enrolled last year. 

Also, I’ve found a University that I really like, but it doesn’t offer Friend A’s course, meaning if I choose to go there, Friend A will be completely alone.

50,"My partner has a terrible mental illness that I basically diagnosed him with. A free therapist I forced him to see agreed he probably has OCD. He is plagued with immoral disrupting sexual and violent thoughts. Its hard to control and he's terrified this means he is a bad person.  They came out of nowhere 18 months ago. Sometimes he barely has them. Other times I have to console him day after day for weeks. It dragged me down so much because the OCD included doubts about whether he finds me hot/thinks women we know personally are sexier/whether I'm popular enough for him/whether he's with me for the sex. He wouldn't take responsibility and always said ""I'm sorry you're hurt but its my OCD, not me"". Several times I begged him to see a psychiatrist for a real diagnosis to prove to me he has OCD and the violent/sexual thoughts mean nothing and that he isn't dangerous. He was offended I doubted him. We fought about this every few days over the summer.

We went for a night away in a posh hotel 3 months ago for my 21st birthday. He was confessing how hot he found a skinny woman in this cafe and some  dark thought and I started sobbing because he was ruining my 21st BIRTHDAY and I couldn't believe my life was so crappy at 21, wirh a guy that made me cry on my bday (obviously didn't say this). He told me to shut up in case hotel staff heard my crying. I sat crying in the bathroom for a while. He apologsied after a while but in a fit of rage, I threw (and missed) a wet cotton pad at him, calling him a ""f***ing AH"". I regretted it immediately and apologsied, this was not me, I was horrifed. He laughed that it was so silly for me to think I was in the wrong and then cuddled me. He has never thrown anything at me.

64,"trigger warning for mentions of self harm eating disorders and suicide

So my best friend has been friends with this one girl (i'll just call her Emily) for about a year and they're pretty close, maybe not best friends but definitely in her inner circle. Over the past few months my friend has told me a lot of really terrible shit about Emily and it makes me kinda concerned that they're still friends. Basically I think she's batshit crazy and needs psychiatric help. She has sent videos of her self-harming to my friend, made several harmful comments about my friends weight, and is a pathological liar and overall terrible person.

So first of all, Emily sends videos of her cutting herself to my friend. From what I understand this seems to be a regular thing with no warning and my friend has also struggled with self harm in the past. She told me about it a month ago but I'm not sure how long this has been going on. It's really fucking concerning to me. Secondly, she makes very insensitive comments on my friends weight. Emily has an eating disorder and my friend has also had ED tendencies in the past and it's really hurtful to her. From what my friend has told me, usually she says things like ""I'm so fat I can't believe I'm x pounds"" or she will compare their weights. These are the two things that are most concerning to me because I don't want it to influence my friend and impact her mental health. There are also other things that make her a shit person like lying about her mother's health to her teachers to get better grades and claiming to have various mental disorders (I don't doubt that she does have some sort of disorder but she claims to have things she shows no signs of for attention.)

Even with all of that being said though, my friend still hangs out with her and I don't really know what to say about it. I encouraged her to end the friendship when she told me about those things, but she said that if she stopped being friends with her Emily would probably kill herself. Emily's mother knows about her eating disorder and other issues but hasn't gotten help or therapy for her because she hasn't asked for help. I want to tell her to end the friendship and stop hanging out with her but I don't want to be controlling or seem like an asshole. Part of me feels like it's not my place to tell her how to handle the situation but I'm also pissed that she's tell me all this stuff and then still hanging out with Emily.",18Nov2020,1
65,"i’ve been suffering from depression for the past several years. i was pressured by my parents to attend a religious university despite me not believing in said religion anymore. (when i told them they began denying it and i stopped bringing it up). i’m here on a scholarship for the cs dept. however i’ve grown to hate my major and have been considering switching both schools and majors, but that’d cost me and my family.

what i really aspire to do is get out of this uni and work towards becoming a record producer and musician, which of course my parents look down upon as a career goal. i feel that i am capable of putting in the effort to compose, perform and market my own music to the point where i could possibly begin producing for major artists on top of that.

the problem is, my mental health’s been shit for a long-ass time. i feel like i’m too lethargic, unfocused and hedonistic to do anything productive… college, music or otherwise. i feel stuck, if that makes sense, and it definitely hasn’t been improving. because of this i am considering dropping out and seeking therapy, or at the very least working towards self-healing. the problem is that once i leave college i’ll have to pay a decent sum to either get back in (which i wouldn’t want) or attend somewhere else.

should i just take a break from it all and seek professional help to sort out my life?",18Nov2020,1

I have this thought because i find the way i operate so strange as a person

given i’m only 18, i’ve seen/ been through a lot in life. I’m strong in many ways but weak in others 

I gotten through crazy family shit, i walked away 

I joined the military, got through the training, i’m strong enough 

But i can’t stop over thinking. 
i’m on this base rn and i leave to a new one in 2 months. I’ll be honest this has been the loneliness time in my life. I ended up hooking up with this girl and i thought that *i actually got this person to spend my time with for the next few months, good bye loneliness!* . Didn’t go like that at all. She went back to this other dude and i see her every day and  i have this constant anxiety and it’s eating me on the inside. i constantly overthink little shit

My fault for setting those expectations, after this shit i learned never set expectations because nothing ever goes the way you want it to go. But I don’t what do to with my own mind sometimes. it truly does get overwhelming sometimes. 

I’m trying to better myself by adding reading and meditation into my routine along with the gym but it’s not the answer.

Unfortunately, all I’ve done is cried on my way home from work every single day due to the awful things I hear over the phone (death, trauma, sickness, etc) and ruminate over how awful I feel for the patients and their families. We’re the phone frontlines for the ER and many of the calls are from scared/upset family members. As someone with severe depression/anxiety, I’ve never experienced a job that’s upset me as deeply or as quickly as this job has. I’ve only been there for 4 days and I’m already sobbing by the time I leave. I need someone to tell me what to do because I’m not thinking rationally.",18Nov2020,2
73,"Hey guys!

I'm an 18-year-old student, currently studying under a Media Program in Toronto. All my life, I've been wanting a career in the arts. I love doing digital art, video-editing, and film. Sad thing though is I have a lot of self doubt.

It's been a semester in, and I want to drop out of my program. This is because of a few reasons,
- I'm stuck in a limbo of just trying to get projects/assignments in, with little to no heart in them.
- I feel like I'm not learning anything new, but the workload is insane.
- I'm not building on the skills that I want to build on.
- I'm scared that after 4 years, I'll feel like I wasted my time and I don't have a solid portfolio to get me started.
- I'm barely earning anything from my part-time job because of my class schedules.

So here's what I've been planning in the back of my head.
Step 1: Drop out.
Step 2: Get more shifts at work and get a decent earning.
Step 3: Now that I have more time, I can work on building my skills by giving myself projects.
Step 4: Start a business with the money I have. Design is my greatest strength, so maybe clothes/a business with my family.
Step 5: Start an online career.
Step 6: I now have a better understanding of what career I want to pursue, and I can comfortably act upon it.
Step 7: Profit...?

This plan could go in so many directions, and that is one of the reasons why I'm holding back. Another is that my parents resented the idea of me taking a gap year, so if they found out about this, they would kill me.

Honestly, I think I just have big-ass dreams. Everytime someone asks me ""what do you want to do in the future?"", I blank out and say ""I don't know"", because I'm afraid that my goals would sound too unrealistic/risky.

What do you guys think about this? Am I being crazy? Should I just stick to the program? Should I just become a hobo?

Give me all your opinions. I'd love to hear them.

What you see as a reason of happiness could be seen as a reason of bad luck, tiring, horrible thing. 

I am looking at it from a wider perspective. The person that means the world to me, could be mean nothing to someone else. In fact, he or she could be hated for that. I would be waiting patiently for, others would leave as soon as he or she enters. I am reflecting now, as I have seen people in my life where I never liked their existance. But for others, someone would come to visit regularly or they would have partners and I wonder how. 

Now with that perspective, I wish I could change my feelings and my beliefs with my ex. My ex had haters. People never liked her and even family members rejecting her. Yet, I was passionate wanted to be close to her. She brought me happiness. I saw her as scarce and wanted to become even closer. 

Now, how do I reach the level of neutrality with her. How did others not see her as I did or how can i see her as they did? 

Dont get me wrong, I am not judging. I am just trying to understand my emotions and feelings and beliefs. 

Thank you,",18Nov2020,2

After that almost radio silence. She still sends me streaks and she’ll snap back every once and awhile but this is a lot different from how we used to snap because we would snap each other like every 5 minutes.

I’m struggling a lot with figuring out the right balance of “I want to lose weight” and “I love my body.” 

My therapist has told me that I can pretty much either change what I don’t like or learn to accept it. I don’t think I can accept my body without feeling proud of how I treat it. 

Whenever my boyfriend encourages me to eat healthy foods, meal prep, or workout, I always take it as, “He doesn’t like how I look now and wants me to look different.” I know this isn’t the case, but deep down my insecurities get to me. 

Anyway, I don’t know, I guess what I’m asking is how can I stay motivated with my weight loss goals while also avoiding shaming my own body?

I'm F23 and my sister is 21. I need some advice on how to deal with her consistently saying hurtful things to me.  I just graduated college this May and my sister is graduating next year. My sister is extremely smart and successful, goes to Princeton, already has a 6 fig job lined up for after she graduates...given her success, I sometimes try to ask her about career tips and such and she helps me out by discussing things but given her high standards, she critiques me very harshly and gets borderline toxic sometimes, constantly reminding me of how much of a loser I am. For instance, I failed a ton of job interviews and she judged me severely for that. We recently got into a fight and she said ""given where we are in our points of life, nothing you say or do can frustrate me"" which implied that she is much more successful than me at a younger age. For more context, I struggled a lot to find a my first full time job and ended up taking a job that wasn't exactly what I wanted because of the pandemic and she knows that and constantly reminds me of how I don't even have the kind of control over my life where I can/can't decide on where I want to work.

But I want to be her buddy, I hate living situations where I’m not friends w the other person. How do I suck it up and ask her to hang out again? We spoke briefly in the kitchen a while ago and she said we should hang again sometime soon and I figured I’d wait for her to ask but she hasn’t lol. Pls help",18Nov2020,3
109,"Hi, I have no idea where to ask this so bear with me....

I would like for it to be that when you google my name, something comes up that lists my email address so people who read my name, for example in an article, have an easy way to get in touch if they want.

I am a college student and my ""industry"", I guess, is mostly writing including academic and creative.

I know that once I saw a website that listed journalists' names and contact info, such that when you google one of the listed people it comes up. And that there was a college student or few on it. But I don't remember what it was called or if there are any other services like this that you can add yourself too.

And I know LinkedIn exists, I just ideally would like something more simple with just my name, maybe uni and email address. I don't want to create a personal website right now.

Thanks for any suggestions!",18Nov2020,1

114,"**** TW: verbal abuse and cussing***


I usually find myself avoiding my moms explosive behavior. It's usually over the top.

Her best moments: running at my dad with a kitchen knife, telling me if I break my pencil agian she would make me write with my own blood when I was 8, smashing things in the home when over the top mad, glorifying being abusive to my dad,the obvious spanking, slapping and whatever else u could imagine as kids.

Tonight my mom was struggling to doing her CAA online after she asked me to help she asked me how I did it and I replied ""just hit the tab, and hit my account""
Then I said wanna pass me your card so I can fill in your information for you.

And then she started yelling "" tell me how u got to the page with the payment, I wanna know"" yelling at me and I responded "" you just hit my account under the tab"" then she goes into a big rant saying ""your fucking rude, I wanna learn. You just want me to look like a fucking retard, I don't know what a fucking tab is.. I wish I had a tape recorder for you to hear how you fucking explain things to me like im a fucking idiot""(childish and rude I know) 

Which I responded ""are you done? Can I finally put in your card information because im over this...""

Shes like ""i wanna fuckin know!!"" I said "" when you act like this I don't want to teach you anything because you speak to me in ways, id never talk to you and you have been screaming in my face for long enough...Having pride to your level is not a good thing..."" so she said ""thats it!! Im calling tomorrow i don't want your help"" 
I said "" okay, but with covid you'll be waiting 3 hours, so if you wanna just drop it and give me ur card that would probably be better"" 

As a adult its been a long time since I had a argument with my mom. However, I really don't enjoy her disrespectful approach towards me...  keep in mind she's screaming at me THE WHOLE TIME. and I just worked a bad 10 hour shift at work where customers shit on me ALL DAY.

I made a couple of friends when I went to Uni, but I fucked up and cheated on my boyfriend with my roommate. I know, it’s bad, but my boyfriend and I have worked through it, and we’re better now. Say what you want, judge me, but I wasn’t in a good place mentally and I made a horrible choice. However, I’ve grown from that and I’m not that person anymore. I still miss my friends from Uni though. My boyfriend and I agreed a couple years ago that when I left uni, I shouldn’t talk to them after what happened. I agree with this, but I still miss them? We had good memories, inside jokes, and I felt open to them because they were the first people I was able to be myself with in person and not be an anxious ball. I haven’t had any real opportunities to be friends with people since then. I don’t have a job, so I’m not going out to meet people or see anyone outside of family I live with.

138,"dear god, I wish I didn't have to ask for advice here but this is the only place I can go to without going to CPS or something extreme like that...  
So, friends, I hope you're having a nice day 'cause by god I'm sure not. Allow me to explain.

I'd first like to make it clear that I'm a 17 year old woman on the autism spectrum, I have a whole lotta mental illnesses and my brother(11M)'s on the spectrum as well;  
However, I was diagnosed much later than my brother so my mom's treating him much much different than she would with me at that age. She continues to make excuse after excuse for him (along with my dad but that's a whole other issue altogether) and this unfortunately didn't change even after my brother was suspended from school a little under a week ago because he started spouting how he'd kill himself or how he wanted to kill someone else in a little too much detail, I have no feckin' clue *why* he started yelling about this but apparently he was also throwing chairs at people (he also broke a teacher's nose with a pool noodle before. I'm not joking.)

Now, my mom *did* chew him out for it once she heard about it, but after then? Nothing. I'm the one holding onto most of his electronics but she still allows him to go on them nearly everyday for at least a half hour... Therefore defeating the purpose of him being grounded, I'm pretty sure. Hell, she's even buying him a switch lite for the holidays and getting him multiple games.

He laughs when we talk about what he did, on god I cannot get to him at all, I've been raising him practically since we moved to our new house and I'm just a dumb kid myself... But no, apparently I ""get him"", even after I told my mom I was uncomfortable with him because of how unpredictable his mood is she just got upset with me because I was ""giving up on him""?? when we're apparently ""all he has""????? My mom says he doesn't need therapy because he's ""not some kind of psychopath"" but he's really showing off some concerning behavior and it seems really unhealthy.  
There's so much more I could say here but I'm gonna end this right here for what it's worth... I've got a headache that's killing me, is there any way to get out of this hell? I don't mean to sound like a victim but this is really wearing me down...",18Nov2020,30
139,"A few weeks ago a few my friends and I got together for Halloween movie night. The friend hosting this(we’ll call her Morgan) welcomed everyone to bring snacks and treats. There were only 8 of us attending so I decided to make some cake pops! I love baking but honestly this was a pretty time consuming task. I wanted them to look cute and even wrapped them individually. With the leftover melted chocolate I made some chocolate covered Oreos as an extra treat. I was pretty proud of how they all turned out. So when I got to Morgan’s house with these treats I was thrown off when she said she didn’t know everyone was bringing something. She said we could, I was so confused. It’s almost like she was offended that everyone decided to bring stuff. What bothered me was that she hid the stuff I brought. She never put it out on the table with all the other treats everyone else brought. So I kind of just set them on the food table myself. It was kind of awkward. Now she’s invited us over to her house again for a mini thanksgiving gathering. She asked everyone to bring their favorite dishes. However, it turns out she just bought everything. And most of it is just boxed dinners. I’m kind of annoyed that she asked us in advance to bring our own dishes but decided to buy everything and told us last minute. Everyone had already told her what they planned on bringing. I think this is a little rude to be honest. She then told us all that her and her husband are picky eaters but we can bring anything else not listed on things she had already bought. I asked her if I could bring a mini pumpkin pie or pumpkin cheesecake. She said bring whatever but that they were picky. That didn’t help me at all! And to make things more awkward, another one of my friends told me she threw away the treats I brought last time after I had left! Apparently Morgan is not a fan of pumpkin or oreos...so instead of telling me before she just threw them away! Now I’m not so sure I want to go anymore. Morgan is nice but isn’t very bright. She can’t cook either, so boxed dinners do not sound appetizing. I also learned she just throws a ton of food away apparently. I don’t know what to do to be honest. I already said I would join them but I also don’t want to bring something if she’s going to throw it away. Originally I wanted to bring baked mac &amp; cheese and a mini pumpkin cheesecake but I guess I can’t anymore. The rest of our friend group loves pumpkin but I don’t want her throwing it out again. She likes keeping the leftovers for some reason but tosses them after a day. Something another friend had mentioned. Should I just cancel?

140,"So recently, I got a one month membership for CourseHero (which was honestly the biggest waste of money) and I was having a lot of trouble with my java programming class at my Uni. For one of my projects, I decided to ask a bunch of questions to the tutors on CourseHero regarding my project which is what they're there for in the first place. There were TA's accessible for my class, but even after all the trouble of asking them, I still couldn't figure it out. I posted my code into my question to further explain my issues and asked specifically how I could change different parts of my code in order to fix the errors and get a possible solution.

The biggest issue is that my questions included my code (which was still pretty incomplete) and they're now stuck on the CourseHero page. I'm just worried that other students may cheat off my code and I may get punished if the professor finds out who posted the questions. I'm not sure whether this was wrong to do or not, so I've decided to cancel my subscription and deactivated my account as well and I also changed my project to turn in something completely new to avoid copy issues. I'm not too worried because I didn't post any solutions to the project at all, but my questions have answers to them given by the tutors. I just asked questions and provided my code so that the tutors could get better insight on what I was working with. I'm just not confident that it was the right thing to do to ask so many questions and also include my code with my question, but I guess my biggest concern is if anything would turn out bad for me if the professor were to find out that the questions I asked on CourseHero were from me?",18Nov2020,1

The past year though almost every attempt to connect again has been met with rejection. Even when I tell her that I'm visiting the area for a week or two, I constantly have to try and initiate contact and have been met with rejection every time. I feel like my frustrations have really peaked recently.

Last month we planned a hiking trip in big sur and she agreed. During the last two weeks before the trip though she flaked and said she couldn't make it, only for me to see on her instagram that she went with a different group of friends the weekend I planned for us to go.

This really hurt me and I plan to cut ties. Part of me really wants to send a paragraph long message about my intentions and how she's hurt me just to get this off my chest and for her to know, but another part of me thinks that it would be more mature and less trouble to just never contact her again.

155,"So I (14F) used to have really long hair. It went past my butt and I never really did anything with it, and it made me feel kind of ugly and had some bad feelings attached to my long hair. I cut it off last year and felt so much better, now it’s really short (like a boy’s haircut). I felt so much more free, like myself and that I could finally start dressing like how I’ve wanted to dress, but felt too self conscious to.

So my family is Asian and very homophobic. My parents view homosexuality as a sickness and when my friend started using they/them pronouns my parents told me to stop hanging out with them (obviously I didn’t). My sisters are really homophobic, but play it off as “I have gay friends so I’m not homophobic, but if you’re gay then you’re disgusting.” I really hate their attitude but I can’t really do anything about it.

So I have two sisters, and the eldest we’ll call W is honestly a bitch. She has entitlement issues and often argues with my parents, and is just mean overall. We never got along and I always avoided her and never talked back to her so usually she would leave me alone.

But ever since I cut my hair she’s been pestering me about being gay. I’m not a lesbian, I’ve only ever liked boys and I’m still too young to even figure something like that out. Anyways, W would confront me about why I cut my hair. I would always say because I got sick of long hair (I wouldn’t actually tell her the real reason, she’ll just call me a pussy) and try to make my answers short. But she keeps trying to suggest I’m gay, without actually asking me.

She would do things like when I exit the room, say really loudly to my other sister “so what do you think about gay people?” Or whenever I say something (literally anything) she’ll go “that’s pretty gay”. And I know she’s not doing this to be nice to me and get me to come out, because I’m not gay and she’s a demon. My friend (the they/them pronouns person) couldn’t come over bc W kept yelling and screaming that she didn’t want a ‘homo’ in the house.

I can stand this, because W has been like this since the beginning of time. But yesterday my mum sat me down and told me that she loves me and blahblahblah but she couldn’t accept the fact that I was gay. I was really shocked, because this meant that W had told my mum I was gay, and now my mum thinks I’m gay??? I’m very confused as to what to do in this situation. I’m not gay, I don’t know how to change my family’s mind.",18Nov2020,1
156,"So, I met my girlfriend in January. She had a boyfriend she was living with most of the time, and I had my wife. Covid strikes, my wife and I eventually separated, and she moved in her parents because we were unhappy, and to be honest I started having feelings for my current girlfriend that I didn’t want to pass up. So, March comes around and I start pursing my current girlfriend and flirting with her. (We work together, in the same building, and I met her from work, she lives 30 miles one direction and I live 30 miles the opposite direction so we are from separate areas about 60 miles apart) 
We add each other on Facebook, and I start messaging her, we exchange numbers and start texting and eventually I tell her how I feel, that I like her, I think she’s sexy and I really wanted to get to know her better. Knowing she has a boyfriend and seemed happy in her relationship, she seemed respective of all this. We start talking, she’s living with a guy that’s 4 years younger then her, that has a drinking problem and isn’t the best to her. He’s not abusive physically or anything, but he’s just not what she deserves, he doesn’t put her first, isn’t really concerned or interested in her and doesn’t make her feel important or like she matters I don’t think. She started seeing this guy 18 months before, she met him through work also, and she started having an affair with him, her husband who she had been together with 12 years altogether and not a good person was mentally and physically abusive to her. They had been married about 3 years and he absolutely treated her like shit and beat her down and put her last every time, and she has no confidence or self esteem left. This boyfriend meets her at work, starts showing her attention and they start texting, 3 months later, have sex, and she’s falling for him because he’s giving her something her husband hasn’t ever at least not for many many years. 
This all happens around October 2018, she leaves her August 2019, moves in with her parents, and then by November is staying and living more with the new boyfriend then the parents, but is quickly learning it’s not probably who she wants to be with, or what she wants her life to be. They started having sex and it was October of 2019 before she orgasmed, so you over a year of sex before he even got her off or cared enough to focus on her. 
She’s going through a nasty divorce, and this guy I think is a disappointment to her. 
So, she lets me come into her life, and we kind of start with a sexual relationship more then anything else. He wasn’t satisfying her at all, he didn’t eat her, he didn’t make sure she got off, he would drink, roll over, and take 90 seconds to get off and he was done and passed out. 
So, early April, we start meeting at lunch and started having sex about every day. 
She’s still leaving with the boyfriend and at first it’s just sex. 
April all month long, we are having great sex, and by May I’m falling in love with her. I push my wife to leave our house and move in with her parents, because I start wanting a relationship with her. May comes and I’m pushing her for more. 
I tell her I want her to leave this guy, and I want more then just sex. May 1st she starts thinking and telling me she wants to leave him, but she isn’t making any move. We’ve been having sex, she’s sneaking off on Saturdays and taking half days off work to come to my house to spend time with me, and tells me she’s not having sex with him still, but she’s still living and staying with him and tells me she’s scared to leave him and shock her family and change her life again. 
We meet May 1st in a hotel room and she tells me she loves me, and we have sex around 12 times that day, and truly didn’t want to leave each other that evening. 
She starts her period the next day, May 2nd, a Saturday. She’s told me at this point she’s not wanted to have sex with him or had since middle part of April. He’s smaller then I am and doesn’t care about her pleasure at all, but honestly is a better looking guy and has a better body, so he does have a few advantages over me. 
On May 6th, Wednesday, he’s drunk, she’s in bed, late at night, texting me, and he’s passed out. We say goodnight, and this is the story she told me about a week later. He rolls over about midnight, she had been drinking a bit also, which she usually doesn’t do, and she’s half asleep and a bit out of it. He’s hard, rips her panties off, and sticks it in and 3 pumps and he’s done, cums in her, rolls back over and goes to bed. She didn’t fight him off because she was shocked, and she is in his home and in his bed, but she didn’t want it and was kind of surprised or shocked it seemed to me that it happened, it took her a week to tell me it had. 
So, May 9th she’s at my house, we have unprotected sex about 3 times, and again May 13th and we have unprotected sex 3 times. So, she kind of takes some of her stuff and stops staying with him May 14th that’s the last time they stayed together, a Thursday. She starts staying with her parents and we start talking more and more each night, because she has privacy and we can. By May 29th I talk her into breaking up with him, and she’s sad and unsure, and I think felt guilty. But she does it, and again shocks her family and friends and chooses to make a big life change and give me a chance. 
She’s sad and strange with me the next 2 weeks, or about. I find out indirectly from some mutual friends that told one of my friends, she loved the guy, and she missed him, but knew he wasn’t for her or who she should be with. She thinks he gave her the attention and courage she needed to leave the abusive husband and was grateful to him for that. She’s sad about giving him up I think, and unsure if she made the correct choice. June 7th she’s feeling strange that day, and we are out of town at her brothers, with her family, my first weekend with all of them together... I noticed she hadn’t had her period, because we have been having a lot of sex and I remembered it was May 2nd last month and I was cut off for awhile. She takes a pregnancy test, it’s positive. She takes another, positive, another, positive. 
So, now she’s freaking out. New relationship, new life not sure what’s going to happen next. Not sure who’s it is to be honest, she didn’t want to say that, but she was concerned as was I, so, I call DDC and pay $1500 for a prenatal paternity that can be taken at 8 weeks of pregnancy. All of June she’s struggling and she’s keeping me at a distance when I just want to be closer to her, and I want more time with her. She’s staying with me a night or 2 a week, I’m staying at her parents a night a week with her, we see each other at work every day, and she’s not as warm with me it seems and not as close as she was at first. 
So, end of June comes around, she’s getting better, she’s talking about moving in with me, he’s still calling and talking to her and I know she’s still talking to him some, but not seeing him or anything because we are together about all the time. He’s just still trying, he lost a beautiful gorgeous girl, and doesn’t really know she left him for me, she never told
him it was someone else. 
I buy a ring, and she knows it, but I haven’t asked yet. 
First week of July, my Dad passed away and she starts staying with me full time, never going another night without me, which almost killed me when she wanted to stay apart because I already loved her so much and wanted to spend every minute with her I could. 
We start moving her stuff in and she’s with me and things are great. 
Backing up. We went June 26th to have the first blood draw and cheek swab for the prenatal. It comes back not enough fetal DNA on July 6, we reschedule, now they will do it the 16th of July. 
So, we go, and wait and wait and wait, I’m calling each day because it was suppose to be 3-day results, it wasn’t, it actually was a horrible experience and the clinic they chose was dirty and not in a great looking place. 
So, July 21st comes, e-mail comes with results. 0% probability of paternity. I’m heart broken, she and I both are sure I was the father with the timeline and what was happening. I’m heart broken and hurt, and she’s not much better and offers to abort the baby, we talk and have a rough couple of days, she looks back through her phone at our texts and pictures and I do the same, and she thinks back on the time she was with him and can’t remember completely but thinks May 6 was, but could have been later. She said he’s been cumming in me since October of 2018 and all of a sudden now I get pregnant? She said I’m sure it’s yours, the time I could conceive I was with you and I think this test is wrong. So, we think and I decide I’ve been with her since day 1 of this pregnancy, I’ve gone to all those appointments, and been with her each day and every step of the way, told me our families and was invested in her our lives, and the fact we told each other we wanted a family and life together. So I decide, it’s a small negligible issue, and I will raise the child as my own, and give it the best life possible because I love it’s mother and will love it. 
I feel funny about raising this guys child that I hate, but I don’t hate the child, I hate the guy and how he treated my girlfriend and how he used her and made her pay for things, and neglected her and didn’t treat her how she had deserved, and he was truly an alcoholic piece of shit that didn’t deserve a child, wouldn’t be a good father and didn’t deserve my girlfriend either. 
So, we do the blood test for the gender reveal, it’s a girl, we are thrilled. We plan a gender reveal with our family, I’m excited, a girl is easier and more lovable and will look and act her like Mother who I already love more then I’ve ever loved anyone. 
Our families are thrilled. 
This other guy keeps coming back into our lives, he finds out after the gender reveal she’s pregnant. Texts and calls her, gets her upset and asks if it’s his. She says no, tells him about me, and she looks me in the eye and says I truly
believe this test was wrong and this child is yours, I truly feel it and believe it, I just do. They made us test twice, the clinic was sketch, and I don’t believe the results, something was wrong somewhere. So, she tells him about me, that we were sleeping together, it’s mine, and he’s drunk and calls a couple nights in a row and she tells him, he isn’t who she wants and that it’s our child. 
I feel funny about it. But I know it’s not the life she or the child deserves, or could want, he lives in a double wide that he doesn’t do anything to improve, drinks himself to sleep, and truly doesn’t do anything but drink and party, the house is dirty and the dogs have ruined the furniture. Not a place for her, or a baby. 
So, he texts a couple more times, but by the end of August we are done and haven’t heard from him since. 
Fast forward, 24 weeks pregnant in October, she’s diagnosed with Preeclampsia and hospitalized October 21st. November 7th our child is born at just 27 weeks, and she’s in Nicu. Mother and baby are healthy and doing fine. 
I see her for the first time on November 7th and she’s tiny. But she has features that resemble mine in a big way, and I’m not just saying it to be partial. 
Her feet are similar, her hands, knees, and a lot of things look like mine. The blood types work, nothing that would eliminate her from being mine, and she opens her eyes today and they look more  hazel similar to mine while her moms are brown. 
Im asking, I suppose, what are your thoughts, feelings and suggestions on the possibility of the prenatal dna being wrong, what are your thoughts on how she’s acted, what’s unfolded and what we’ve done. I’m just looking for an opinion and guidance from folks that aren’t necessarily people we know. Nobody knows all the true details accept us, and she doesn’t know everything I know about how she felt about him. I’m looking to discuss every aspect of this and talk about every detail. I still have a lot of doubt and grief about me begging her to leave him, her taking so long, and staying with him and possibly all this would have been avoided if she had truly not slept with him like she promised she hadn’t or left when I asked her to go back to her parents in late April. I love her very much but I’m bitter, and hurt by her also. 
Thoughts, opinions, suggestions, ideas, I’m welcoming all.",18Nov2020,1
157,"1:  There isn’t really a way to ease into this: I kinda have a crush on my friend. It’s also worth noting we’re both boys. I doubt he feels the same way but there is a chance he does (we have messed around a few times). Also we aren’t like best friends but we’re still close.

2:  Nobody even knows I’m bi, not even my parents. There is no way in hell I would tell my dad, like ever. It’s out of the question. My mom would support me but it would just be awkward. My brother and sister would totally support me and Ik that for a fact, but at this point I am more comfortable with it being a secret.

3:  I don’t want to ruin my chances with anyone, since girls (and honestly a lot of ppl at my school) would think I’m weird if I came out. I guarantee I would get bullied if I came out. 

4:  There are some kids who I am like 95% sure are gay/bi (kinda flirty beyond joking bromance), but I wouldn’t really want to hide it. Especially if they came out and I was their bf but I didn’t come out. I just feel like that would be awko taco 😳😬🌮 (and difficult to hide). 

5:  If my crush isn’t gay that wouldn’t be the worst thing, but again it would just be awkward to hang out with him when we both know... ya know?

168,"I've been wanting to vent this out for a long time now. I feel lost and depressed and anxious and meaningless but I hide all these emotions to everyone that it just makes me feel worst, which is why I want to just vent it all here.

I'm going to be asking a bunch of questions, so bear with me as I give context below or leave now if you don't want me to bother you and waste your time.

So prior to the pandemic, my life had already been subpar for the most part, but going out on adventures with my friends give meaning to my life, and what has really kept me going for the most part for a number of reasons.

With the pandemic hitting and everyone asked to stay home (I live in the Los Angeles area), this only exacerbated my anxiety and depression. 

Without being able to go out with friends, or really at all, I have been crying myself to sleep, feeling shortness of breath (panic attacks), increased anxiety, and feelings of meaningless (no suicide thoughts though, I promise).

This August, I started attending USC. Now you might be thinking, wow you must be a very knowledgeable and driven individual. That's true, but that's all that everyone sees me for. Nobody really sees my faults, shortcomings, basically my human side and how much I'm hurting emotionally.

At USC, everything is online, with the classes, resources, and we aren't able to dorm at all. Online learning has been the worst for me so far for the following reasons:

- I haven't been able to concentrate at all. Having everything online just doesn't work for me and although I did fine this semester, it still took a toll on me emotionally.

- I haven't made any actual friends. This has made me feel meaningless as a individual. Not being able to interact with anyone, even if it's at the very least online makes me upset.

- My learning environment is horrible. I live with my mom and her brother, and she simply doesn't understand me. I live in a low-income environment in a studio apartment, where I have no source of privacy my mom is extremely strict on what I can do with my life. She wants me to settle in life, when I'm not like that at all. I'm not someone who settles in life, rather I'm someone who's working arduously to get out of this crap situation that's my concurrent life. This mindset is what got me to USC in the first place.

-We have no car, my mom is a illegal immigrant with nothing to her name, and she has that typical Mexican mentality that I should take care of her until she dies when I don't want that at all. I've tried to convey all of this to her, but she simply doesn't get it.

- Let's go back to the dormimg situation. At L.A. county, the laws currently enforced by our governor is that no L.A. county college / university is allowed to have students dorm, with very minimal exceptions. At the very least if I were able to dorm, I could find some solace in the sense of having my own privacy and a better learning environment. Having the opportunity to move away has been what I've been dreaming ever since as a High school sophomore. But nope (screw Newson).

I underwent a additional experience in July where me and a group of friends were jumped and stabbed by a low-life. This was a scary moment for me because I thought I was going to die. Thankfully, no permanent damage was done, the dude was arrested and sentenced to 7 years, but again, it exacerbated my depression and anxiety. I was extremely scared to go out at all for a short while, and many people teased me for being scared and not maning up like my friend did (my other friend got stabbed as well, but he took the experience well unlike me). I feel somewhat better when going out, but I still feel extremely anxious in low-socio economic areas with lots of crime. The irony in this is that USC is in South LA, a area with a high crime rate, and this is something I have to improve before I go back to campus.

Things only get worst from there. You could say, why not just get a job and move out of my mom's place? To that I say I have Autism; yes my diagnosis is relevant to the context. As you can tell, my Autism is very minimal, but my mom ever since I was probably fivea enrolled me in a social service where they give individuals with disabilities monthly checks for their services. Okay not too bad, except since my mom doesn't work because she's an immigrant, she uses all my money for the rent. My social security coordinator and my mom have lied on reports to make it seem like my Autism is more severe and like I still need to be depended on by someone so that she receives more money from me (basically fraud) which makes me feel like literal crap. They want to make an entire court case so that they rise the age of my independency so that my mom still has the ultimate say in my life.


In short, If I start working, I lose that disability social support which means my mom and uncle would become homeless (to an extent, that's something I couldn't really live with myself).

Going back to my overall situation, I feel stuck in life, like it has no overall meaning. I tried helping myself and improve my situation rather than whine by seeking therapy this May. I thought it would help, only to have my therapist tell me ""You are extremely selfish you only think about myself. You should honestly just kill yourself so that you don't drag others to your shit life."" Yes she said it exactly like that, and yes I did report her and she got fired.

So that made me feel worst about myself and for that week I was complementing suicide (not anymore though), but it completely made me lose all hope for wanting to seek help for a long time.

So now I'm wondering if anyone can give me general advice about what I said and if I can get answers to these questions that I'm going to ask that act as potential solutions to my adversities. 

For my questions, here are the following that I think might act as beacons of hope but I'm still having deliberate thoughts on:

1. Should I practically say screw you to my mother, work, move out to my own apartment, and have my mom and uncle become homeless? In all honesty though, maybe this isn't the most probable option since getting any job probably wouldn't even pay for the expensive rent inherinted in Los Angeles, and given my full-time student status, could give a toll on academics. I know this also sounds like a shit thing to do from my end, but given the circumstances, I'm laying that option on the table.

2. Is there any way I could possibly socialize with others and follow social safety guidelines? Especially in LA county right now cases are exponentially going up. I was wondering if there was a way where say I meet a small group of people, and we go out to say Santa Monica where we can ride bikes on the bikeway or go hiking at Runyon Canyon while wearing masks the entire time and being distant from other people. I feel like this alone would save me from all that crying I have at night, but of course I would want this experience to be a safe one. I wouldn't want to do this if it means risking even one life, but I'm asking to see that if I there's a way that I could just adhere to these guidelines and go out with masks, and social distancing, and bringing our own lunches so that we don't eat in restaurants, then would it be safe? If not, then is there any other way I can try to go out safely?

3. Should I possibly request a gap semester or gap year? It's pretty obvious that online learning simply isn't working for me, but I'm wondering if smart or not to continue with my studies in spite of the circumstances, especially as a Computer Engineering major.

4. What can I do to remedy my Anxiety and Depression I'm constantly feeling? My overall experience, merged with my stabbing incident, the fact that I have no money at all and my mom not understanding me at all has brought these two dynamics to an all-time high. I do want to improve my anxiety whenever I'm out on the street, or my depression when I feel meaningless at night, but I don't really know how.

All perspectives and opinions are welcomed. I really don't know what to do with my life anymore, but I hope any of you guys can in which I will be eternally grateful for.

175,"As the title says, my bf's sister is pregnant and cannot afford the child; however, she is 50/50 between keeping it and having an abortion. She isn't able to care for the potential child. She hasn't worked since pre-covid and for the past 11 months has had no desire to get a job. She hasn't looked because getting rejected would be depressing for her. The baby daddy is a friend with benefits who doesn't want kids, she doesn't care that he doesn't and would sue for child support which apparently he can afford. Child support is her argument for how she would be able to afford keeping the child. 

The biggest issue is, she has no support here. She's free to make whatever decision she wants, but I'm not sure she understands what the potential consequences might be (not partying till 3am multiple nights per week, limits hanging out with friends, financial burden, ect). Her family is in a different part of the country, save for my bf who does not want to help raise his sister's child. She is also nowhere near the age where it starts to become difficult/dangerous for her to conceive.

In all honesty, I'm really embarrassed to use actual weights and start by myself. But even if I was confident I wouldn't know what to do. 

I didn't know where to ask this but could anyone give me some advice on how to start powerlifting?

I don't like being weak, emotional, and vulnerable, so I put up this shell that makes me appear stronger and more vocal than what I really feel inside.

..I just think that it's the emotional side of myself that I can't stand. I want to be logical, calculating, organized, systematic, cool and calm, get things done, not an emotional melting pot who TRIES to be all of the things that I've listed above but its a struggle because it's not the real me.

Im feeling hurt and lost right now and wanted to get some perspective on some things that have been happing between me and my s/o. We’ve spent the last week apart because he said he hadn’t been feeling well and wanted time alone. Tonight he told me he has enjoyed his time away from me and has a preference for spending more time by himself than with me. I’m trying to be understanding of that but it honestly hurts to hear. He continued by saying that I was exhausting and that if I was so upset with how he behaved then I just needed to leave, but in the same sentence will tell me he doesn’t want to break up? 

Every time I try to talk to him about things that upset me somehow I end up being the one apologizing, I never really feel like he hears what I say or even cares to. At the end of it all I usually just end up feeling heartbroken and unimportant 

In addition to all of this, I compete regularly in sporting events and he hasn’t come to my last 3 shows (4 months worth) he promised me he would come to my last show of the year four months ago and then said today (5 days before we were supposed to leave) that he can’t anymore and instead will be flying home during that time. I understand that family comes first but I was really excited for this trip and am so disappointed and confused. 

I don’t know what to do, it just doesn’t feel like he loves me anymore. I feel like I have to beg him to be around me and it’s so painful.

I know deep down she’ll be fine wherever she goes me on the other hand i’m not so sure. I dont know what is there waiting for me. I’ve singlehandedly destroyed my future and let down everyone who had faith in me.

I’ve spent the last 5-6 years just trying to make my parents happy whether it was playing sports so i could connect with a father who felt like a stranger up until freshman year or a mother who resents that same man and makes everything at home miserable. All the way since 8th grade ive taken rigorous classes so I could just hope they saw in me what they saw in my sister. It’s not easy for me to catch on it feels like anytime i fall behind its like trying to dig yourself out of a hole that just keeps getting deeper. And because of this ive failed many classes over the span of the three years of high school. Just recently I failed four classes because I was put into a stupid program that i didnt even ask to be placed in by the time i switched it was the fourth week of a six week grading period and I had to catch up on the weeks i had missed causing me to either focus on the classes i just transferred to or maintain the ones i was on top of. 

At this point there goes my hopes of even getting into college, who in their mind would accept me? This also doesn’t help that since our move in eight grade I’ve been alone at school I have no friends and I’m not exaggerating when i say i have no friends, it’s a struggle to get by the day i feel so hopeless. I don’t know what to feel am I depressed? I’m certainly not in a position to be. I have a both parents, we’re financially secure i havent been through a traumatic experience, and i wasnt molested or touched as a kid that in aware of.

One night me and my two friends were heavily drinking at his dad’s house. I was very very drunk I am not 100% sure how inebriated he was but he was taking care of my other friend who was throwing up. At that point I was heavily flirting with him (we had hooked up before) but I don’t think I did anything else besides ask him to like come here with me (which I know I did really want to kiss him and stuff but I’m not sure if I even was thinking about having sex at that point). The point is the next thing I remeber is being in his dad’s kitchen while he was penetrating me and me silently crying about the situation (sex is really painful and unpleasant for me). The next day he told me he didn’t wanna have sex with me that night. I immediately told him that we should never have sex again. We continued to be friends for a while after that and one night we again hooked up (he initiated it this time) and after that we started dating for like a year and a half.

That went downhill when my friend told me how he talked to her about me and how she thought I wasn't interested. This made me feel a lot worse.

193,"Hi all. So my (20f) girlfriend (20f) and I have been together for just over nine months, and we were best friends for years before that. She is without a doubt the person I want to spend the rest of my life with. Nothing with the current situation will change that. 

Since covid started and school shut down she became the only person I’ve been really keeping in touch with. We’ve both been having mental health issues for years but hers have been particularly bad lately, and steadily worsening. 

Three days ago she was finally admitted to a psych ward for intense suicidal thoughts. Personally, I am no stranger to psychiatric hospitals, I’ve spent over 4 (non-consecutive) months of my life in them. It’s difficult being on the other side though, more than I’d ever imagined when going through it as a patient myself. The phone calls in particular are very difficult for me, very emotionally draining. She told me I can call twice a day, and I did that today. During each call it was really nice to hear her voice, but it also felt very superficial. The calls are also incredibly short compared to our regular calls from before she was admitted to the hospital. Both calls today left me in an emotional dumpster fire - after hanging up each time I was ugly crying in my bed for at least half an hour, and once that ended I just felt terribly empty. 

On the other hand, without being in contact with her every single day, often FaceTiming for multiple hours a day, and without really having anyone else to talk to while she’s gone, I have  become incredibly lonely and sad. It’s only been three days and my own mental health is already deteriorating.

So the dilemma: I’m craving contact with her but the only contact I can have with her for the time being leaves me in an hours-long emotional downward spiral. I’m thinking it might be best to lower the frequency of my calls to no more than once a day, maybe even once every other day. I am not the only person that calls her, I know her dad at least calls her daily too, so she won’t be left all alone without my calls. 

Finally, is it selfish of me to be missing her this much? Like, she’s not dead, and as long as she’s there she’ll be safe. She’s just not with me for the moment. To some degree I feel like I shouldn’t be wanting her back this badly, she’s where she needs to be right now and she’s getting the help she needs. I just miss her a lot.",18Nov2020,2

199,"Sorry if that title does not explain the situation properly, since this is a very complicated situation. Basically, my little sibling (gender fluid, 18) just moved out of our parent's house a few months ago, and moved in with me (F22). A couple weeks ago, my sibling told me that our older brother (M24) sexually harassed them (not sure if it went physical or not, since it was traumatic and sibling does not remember, as they were 12 at the time). Now, my dad is selling the family house, and wants our brothers to move in with my sibling and I. While I'm fine with my younger brother moving in, I'm not fine with the older one, and neither is my sibling. My little sibling just got away from them, and even though this has not happened for years, they should not have to live in the same home as their abuser, and I don't want to live with him after learning this.

Sibling is not sure if they want to tell our dad or not, since our mom knew a little bit of what was happening, and did nothing (we are pretty sure she did not tell our dad about it though, and they are now divorced). They are also just not sure about how he would react, and also do not want to ruin Thanksgiving, even though I reassured them that this is not their fault, and if anything, it would be our older brother's fault. Dad wants an answer by tomorrow at noon on what we want to do about our living arrangements, and is pushing for us to take both brothers in.

We have a couple options: tell dad what happened and hope he takes it well, or just give permission for our younger brother to move in without the older, not giving a reason for it. If we took the second option, I would make myself the bad guy and say it was only me not okay with it, and stand firm on that, since I'm the only one on the lease. I'm not financially reliant on him, even though he owes me money, and I could get away with doing that, even though I think it would ruin our relationship. I would be willing to do that if necessary. But, I would rather not have to resort to that.

So, that's where the advice comes in. I am not going to pressure my little sibling into coming out about this, as it was a very traumatic experience and they do not deserve to be treated like that. However, I would like to preserve my relationship with my dad, even though I will go option two if necessary. Does anyone have another idea on how best to deal with this situation? We are both at a loss and would like some help. I also got my little sibling's permission to post this information beforehand.",18Nov2020,2

207,"I’m (21F) currently in a class called Bioelectricity Lab. Instead of a final, our professor had a work in groups to design and perform a novel experiment to further the field. The experiment is then designed, performed, analyzed, and presented in the group. Papers are written individually. 

I setup multiple channels of communication for my group (Canvas, Google Drive, GroupMe, Zoom, Email, etc). They never reached out unless prompted by me, and sometimes not even! I designed the experiment almost entirely by myself. Not only that, after designing the experiment, they shot down my ideas but offered none of their own so I had to redo it. I analyzed 80% of the data and answered all of their questions on the meaning of the results. Each of my other three group members missed class and meetings for no reason. Mind you, I wasn’t perfect by any means but I communicated when there was going to be an issue. I consider myself a decent leader and I literally could not get these people to do anything.

215,"Have you ever heard about Helen Keller? Well today i will be comparing and contrasting two Helen Keller articles. In the first article ""The story of my life"" by Helen Keller, her point of view on her article about her was an positive outlook. In "" A remarkable life"" by Mary Wilkes, his point of view on his article about Helen Keller was an positive outlook too. Text evidence that supports these similarities is in ""The story of my life"" by Helen Keller she talked about how she was happy when she learned what water was and how her soul was happy. In  "" A remarkable life"" by Mary Wilkes he talked about how Keller spread a message of strength and courage and was a legacy. Another similarity within these two articles is that they both talk about the same topic. Text evidence that supports this similarity is in ""The story of my life"" by Helen Keller she talks about how she learned what water was and how a teacher taught it to her. In "" A remarkable life"" by Mary Wilkes he talks about how Helen Keller was a legacy and talks about what she did in her lifetime.

However, a difference within these article is in the first article ""The story of my life"" by Helen Keller was to entertain while "" A remarkable life"" by Mary Wilkes was to inform. Another difference within these articles is in the first article ""The story of my life"" by Helen Keller the types of details Keller used were different from the type of details  "" A remarkable life"" by Mary Wilkes used. Text evidence that supports these differences is in the first article ""The story of my life"" by Helen Keller, Keller used sensory details but in "" A remarkable life"" by Mary Wilkes, Wilkes used narrative details. Text evidence that supports these differences is in the first article ""The story of my life"" by Helen Keller, Keller talks about how water felt on her hand but in "" A remarkable life"" by Mary Wilkes, Wilkes talks about when Keller graduated and the books she wrote.  Text evidence that supports these differences is in the first article ""The story of my life"" by Helen Keller, Keller entertains the readers with her experience of going blind then being grateful that her teacher took time to teacher her what some words meant while in "" A remarkable life"" by Mary Wilkes, Wilkes informs the reader about Keller's life and how she was an inspiring legacy to everyone.

221,"Recently I’ve wondered if I have a problem. I only noticed it a couple months ago, but I’m 26 years old and I haven’t gone a full day sober since I was 21 years old. Sorry for the novel, but here’s my life story lol. 

I’m a white, thin, blonde, affluent Canadian girl, and I’m not overly confident so I hate saying this but guys do generally find me very pretty. Ugh that was painful to type. 

Anyways, I used to do coke very regularly when I was 18 but quit after about 5 months when I realized just how addictive it was. I did mdma from 18 to 22 pretty often as a party drug, too. I think I probably did about 40+ caps, but I eventually stopped after watching a friend O.D. (she was okay in the end but scary enough to ruin the experience, I did it once after and it was never the same). I still do shrooms once every summer, so I feel like that’s okay.  

I used to drink to the point of borderline blackout or straight up blackout at least 1-2 days a week from 15-17, and at least 4 nights a week from 18 to 21. I cut back significantly for a few years after a few too many mistakes, but I’ve slowly fallen back into getting drunk 3 nights a week on average. 

I started smoking weed pretty regularly at 18. And it turned into a poppers (cut cigs and weed through a bong) addition at 20 until I was about 22-23. Then I went back to straight weed and haven’t stopped since. It was very excessive for many years, like 2.5 ounces a month. I lived in a haze. In the last year (since my breakdown, more on that below) I’ve cut it back to about an ounce every month and a half to two months, and only smoke at night (or weekend days when nothings going on - but cutting back has really helped with getting my social life back so this rarely happens). I still get wrecked most nights though with back to back bong hits (sometimes mixed with a bottle of wine).

I’ve been smoking cigs since I was 17 too. It started as a when I’m drunk/ stressed thing but it turned into a daily thing when I quit poppers. I was up to five pack a week but now I have it under 2 packs a week at most. I’m trying to quit completely. 

So yeah, since I was 21 I haven’t spent a single full day without either smoking weed  or drinking (or shrooms/ mdma..... or doing Valium/ opioids once each). That’s about 5+ years. 

I guess I should mention that I was in an extremely toxic/ emotionally abusive 6 year relationship that I got out of a little over a year ago. I suffered through depression for years, was very suicidal for as long as I could remember and I self harmed from the age of 12 until I was 24. After a friend passed away from suspected suicide and I sought out a couple months of therapy, but I was still struggling though. July 2019 I had a very bad couple weeks of what felt like endless panic attacks and essentially a mental breakdown, but I’m so glad it happened now. That’s when I really put the effort into cutting back on weed and smoking cigs, and started doing yoga regularly, taught myself guitar, made/ reached out to friends and so much more. I’ve worked extremely hard on my own to change my mindset, and it’s worked for the most part. I’m in the best place I’ve ever been. I’m happy most days, and I have the tools to keep the depression at bay when it rears it’s head up.  

I probably still have an eating disorder. I thought I got over it because I’m at a healthy weight for the first time since I was 21 (113lbs, 5’6”) but I still feel super chubby most days, and after a long time of not purging I made myself throw up a couple times this week. But I know I can stop that. 

I’m seeing someone new after a year of “finding myself” after my ex and he’s really great (not that the bar was high), despite being a bit of a goof. I work for a very well-known company at the head office’s e-commerce team, my resume kinda kicks ass for 26, and I have a couple contract marketing gigs too. I’m financially secure with a cool spacey condo in the city. I’ve slowly built some of the friendships I ruined during my worst years. 

But I still can’t go to bed sober. It gives me anxiety just thinking of it. And it’s not like I just have one bowl of my bong. It’s always to the point of ridiculousness, or I have to mix it with alcohol, or be pretty damn drunk if I don’t have weed... but it’s only at night, rarely do I get drunk or high during the day (maybe 3 times a month..). When I drink I have a hard time stopping once I’ve had 1. Do I have a problem? Do you think I have it under control?

Two weekends ago I did get extremely drunk and a friend and I took a hard fall down the stairs being dumb, long story short it ended with so much of his blood all over the cottage/ soaked into my clothes (imagine a crime scene) and the ambulance coming at 2am to take him in to reset his nose and give him a fuck ton of face stitches. My tailbone is still in a decent amount of pain and my head still hurts if I move certain ways (not to mention the bruises/ cuts that haven’t healed). You think that’d be a wake up call, but I’ve been drunk 4 times since. Tbh I’m drunk and high right now. 

So yeah, if anyone actually made it though all that crap - Do you have any advice as to what the fuck I should do? Lol.",18Nov2020,1
222,"About 1 or 2 years ago I was sexually abused by two people at two different times. I won't go into too much detail but the first times was with my ex (at the time bf) I never wanted to have sex and I had made it clear but he still forced himself on me multiple times. I was too young (14) to understand that I should leave the relationship so it happened more then it should've. Right after the break up I was in a very bad place, I had turned 16 and for the first time ever I got a friend that I started hanging out with, he took advantage of my situation and eventually abused me as well. He would bring up the subject constantly and it should've been a huge warning to me but I didn't want to loose my only friend.

I was about to commit suicide because I realized how fucked up everything had become, I hurt myself etc, but that day when it couldn't get worse I met my now bf and he saved me.

Today I'm 18 and almost every time I think of sexual things or if the subject gets sexual with my bf I get flashbacks and I can't stop remembering the time I was abused.

I have no contact what so ever with my abusers and I'm happy with my bf but I just can't forget about what happened and it's making me depressed again and it's making me unable to do what I want with my bf.

And yes I will go to therapy I'm just waiting for my appointment that is in two weeks, I'm just afraid of telling people about my experience, I have a huge problem with being judged even tho I know I won't be.

I blame myself for the experience, I could've done plenty to avoid the situation if I was stronger.

Is there any advice other then therapy that other people have that had a similar situation? Anything could help.

I have a strong grip on global and national issues and I’ve started a detailed plan for national infrastructure. Since now I’ve always been undecided on a college route and this one happens to interest me.

226,"So I work with this girl and we’ve only worked together for 3 weeks (4 shifts). After each shift we’ve went and grabbed drinks and had really good conversations we sat in her car and talked for like 3 hours the second shift we worked and told each other stuff that was pretty personal. So we’ve hung out once outside of work we went to the gym together, and she’s said that she’s down to hang out any time. We’ve scheduled a couple things and once she was sick (I believe her she called out of work the next day) and the second time I canceled because I was just having a weekend where I was not feeling very social. 

She’s leaving the job already because of another opportunity and I’m not sure where we stand. We text off and on and it’s usually pretty short but the past few days it’s been paragraphs and longer conversations. She also will talk to me about guys she’s talking to and is going out of the state on the weekend to visit one of these guys. At the same time when I’ve mentioned girls I find attractive she kind of brushes it off and changes the subject like at the bar I said something along the lines of “I’m in love with the girl in the blue” and she said a few minutes later “can we go somewhere else I’m not feeling this place.”. I don’t have an issue with her talking to other guys because we literally just met and haven’t had anything set that would make to where we were talking to just each other. 

Does it sound like she’s interested in being friends outside of work or even more? I feel like she’s cute and she’s honestly a great person to hang around and talk to but i don’t really feel like she’s interested in a more than friends level but it’s odd how she’s brushed off me talking about other girls.",18Nov2020,2

229,"So, I’m a 20 year old female and I let my brother use my phone for about an hour before he had to go to bed for school because he got his phone taken away. 

After my mom tells him to go to bed, he tells me to unlock my phone so he can log out of his social medias and I tell him I’ll do it, just go to bed so you won’t get in trouble. 

I’m doing my hair at this point so I’m not really worried about my phone, but I went to go check it and I was curious to what was on his Instagram and Snapchat (I know invasion of privacy, but I didn’t expect to find anything too inappropriate because, y’know, he’s 13). So first I look at his Instagram and go in his DMs and it’s just a bunch of “stan” fandom stuff until I look at a DM between him and another boy and one of the messages says “*makes out with him(referring to lil nas x) in front of your house*” and I’m like....okay this is interesting. But I log out and go onto snap. Now I didn’t know he logged into snap and I open the app expecting to see my account, but no, it’s his.

I don’t look through much of the DMs, but....I go on his feed where people post and I see so...much gay porn...I was extremely shocked to find that stuff on his phone AT 13!!!

I don’t know what to do, I’m thinking of confronting him about it because this stuff is so inappropriate and damaging for a child his age. I’m pretty traumatized right now knowing that he looks at that kind of stuff and the inappropriate messages he sends. I’m not even sure if he sends nudes (I truly hope not). 

Any advice on what I should do?",18Nov2020,1
230,"Ever since meeting my (27f) current partner (26m) I've been through the ringer and have opened up to him about all my depression and trauma and insecurities not just from 2020 but definitely exacerbated by this year. 

I told him that he met me at the lowest point in my life (few months ago) and I kept saying that there were times where I felt like I could do anything, if only he knew me then or will stick around until then, etc, sad stuff about when I get back to who I REALLY am and not this lonely, sad girl. He said if this is the lowest point of mine, its not that bad, and tells me he's not going anywhere anytime soon, and has been so open about listening, but I feel bad. 

Problem is I'm not 100% so I keep bringing it up and apologize for bringing it up and then apologize for apologizing. I keep thinking I'm annoying him or misinterpret his words and then apologize, and he tells me that it's actually okay. 

I lost SO many people this year bc they either left me and told me that I brought up my depression and family too much, or they were slowly phasing me out (and not for political reasons, gotta clarify bc US). Sounds dramatic and I wish I was lying, but I haven't nearly discussed my depression as much as I have been lately. 

I have abandonment issues and I've been deep in my head for all the reasons why and how much IS my fault, any sort of reason why they'd just ignore me and bail, bc my biggest fear is I'm the asshole and no one told me. And I know that it's still haunting me, this is trauma I gotta deal with with a therapist and not reddit. 

But for now, how do I stop this from becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy? How can I convince myself that I won't bring it up too much and drive him away despite what he says? I didn't think I'd hit other peoples limits and that fear is why I can't get it out of my head. How do I shut myself up? 

For what it's worth, reddit has helped me during the darkest times this year so I know I need a legit expert, this crutch is only so helpful, but I'm still on here because of you guys, so thank you.",18Nov2020,0
231,"What is the best way to help these kids?? They often have injuries like bruises and cuts that are shared as ""they fell off a chair"" or ""their sibling did it to them"" which might be true because they really are tough, destructive kids. The parents just laugh it off and say ""that's just how kids are"". I've actually seen the father hold his 6 month old, who we later found out is on the autism spectrum, upside down by his ankles and shout into his face ""stop crying"". I feel so so sick just writing that. He also laid the baby on the counter and let the baby's head hang off the edge without support. They brag about shoving a baby into their crib so that the baby knows to go back to sleep. Two of the kids have had severe cavities, one kid literally had a tooth rot out of his head and their excuse was ""oops, guess we shouldn't have let him brush his own teeth"" and then they laughed about it. They call their kids stupid and tell them to stop being ""babies"" - in public so I have no idea how much worse it is in private. The instigate fights between their kids, it's horrible. I've seen the older ones slap the younger ones in the face and the younger ones don't even react. The kids physically harmed my children and the oldest one is so rude. He says and does terrible things. I know that comes from the parents behavior. You're wondering why I haven't called yet. They're pinterest parents. They have a beautiful house, the kids have nice clean clothes, the kids have newest everything. They take nice vacations and the kids do well in school. They do pinterest worthy activities with their kids. The kids don't realize that anything is wrong. I'm so afraid a CPS worker will go to the house and think everything is fine and then leave and the parents will get worse!! That's been the trend, any time anyone has ever tried to call them out on anything or ask them to stop they only do it more and worse. I'm just so scared they'll feel threatened and those poor kids will suffer even more. How do I do this? How do I help these kids?

236,"I've made a post once about this situation over on r/crazygirls but it hasn't stopped, I do have more saved messages/can find the messages from my friends about this situation.  
There this girl (we'll call her S) who's been messaging my friends G and K ever since K got G to stop being friends with S, this was a good thing since S was obsessive over G for no reason and she very much would abuse him/ cause him to hurt himself. The situation is messed up if you knew all the things S made G do.  
Anyways, K and G are also staff on a server I was made owner of and thus far the best thing we can figure out to do is for them to only allow messages from friends and we implemented a mod bot so we don't have to worry about them still doing staff duties if someone needs help and needs to DM staff. The problem here is that S keeps making new accounts and is using a VPN were pretty sure because the chatroom that we use is one of there if you get banned from a server/ the people who run the site it also IP bans you as well.   
This girl is infuriating, delusional, and just wont let up on leaving either of them alone. I just want to help my friends in making S go away but also so she doesn't go harassing members of my server, which she's done already. I'm just not sure if there's anything to be done, our server has an age verification thing going on (its an 18+ only server) which can stop her from just popping in but S has gotten smarter as is starting to change up their handwriting and is also somehow getting other's IDs? My best guess is that she's taking them from family/ somehow convincing IRL friends to let her barrow their IDs.  
And before anyone ask: No, K and G aren't dating and no G and S were never dating. S is just a crazy chick who's made we took her play toy away and that we're helping him to be a functional person and showing him what real friends are/ how it is to actually be respected and cared about by another human being. And for anyone who wants to know, S hasn't come after me at all. I'm not sure if its just because she's doesn't know I'm now becoming close friends with G as well or what, I just feel lucky I havn't had to deal with her crazy butt over the past few months this has been going on....but I still want to help my friends the best I can if possible.

238,"So Ive encountered an issue where I can't personally relax unless I am exhausted. I will only try to post as much background as necessary. Sorry if mobile messing with the formatting. TLDR at bottom

I am a person who comes from a very busy family. From a young age my sister and I were taken to volunteer programs and asked to help with whatever project they had going on. In highschool we were encouraged not to come home until 6:30. Often my sister would not come home until later. I would come home at 6:30 and would work on homework or study till 7:30ish. In college both of us picked up more work. I in all of my years would end up with 12 hour days most of the time. In my last year for example, I would go to class at 9:00, work on homework and other things when I got home at 6:00 on Wednesday. On other days I would go to my part time job at 5:00 and come home at 8:00. I would sometimes assist with debate practice that I used to compete in. That would bring me home at 11:00. On weekends I would work on my homework, study, or volunteer. If I volunteered the project would often be all weekend. For example if I judged for debate I would be on a bus to another state and be back late on Sunday. During college I founded a club and won awards in my competitive debate team

I think my issue is I compare myself to my sister on this. My sister is a triple major doing pre law. She also runs a college cubbord she founded and now works on several projects on the student government. She is also a sorority girl and I'm pretty sure she has high grades (close to 4.0 last I knew). She has so much effort. She also plans holidays with us by the days she can be there. She often spends less than a day or a day with us and either is with her friends or studying back at her college. She loves us, but she honestly believes this is her best shot getting into law school. She also spends several days around Christmas, and has made exceptions for family holidays. 

Now on to why I feel lazy now. I now work full time as a health insurance agent as I took a year off from school. I had to do this because during my sophomore year of school I was diagnosed with a psychotic disorder, I know I need to learn how to relax. But when I have so much time in the afternoon I just keep thinking of what I could be doing to improve myself. Weekends are especially hard. Money is no concern, and right now I have a friend I'm trying to help. She and I moved in together because she wanted to get out of her parents house. I just want to show her that I can calm down and enjoy my time with her, and with myself. 

How do you guys let yourself be done with work?

TLDR I never learned how to relax and now I feel like I should be exhausted before I deserve to relax. Please help.",18Nov2020,1

243,"So recently I have been having a lot of issues with my dad. Back around mid 2019 and a bit before there was a lot of building tensions between him and my mom for multiple reasons that I won’t really need to get into, but just for clarity they were really stupid and usually ended with my mom not doing anything wrong but trying to apologize to my dad and get him what he wanted. My parents have been divorced for around 6 years, but they always had a decent relationship after, if only just for our sake. 

So anyways, this few months of tension exploded when we were out of town visiting my dads family. He was very angry at my mom, and spent basically the entire weekend screaming at my mom on the phone. After my mom couldn’t handle it anymore, she asked to talk after we got home. And he lost it. He was screaming, throwing his phone (not at anyone), making me call her on my phone, and he has never really acted like this before. And it was for hours. Then after that... chaos. 

Since then, he has said all sorts of time saying all types of really scary things to my mom, (not in front of us, I just have looked at my moms phone over the time for different reasons) spent hours screaming at us on the phone, and he even came over to our house twice, once in the middle of the night. It got to the point that the stuff he was saying made my mom get a restraining order. The judge ordered that we meet at this supervised meeting place, which my dad just outright refused. Which is really frustrating because he keeps saying he would do anything to see us, which clearly isn’t true (and it’s not money either, his parents offered to pay for it) it’s gotten to the point where he has turned all his old friends and even his family against him. 

He guilt trips me a lot and says that I make him feel awful and that I’m slowly killing him and that’s really messing me up. But then in a week he’ll also be calling me an selfish asshole who is a total pussy that he wouldn’t want to hang out with anyways. It’s things like this that make me not want to call him, which makes him even more angry, and it keep going this way. One time, we had a week of really nice phone calls, talked about like music and shit. Then, when I told him that I couldn’t call for a few days because I had school to do, he got all angry and then here we are again.

I just feel so lost. I have no idea what to even do at this point. I don’t even know where he is. He doesn’t have a house or apartment so I don’t even have a clue where he could be. This has been really taxing on everyone in my family (especially my mom) and I don’t want my dad to keep feeling this way either.

244,"     Me(m19) and this wonderful girl(f19) have been in a comitted relationship for just over 4 1/2 years. We have done so much together in these last 4 1/2 years. I had engagement plans lined up within the next year or so. We loved each other so much and even have been to a few ring stores together. We have discussed and planned so many aspects of our life together. She has depression and I have been helping her every step of the way. We got a dog together last fall to help with her depression, and because we have wanted a dog forever. She previously lived with me and my parents until we were able to move out together. I quit my hosting job in July and thought that I would be able to get a job the IT field within about 2 months. 

     Well it has been 4 months and I still am unable to get a job. I am studying an online IT certification course that will almost definitely get me a job, because it is what most employers are looking for in my area. Me being unemployed has put a large strain on our relationship and recently I have applied for many temporary jobs to alleviate this stress; although, I will admit it is late. I have lied to her about my grades in college this semester because they are extremely low and I did not want to worry her even more than she has been. She has now entered her career as an EMT for a privately owned ambulance company, and cannot help but feel like I am holding her back. While I cannot deny this, I am trying my hardest to finish this course and get a job to help support us. 

     I have made similar mistakes in the past smaller than this, but they have added up. Today my girlfriend broke up with me and I do not know what to do. I am still staying with her for now. I love her more than anything and think everything would be better by the end of the year if we stayed together. We have always promised to stay bestfriends if we break up, and it seems to be going that way. I fucked up and I know that, but I have been trying so hard to be the best boyfriend I can while fixing things. I have apologized and have been trying to fix things, and she understands that, but still wants to end things. I do not want this relationship to end. This girl helps me in so many ways and I have planned so much around her. I do not know what I will do without her. She is as upset about this as I am, but thinks she needs to be more selfish and think about what is best for her. I do agree with this, but I dont know if I can stand to lose her.

We were talking everyday and she told me things like “You help me want to stay alive” and “you make me a little happier” then switched up on me the day after I said it was best for us to distance ourselves  and said how I never made her feel better and other things. Ever since then i’ve just felt so empty and alone. It’s hard to meet new people at the moment due to covid and living with my parents.

She calls grandma and tells her how horrible her younger kids are to the point that my grandma sometimes  cries. Then my mom smiles and consoles her and acts like the perfect daughter. Then she calls her siblings and tells them that grandma was talking shit about them and then console them. Whatever complaints she told grandma she changes the story and tells them that grandma is the one who actually told all that crap.

She even tried to do this to me and my sister but we were prepared and we told her off. She does all this and even abuse us but posts the exact opposite on Facebook about what a good parent should be like and how family is everything. So everyone thinks she is some sweet angel.

254,"My household was toxic growing up and being home makes me uncomfortable as an adult. I moved out with my partner to my college town, we’re 5 hours from my family. I still call on some occasions when I feel guilty. I’m not going home for the holidays this year because I can’t afford to not work, and I have no one to take care of my pets and it’s my first tear living on my own- as in not in a college owned dorm or apartment. It’s a mess. So I feel an intense guilt about it this year. I just feel so sad because Christmas is my favorite time of the year, but thanksgiving in particular is extremely difficult for me because it’s supposed to be a time to spend with your family... but it’s not great for my mental health to do that so it makes me feel awful and guilty. What makes it much worse is that we’re doing thanksgiving with my boyfriends family. I think everything kinda sunk in when my boyfriends sister called him for his birthday today, and it was sad because it reminded me of how alone I am- my family would never do that because they don’t care like that. I’m in pain because of it. Nothing wrong with his family, but it kind of rubs it in my face because everyone in his family is so close knit. And yeah I do have my partner and it’s selfish to say that I’m completely alone- but I feel so lonely and sad. My depression always gets worse this time of year and it doesn’t help that my boyfriend and I are on opposite schedules since he works third shift so I rarely get to spend time with him.  
I’m struggling with coping with all of this and I’m not sure what to do, so I’m here seeking advice... anything helps &amp; is appreciated.",18Nov2020,1
256,"I’m at the end of my rope here, I’m so stressed I can’t think. I have had problems with my teeth for years, and I was told that it was because of how my teeth were spaced apart. I brush like a mad man as well as use floss and mouthwash 2 times a day. I recently went to the dentist and they said I have 10 CAVITIES. Granted, only 2 of them are a little deep, the rest of them are surface level and small. I don’t have much money in insurance left for this year, and I was thinking about getting the worst ones done this year, then wait until the first week of January to get the rest done when I have more insurance money. Can I go a month without getting them filled? I just feel like a failure, that I did something wrong and I just feel like shit. Any advice is welcome",18Nov2020,2
257,"Since last night, I (21NB) have came out to my mother that I would like to change my name. To put this out here, I am doing this regardless of reactions. I explained to my mom that I am not happy with my birth name (it is a super common girl name- I know it’s not my mom’s fault I ended up not liking it) and that I am going to change my name to be more androgynous. I’ve chosen the name “Charlie” a while ago since I’ve liked that name as a child and it is fluid with my gender. 

My mom told me she was going to let my family know and I was so happy! However at dinner tonight, I began to discuss the name-changing process in which I found out my father hasn’t been informed. He got angry, went for a smoke, and claimed he will always refer to me as “____”. 

Personally, I did not get angry or start an argument since it’s my choice as an adult regardless. I was honestly just disheartened because it reaffirmed a bigger issue. 

This bigger issue is that my father doesn’t understand/believe in gender fluidity. I knew I was gender fluid at thirteen, but I closeted my identity after a few months and for seven years after my dad was pretty cruel about the things I wore and did experimenting. I came out as genderfluid again at twenty, but my dad said that he will accept me as a lesbian, but I will always be his daughter. I’m guessing with this name change, my dad now has to accept it was never a phase like he has always told me. 

With all of this, I can accept if he wants to see me as his daughter. I can accept if he doesn’t believe in gender fluidity since I’m the one going through it. But it was highly saddening for it to be known that his comfort is more important than mine. That he would rather watch me be sad, unhappy with myself and the life I live, because he refuses to empathize with how I feel. 

I guess writing this out, I am realizing I’m a lot angrier than when I began this message. I’m angry that he refuses to learn even just a smidge of a concept that honestly has been around for a long time (looking at you, Ancient Greece). I’m angry that I can’t even be validated just enough to have a comfortable name, but I’m supposed to suppress my gender dysphoria because it’s oddly too scary of a concept. 

The last time we discussed gender, I ended up staying the night at my friend’s house as my dad was yelling that there are only two genders whilst my sister taunted me. I know this sounds like a troll post, but there is a reason why we insult the “one joke” trope. They kept drilling this while my dad was playing the straight savior saying he beat up homophobes in the 90’s. Like congrats, but you can’t even use the pronoun “they”? I ended up crying and calling my friend to get me. I learned that the only person I have for this is my mom. 

Anyways Reddit, how do I confront my dad on this? I’m not asking him to 100% accept and understand my identity- I’m just asking him to be courteous of me. The reason why I seek advice now is because I finally have a plan on being able to fully express my gender identity in its current form. I have a binder hopefully coming tomorrow, the name change, and at the very least getting top surgery. These are things I confidently want to do because I feel warm, happy, fulfilled just thinking I could be in a body I love! It does genuinely hurt that my dad doesn’t want me to be at my happiest.",18Nov2020,3
258,"a lot happened tonight. basically, my friend of 10 years just did some of this dickiest things because he caused a problem in the first place. what’s going on is i have a small friend group of 5 people. we made a minecraft world and have been in it for weeks. this friend i’ve know for 10 years will be named L. then there is two more during the situation. R and J. R and i made the world first, then the others joined after. it started off great, we had some arguments over things but it was fine. then tonight happened. basically, me and R were screwing around when L decided to kill R in the middle of it. now a bit of backstory, our goal for the world is to make a thriving community with an economy and laws and such. one of the laws is to not kill so we decided to say, “since you killed, you need to spend 10 minutes in jail”. it’s not a harsh punishment, it’s just 10 minutes of sitting there. L is stubborn though. he claims he did nothing wrong and if were abiding by the law system, it wouldn’t be much time so i’m not sure why it mattered.
after that though, it got worse. our world has a campsite that is fairly large. L did multiple things to the world for no reason other than “i didn’t want to sit in jail for 10 minutes.” he proceeded to accuse of theft when none was done, put tnt in a central part, blow it up, then claim i did it when i had solid evidence i didn’t, he murdered a cherished animal of the world, fought with the players, blew up a community center for community items while J was trying to reason with him and get a simple apology, L took from the community fund which is basically where we keep the ores in the bank for loans and the community, left the world with those items. stole and killed horses, threatened and almost killed J’s fox and some other stuff. we tried reasoning so much just for him to chill tf out and stop doing this crap but he continued until we banned him. the thing is, i don’t want him banned. i want him to stop his shit, apologize, and leave it behind us. it’s hard though because he’s destroying hard work because of pettiness. i wanted to remain calm but after hearing him claim he’s the victim after blowing up the communal hall, i snapped. i chewed him out saying this is such bullshit, stop being a dick, 10 minutes isn’t that much time, and other stuff. J tried to remain calm but it was hard after hard work was diminished.
R was calm at first but had to step in when it got serious and got offline because he was so pissed. i don’t want to lose L as a friend because of all we’ve done together but i’m tired of all of his shit. his constant assholiness towards everyone because he’s forced to follow the servers role play. i’m just posting this for some advice and what to do, also because i’m still fuming over this blasphemy.",18Nov2020,1
259,"Whenever my little brother gets angry or sad he starts to hit himself, slap himself, and saying that he hates his life. This has been increasing lately. None of my other little siblings do this.

260,"Me and three other people live in an apartment complex near a college campus. The rooms are randomly assigned to people unless you want to be paired with a friend or a group of friends. I live with one of my best friends since middle school and we chose to pair with each other. The other two roommates were assigned to the rooms at random.

One of those roommates, let's call him Bob recently has been becoming pickier and demanding about our living situation. I think it is a culmination of the quarantine and him being in between jobs. Regardless, he has started complaining about the dishes situation.

He's stated that he wants the kitchen sink to always be empty and the dishwasher to always be emptied. None of the other roommates have a problem with periodically cleaning the dishes and dishwasher but him. I tried to talk to him about it saying that I get his point, but we are all busy and sometimes we look over simple tasks for later. I also said that we will try to accommodate but if it isn't satisfactory to him then maybe he could try to switch apartments to somewhere better suited for his needs (also being sure to add that we don't want him to leave, but we want him to be happy with where he lives) Then he doubled back by saying he will talk to our building manager if we don't do what he says.

To add on to the situation, me and my best friend have very good reason to believe he leaves dishes in the sink too and it isn't just us other three.

TL;DR - Roommate is adamant about us changing how we do household chores but we think it is just fine how it is.

So Reddit, what can we do to calm this situation down?",18Nov2020,1
261,"I turned 18 today
“You’ll be happy they said”
Yet this morning I wake to a freezing cold bed
I turned 18 today
And it’s different then expected 
The world is worse than I had dreamt in my head
I turned 18 today 
And now I see grey skies where blue once laid
And there’s no more birthday cards to be saved
I dreamt of 18 I know I did
How foolish of me
Now all I want is to be that free spirited kid again
I turned 18 today 
And for a second I thought
Maybe my mind
Doesn’t have to be bought
Maybe I can still see the blue
Even though I know the grey remains
Maybe I can still read the cards I used to
Just not in the same way
I turned 18 today and I learned something
The world is cold and dark And cruel and mean
But maybe there is still some light to be seen",18Nov2020,23
262,"So I’m 19F, I work at a restaurant and one of my coworkers (42M) is always touching me. Nowhere inappropriate at all, but he’s always pretending to choke me, or coming up from behind and putting his arms around me. Sometimes he just gets so close like yesterday he was full on hugging me and rubbing my back. Also yesterday I had a drink in my hand, he came up from behind and grabbed me and I spilled my diet coke all over myself. He just laughed but I was pissed. 

I’m not comfortable with this, not just because of the virus but I’ve never liked people doing this to me, not even close friends unless it’s a meaningful hug. 

He does this in front of other coworkers, so it’s not like he’s trying to hide anything. Every time I tell him to stop or to leave me alone he thinks I’m joking, he’ll stop but he laughs and does the same stuff next time we work together. 

Sometimes he’ll Snapchat me “I didn’t get to see your smile today” (cuz of a mask) or “I miss you” and I stopped replying but he gets mad now if I don’t reply. Oh and this reminds me he often comes up to my face and pulls down my mask and says “Smile!” it’s disgusting to me, I’d never go up and do that to someone I don’t know well

I want to say something to management, but this guy is super senior at the company and is known to be “class clown” so they said it’s just him being playful. But it’s to the point where it’s downright disturbing and idk how to get management or the guy himself to take me seriously when I say I’m uncomfortable. Everyone says “it’s just how he is”

BTW I have NO idea if he does this to other people at work or if it’s just me. I never see him do it this stuff to anyone else, but I don’t know what he does when I’m not there",18Nov2020,1
263,"Bit of a strange one. I’m 16 and go to school, due to covid-19, we now eat lunch in a different room. Instead of the usual small room, with a few big tables. It’s a much bigger, open room, with lots of smaller tables, perfect for each friend group to use for themselves. Now the issue is, my friends have fallen out with me, all of them. This means I’m gonna be alone during lunch at school, in a huge room. For half an hour. Just the thought of it is making me shake with nerve now. I’m extremely worried and anxious because this is obviously quite an embarrassing situation and definitely not one I want to be in. So, now can I not care what everyone thinks? How can I appear more confident to others to draw attention away from the fact I’m alone? How can I try and act casually and like I don’t care? How can I not feel embarrassed or awkward? How can I calm down so I don’t end up crying or something like that.

I spent most of my life always being the fattest person in the room; undesirable, judged, and unsightly. I've never even understood what 'self esteem' is like, let alone had it!!

I can't wrap my head around this, and it's stopping me from giving dating a shot or taking pride in it. There is new confidence, but it makes me feel like my body isn't me. For my height I'm overweight, but I still feel as big as I did in January. (&amp; yes, I lost it quickly. It was intentional but covid depression has led to some low intake weeks.) I'm okay with clothes on, but seeing myself naked makes me think I'm extremely deformed. Sometimes it looks like I'm horribly asymmetrical, and it gets worse the longer I stare.

How can I develop a new sense of self, and how do I get used to men seeing me as a woman? (I can't really bro around with guys the same way... my dad even got me pepper spray... I didn't want confirmation I was that ugly before, lol)

My friend, who I have not spoken to in a while catches sight of these updates. Now she’s literally trying to have the exact same hobbies I do (ie: studying multiple foreign languages, talking about theatre, fashion, art, literature in depth) when she’s never even had them before.

267,"I only put my age because I don’t want people to think I’m too young. I’ll will try to make this as short as possible because I feel that a lot will change in my life if my make this decision. I feel that I no longer need most of my friends so I should cut them off. It started with my friends guilt tripping me into thinking I was wrong for not hanging out with them because I had work, class, and homework which I still didn’t finish in enough time. What did they want me to do with them at this time in 2020? Go to the desert and smoke weed... then I realized my job is overly stressful. I work at a fast food chain and mostly everyone there treats me like shit or hates me. I get it I can be an ass but I became an ass after I realized I was new (less than 6 months) and I shouldn’t be doing half the shit I’m told and shouldn’t be pressured to work harder than everyone else. I won’t quit my job because it can help me save up for my independence but I hope to get an internship soon. I am also will graduate from college next year and will hopefully have enough skills to get me a descent job in a filed I like. I live in a really big household (more than 4 people) and our house isn’t very big. I’ve realized that people still have the same idea about me when I was younger or they don’t really support me. My sisters treat the house like it’s there’s and seem to disregard others space. My brother when he gets mad belittles me or insults me. Because whatever has happened In his life when every he gets mad he blows it at other and purposely digs his nails into people (metaphorically speaking. My dad said “all you will do is hurt yourself” when I told him I was really on edge. So I got mad and I cursed. That made him mad so my mom told me I need to be respectful of my dad. My dad lately has showed that me seems to not have the capacity to sympathize with people truthfully. He doesn’t seem very educated meaning he is quick to put a person down because they haven’t done the same thing as him. He hasn’t graduated highs school ever and has somewhat had many achievements I guess at his age. My dad also seems to justify my brothers actions  because he’s his first son, they have the same name, and will get the same job (I don’t care I love my name). My mom told me to need to come at peace with whatever is going on in my life. But something I have come to acceptance with and I am at peace with the fact that people seem to never change. From family to friends to co workers people see the world is their own bias point of view. Therefore they personally accept what they see as a personal premise and a personal answer to that conclusion. That in nature is selfish and they can see the world in any point of view they want weather it’s fair to others or not so tuff of luck. If someone accepts this then they will be someone else they are not. I personally know what will make me happy and at peace and it involves living my own life with Or without these people. And if I feel someone people should  be cut out of my life or have no involvemnt in it it’s perfectly fine if I feel happier.

I'm mostly in the accounting program because it's one of the very few fields that still leads to well paying jobs after school, and the others (engineering and computer science) I'm not capable of doing.

282,"My stepdaughter we’ll call her Anna. She was given to us with Rotavirus. Anna’s mom knew her daughter had Rotavirus from her but neglected to inform us. 

I have have a child we’ll call him Grant who is in 1% for weight and losing and we are trying to figure out why. Grant is two weeks away from a possible hospitalization due to being so under weight. 

Well, Anna’s mom doesn’t care apparently. I told her what a horrible person she was to do this to both of our children knowingly. Anna’s mom just omitted the fact she was sick and said she needed someone to watch Anna for a work thing. I informed Anna’s mom she needed to come pickup Anna. 

My best friend who’s studying to be a doctor who we’ll call Ariel she came right over and sanitarily put my son to bed and helped me sanitize my whole home. Since puke can sometimes be contagious especially if it was Norwalk virus we would need to bleach and scrub every surface according to cdc and whatever else guidelines. This took quite some time. 

Well, this isn’t my only problem with Anna’s mom. We have been in a child support case for a while now. She says she doesn’t want it and wants to opt out. 


she won’t go to the meeting to sign the final papers. Even after taking Anna of of Medicaid. Which is all good and fine but this makes her legally responsible for half of the medical bills since she won’t sign the form which is a medical bill release form.  Releasing Anna’s mom of medical bill responsibility. 🤷🏻‍♀️😂 

I have been nice and informed her of this. She still ignores us. She also refuses to do 50/50 custody of Anna even though that is what is in the court agreement. She also lives two hours away and refuses to meet halfway. We have also asked how high anytime that she says jump. She is about to be in a world of hurt. 

We’ve tried telling her she may be about to get child support but she’s also now going to have medical bills since she won’t sign the release form since it will absolve my husband of having to pay child support. She also I don’t think realizes we’re serious when we tell her we’re going to stop paying for all extras for Anna because that is what child support is for. 

We’ve been buying all of Anna’s clothes, school supplies, and even extras like Disney+. All while begging to see my stepdaughter. It’s just sad. Well, no more. We’ve decided to be mean and nasty people. 

The court here doesn’t care if you spend extra on a child it doesn’t factor into anything. Anna’s mother does drugs and was found with them in her system when Anna was born. Anna is the product of a one night stand. We love her dearly and she’ll never know this. 

Anna’s mom has also failed to enroll her in school. She hasn’t been in, in almost two months. Since her mother moved (again)  she cannot even bother to enroll Anna in online schooling. 

We’re going to force the custody agreement. We’re going to stop paying for extras. We’re going to make sure all doctors know that Anna’s mom is legally responsible for medical expenses and ever so kindly give them her billing address. 

We’re going to watch her freak out about not being able to afford her bills. We’re going to watch her try to get cps out of her hair and the truancy officer. We’re going to fight for full custody to put Anna in a better situation. We’re going to pay Anna’s mom child support while she thinks she getting the last laugh thinking that we also have to pay the remainder of the bills.  

We’ll watch as she cannot afford these things and wonders how she’s going to get her drugs and get her child the things she needs. 

The sad thing is the prosecutor said we could file for full custody but we know Anna loves her mother and she would hate us. 

However this is the last straw and we’re done keeping the peace. Anna’s mom and my husband and I have literally had the conversation of all of this face to face and she still cannot get it or she doesn’t care. That’s fine because we cannot take anymore. 

Our daughter smells like smoke when she comes to us. She fights us with her words and her fists. She threatened her baby brother. She is violent towards others. She cannot even say her colors or count to ten. 

She needs someone who cares about her best interest in ten years from now. Not someone just looking to keep her happy. 

Her mom cannot count or form proper sentences on paper. At this rate Anna will be just like her mother and her mother is content with that. 

I am not. I have had it. I will fight this fight for everyone since no one seems to have the gull.",18Nov2020,3

285,"Basically, I (16F) have some very liberal parents who are anti-organized religion and I want to become a member of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints— aka the mormon church. So that’s... not great already. Also I know obviously w corona it’s not really safe to go to most churches so I understand that concern of theirs, but at this point they won’t let me go at all. They have said lots of things the church supposedly does and are very firm believers that I want to join a cult. 

I have trouble believing what they say to me and honestly I don’t think the majority of it is true. They make these wild accusations that I know for a fact are incorrect or that are misinformation. For example, they tell me time and time again that in the mormon church women are required to have a minimum of four kids and that if they don’t they are going to hell. I have no idea where they got this from, as no one in the church or in any scripture has ever said anything close to that. My dad told me recently that a prophet supposedly translated scripture using magic sunglasses.

I also spoke to several missionaries—out of my own curiosity, they didn’t approach me— and I loved hearing everything they had to say. They were wonderful and I could tell they genuinely cared about me. When I told my parents I was interested in all of this, they read all of my texts with them and made me send a text to them saying that I can’t communicate with them anymore. Then they made me block them and delete their numbers from my phone. This was very upsetting and I felt horrible and guilty that I had to do this. 

I feel very strongly about becoming a member and believe in the values and everything that their church preaches. I sincerely believe that they and their members are centered on love and that their only intent is to make others happy and to live righteously. I want to become part of a loving community and I want to make others happy and better myself. I can’t be baptized without parental consent until I am 18, so until I move out there’s not much I can do. I’m also afraid that if I ever need help in the future financially or otherwise they won’t give it to me if I’m in the church. What do I do?",18Nov2020,1

288,"I have been gunning for a promotion in my job (Company A) , i am not sure they will give it to me but this past year I have been recognized by the managers for excellent work and proactiveness .

I interviewed with a (Company B) yesterday and they were impressed , they said they will let me know in 5 days but the recruiter emailed me yesterday and said she needs to talk to me ASAP . I got a call today and they gave me an offer and specified that I am one of their best candidates and told me I was the first one to get an offer. 

The only goal I want is **to get a promotion** in my current job at Company A . Its litterally the best workplace i ever had , great manager , great staff , and great team . And the only reason why I applied to Company B is to 

- use an “offer” to be a catalyst of a “promotion” ,
and
- ~~gain exposure in hopes that the manager in Company B will think about me and reopen a previous corporate position that I applied for and got but due to Covid It was cut off~~ this is one of the reasons but i know I have to be lucky, basically , i want to put my name out there in hopes the manager from Company B see my name and pick it out .

Currently , I have the following :
- A job offer at Company B
- A proven track record and recognition from the managers about my performance at Company A
- i alluded on my last performance interview that I want to be “promoted”
- The manager is not really adverse to the fact of promoting me but to another department .
- Tenure , seniority and clout .


My approach is going to be 2 pronged :

- 1st Prong : Tell my manager that “I want to follow up with her that since i have been doing cery well , I want to get promoted , and “oh yeah” i have an outstanding offer from Company B but I really love to stay with Company A”

- 2nd Prong : Force Company B to do a counter offer . 

**Best Case** : If the first prong actually worked , then it solves the fact that I want a promotion and i got promoted .

**Okay Case** : If prong 2 worked , I get to see the counter offer and if it is high enough , i might go with them .


**Worst Case-A** : If neither worked , I get to keep my job , then ask for a promotion “again” on my next  evaluation .

**Worst Case-B** : They did a counter offer that is still way below my current pay . on which , i have to decline .

289,"Okay.. uh. I've been through a lot during the pandemic. And the least I could do is say that right now, is not a very great time. I have a deep voice, and I find it hard to have normal conversations without the person I'm talking to being like: ""Hm?"" or ""Say that one more time."" 

 And most of the time I don't like it. It's hard for me to make friends, it's hard for me to get attention from my peers and others (Mostly teachers.)

 I hate how I look, mostly no one would even think to interact with a person like me because, well, I believe I think they think I'm ugly or intimidating. I do _not_ like myself. I hate myself.

   So i have 2 friends. one ill call M and the other ill call T. M is kind of a shitty friend, not gonna lie. But our parents are friends and its hard to cut people out at 14, so i deal with it. Come over when he asks, etc. He says everything i have was give to me, which is a fair point i guess. ive never really worked and i dont do chores, but if my parents tell me to do something i do it, if its takig the trash out or whatnot. But most if not all of M’s things are given to him through christmas and stuff. however he does have chores so i think thats what he means. Anyways, right now, i have 2 hobbies. Biking and gaming. M also has the same hobbies. Recently, his parents gave him a 1500 dollar bike and a pc that costed about the same amount. Im happy for him, although its kind of ironic that he said everything i have was given to me, when just one of those things is probably worth more than everything i own/was given. Although i will say im happy for him, its not his fault he was given those things, i will admit im jealous. I keep it to myself, dont let it change what i do/say and i try my best to not let it bother me, but it does. Anyways, onto friend T. Hes a better friend i will admit, and we also have the same hobbies. He builds and sells pcs for some money, so he has a decent pc. That i not jealous about, i know he worked hard for it. But recently, his grandparents gave his family alot of money and he got around 2,000 dollar bike. Im happy for him, but again im jealous. It doesnt help that ive recently been working on my neighbors lawn and trying to save up money for a good bike and pc, i have a way cheaper bike and an xbox one. How do i not get jealous? Ive been trying to work and save up for these things and then both of my friends end up getting them for nothing. I know it probably isnt right to think like this, and thats why im here.

I've recently found out I had been diagnosed with language impairment when I younger from a guidance counselor, and when I asked my parents about this they didn't give much of a response and that all they said is I just need more help than other kids. 

That answer just made me want to die, and the more I think about it, the more it bothers me.

Why does it bother me? I never seen my parents try to help my lanuage impairment and now it feels like I'm no longer ""normal"" to society. Its insanely hard to communicate verbally, I stutter lots and I have a permanent congested voice.

Most of the time, I hear trauma as just being in a school shooting, which I feel sorry for anyone who has gone through extremely terrible situations.


But by google, it’s just a very affecting bad memory, and I have plenty, with 1 in particular I would like to share.


When I was in the 5th, I finally spoke out about how I felt to my teacher, and we scheduled a conference with my parents where they would talk about my health. My mom was chill during the conversation, BUT SHIT HIT THE FAN WHEN WE GOT HOME.

My parents started screaming at me, telling me that I was ungrateful, that I should be sent to Africa so that I’d know how lucky I was, and how I was selfish and entitled. They yelled how CPS was going to come and take me away, and how they’d go to jail, and how I’d be put on pills that’s turn me into a emotionless zombie.

It may not sound like much, but think about it. I was 11, I was in a super vulnerable position. I was having thoughts about not wanting to exist, and thinking I was worthless, and when I finally got the guts, I was screamed at, tears down my face (I’m crying just typing this), shamed by the people who were supposed to love and care about me.


Ever since that day, I’ve pretty much never told anybody except through Reddit. It’s had a long lasting impact on my ability to show “weakness” and pain.


So Reddit... do I have trauma, or is it just another case of bitchy?",18Nov2020,1

Years ago when I was 11 or 12 I went to a family gathering and I was sitting in my friends room, but little did I know her dad who was creeping up on me from the bathroom came to grope me near my breasts, hips and thighs and said very sexual things about them. Me being young didn’t know what else it could lead to. His daughter barged in the room and I’m so thankful she came, otherwise it would’ve ended differently. Although I am pretty much over it and know that what the uncle did was really fucking weird and to protect myself next time, I still feel a little scared to go near another middle aged uncle or old man except for my dad. 

I’ve visited his house after that about two times and now this will be my third. I think that each time I go I do go I get a little anxious. My boyfriend suggests I tell my mom (I’ve only opened up to my boyfriend, no one else) so that we do not have to communicate with them again but this family we’ve been very close with for years, and I come from a brown family where girls are meant to keep safe away from boys, and if they hear that this happened to me I will not be allowed out the house again. I’m getting really more anxious than ever and I have only three days before I might see this person again at another gathering (covid-restrictions of course).

307,"I'm sorry if this is long, but its currently 1 AM and I've had enough of this so I'm typing this out, and I'd appreciate some help. TLDR at the bottom


(Typing on phone) Before I start my story, I am 16 and here are the problems I'm having, and if anyone can give me advice on how to fix this, it would be a big deal to me since I've been dealing with this for years. Just to be clear, I've never slept in a room by myself.


It all began in 2nd grade when my friends kept talking about bloody Mary and kept telling me to do it and such. Now, that really freaked me out and that's when my trouble started. Back then, my whole family used to sleep in the same room since our ""house"" was 1 bedroom, a living room, kitchen and bathroom. There was a huge mirror in the room and we faced it every time we slept. I don't know if it was a nightmare because i was so scared of bloody Mary before going to sleep, or sleep paralysis but one night in 2nd grade I had either one of those of my image of Mary and was scared sh*tless.

 Also, ever since then I always had slight paranoia. A good few months after that I was too scared to stay in a room by myself even in daytime. If I didn't have my back directly on the wall, I would also look behind me, just in case, and 


I still do that, and yes, im scared of the dark. Also, if I woke up before anyone and tried going back to sleep I was too scared to since every time I closed my eyes my brain pictured the same Mary looking at me in front of my bed, not through the mirror though. I didnt really worry that much after that thought because until 6th grade because my whole family stayed in the same room but I was skeptical around mirrors ever since then. 

Before the end of 5th grade I started having sleep problems where I just could not sleep because I kept thinking about when I'm going to fall asleep. That problem ended however when I went to my home country over the summer and their I could sleep peacefully because every night I just dreaded being their so I didn't have much trouble keeping my thoughts away from that. 


After coming back from there at the beginning of 6th grade we moved into a new regular sized house (3 bedrooms, 1 bathroom, living room, kitchen, basement, dining room). My problem of keep thinking about sleeping went away and I wasn't scared to sleep either because for a few days I would sleep with my whole family. In those few days, my new friend from school kept telling me about lucid dreams and stuff, I was really hyped about that and then he said you can also get sleep paralysis from them.  I didn't know what it was but he told me. I was scared of that but I didn't think much of it, until I tried to lucid dream but got sleep paralysis instead. 


Ever since then I've been having sleep paralysis every few weeks but when I get sleep paralysis I don't feel or see any entities, its just ringing noise and vibration, which I usually shake myself of. Since my new house was 3 bedrooms, my brother and I had to sleep in a room together but I was too scared with just us two, so I made my dad sleep with us in our room every night. At this point I was still slightly paranoid in my day to day life but not scared to stay in a room by myself, and this continued until like 8th grade where I was comfortable enough to sleep only with my brother in the bed, but only when he wasn't sleeping. 

So I usually tried to sleep before him. He never had any of these problems, but it took a while for him to fall asleep. I think like halfway through 8th grade I was ready to sleep by myself on different beds, so we finally got single beds and we each slept on the opposite side of the room. We have the master room by the way. For like a year I could sleep by myself in the same room with my brother, but I still had some paranoia which usually led me to putting the blanket over myself or a pillow over my head too. The paranoia was also like if no one was upstairs and I was trying to go downstairs I feel like their would be something in one of those rooms waiting for me while I was trying to get downstairs and when walking down I would always look behind me. 


Fast forward to freshman year my non blood related aunt moved in with us from my home country and she needed one of our single beds since she could stay in the basement so my brother and I had to sleep on the same bed. At this point in my life my friends started making me watch horror movies on daily movie nights on discord (not horror every night but mostly). At this point because of those times my brother fell asleep before me my mind would picture the way I imagined Mary standing in front of my bed. I knew it wasn't real but I kept getting scared, but I would usually just pull over a blanket over me and a pillow and most of the times I would fall asleep. At this point I would most of the time fall asleep before my brother so it happened like 30 percent of the time.


Two years later (this year) beginning of junior year i started hanging out with my childhood friends again, we usually hang out on and off for a while. Every time we went to one of their houses and we were planning on watching something they always wanted to watch horror movies but to my protest they wouldn't listen so I'm usually forced to watch them. 


About a month ago my dad got me a new mattress so now we're back to the old way we used to go back to sleep, different beds but same room and I also have led lights because I'm scared of the dark, but its dimmed when I'm going to sleep. Problem is, now I'm like too terrified to go to sleep. Not only is my brother falling asleep faster than me now, but whenever he does, my mind keeps imagining this. And every time I think of a what I'd scenario, my mind pictures it too.


One day I tried holding my own and keep closing my eyes no matter what and I thought of it tapping on my blanket to mess with me or opening my blanket, my mind pictured it although it never happened irl. I used to shake this off years ago when trying to sleep but not anymore. 


One thing that amplified this is when I got sleep paralysis in the middle of the night when I woke up I usually shake it off but this time I wanted to see what would happen if I let it run its course and the vibration and ringing got really strong and I thought in my mind what the f*ck but somehow I actually spoke it so it kicked me out of the paralysis. it left me so shook that night that I just stayed up, which at that time it was like 4:50.


Now, the long story is almost over. Its gotten to the point where I go to my parents room but she gets annoyed and thinks I was just on my phone the whole time. It worked on and off and the nights that my mom said no, I stayed up till like 6 sometimes until it was sunrise when my dad wakes up and does morning meditation in my room. I'm typing this right now staying up until probably 6 again. But I won't even be able to sleep because of online school at 8. I also get scared easily, so please.


Now I don't have these problems when I'm distracted or thinking of something else. Its just the anxiety of me thinking it will happen. I can't even close my eyes in a room by myself without being scared, let alone try to get comfortable in a blanket over my whole body even in the day time now because I think something is there. Even now while I'm typing I keep looking to my mirror but nothings there.


I hope you guys get the gist now, I want to ask for help to a therapist or something but I don't know where or what kind of therapist I should be asking. Please, give some advice for me.

TLDR: sleep paralysis in 2nd grade led me to get scarred, get scared easily, skeptical around mirrors, and thinking their is bloody Mary trying to get me when I close my eyes.",18Nov2020,1

312,"Okay so let me start by saying I come from a very conservative family. 

My little sister was caught having sex in the high  school bathrooms. She was essentially shipped out over seas to stay with “family” for about 2 years. Of course my parents went with her and the family was separated for a while. But during that 2 year period where she was over seas, she was almost raped by her cousin. Shy of actually raping, she was verbally and physically abused (saying what he would do/groping and trying to actually take her clothes off). She tells one of her aunts who refused to say anything to ANYONE (wtf right?) but then eventually word got to my mom and other family members from that side about 3 months later. The majority of the family on that side blames my sister for the incident even though she was the victim. I had just found all this out about last year. 

My father is still oblivious. It was his idea to send her over seas back home to spend time with relatives and adopt a conservative culture. He would be crushed if he found out what had happened. Especially if I had to tell him. I keep trying to convince my mother and sister to speak up to him (my father is very dramatic but he’d never hit my mother or my sister) but they don’t want to and they encourage me to keep silent to. They think it’s to late to do anything about it. 

Today my father and sister had another argument. She had came back from her over seas stay and are negotiating the idea of trust and allowed permissions etc. you can tell she wants to tell him about the incident during their bickering about these permissions but she didn’t. 

 But my father picked up on that. He encouraged her to talk and she refused. I told her if she had something to say she should say it. She refused. The look in her eyes wanted me to say something and I almost did until my dad said something first. 
“If your mom knows something and is hiding it from me, I will divorce her.”
That stopped me in my tracks. Is it an empty threat? Maybe. I wouldn’t put it past him to do it though. 

I keep trying to have my mom tell him but both her and my sister refuse as they think there’s nothing that could be done. And they are right, but the emotional baggage is what concerns me. 
My sister is very defensive and will get triggered at any moment. She’s always victimizing herself in her speech. Maybe it’s a mental health issue but idk. 

I’m really looking for some advice. I’m thinking of just confronting my mom and dad in private next time they are together and letting them know what had happened between my sister and our cousin. Act as if I was the only person that knew (from my dads POV) completely surprising them both. 

My mom and sister want me to keep quite but I don’t think it’s fair to my dad or my sister as they are both seeing things from a different perspective and are unable to find common ground. Arguments with my sister happen every fucking day. It’s honestly tiring. 

What do you think? What would you do?

Thanks for your time.",18Nov2020,3
314,"I am a 19M who moved into a college dorm at the start of the semester. I had been hanging out with this one group of people and initially we got along well. I thought we were getting along fine but recently they have left me out of a lot of stuff. They asked my current roommate if he wanted to get an apartment with them, and he said no cause he was already getting one with someone else. They instead asked someone they don't talk to nearly as often as me. They were all hanging out the other night and I only found out cause my roommate told me. I have talked to my roommate and he is 100% that some of them just straight up don't like me and that I make them uncomfortable. Basically, I am a bit of a suck up and give compliments often because I thought that's how you could make people feel good. I also make unfunny obvious statements (if someone says ""I'm so tired"", I'll say ""there's a solution to that""). Or because I want to fit in I'll not think before speaking (""what's cotton candy made of, crystallized sugar?""). I wanted their approval for the longest time but honestly I know that I'm not going to get it and that I am never going to be part of that group. I thought I was getting close to people at the start of the year but as my roommate put it, I'm trying to be welcome in a group where I am unwelcome.

Whenever someone struggled making friends the answer is always ""get out there and talk to people!"" That's exactly what I did. It is a fault with me. I know j have self loathing issues and literally 0 self esteem. I think what went wrong is that bled through, depsite my efforts to hide it and my craving for apprival from other people to validate myself is what drove them away. I screwed up, and I won't be able to get that group back. I will likely be alone over break and depressed about this for a while. The fault is my personality, my stupid obvious statements, my sucky up-ness because if my lack of confidence. I'm not someone people want to be around and I need to basically entirely redo my personality. How do I redo make personality? 

One of the guys in the group was really into music. The group consisted of about 8 ppl and 2-3 dislike me. So, as a result I can't be with the rest. This guy was one of the others. I can't listen to music anymore because I get depressed thinking about the group I lost and that I most likely will never be a part of. I can't help but hold onto this gain hope that I'll be a part of it someday but I know that's dumb. How do I move on?",18Nov2020,3
315,"Hello, the title kinda already states everything you need to know but here's a longer version.

4 years ago I started an apprenticeship which I thought I'd like. After 1-2 years I decided that this is not for me. I absolutely hate it, the stuff I do and the place I do it at. Mentally, it's eating me up and I don't know if I can continue doing this without going completely insane.

About a year ago I discovered something I like doing but it's not easy (I can't state what it is for privacy reasons). Only few people succeed at it but once you succeed, you're basically free (financially and geographically). I really do believe that, if I quit this apprenticeship that I hate, I could completely focus on that and eventually succeed.

Of course, there's a tiny voice telling me that this is a bad idea so that's why I'm looking for advice here.",18Nov2020,1
316,"Since the beginning of “quarantine” in the US (for me it’s been March), I’ve been itching to move abroad to study, work, and experience newness in my life for personal growth. I have done/continue to do a lot to prepare my mental state, emotional state, and physical state for change; thankfully I have a lot of practice in this area as I’ve moved with my family and alone various times. Where I’ve hit a little roadblock is my application to university was denied.

This small part of a bigger plan to move to another country, start fresh, and just live authentically to my aspirations has given me pause. I am a determined, intelligent, and capable 22y/old being and amongst this all - typically enthusiastic and optimistic about things working out in the end. I guess I’m just feeling sort of halted in my efforts for as much as I’ve worked towards this move in the past 9mos.

I know deep down, I feel it in my gut, that things will work themselves out. I’m applying and reaching out to people at various INGOs of the country I’m interested in moving to and just really doing as much as I can to be ready.

Ig what I’m having trouble with is understanding how to not just know that I’m doing the best that I can, but to feel that things are happening as they need to. I know a lot of this is in the challenge of being a young adult and finding my purpose outside of what I might have thought it to be previously. The other part is dealing with the frustrations of mental health being torn in by this pandemic, social justice issues in the US, and general empathy that I’ve been feeling for the hurt of the world.

It’s all sorta pressing now and important to me that I get a move on things before the end of the year as winter time causes a lot of strife with SAD for me.

TLDR: I was denied application to a university abroad and am trying to figure out how I’m gonna make it there while not losing hope in the meantime.",18Nov2020,3

318,"I was rehired a little over a month ago after being asked to come back to work for a company I left 10 years ago. My now supervisor (previously respected  coworker/different branch) was part of a group that petitioned for my return because of my past performance in this position (I know, way too many p words right there to take me seriously now). There are a lot of things I’m struggling with under her rule but my intent isn’t to bash her and I genuinely want some perspective. 

So, I have a great reputation in my industry for my experience, my work ethic and dependability , and especially for my organizational/management skills. I’m proud of that, I’ve worked my ass off for that, I’ve dealt with a lot for that. With that said, I get that my situation, or perceived situation, is quite possibly just my ego getting checked...  but my supervisor insists that I cc her on everything including texts so that she “knows that it got done”. She also will assign or ask if I want to do a task, which I always happily agree to, and then she completes those tasks herself while I’m working on them. It makes things incredibly confusing. This has been the constant since I started, her telling me what I’m to do and then not allowing me to follow through with it. When she asked why I’d left her off a text I send out every night to my department, the same message she IS included on that goes to their email every night, I asked her again why she needed that. I told her how it made me feel, why it makes me feel that way, and her response was “I’m the supervisor” “I’m still part of the team” “I’m just making sure things get done” and that I “have now given her anxiety”. She did ask if we needed to talk but in that moment her dramatic response felt like the straw that was going to break my ability to keep my frustrations in check so I told her no, that I was good. 

What’s the situation? I’m not picking up a maybe I should self reflect vibe from her. Is the problem my ego? How can I adjust or fix this? Working under her supervision makes me feel terrible. I spent my savings moving to take this job, this job that I now hate going to.",18Nov2020,2

322,"I don't know if I'm overreacting or if I have a good reason to feel this way. I'm 36, my boyfriend is 40 and his daughter is 19. We have been together for nearly a year and have known each other for several years. Her mom is out of the picture and he has raised her mostly as a single parent, with the help of his parents. He's a great dad and I admire  how well he's done as a single father, but boy is that girl spoiled and clingy. She gets all his attention and I feel like chopped liver. He spends so much money on her. If he has the money since she's an only child then I guess why not, but it's over the top and I can't help but feel jealous thinking about how he's never done the same for me. I get that she's his daughter and more special, but she's an adult. I'm trying to get serious with him and hopefully get married but it's hard when I feel like the third wheel ugly step mother figure. I don't know how to explain it but it's like he's afraid of his daughter and he lets her boss him around and make all of the decisions because he's so scared of upsetting her. She's always gotten away with anything because I don't think he's ever known how to discipline her. He's too scared of getting on her bad side. He's a police officer so you wouldn't think he would be so afraid of his own daughter. He just bought her a brand new car that she kept hinting she wanted even though her other one was fine and I've lost track of how many of her vacations he has paid for. She doesn't live with him anymore but his schedule still revolves around her and he basically has to run it by her whenever we try to make plans. It's already hard enough making plans with his work schedule and the last thing I want is his grown daughter interfering. They have certain nights where they go to the gym together and there's absolutely no way he'll adjust that at all for me, despite the fact that we hardly see each other. I've kind of tried talking to him about how I feel and he brushes me off or makes me feel like the bad guy and I really don't know what to do. I want a future  with him but I feel like his daughter is literally in the way

323,"I need some advice. I just ranted to one of my friends but its getting worse. Basically let me set the scenario Im fucking fed up and tired of my father. Hes manipulative, has high bloodpressure and is a nicotine abuser to the point where I confronted him about it and he started shaking, freaking out and almost had a heart attack. he's 6'3 around 345 pounds and in his late 50's. Im 18 years old,  6'5 around 390-400 lbs which isn't healthy and ill agree but I am also extremely strong though my physique is more on the obese side and I realize that. At this point, My father will not talk to me about anything in my life, interests, friends, family. The only thing he will talk to me about is school and my weight. Its at the point where If I say I'm done with school work he asks if I've gone on a walk to which I know they don't do jack squat for loosing weight and I say no then he kicks me out. Last week my parents started a lean diet of ordering a shit ton of bread, breaded chicken and eating garbage like meatloaf, enchiladas with extra sour cream and ordering 2 bags of doritos and this unhealthy shit. After talking to my best friend he helped me plan out a couple meals I can constantly repeat. I told this to my parents and that my weightloss journey is going to be on my own and something I need to do. Instantly my dad shut me down and said ""fuck no your not, your mother and I have stuff planned for you to eat and tomorrow you will go on a walk or we will sell your car."" for background info I put the downpayment on my car but my parents wanted something above 25K so I couldn't sign for it and I can't get my savings out of their account which I couldn't sue them because I was a minor. I don't wanna take my parents to court. I do not want to add the load of my fathers loosing weight I think its bullshit that not only do I have to manage myself but manage him aswell and if I fuck his diet or anything up its MY fault not his. What should I do to tell him that this is something I will do for myself and I need some freedom here. because I told him exactly that and he said ""You will not loose weight without me because I need you"". Also idk if this helps but back in 6th grade he forced me to go to a gym and work out with him, I fucking hated it because he would say ""Im not feeling well,"" sit on a bike and drink mountain dew or Gatorade while I was working my ass off getting judged by him, and we got into so many arguments about it. I've tried going to a gym but because of covid I'm not allowed out of the house because he's high risk, I'm basically trapped at home with no options but to commit suicide or walk my self to boredom and death while they shove food down me. Oh yeah if I skip a meal he diables the power to my room. And even if i go outside to turn the power breaker on for my room, he has my computer and wifi disabled so all I'm able to do is lay in bed waiting for another day. I've started sleeping more because the only source of income is through a stupid game at my school because they've blocked me from getting a job and also hid my car keys for attempting to sign up with doordash.

She’s a senior and a couple years older than me but from the look of it so far we get along great in person, although my texting skills are extremely subpar. I’m the kind of guy who is extremely nerdy but I’m able to be charming and cute, and I enjoy giving support to my partner and making sure they feel appreciated, loved, and that can feel open to talk to me if they need anything.

I’ve been struggling with anxiety and depression for a while, and I’m pretty comfortable with myself, but I’m just concerned with how I appear towards others (I know it’s fucked and not important but I’ve always been concerned with it). I really like this girl and I hope that we can have a future down the line since we have a lot in common, and we have similar outlooks on life. 

Anyways, she’s staying tomorrow night and I’m planning on making her breakfast in bed but I also want to spruce it up a bit and write a cute little note telling her that I appreciate getting to spend time with her and that I really like her (she already knows that I really like her). 

I feel like I’m different from a lot of people my age and I’m concerned that I might not be cool enough for her and maybe coming off a bit too romantic or like 8th grade crush-like.

As the title says, I do this because (as these have all happened while I’m still young) I think it’s very unlikely that anything remotely long-term would come of these, so I don’t see a reason to waste the time. 

I’ve acted this way since elementary school, and I realized why I did it in middle school. Then, a little while ago a friend of mine pointed out how I’ve never had a relationship, and so I explained my thoughts to him, and he said that it’s unhealthy for me to think that way, also adding that I can never really be sure, which I do for the most part agree with.

333,"Hi all, I am new to this but felt like this is a community I could go to for help. 

I’m a student that has saved for the past 9 years, with my intention of doing my undergraduate degree. I come from a family that’s not well off, and I never expected them to pay for my education. As a result, I’m 30 years old and much older than the usual university population. 

Last year I applied and managed to get into my dream university, king’s college in London. I managed to get a partial scholarship with a partial accommodation subsidy as well. This is really like a dream come true for me because I’ve been saving up for so long and worked really hard to get here. Due to covid-19, the University start date was pushed from September to a January. 

However, the king’s colleges dorms are full, but they extended my accommodation subsidy to a selection of their joint dorms with other universities. I found out today that the place that was given to me is under this area called Stratford, London, where they built up for the 2012 Olympics, but after much research, a lot of people don’t recommend living there due to the safety. It used to be what they consider as a bad part of town, and is slowly / potentially on the rise. I’m a petite girl at 145cm, and I’m worried that sometimes classes end late, or a part time job I might in the future may require me to go home late. As a result I am worried about my safety. 

Does anyone have advice on whether I should go ahead with this accommodation or struggle to find my own place in a place in a a country I haven’t been to before? Happy to hear alternative suggestions as well. If anyone has been or lived in Stratford, London, I would love to hear what your thoughts are too.

The reason why I am keen on the dorms is because my housing subsidy is about half the fees, making it very affordable on my savings. Plus it is only 30 minutes away from school by train. 

The dorm itself is very great and very nice, being rather new. However, a lot of sources say online that it’s one of the “biggest sh**holes” in London 🤣

I am feeling super isolated and having trouble making new friends and staying mentally healthy at university this year (classes all online, only one of my friends from last year lives in town). I am starting to think about moving back home, but I am not sure if my motivations stem from wanting to get back with this guy?

I've known this guy for three years, and we have always been very close friends. He knows pretty much everything about me, and is simply the greatest- funny, caring, amazing cook, intelligent, interesting, just wonderful. We finally got together this summer while living together. We were only together for about a month, but it was a great time.

When August rolled around, I headed back to university (in a different country) primarily for a job, even though my classes are remote. We talked and both agreed that distance wasn't a good idea... but I was very surprised by how much we stayed in contact. Even now, we are still talking everyday, though things have been tapering off.

I've honestly missed him like crazy, and do want to give things a shot. Moving would potentially jeopardize my job here, but I can still take all of my classes remotely, and can easily line up work back home (which would also be more relevant to my future career). I have other friends there too, and would potentially be able to live with roommates which would be great for me since I am currently living in a studio and hating it. Not to mention, my family is there as well.

I'm worried though that he might not feel the same way/want to be more than friends now. Going back, I would at least get my answer, but I just don't want to come off as pathetic for making a decision like this.

343,"TW: pedophilia, sexual assault, child abuse

This is very hard for me to write, let alone reach out to potentially thousands of strangers. But this has been bothering me for years and I need advice. 

My best friend of 12 years is one of the most important people in my life. They’re incredibly smart, caring, understanding, and supportive. We go to each other for everything and anything that happens in our lives, including the traumatic incidents. They have shared with me that they were molested as a child by a male family member who has since passed away, and obviously that messed them up pretty bad. They have an incredibly abusive family that still emotionally and verbally abuses them to this day. 

Last year I learned my friend had a massive crush on someone who was 14 when they were 18. I learned that my friend was manipulative to this younger person in an attempt to have them like them to have a relationship. 4 years isn’t much of an age difference, but personally I think it matters in that age bracket. 

Since then I’ve realized my friend is usually more attracted to those much younger than them. I brushed it off since it seemed harmless at the time. 

My friend started dating someone around 4 years ago, and they just got married last year. Their partner has a daughter who was 3 when they met, and is now 7. Almost immediately my friend took the parenting role of the child and quickly became very responsible for her. Over the years my friend has told me that the child would have odd rashes on or near her genitals when she’d come to visit them, and sometimes she’d be complaining of burning or itching in the same area. This was alarming but nothing more was done outside of regular treatments with various ointments. 

Today, they took the child to urgent care because she was complaining of burning when she peed. The doctor (male) apparently said that there was a protein in her urine that indicated something was “sore or hurting”. This is what my friend told me, and honestly, that doesn’t make any sense. I’m not a doctor but I’ve worked in healthcare for 6 years and have personally had UTI’s and treated patients for them, and I’ve never heard about a protein being able to detect if the genitalia is sore or hurting. I could be wrong, or my friend could have explained it to me wrong, but regardless, the doctor performed a vaginal exam. The doctor discovered a bruise on the opening to her vagina. He tested her for STDs and apparently when he swabbed her she completely freaked out and started screaming and pushing away. 

The thought of this happening to this child makes me ill. And the fact that I’m suspicious of my friend for it makes me feel ashamed and guilty. 

I know my friend very well. I know how manipulative they can be and I know how smart they are. They have studied psychology and sociology and have worked with young children all of their adult life. I also have a very strong intuition that is usually correct (though obviously, not always). 

I asked my friend if there is going to be an investigation into all of the child’s parents and homes, but they said they aren’t sure. They said they are waiting for the STD results and then going to see their primary doctor. I told them that even if the STD panel is negative, that doesn’t mean she wasn’t assaulted, and they ignored me. I know this is an extremely sensitive thing to talk about but I felt it was important that they knew that. 

A few hours after the child was at the urgent care, my friend sends me a photo of the child, completely naked in a bath tub, with the caption “pink bath water”. This made me feel uncomfortable, especially since we think the child is being assaulted, and especially because she’s 7 and to me, that’s a little old to be photographing naked and sending to people. They told me “oh I forgot you’re not around kids a lot so you’re more uncomfy seeing naked babies”. Am I wrong for thinking 7 is too old to be photographing naked and sending to people?

Am I wrong for thinking my friend is a pedophile and/or sexually assaulting their step daughter? 

I tried to only keep relevant information in this post. I don’t know the child’s other parents well enough to lay suspicion, but my friend hasn’t expressed any concern that they’re assaulting her. 

What should I do?",18Nov2020,372
345,"I’m in college and for the past week now my roommate has been staying up until after midnight with the desk light on (which fills up the whole room with light) to study/take notes etc. She’s done this in the past where she’ll maybe stay up until about 10:30 and in the past when she notices me going to bed (usually around 9-10) she’ll ask if it’s okay to keep the light on and in the past I’ve said it’s okay because I know she’ll usually be done around 10:30. But this week she has been doing it until after 12am and I haven’t really been able to sleep while the light is on and she doesn’t ask me anymore if it’s okay to leave it on. Also I know she has a bunch of midterms coming up so I’m not sure if it’s rude to ask her to go somewhere else to study. I usually have work days that vary between five to nine hours and have to get up at 7:30 every morning so it’s been affecting my energy levels over the past few days, I’m too nice to say anything and also scared she’s going to be mad at me if I ask now after not minding her doing it for the entire year what should I do?",18Nov2020,2
347,"AITA for not wanting to be involved with someone who left chocolate on my coffee table that my puppy ate.

I (29m) was having C (28f) watch my dog while I was working late tonight. C decided to bring a ghirdelli chocolate bar over to my apartment when she was watching my puppy. She fed my dog her dinner around 8pm and she was hanging out on the couch until about 11pm. I came home at 1130 to find packaging torn apart all over my living room floor with my puppy laying on the floor in obvious distress. I called C to ask what it was she told me how she had left a chocolate bar on the coffee table in the area where the puppy stays. She then told me that she didn’t think that the dog would eat the chocolate because it’s poisonous to dogs. Now I am at the emergency vet hospital getting her treated, when I told C that I was bringing her to the hospital that I wasn’t mad nor did I yell at her when I called to ask what she ate. Now I’m on the phone with the vet and poison control while my puppy gets treatment all said and done the cost will be around 400 dollars.I asked C if she was ok with paying for the deductible of 75 dollars for the whole situation. I do have pet insurance so the cost isn’t an issue and I’ll gladly pay the money to make sure that my dog is safe. Now the part that is tricky is that C and I have been dating but not in a relationship yet, for about a month and a half. She also started to argue with me that she shouldn’t have to pay for the vet because, “ I should have trained my puppy to not eat chocolate”. She also told me that she never had a dog before so she didn’t know that dogs will eat anything. C is working as a teacher and is finically stable so 75 dollars isn’t a huge amount of money in this situation. AITA for asking her to drop my key off tomorrow and telling her that I don’t feel comfortable with her watching my dog. I don’t really want to be involved with her anymore at this point if she can’t see the issue with how she reacted. So AITA for not wanting to date someone who isn’t willing to be accountable for her actions?

348,"This is my first time using reddit, literally ever. Ok, so my problem is that I suspect that this boy likes me. And I kinda suspect that I like him back, but I'm the kind of person who really needs confirmation for that kinda shit. Anyway, he's like one of my two best friends, and I went to his house with my other best friend so we could all hang out. Long story short we took a lot of shots and we were all pretty drunk. We were all laying in bed and talking and someone the topic of love interest was brought up. My other bff and I were both like ""nah, we don't like anyone"". But this guy, my guy best friend was like ""No, not really. Except for this one girl"". So we started asking about her to try to see if we knew her. He said that she would never like him back, that they had a lot in common, and that she lives in our town and goes to our school, and that we know her. Now, let me tell you, I know this guy very well, he doesn't have very much in common with any girls but me, my other bff, and one of his friends sisters who has graduated and has a bf. So he either likes me or my friend, I'm convinced of this. I just want to know. I've been in love with this boy before. Like seriously in love.

352,"Should I be worried of being charged

I’m in Indiana. At the beginning of the year I met a girl named Lexi in class. We go on a date and have sex after. The next night we sleep together but no sex. In morning I attempted to initiate sex. She says no a few times while giggling and biting my neck and ear. I attempt to take her shorts off but she pulls them up very quickly. I get the point very quickly. (Btw that was the second I had ever had sex in my life and I now would stop immediately when a girl says no.) I go home and she texts me how she was raped in past and it was giving her flashbacks. She says she doesn’t want to stop seeing me and I should come drink later that night. I come back and we start drinking. Two other guys come by and she sits on one of the guys laps and is nuzzling his neck. I get pissed off and attempt to pull her into the hallway. She stays in room and I’m locked out. I’m very drunk at this point and attempt to drive home but my friend comes get me. Over the next week I keep calling to get my 100 sweat shirt and hat. I eventually just go to her dorm and bang on door and I get my shit. She pretty much was just telling everyone I’m psycho. It’s been nearly a year and I still worry she’ll falsely accuse me of rape or something. Is there something I should do?",18Nov2020,2

354,"I am 22M and I think I have trust issues but I don’t know why or how to improve. Here is a list of my behaviors that led me to believe I have trust issues:
-I worry that something is wrong when my gf does not respond quickly or wants time to herself or, in general, does not give a satisfactory level of affection
-I worry that I am not interesting/exciting enough for my gf and she will leave me when she realizes it
-I get jealous when my gf talks about past relationships or sexual experiences
-I do not want to look at pictures of my gf because I feel as though she has already betrayed me and it hurts to look at them
-I am afraid to say no
-I can get offended by obviously playful teasing
-I worry that my gf complains about me to her friends

I would like to point out that I seem like I am an emotional wreck when I list all of these bad qualities so bluntly. Most of these behaviors are mild, occasional, and internalized. But these behaviors are not justified whatsoever in my current relationship. She is 22F, we have been dating over 2 months. I have never felt comfortable revealing so much personal information to anyone as I have with her. She has said she loves me. She has said many things to imply that she believes we will be together for a long. And she has been the opposite of suspicious or sketchy (lets me know what she is up to, is not protective of her phone, etc). 

I want to love her back very badly, but for some reason I feel like I cannot even though she is the type of girl I was looking for and I think its because I have trust issues. I don’t know why I have trust issues though. I can think of two possibilities only: 1.) when i was 16 my first gf who i deeply loved cheated on me but I think I am long over that, and 2.) growing up I was always one of the uglier, less hygienic, annoying kids with no friends. I think that may have caused me to continue to feel undesirable into adulthood and never truly believe any girl who claims they desire me now unless I am very clearly much more attractive than they.

356,"hey there! this is kind of a dumb post.. honestly, i think i’m posting too much on this sub, haha. sorry about that! thank you though, everyone here has really great advice to give, and i’ll try to give some of my own. its really helped me.

well then, getting into my problem; i got diagnosed with depression months ago and since then have been trying to remember when i was last happy, and what made me lose that, and i think i’ve pinpointed one of the causes.

back in winter of 2017, the last time i felt genuinely happy, i lived in germany. i was honestly mad, having to move out to a city for a bit where i didn’t even speak the language, bored with the lack of things to do that i would’ve done at home. spending my days there gushing over my favorite series. missing my friends and growing irritated with my family. confused with the language barrier and all these new sights, yet admiring some of them. mainly negative emotions, but they didn’t make me feel ‘sad’. at least, not in the way now. 

in particular, looking back at the the time there, i get this weird feeling i can’t put into words. it’s not nostalgia, but it’s something along those lines, albeit a little more melancholic. even if it’s not something ‘positive’ to feel, i really do miss it. 

ever since then, i’ve returned to my home country, but i started to become a lot more apathetic. i’m not saying that moving countries has made me depressed, but i miss being there. nowadays, it’s the same routine; i’m in my last year of school, but even once i leave, things will stay the same. no city sights, only a decaying town. no confusion, or even a language barrier to make things just a little bit more interesting, just the same old routine. apathetic to any of my interests, spending my days obsessing over what people think of me. 

i can’t put the emotion(s) that i felt there into words, but i really miss it. feeling sad is so much better than feeling nothing at all. is there any way i can at least try to bring back this feeling? i don’t want to live in the past but if i can at least try to bring back how i felt to make me feel like i can spend my last days at school with a little bit of excitement. i know this is a weird post and i can’t really explain myself, but any advice would help",18Nov2020,2

anyway, this is kind of all over the place for me. its 3am, im in my off-campus apartment at a large university. i have it good, the guy that ive ever felt the most genuine connection to is sleeping soundly next to me. i am so beyond grateful. 

my university has had its fair share of suicides every year &amp; its tragic. however, there have been 4 suicides in this fall semester ALONE &amp; our university does absolutely nothing about it. its so important for them to speak out about this ongoing issue but  the school turns a blind eye. the argument is that announcing news of student suicide may promote or trigger more suicides. however, i think the school has a moral obligation to provide adequate aid to its students and properly address the issue instead of pretending like they dont exist. when i read about the 4th suicide tonight i was absolutely heartbroken. not only for this poor student who felt so trapped that their only way out was to cease to exist, but that three others have happend before this &amp; i had not heard a peep about any of them. no official statements from the school... nothing. i was super distraught after learning about the tragedy &amp; i tuned out the movie i was watching with my friends &amp; eventually went into my room. 

i see the kid who has understood me better than anyone else ever had &amp; care for me more than anyone else in my bed. absolutely nothing in the world fucking matters right now. im so grateful for him and i cannot appreciate him enough. i think of how i wished the people who took their life at my school all had relationships with someone in their life like mine. i wonder if that would be a solution to their pain, i wish they felt like they were understood, cared for &amp; loved. tell your loved ones you love them often, your friends &amp; family. dont ever take that shit for granted. love harder than you ever thought possible bc when it ends, nothing fucking matters anymore.",18Nov2020,2

About 5 years have gone by now since we last saw each other and I recently ran into her coincidentally. She told me how she had started her own small business as a life coach. A few weeks ago she contacted me saying how she’s been thinking of me and if I’d be interested in supporting her business and joining her program where I’d get coached by her. She truly believes I could benefit from it. I believe I can benefit from it as well. However, what is stopping me from supporting her business is, I feel I will now become “client zoned” in a way (almost like “friend zoned”, but in this case “client zoned”). I feel like there will now be a set boundary between her and I that we cannot cross. I feel she will then view me as her client and not as a potential romantic partner.

363,"Since I was little, me and my relatives' ears bleed whenever my dad gets a hold of a microphone to sing. Here in my country (Philippines) it's a norm to rent a videoke machine for occasions like birthdays (even funeral wakes). So naturally, the whole neighborhood would know you're celebrating something because someone rented a videoke machine, and someone is singing. 

Unfortunately, my neighbor has a LOT of children and never runs out of reason to rent a videoke. And much more unfortunately, my dad, who thinks he's a Western singer, would grab any opportunity to sing in a microphone for everyone to hear. He prefers to sing English songs, he hates songs in our own language. I conspire that he's a narcissist. He would never take any criticism and avoids confrontation a lot. He's delusional and thinks he would also make a great president. He's also a Trump supporter if that helps. 

I can't really describe his singing. It always sounds like one of his veins would pop anytime. He's not even in sync with the instrumental of the song. Imagine a cringe compilation of American Idol auditions combined. That's my dad. I feel sorry for everyone within the mile radius whenever my dad is singing in a videoke. He's singing outside as I type this and feel embarrassed and enraged at the same time. Any ideas how to gently confront my dad without him being mad about it? I don't want to cause trouble.

365,"TL:DR; Recent outbursts of rage that I need to control before I continue down this path and hurt someone. Unsure where to start.

Two weeks ago I snapped at my ex girlfriend. Said some mean things that I can't really take back. I didn't even know how awful they were until she told me about them a week later. I really do still love her and it hurts that I was able to do this to her. It really doesn't sound like me.

Fast forward to tonight and I've been going back and forth with therapy and a psychiatrist over the last two weeks. My psychiatrist put me on lamotrigine (it's only been 4 days now) to handle some of my depression and my therapist has just been talking with me about my mental state but we've only really just done the introduction appointment. My next apt is on Thursday.

Anyways, I'm a pretty calm and collected guy 24(m). My friends can say they've never seen me mad. But the first time I snapped at my ex I also forgot what I said. She stonewalled me and I wanted her to keep talking to me and I think once I lost that sense of control then I really just let go. And this last time I yelled at her was when she was leaving me, for good. And I really want to make sure I never do that to her or to anyone every again. Nobody deserves that.

I'm not sure what's wrong with me, and if this is something that I've had but never had a breaking point or this is something new. It's kind of like when you hear a new word for the first time and you're not sure if it's just being said more or because you just learned what the word means.

I'm really confused and really alone. I think quarantine has helped me learn a lot about myself for the better but all I know is that this all seems new to me and I need to find a way of managing my anger before it happens.

What are some things I can do day to day to deal with this impulsive and explosive anger?",18Nov2020,1

I want to scream. I don't want to end my life but I rather want to reset my life. I don't even know what this is called.. not that it needs a label.

368,"This is partially for my own benefit as I spend the vast majority of my time alone in a house and this is the first time I'm really fully recognizing any of these things, none of my family have any clue about any of this and I dont really feel comfortable telling them. I dont know why but it just feels better to write this stuff down somewhere

I dont even know where to start. I guess I'll start where this all began(where I think it began)

Also, its gonna be really hard to describe specifically every scenario in wich I get paranoid, so be prepared for really long possibly nonsensical descriptions.

Growing up, from a very young age I had a very morbid curiosity and loved looking up both real and fictional dark stories, and throughout my childhood I've seen, heard and heard about some pretty Terrible stuff

I've seen people burned alive, the Dagestan massacre, a dude mauled by a bear, multiple dudes who shot themselves, multiple dudes who've fallen off of high places both on purpose and accident, all sorts of workplace accidents ect and I've heard multiple death screams, final words, tragic or disturbing 911 calls, a very disturbing audio tape from a really messed up kidnapper, and all sorts of horror stories both fictional and real

Essentially growing up I saw and heard a lot of stuff that most people would consider pretty messed up, I never remember having significant reactions to any of these, and I didn't even have any nightmares directly related to any of them and other than what I'm about to talk about I dont seem to have been affected in any other way from these

So onto my issue, I'm really really paranoid, sometimes to dangerous levels

The most common issue I have with paranoia is when I'm alone. I really really hate being alone, like not that I need other people with me all the time, I'm fine if someone else is on another floor on the other side of the house as long as there is someone else in the house. This isn't something I tell my family because I just dont feel comfortable saying it

Essentially when I'm alone and its bright out I'm pretty ok, I can function as a normal human making myself food, cleaning, doing homework ect however when it gets dark I usually stay either in my room or on the couch, both of these are because I cant comfortably sit with my back to an open space. Not that I'm slightly uncomfortable with sitting with my back to an open space(or window) its that I literally cant, I can not force myself to do it and I dont want to even try, I immediately can not think of anything but crazed machete wielding killers coming up behind me or eldritch abominations sneaking up to me, that's not an exaggeration, I will literally spend any amount of time that my back is facing an open area imagining horrific scenarios and very detailed monsters. 

Essentially one of the worst times for me is when I'm alone in a dark house, I'm sure this isn't to odd but It really gets to paralyzing levels of fear a lot of times

I get paranoid in my bedroom, I never have and probably never will sleep with my back to the door, I cant sleep with the closet open(probably common) and I cant sleep with an uncovered window. Infact right now as I'm writing this, its 3 AM and I'm terrified of a creaking noise outside my room. I've been having a really hard time sleeping because I literally have a hard time closing my eyes because I'm afraid something will use it to sneak up on me, I also occasionally imagine distant voices, usually they range from vaguely distressed to a bunch of distant screaming voices(although that was just one pretty bad night) 

The whole voices thing is really rare and only happens when I'm really really paranoid, and it usually happens when I'm tired in bed

In general I have a really hard time sleeping, especially recently as I am constantly afraid of every noise and I'm constantly imagining someone or something comming in through the windows, closet or door

I also have a hard time with paranoia about just freak accidents, I'm afraid of just choking to death when I'm alone, I spend a lot of time imagining freak accidents

Even when people are around and its light out I sometimes get paranoid of someone just breaking in or a freak accident, but its faaaaar less common when people are around

It has been an issue before when I have been driving at night where I have issues keeping my eyes on the road because I'm constantly watching the back seat however this hasn't been an issue since I've started making sure to check the back seat and trunk before I drive 

When I'm home alone I usually always keep my two big dogs by my side, wich definitely helps, it's far better with them than without however it doesn't completely remove my paranoia, I still often imagine a crazed hobo sprinting at me from somewhere inside the house with a machete or kidnappers Rushing in to kidnap me. 

I'm also constantly paranoid about the people I know, my father spends the vast majority of the day and night driving around for his job and I'm constantly afraid I'll just get a call that he crashed, my brother spends a ton of time alone in his room and I'm constantly afraid every time I haven't seen ot heard from him for even a short amount of time that when I check on him I'll find that he has choked to death


Again I cant really specify every situation and way that I get paranoid but essentially I spend a lot of my day and night afraid of freak accidents and murders/monsters, its especially bad when I'm home alone(the vast majority of my time) and when it's dark

Its starting to cause a lot of issues, well it has been for a while but its getting really bad now. I barely get any sleep because I'm literally afraid to close my eyes wich is hurting my grades

It's now about 3:17 AM as I write this and I'm really tired and I have a hard time properly formulating my thoughts so if you got any questions feel free to ask and I'll be happy to specify but yeah I have some things that kinda help like my dogs and checking the car before I drive but other than that it's still a pretty big issue and I'm not sure what to do",18Nov2020,1

373,"Sorry this is really long, I just feel..lost

I'm 17, and I don't know if I really feel things. Things that happen to other people are such big deals to them but to me it's whatever. 

I'm smart but good grades are hard to come by, I can't concentrate and my friends tell me I have inconcistent personalities. They say that my eyes look like I don't have any empathy in them, and their right, I feel pity in place of empathy except for children. 

My head is always spinning and I cant stay on one train of thought. I talk to fast and move to fast for anyone I have interacted with, if I'm not being the funny one I'm too exhausting to be around. I feel exhausted myself. 

I want to take a bat to someone's face sometimes, I don't care who. 

I'm scared of being myself around anyone except close friends because I'm afraid I will scare them with the strength of my personality. I usually end up taking leadership roles but I have to put myself on a leash so I don't slap someone for taking so long on a menial task. I'm constantly frustrated when working with others because they move so slow. People are afraid to give me feedback even though I have never outwardly shown my anger. It's frustrating because I can see on their face they have something to say. I'm tired of being around kids without backbones. 

Everyday is the same especially because of covid. There is no structure to my day yet there still isn't any variation. I feel like I'm in a loop. I used to think that solipsism waa a crazy idea but now I'm starting to connect with it more and more. 

I have university applications coming up and I don't feel a thing, all my peers are stressed up the wazoo but I'm more or less apathetic - even though I say I'm passionate about my favourite career paths I feel like even though I want to pursue it, I would rather go to sleep instead and live in my dreams. 

My dreams, I look forward to the night so I can go to sleep and dream again. I know it sounds cheesy but it's true.

Nobody has expectations of me except me, I crush myself with the. And stress myself out. I tell myself I'm worthless if I can't meet my goals and I always move the yardstick forward before I cross them. My parents say I expect too much of myself but I only have one life, I want to do everything, i want to get good grades,I want to continue my charity work, I want to do more volunteering, I want to continue my business, I want to keep doing everything and more. 

I have anxiety attacks when I'm not doing anything, I'm not entertained by videogames anymore and I feel like I'm only playing them to hold onto the little innocence I have left. 

Everything seems so close but out of reach, everything I do feels second class, every compliment I get feels like a backhanded insult. I've turned down everyone who's approached me romantically because I'm afraid I'll hurt their feelings. I want to drive a pencil through my skull when I speak with people who are my age.

One time I woke up from a euphoric dream and was legitimately depressed for the next month. It's been so long since I feel like I've felt happy or even just not apathetic that I feel like I have to hit my head like an old tv to change the channel. 

When I said I speak fast and move too fast for others. I feel like there's is a brick wall between every person I talk to. No matter how many communication classes I take I will never get to someone because either I'm dumb or they're dumb. Sometimes I feel like there is no way I can be wrong about something through the lines of reasoning I have in my head but everybody else around me tell me I am wrong. I accept it but I still feel like I'm right and they're not understanding me. 

Online school has been insane, either it's too underwhelming or too overwhelming. I feel like these teachers are incompetent in the way they structure their lesson plans during covid even thought they've been doing it for decades. How can you expect me to complete 8 hours of lessons and an assignment in one day when it takes you 2 months to mark 30 papers?

I don't want to die but I just want to melt away. You might think that allot of the stuff I said above is arrogance, idk, I don't think so, I admit when I'm wrong (and understand why) and I happily accept feedback and criticism (when I'm given an explanation) but when I don't understand and am not given an explanation I hardly move. ""I don't give a shit what you have to say untill you explain to me why you say that""

I just want everything to stop but not really stop. I want all my expectations to go away, I want everyone to go away, I want to be able to tune in and out of reality as I wish and not to the whim of my thoughts. I want to be loved by someone else other than my parents. I feel like if I was in a relationship then all my problems would go away but I know that's not true. I know I would only end up hurting everyone involved.

What can I do to make all of this go away, I want to actually feel something other than dread.


Tl:dr
I really feel like the waiter or old man from hemingway's ""a clean well lighted place"", except I don't want to kill myself, I just want to sit in that cafe for eternity, I want to sit in nothingness. What can I do to change, I want to feel something again.",18Nov2020,1

376,I live with 2 other people and we have a flat screen tv with streaming service's in the living room. One of my roomates LOVES tv and will watch it for 12 hours straight sometimes even longer . I'm beginning to become frustrated because for the past 15 days this roomate has layed on the cough and watched tv for at least 10 hours a day. I get the living room is a shared place and everyone has a right to hang out there but waking up to him and his gf watching tv and then going to bed and they are still watching tv is insane. I'm losing my fucking mind. Do I wake up earlier then them and get to the tv first? Do I take my streaming services off the fire stick?,18Nov2020,1

This wouldnt make sense if i didnt say the whole story, 2 years ago (when i was 12) i was working with an animation team which ill call ABC. 

ABC was separated into 2 teams depending on the software used (Team 1 Team 2). Team 1 was led by Jim, Team 2 was led by Kit. 

Some drama happened in the server and we had to close the whole thing. 12 yo me pretty much looked up to Kit and was very sad by the whole thing. 

Now meanwhile my friend wouldnt stop talking about OWL (OverWatch League) and stuff so i just decided to join the server of last year's winner, SF Shock.

Now as unlucky as it might seem, here's Kit in that server. Now 12 yo me doesnt the stupidest move ever known to man. I decided to DM her.

She started calling me a stalker and blocked me on everything before i got to explain myself. Now i dont blame her, i slipped into her DMs despite here not wanting, and she's clearly very insecure about it.

381,"So about a year ago my father suffered a severe stroke. Almost died, but pulled through thankfully!! Any how he went to a nursing facility to rehab. It was slow, and then covid hit. My stepmother took power of attorney, and I didn't challenge it because I Iive a good ways away and couldnt be there on a consistent basis. So my father has made a real good recovery. He has some speech and physical problems still. But, can carry a conversation, and get from bed to chair and back, use restroom and generally get around. Now here's the dilemma, recently (2 months) now my father has been asking to leave, my Aunt goes and visits once or twice a week. He has stated that he wants to leave and that my stepmother hasn't really been there. So when I inquired about what getting him out looked like, she kinda had a meltdown. I don't feel he should be stuck there permanently if he's physically capable. I even discussed with him about moving down to where I live with me. He wants to, but my stepmother is adamant he's not mentally or physically able to. But, when I speak with him on the phone he seems very coherent and lucid. I feel like there is a fight brewing on being able to get him out of the nursing facility. There is financials that seem to be wrapped up in this, I don't want to believe that would be a motive( but who knows). So I guess my question is can I challenge the POA and how hard is it gonna be to overturn it? Sorry for the wall of text, any advice or suggestions or tips are welcome.",18Nov2020,1
382,"This happened Sunday morning. I woke up to possibly the sweetest little dog in the entire world emptying her bladder and proceeding to tense and convulse before going completely limp with her eyes wide open. I still can’t get the sound she made before going limp out of my head, I keep thinking about how afraid and in pain she must have been. I proceeded to call my mother, who had stayed over at her boyfriend’s house the previous night, with one hand, and using the other to do chest compressions on my unresponsive dog, she had no heartbeat and was not breathing.

A few seconds into feverishly trying to tell my mother what was happening, my dog suddenly blinked and started breathing again. I let my mother know and she rushed over to take my dog to the pet hospital nearby. Now, my dog is fairly old, she’s a 10-13 year old Chihuahua mix, and has been known to have a heart murmur, but had since stopped needing heart medicine due to the vet feeling as though it had become less life threatening. She’s very healthy otherwise.

This experience was deeply traumatizing to me. I’ve mourned deaths of loved ones and been to open casket funerals, but waking up to my sweet little dog crying out as if her last few seconds on Earth were upon her and nearly dying is a completely foreign experience to me. 

On one hand, I’m filled with joy that I was able to save her life, and that she’s still here with us and doing so much better after getting back on a prescription. But on the other hand, I have some minor PTSD about the whole scene, and I feel a deep dread for my dog. I really hope that she is able to pass gracefully and peacefully with us by her side when the time comes. She’s completely functional and healthy with her medication, and she is an absolute ray of energetic joy in my and my mother’s lives. We feel like we still have a couple years left to spend spoiling and pampering her.

It’s like I’m stuck between feelings of dread and joy. Would you all have any advice on how I could go forward with these feelings? I’m lying awake in bed trying to analyze my current emotions. Are they cancelling each other out like equal exertions of force? Or am I still in shock and will eventually come to terms with these feelings in the future? I’m just unsure what this feeling is that I’ve had.

384,"My daughter recently told me that she wants to enter the adult industry when she turns 18 in two weeks time and I don’t know how to react. I was stunned and horrified when she first told me and I haven’t been able to make sense of it. I find it deeply upsetting. These are for numerous reasons. First it’s dangerous and she could get STD’s, 2. If people find out who she is it could bring shame to me and our entire family, 3. it would follow her for the rest of her life even if she quits and regrets it, 4. These people she would work for don’t care about her and will use her as a commodity for money, and finally, that’s my little girl. I’ve raised her since she was a little baby and I love her so much and I don’t want seedy people taking advantage of her for the whole world to see. She is also highly educated (for example, she currently studies physics and she knows English, French, German, Latin, Spanish, Italian, Russian), thanks to her parents. I expected much more out of her in life and hoped for much more.

385,"Tonight my roommate and I ordered food delivery on a reputable app. We've ordered from them many times and did not have problems. We live in an apartment building with a dedicated front desk, and 99 out 100 times if there is a delivery the front desk will call us to let us know before they come up, but that didn't happen today. I personally always lock our doors behind me, but my roommate does not always to that. Today she was the last person to enter our apartment before the incident. 


We were each in our rooms doing our thing and then I hear someone knocking on our door. So I leave my room and was shocked to see that the delivery person was already in my apartment, dropping the food off in the dining room. My first reaction was ""wtf how could you enter without my permission"" so that's what I said along those lines. He briefly apologized and said something about not answering my door, etc. Mind you only 5-10 seconds have passed since the knocking, and I do deliberately tell people to leave the food outside. I was quite shocked at the whole event and basically told him to leave my apartment immediately. I should also mention that the person did not wear a mask (and neither did I, but I was in my own apartment)


The reason I reacted so poorly was because a couple of years ago I woke up to a burglar in my bedroom and he threatened me at knifepoint, demanding my properties. So what happened just now had triggered my PTSD. 


As soon as he left I texted their customer service reporting the issue. The agents attitude was pretty nonchalant - they simply apologized and said they have field a report on the driver and warned the driver etc, and refunded the delivery fee (something like $3). They even attempted to end the conversation prematurely by letting me complete the ""rate your experience with customer service"" survey. Needless to say I was very disappointed. 


Now that I've had a couple hours to cool off (still quite shocked tbh) I wonder if what I did (reporting him to the delivery company) was the best thing, or if there was anything else that I could have done. I'm concerned if I was acting rashly - if anything the person knows where I live, and if somehow they got punished I am scared that they have the potential to seek revenge on me (I am paranoid, I know). On the other hand, I don't know what else I could have done (I already talked to my roommate about looking doors). Can someone offer me some advice or perspective to ease my mind?",18Nov2020,1
386,"Hi, thanks for looking!

I'm a sophomore in university right now, and I live in cooperative housing by campus. When I moved in in September, I was placed with a random roommate, who is Greek and just graduated from law school. She's very nice, and we are friendly, so there are no real problems with her, other than the language barrier.

This is my problem: when I moved in, my parents gave me a lot of food and stuff, so to be nice I told her she could have some of my snacks if she ever wanted. She has taken it too far! She ate all my granola bars, my entire jar of peanut butter, half of my drinks, and a lot more!

I've felt too awkward to bring it up because I did offer the food to her, but today was the last straw. Last week I bought myself a pack of my favorite granola bars. Today I went to get one, and found that she had opened the pack, eaten all of them, and put the empty box back on the shelf!

How do I causally say ""hey can you stop eating all my food?"" I feel bad, and I really don't want to make her feel bad because she really is nice, so how do I bring up the issue gently?

I had a deep hearted conversation with my dad tonight and initially he didn’t want to do a paternity test because he said that it doesn’t matter and that all it can do is hurt me. But I explained to him that it would just give me a peace of mind and he said that if I wanted to, we can do it.

389,"My dog Roxy is my best pal, she's from a rescue and I've watched her turn from a skinny, practically feral hound to the cuddly couch potato I love.

The rescue needs to know if the address of the dogs main household is changed, etc, but I've had her for about 6 years now and I'm not sure if that still applies. If it does, well, that's the only thing holding me back. The papers are in my mum's name, legally the dog is hers.

Next year I'm planning to move to my dad's, but my mum is trying to stop me as much as possible from hassling me about picking the ""wrong"" college, to telling me I'm wasting my life and I'll get nowhere.

One of her methods is refusing to let me take my own dog (who she usually treats as a bother anyway) because she'll be ""happier"" here and moving would cause ""far too much stress"" and she ""loves being with my sisters dog!"" (who bites and literally chews Roxy all over her legs and face if she's tired or doesn't want to play).

Here's the thing: my dad said my aunt is willing to take my dog while I'm looking for a place I could move and take her with me. She has a big garden and a small friendly old dog who roxy would have for company. My aunt only lives around the corner so I could still walk her, feed her, clean after her, etc. There are many more paths, riversides and parks she could explore in the city and I could finally feed her proper food rather than the cheap crap and leftovers my mum feeds her here. 

The house here is very stressful for everyone, well, me and my pets (I have a Guinea pig I'm allowed to take). My mum's job means there are strangers in and out of the house, resulting in barking stressed dogs and a scared Guinea pig. There is almost constant arguing and shouting and just generally an awful environment. 

My dog would have a much happier and less stressful life with me, but I'm not sure if I can legally take her with me, would the shelter still have that legal control? If I told them her quality of life would be much improved would they let me take her?",18Nov2020,1
390,"*Originally posted in* r/Frugal

Today  I went to T-Mobile to sign up for a cheaper family plan than my family  is currently paying on AT&amp;T. We all brought our current devices and  simply wanted to switch services. I have been researching all the new  iPhone 12 lineup devices and was interested in purchasing one, but  figured I should just wait until next year for the next, perhaps more  dramatic, Apple iPhone update.

Earlier,  a friend of mine informed me of T-Mobile's buy-back program. He was  able to purchase a brand new iPhone 12 Pro Max for $400 (normally $1,099  +) after T-Mobile agreed to buy back his old iPhone for a certain  amount. While in the store, I asked the salesperson about this and was  given different quotas depending on the desired model &amp; storage,  paired with my current iPhone's model, storage and physical condition.

Here's the breakdown, and proceeding that is my question.

Trading in my current phone (iPhone X 256 GB \[3-years old\]), I could get:

* iPhone 12 Pro Max, 128 GB for $370 (originally $1,099)
* iPhone 12, 128 GB for $100 (originally $849)

(I'm excluding the other options as these are the only two I am serious about).

The  balance will come in the form of a debit to my account for a 30-month  period while T-Mobile credits my account for the buy-back price of my  phone during that same 30-month period.

My question is not regarding the specifications of payment, but of general monetary worth.

Should  I upgrade to one of these offers? And if yes, which one? The cheaper  one certainly fits my needs. However, the more expensive option has some  nice, but not necessary features. Plus, it is such a large discount  from it's original price. As a side note, I have the money available to  pay for both of these discounted prices.

*OR*  should I wait? Apple has another year for their new iPhone model and  I'm really in no rush to upgrade. Sure, it would be nice--especially at  these price points--but it's not necessary.

I  will state that my concern with waiting another year is primarily that I  will have to either pay full price for the next model; or that if  T-Mobile continues with this buy-back program, I will not get as much  money to buy back my current phone one year from now as I could now with  the present upgrade.

It was my last class which was chemistry so all my classmates went to the chemistry lab upstairs with my teacher, including me. I really needed to go but I didn't want to interrupt the teacher as she was giving her lecture in front of the whole class and if I asked her then, everyone would give me weird glares so I didn't and held it. 10 minutes passed and then it got real bad. I couldn't hold any longer and then.... There was a puddle on the floor I didn't know what to do and I was cold sweating.Then I just started panicking and then began crying. By then the students and the teacher saw and everyone started staring at me. Thankfully the teacher was understanding and I left to the bathroom downstairs. By then there was half an hour left before school ended and I stayed in the bathroom crying and washing my clothes the whole time. Finally someone came to call me and I was so embarrassed i couldn't even show my face!I had my mask on so it kind of hid the crying. On my way back to class my classmates said that she had packed my bag and stuff but I just ignored her. I couldn't stop crying ughhh.. My teacher asked me if I needed new clothes but I told her I had washed mine already.Then I went home...
 Now I am too embarrassed to go to school tomorrow. What is the best thing to do? Everyone probably thinks I'm weirder than I already was. the only thing I could think of on the way back home is to run away and kill myself. I can't go to school now, what would people think?

406,"We’ve been friends since grade 8 and became closer in the beginning of grade 10 to the end of high school. I considered her one of my best friends. She was different though in the beginning when I met her much kinder and funny, we got along really well, she gossiped but everyone did when we were 15. 

In grade 11 however she gossiped even more and it got really really bad and it made me feel bad for I didn’t like talking behind people’s backs anymore. I stopped talking to her for like 2 weeks(which I admit if I was trying to cut her off then I should’ve confronted her)  but then she FaceTimed me and asked me what was up and I confronted her, she apologized and said she would work on it. 

In our last year of high school grade 12, she was so much more judgmental, gossipy, and completely ignored the whole thing of her changing her ways in grade 11. I even got my first boyfriend and when I broke up with him she didn’t care and I felt like I couldn’t talk to her about it. Mean while whenever something inconvenienced her I listened and tried to give her my full attention. By this time she had no other friends except for me and hung out with me a lot, which I didn’t mind because I enjoyed her company. I even switched my lunch schedule for her so she could have someone to eat with at lunch on the days she had a short lunch (the longer lunches which was when she had a spare period after she drove home to eat, and I sat with my other best friends). 

The covid happened. We didn’t see each other for 3 months but then things got lifted and we started to hang out again. By this time I got my second job at a long term care home where seniors live so I had to get tested for covid bi-weekly. We spent the summer together kinda, it was hard because I worked everyday cause I was working 2 jobs, but I still tried to hang out with her after my shift and whenever I got a free day. At first she was scared to see me cause I was working 2 jobs but then she said she didn’t care anymore cause I got tested every 2 weeks and stuff. 

We got into a couple fights that summer from her coming to my work and talking to my boss about the fact that she didn’t get called back (I gave her an interview cause she was looking for a job), fights about gas on her car cause she wanted to go on a road trip but I told her that I didn’t really want to go because gas would be expensive and I didn’t have the time to. A fight about so many other stupid things.

Then this September we started our first year of university. We went to different unis but we were doing it all online so we were close to eachother. But now it’s November and I haven’t seen her in 3 months and at first it was because we were both busy with school and work, but now I’m only working at the long term care home (the other one is seasonal), and I’ve balanced school quite well with my new work sched. 

I asked her to hang out one day and she told me that I have to get tested each time I see her.... that’s impossible to get the result by the time I work another shift. I was confused on where all of this was coming from cause we hung out in the summer but she just said it’s for her inner peace??? Im just done being her friend at this point it’s exhausting. All she does these days is send me pics of ppl we went to high school with on Instagram and say “omg she had a glow down” or something stupid like that, I’ve had it! I feel like the only reason she’s still clinging onto me is cause she has nobody else. 

Here’s where I ask for advise we have so much history together, I already lost another best friend earlier this year, and it’s almost her birthday.

407,"I’m 24F, living in a safe city, lockdown everywhere but we are allowed to go for walks. My neighborhood is probably even safer than other parts of my city. 

However, I’m becoming more and more afraid to do it and I don’t have anyone here, not anyone that I’m allowed to meet. 

The reasons that I can think of is that every time I go somewhere there are weirdos, junkies, and when there are less people outside like now during the lockdown I find it even worse. Sometimes there were guys who would fap in front of me at rush hour with many people around me. 

Another reason is that my hometown wasn’t safe at all and I had some really bad experiences. But when I moved to my current city I used to go out by myself all the time, day or night, and I wasn’t afraid and back then nothing happened (it did become less safe though). 

What can I do? I feel depressed.

408,"I (27F) live with my best friend [S] , her bf [B], and his best friend [D]. I moved in 6 months ago and my job situation has been in limbo due to Covid. No idea what is going on with my office but my friends told me to not worry too much about rent just pay what I can and help out around the house with cleaning and cooking. The first 3 months were a blast. Enjoyed all my time with them just hanging out, watching stuff, playing video games. 

A month after moving in I started having kidney issues and have been in and out of the hospital since. It’s been a stressor on my finances but I’m still getting by. Initially I didn’t mind cleaning the kitchen or cooking for them and they were clearly loving it. But I started to catch on that they don’t make D clean anything. He leaves his dishes in the kitchen after he’s done cooking. The bathroom I share with him is always disgusting. Since they don’t go into the guest bathroom, they aren’t bothered by it no matter what I say or how many times they’ve seen me clean it. He’s mostly gotten out of dishes because he told B he doesn’t make dishes and that’s ALL he needed to be convinced... Then I noticed S and B were leaving behind a sink full of dishes and I honestly got sick of cleaning the same messes everyday... I told them from now on I’ll clean my dishes, my messes. I don’t see why one person should be a personal maid to a house of 4 grown adults at this point. They had to gotten all this done before I moved in... As a result the place is honestly starting to look awful. I stopped making dinners for everyone as well. D and B are picky eaters and won’t eat fruits or vegetables. So most of the time whatever I cook they won’t eat. If I make dinner for all of us they either eat it once or not at all and eventually the leftovers are tossed on garbage day. It’s not even that the food is gross, they are picky and rather buy fast food 5 days out of the week. I particularly don’t think it’s fair that with what little money I have it’s being wasted on food that is thrown away. Or snacks I buy intended for myself they will eat through...

B always stresses to S and at times myself about money. However they are always eating out or bringing fast food home. We’re a house full of geeks, we love video games and collectibles, but they are bringing new games and toys home weekly it seems. They seem incredibly wasteful with money and from what I’ve overheard them discussing today, it sounds like they want to pull me aside and talk to me about it. Maybe even the fact that I stopped cleaning as much. In the past couple of months I’ve barely left my room mostly sleeping or kind of out of it because of the medication for my kidneys. So whatever state the house is in is really on them. 

To make household tension worse, roughly 3 months after moving in it was discovered S was cheating on B and it really blew up the friendly fun atmosphere. Now I just feel awkward around here and I stay in my room. B gets annoyed that I won’t come out and spend more time with them since then while they go back and forth between arguing and constantly forcing happiness to keep appearances for D and work through their relationship. S is always telling me how she still wants to stay in contact with the guy she was talking to and meet up with him in secret... It’s just a sitcom worth of events... 

I don’t really have anywhere else to go. I could go home to my family but they are so much worse and I’ve had to leave home because of domestic violence before. Of the two evils, this is easiest to deal with. At least I’m mostly left alone and all I really want to focus on is finding remote work and moving on to be on my own. How do I handle this and talk to them moving forward?",18Nov2020,1

When I started, I guess my brain was like 'wouldn't it be terrible if you thought of your friends sister right now' so I did. I stopped though after like ten seconds because I instantly felt terrible about it.

414,"Im confused and scared because im in a situation and dont know what to do. About 15 years ago my friend had old me about his sister losing her share of a house she had with her ex.

I never speak to the friend any more but he told me that his sister was kicked out of her home by this ex while she was pregnant. This friend told me about their plans to retailiate against this man; the ex; when the son was born. I remember laughing because it all seemed so crazy that i thought he was joking.

I now realise that the plans which this friend talked about in detail actually happened about 15 years ago and i dont know whether i should tell the police about what i know. It just seems too much to be a coincidence.

How i realised this was because a few weeks ago i started hearing rumours about this same friend commiting this same crime and never being arrested or charged. These rumours are what happens on a small island, we call it the guernsey rumour mill.

There are some small differences with the rumour about the burned house not being owned by my friends sister but the rest of it is exactly the same as this friend spoke about. One thing is certain and that is that i am convinced that this friend did this terrible crime.

I have so many questions in my head and dont know whether i should do something. It also turns out that i now know a close family member of the victim and this whole thing seems so unfair. I heard he survived the fire and moved to the mainland years ago. I really want to tell people what i know but am so scared. I have so many questions i ask myself every day now.

Should i speak to the police or the victims family about this and betray this friend? What if he is guilty what would happen to his wife and daughter? If he knows it was me who spoke up how do i protect myself from similar retailiation? I dont want to put myself and my family in danger like the victim.

Does anybody have any advice about what i should do?",18Nov2020,1
415,"As said above, I have four female friends that all work together and they all have an issue with one male supervisor. This man is racist, sexist, homophobic, genuinely awful at his job, inappropriate to the girls, bullying younger male employees, been caught stealing, and comes to work high amongst other things. 

After months of being harassed by him at work, my friends decided that they all needed to come together to make their voices heard about his actions. They did is after being told that the male employee was on his last straw so in reality they did this in hopes that he would be fired and they wouldn’t have to work with him again.

After all sending the manager complaints which disclosed all of the horrible things the male employee has done, including sexual assault towards one of my friends, the manager said he would look into it and also check cctv, then he can take action. 

In the end the ‘action’ he took was just telling the male employee about every single complaint made including who complained. I know that in at least one of the letters it was stated that they wished the manager wouldn’t disclose this information to the male employee as it would then be unsafe to work with him. This is because he behaves very erratically and is thought to be on cocaine most of the work day, which scares the female employees. 

Personally, I feel that the manager has made a mistake in telling the male employee about complaints and instead has created an unsafe work environment for other workers. Is there anything they can do about this? And also how they can stay safe at work in the meantime?",18Nov2020,2

So here’s the problem, Increasingly over the last few weeks but especially recently and going into holiday she has been giving all of my shifts to the newest people and giving me the worst possible shifts.  The newest people don’t know anything so I’ve had to train them and do my work.  I’ve asked my manager about my schedule and they says that it’s just the way that it is.  I thinks it’s wrong and disrespectful.  I want to quit on the spot but am worried that I am making a mistake since I’ve been with them for so long.  

For background, I have a partner who makes significantly more than I do and easily could support us since he already does - he makes about 10x my salary.  My job is just extra money. Quitting would give me some time with my partner as my new schedule keeps me from seeing him besides a couple hours a day for the last few weeks and to also enjoy the coming holiday.

My location is one of the busiest in the city, always being chaotic in the restaurant. I personally work in the kitchen.

419,"... and they did not take it well. I am 19F and my boyfriend is 20M and we’ve been together for almost 4 months. We still live with our parents and are financially dependent on them. My parents raised me in a conservative evangelical household and my boyfriend Catholic. 

I decided to tell my parents last night as I didn’t want to have anymore secrets. My dad got mad and thinks I’m ungrateful for all the things they’ve done for me just because I decided to get a boyfriend. Both my parents think I don’t care about anything except my boyfriend, which is not true. I’ve been doing very well this semester in college, I’ve even made the deans list. My mom thinks my boyfriend is manipulating me into being with him (he has a disability) for his own personal gain and does not care for me at all- in her eyes, when that is all not true. My mom told me that she’ll set up an appointment with our pastor so he could orient me on what to do best (I don’t like spreading my business around like that and I’m starting to not believe so much in conservative evangelical faith) They think I’m in the wrong for being with my boyfriend cause in their eyes, I’m not ready to be in a relationship yet cause I’m still in college. 

I got slammed left and right by them for a total of 3 hours just cause I told them I have a boyfriend. I felt mentally exhausted and dizzy after that.They’ve told me in the past I can tell them almost anything that’s on my mind but this is the exact same reason why I don’t tell them things. They were assuming a lot of things about my boyfriend without even having an actual one-on-one conversation with him and my dad doesn’t want to meet him, he laughed when I offered that (my mom has met him before) Plus they sprinkled in the religion stuff which is just great. 

I don’t know what to do, I mentally prepared for this beforehand cause I knew this reaction would be a possible outcome. They’ve made me feel guilty for choosing to have someone other than family to love. They told me how am I going to proceed in this situation and I told them I really don’t know, all I know is that I am still going to be with my boyfriend no matter what.

423,"**Background info:** I have never had any serious suicidal thoughts but I know that my friend Katie (not her real name) has in the past and quite possibly still struggles with suicidal ideation. 

**Story:** I (F) usually hang out with the same three friends (Katie, Becca, and Erin) every weekend to watch movies and TV. Last weekend (4 days ago) we were watching a show where the characters were having a discussion about suicidal thoughts. Anyway, Becca said ""Maybe this sounds bad, but I kinda think people who commit suicide want people to be sad. Like they want to know that people will be sad and miss them when they are gone."" 

When she said that it just felt really wrong to me but in the moment I wasn't able to really articulate why it felt so wrong so I didn't say anything. Katie and Erin just kinda pretended they didn't hear it and kept watching the show but I wonder if Katie might have been bothered by it since she has had thoughts like those and Becca basically just said that she wants to make other people sad...

I know Becca didn't mean to offend and she probably just wasn't thinking about it when she said that. I also know that she is the type of person who would want to know if she said something offensive and in the past has taken criticism on problematic statements really well. So if I let her know that I thought here comment might have been inappropriate she would definitely do some reflecting and also probably apologize. 

**My questions are:**

1. Can you help me articulate what exactly was wrong with her statement? 

I can't speak to the experience of those who suffer with suicidal ideation but I don't think that ""making people sad"" would really be on many peoples mind in that situation. I think that maybe they would like to know that people care about them but I don't think that means they want people to be sad. I don't know if this would be enough to convince her that what she said was wrong so if anybody could add onto that I would be thankful. 

2. Should I even bring it up at this point? 

It's been 4 days since it happened and I'm not sure if I should even mention it at this point. Would it be worth the awkwardness that it would cause? 

3. Should I apologize to Katie for not calling Becca out?

Katie didn't say anything about what Becca said but I feel like it had to have hurt a little bit and probably even more so when nobody stood up for her. Should I apologize for not knowing what to say in the moment or could bringing it up again make her upset?",18Nov2020,0
424,"Hi,

I've been wracking my mind over this for the past hour. I'm a 2nd year English Literature and Creative Writing undergraduate who's been tasked with producing a short film to be graded as 30% of my Screenwriting module. Up until now, I have been very anxious about having to make a pitch in front of my peers and that anxiety has been getting in the way of me coming up with a script (or even an idea) to pitch to them tomorrow.

My first idea was to centre the short film around a student who has moved away from home and is struggling to grapple with a new sense of place, the responsibility of being their suicidal sibling's emotional bedrock, and trying to find themselves in a place where they have no prior connections. The 'script' was set to be a series of text messages sent between the student and various relatives and/or friends, interpreted and narrated (tone and all) by the student's inner voice. I wanted to focus on movement (as in, literal walking, driving, etc.) and immobility as contrasting states for reflection (without dialogue), posited in between the student's three main aims: 1) adjust to life away from home, 2) do university work, and 3) take photographs to send back to their sibling. Each of those three aims were supposed to incite an inner conflict while also causing hindrances to the student's ability to achieve any specific one of them as they struggle to manage their time, energy, and mental health. 

I mention the first idea solely because I think it shows how few resources I feel like I have. The entire thing could have been written, acted, and filmed by me, in and around where I live. However, I don't feel like this narrative is particularly compelling because it lacks meaningful drama, and I don't think I'm competent enough to present meaningful drama in a short film with one actor.

This morning, the day before I have to pitch my script and idea, I've come up with something new. I want to base my short film around the plight of a homeless man who is struggling to find enough change to call his eldest son on a pay phone. Passersby pity him and distrust his intentions, so instead of giving him money they'll give him food and refuse anything else he asks for. Elsewise they'll just walk on by and ignore him outright. The character would eventually turn to busking (in regards to this, I'm inspired by a homeless man I see on my daily walk who has a guitar) and get enough change to use the payphone, but when he calls his son there's to be no answer. 

I'm more convinced that my second idea will make for a more interesting and compelling short film. For a brief format, it's simpler, it's more capable of demonstrating intense and universal feelings (love, isolation, loss, desperation, etc.), and I think it would be a good opportunity to provide depth through moments like his busking where homodiegetic music choices can offer a deeper understanding of the character I'm trying to create.

Only problem I have is that I'm not homeless, I don't know anyone who looks convincingly homeless who would be willing to help me with the film, and I'm not certain I would successfully be able to film myself in outdoor spaces if I were to take up the task of making myself look homeless. There is, however, a homeless guy in the town centre who I often chat to and buy dinner for. Would it be immoral for me to ask him if he'd help me with my short film provided I paid him to do so? I'm torn and need some help working it out.

Thanks in advance.",18Nov2020,1

429,"If there is a better page to post this then please let me know.

So I work in retail in a supermarket. I have been working there for 5 weeks now. I had another job in retail a long time ago where I also felt anxious and I feel like this did affect my work performance, but no one ever really said anything about it in my last job. 

My manager pulled me into their office today and told me that I was a slow worker, that I stress out the other employees with my slowness and that I am ""unaware of my surroundings"".. But when they were going over my performance, they said I wasn't fast enough on the till when serving customers, and went on to comment on how slow I was (which I thought was pretty harsh and unnecessary). This wasnt the first time I heard about this though. My supervisor asked me a week before if I had any concerns about my job right now, we did go over some things but clearly this wasn't enough for the manager. I could also sense that the other employees were silently annoyed with me for the way I work, which has also discouraged me from wanting to ask them for any help when I am working. I fully understand that they all have their targets they need to meet and I am more aware of my responsibilities now after my chat with the manager. 

There was 1 aspect of the job I didn't actually know I had to do on my own which I was only made aware of today. Even though I had help with this during my whole time working there and now I did feel very unaware of what is expected of me on this part of the job role. However, I do think that they should have at least said something to me about this beforehand instead of letting it build up to this point, because non of the other employees said anything to me about it before my chat with the manager.

I just want some advice on feeling less anxious at work. I feel like my anxiety does prevent me from doing a better job. For example, I really struggle to find stock even when it's right in front of me, I just really don't notice it? I also want to be able to approach the other employees without it feeling like a bigger/more hostile thing than it needs to be (also I am fine with talking to the customers, it's literally just the employees). Not everyone is like this, but I'm just feeling pretty bad about stressing out everyone else. 

If anyone also has any advice on improving job performance in the workplace then this would also be very helpful. I want to improve but I don't know where to start.",18Nov2020,1
433,"This is so long and I’m sorry. 

I’ve been having some problems with my roommate(we will call her Amy)at university. I live in a suite, so there is a living area and another room across with a suitemate (we will call darla) (she doesn’t her own roommate). Amy and I share a room. So, it began with amy never cleaning up after herself. Always leaving trash around, when asked to clean she always got hostile, cried, and/or would talk bad about whoever asked to other people. This is the normal roommate stuff. Some other things she would do is hang trash all over living area. She would hang old McDonald’s trash on the ceiling, glue condoms to the door, and candy to the ceiling. Darla and I made it clear we did not want that there, Amy would get angry and talk about us to other people about this. 

Things began to escalate as the semester went on. Amy got a friend and darla was attracted to this friend. Darla made it very clear she was not into my Amy like that. Amy began spreading rumors that darla was trying to date rape her friend. At first, I believe it to be true because who would lie about something so serious. Amy began telling everyone who would listen about this rumor.  I realized that the rumor was a lie, there was no proof and knowing darla’s values, this isn’t something she would do. Maybe made up out of jealousy for not being picked. I really can’t tell you why anyone would make that up. Amy is in a relationship, this is important for the next part. One time Amy brought over a guy to hang out. She made it very clear that I should not talk to that person because she “claimed” them. The days goes on and we hang out. Amy and the guy begin cuddling on the couch. After that guy leaves, amy tells me how much they liked them and how much they liked cuddling with them. They even hung out the next day alone. I think that maybe amy felt like she got caught by me and that I could easily tell her boyfriend about the situation. After that, my roommate told me and everyone they could about how the guy “forced them to do it” and “made them uncomfortable”. She even accused the guy of stalking her because she would see the guy in common areas of our dorm building. Another time, Amy came home super drunk and unable to control themselves. Darla, her boyfriend, and I felt it was our responsibility to ensure she was safe getting to bed.  Darla’s boyfriend checked on amy while she was in bed. He was only in there for about 15 seconds, came out and stated her breast was exposed. The next day we told amy about it because honestly if my body parts were exposed to random people I would want to know about it. After I told her, she started telling people that Darlas boyfriend had to have touched her while she was drunk and questioned why he was in the room alone with her. 

Another thing my roommate did was be very openly racist and transphobic. She knew darla and I’s opinion on this and knew we were not okay with it. It seemed to fuel her need to be racist. Some of the many quotes, “brown people smell horrible” “it’s okay if you say the n word around me I’m racist, too” (the next one is when introducing herself to someone she’s never met) “hi I’m ___ and I’m racist” 

My roommate let one of her friends have sex on my bed while I was out of town. Didn’t tell me about it and did not wash my sheets. I found out through darla that this happened. 

My roommate would bring at least 7-8 people to our room over to party. This occurred every night for about a couple of weeks, weekdays and weekends. They would stay until 5-6 am every night. They were very disruptive every night. Darla and I would beg my roommate to make them leave. Amy would always say, “they’re about to leave I promise” which was always a lie or “I just don’t know how to tell them to leave, I don’t want to upset them”. She would get very angry when we told her they should not stay past midnight. Amys guests would always leave their trash. When we asked Amy to clean up after her guests, she would simply say it wouldn’t hers so she don’t have to. There was a falling out between amy and those people, so the partying stopped. 

One time, I was with Amy, her boyfriend, and darlas boyfriend. We were having a normal conversation until amy brought up how she fantasize about how she would murder people she knows.  She went into detail about how she wanted to and how she would murder us. When asked about myself she said “you haven’t made me angry enough to think about it” this conversation was not said as a joke. My roommate stated she thought it was normal. I mean Idk about anyone else but I don’t think about how I would kill people. 

Since the falling out between my roommates party guests and my roommate, my roommate has not stayed the night at the dorm. She has been staying with her boyfriend for about a month now. 

Darla and I finally got tired of all the lies and chaos my roommate was bringing. We spoke to RA’s they said the only thing we can do is for Darla to file a title ix against amy for spreading false accusations. The RA said they cannot forced amy to leave since we are the ones with a problem with her. We also spoke to the advisor of the club amy, Darla and I are all on and let the advisor know about the entire situation. Since we are all on leadership positions, we are pushing for Amy’s impeachment. 

To end this, I’ve expressed my concern for amy’s mental health, as she have a long history of mental health issues, to darla. We agree that we have both noticed amy is not behaving like a normal and sane person. Since amy has not been to the dorm in a month, and Darla and I got her in trouble with the club we are in, I fear for my safety being in my room. I’m scared because she has a key to our dorm and our room, and has clearly stated that she thinks about harming people. I’m scared she will either harm me or my belongings. Darla and I are trying to switch dorms but at the moment there is nothing we can do because the deadline for room changes has passed. We are currently waiting for the housing people to get back to us with options to move. Darla has filed her title ix. Amy is a pathological liar and a master at being the victim. 

What I need advice on: I worry that she will retaliate and/or lie to get me and Darla in trouble with the school. I have not gone to campus police but I’m worried campus police will not take me seriously.",18Nov2020,1

I have a really good friend who founded a semi successful band. He usually does everything by himself but for his new album he's got some friends helping him.
He asked me to draw the album art a few months ago and I already worked a lot on it and I loved the project. I love his band so much and yeah.
The singer for the new album was a guy who in the end didn't fit too well so my friend just told me they replaced him. The new singer is one of my former best friends, who frequently bullies me, talks shit about me and made jokes about a suicide attempt of mine. He basically told me to kill myself.
I find the idea disgusting of spending so much time on a cover for a band that guy sings in and in the end I don't even want the album if he does the vocals.

In the mean time I let my roommate borrow it while I waited to try to sell the old one on Ebay. Not even a week passes and she already locked herself out of the iPad because she forgot the passcode to log herself in after I told her to write it down. She didn't listen to me and it automatically upgraded on her last night and the iPad isn't letting her back in without the passcode. When she told me she couldn't remember and it wouldn't be the 1st time she would lock herself out of a device I wanted to strangle her because she knew I was going to sell the old iPad she was borrowing. I blame myself for letting her borrow it but she was so irresponsible for not listening to me when I told her to write down her passcodes if she where to lock the device. So the reason why I'm here is if I should get her to give me the money I was going to request online from her because she locked herself out of my old tablet?

Salary is the same but in the IT one it's a jr position vs the sr one in design. My main goal is to eventually travel, change country and finding steady job as a designer took like 5 years here. I feel that it may be impossible to find one again in another country.   
So i'm torn between staying in the job i kinda like, with a nice relaxed ambience where you can't really grow, vs going to an IT factory, that while it has benefits and allows you to grow, it was just a backup plan and it's a more ""stressed"" place.

She just sits and watches CNN for HOURS a day, sometimes until 5 am. She also stopped showering, washing her clothes and doing any type of cleaning. It seems like she doesn't care anymore.

Or cries and says we are being mean, which we arent, at all.

478,"Edit: Warning, long.

Burner, because I just don't want her finding out I feel this way exactly, unfortunately:/ I just don't want needlessly hurt feelings over my own before I figure out how to go about this. So, for context:

My sister (who's younger than me by a few years, but has just turned 18) has a new boyfriend who practically lives with us now since about a month ago. He hangs out with her constantly in her room and is always over when she is, which is whenever she doesn't work. She's done this with a few other new boyfriends, but this one stays over the longest out of any of the boys she's brought home. He's over about 6 days (and nights) out of the week. We both live at home because I go to college in town and she just graduated highschool (our parents don't make us pay rent, especially now because of covid and so that I can afford college better; they can afford this arrangement comfortably). He's a good kid, and I have no issue with him as a person, although his presence has been starting to get on my nerves for a few reasons. To reiterate, he has a home. His mom seems nice although I've never met her; but I know for a fact that the reason why he's over here all the time isn't because he doesn't have somewhere else to go.

In addition to all of this, when I was her age, I had a similar arrangement with my own boyfriend in my room, and he stayed over quite frequently for about a summer (but not nearly as often as this kid- my boyfriend had a job and went to college, and we would leave the house way more often). I had also left home to stay with him like that for a few seasons as well; and I still am dating him to this day, I just live at home now and so does he, although I do spend nights over at his place pretty frequently. My family knows him super well, and none of the additional problems (listed underneath the next paragraph) ever ocurred with him and another member of the household.

To start, I am uncomfortable having a stranger living with us now. Like I said, I don't have a problem about who he is, but I have anxiety about someone new just living with us now all of a sudden. No arrangement or anything was made, he just started spending almost every night over here. I don't feel comfortable around him, especially since he often wants to involve me with the time he spends with my sister. 9 times out of 10 I don't want to be involved. It even seems to somewhat bother my sister how often he'll try and involve me in something. He'll ask me to play games with them, recommend anime, etc etc etc. He's definitely higher energy then either me or her are, coupled with the fact that I never even hang out with her alone anymore (outside of the house or even at all); because of this it makes it frustrating to be involed with their duo at all. If she chooses to spend all her time with him that's her choice, but I personally don't want to be involved with him since he's not someone I would choose to hang out with per se. I feel like plenty of times I go into the public part of the house he'll just kind of be there, and try and engage me in some kind of way. When I'm at home, I just want to relax from work, get schoolwork done, etc. I really just don't want to be encountering him every single day of the week.

As for some of the other things that have changed since he started spending almost every night over here:

\- He snores very loud. I can hear it through the walls because me and my sister's room are right next to each other. She's a deep sleeper, and I can realistically say that I can definitely sleep through it, but it's the equivalent as if someone were to use their leafblower down the block from your house every night. You could totally sleep through it, but it's always there. You can always hear it. It's starting to drive me crazy and I don't know how to ask for someone to just stop... snoring.

\- Me and my sister's shared bathroom gets way messier now. I try and keep it clean, but the ratio of me and my sister cleaning it is definitely 3/2. The initial division of work isn't that bad (and I didn't mind it before really), but it gets messier more frequently now, with me still doing more of the cleaning (or it doesn't get done).

\- He also has interrupted me in the bathroom more than anyone in my life, while I'm getting ready for work, finishing a shower, or washing my face about every time I do (luckily not actually using the toilet though, lmao). I don't know if hearing me in there reminds him that he has to go, but it's also driving me crazy. It seems like every time I'm getting ready for work I just have to stop because he has to use the bathroom all of a sudden. He literally has no obligations other than abiding by my sister's schedule and leaving the house to go home when she goes to work, so it's not like he's on any other overlapping time frame. Either he has a UTI or no ettiquette, because he knows I'm in there and always manages to find some way to interrupt me right when I start washing my face or whatever. Last time he knocked on the door right when I was getting out of the shower and asked to use the bathroom, I just had to shoot him a somewhat stern, ""Yeah... when I get out"". I don't fucking get it. It mildly stresses me out to be in there now knowing he's probably going to interrupt me at some point.

\- She's late to work all the time now because she has to drop him off at his house when she leaves and doesn't account for time (I got her hired at the same work as me a couple of years ago, so that's how I know). She's religiously late because of this, although not usually by much. Since work's been kind of slow since covid started I can't complain too much, but she was late by about 20 minutes last time and it ended up putting everyone that was on the clock (including myself) in a tough spot.

Anyways, it's all eating away at my sanity just a little. Home is slightly more stressful, but since I'm obviously biased to my own sentiments, I don't know if from an outside perspective I'm just blowing this all out of proportion. My boyfriend obviously lived in my room with me some days of the week when I was her age, so I know that everyone else was accomodating to me. I don't know if the fact that they've known my s.o. for a lot longer affects anything; our parents know he's practically family now and that we plan on getting married. I just am starting to lose it, and need some advice.",18Nov2020,1

TRIGGER WARNING. (sorry, my first time writing this kind of post so I'm not sure what kind of trigger to give for this)

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: guy kept touching me on the waist and back when I was drunk. I do not know if Im misunderstanding him and need help getting over this incident.

Hello internet, two days ago I went out drinking and hanging out with my friends and acquaintances from a club I just joined. The people there are generally nice and friendly. I got too drunk and when I'm drunk, I tend to get too tipsy and let loose. Anyways, I was having fun and when it was time to get home, I decided to join the small group of people who wanted to go back to the college campus to hang out further.

On our way to the nearby bus stop,  this male acquaintance started exhibiting weird behaviour towards me. Fyi, I absolutely do not like it when people touch me for no reason at all, even on the head. I've had past trauma with it. That night, this male acquaintance (Guy A) would suddenly dive to support me eg. if I was about to somewhat fall, he would immediately dive forward to catch me. At first, when he did such things like suddenly lunging forward to support me when I was going to fall, I thought of it as nothing. I thought he was being friendly. Yet, there were also certain instances that made me feel uncomfortable till now. For instance, I was just going to sit down on the bench near us and he suddenly (if i remember clearly) touched my waist i.e. wrapped his arm around it like he was supporting me. At this point, I was getting irritated but I was having too much fun and felt I could be misunderstanding him.

However, on the bus towards the campus, when Guy A decided to go home taking that bus, since both of us lived near each other, he asked if I wanted to go with him. He even said, "" Let me drop you off at your bus stop. No, actually, let me walk you to the bus stop and even back home."" and he looked very eager. At that point, I somewhat sobered up and had enough and told him it's fine, I will go back by myself.

Two days later and I'm still thinking if I'm being overly sensitive... I can still feel the person's touch on my waist and back. Can someone please tell me if I'm misunderstanding Guy A? Should I avoid him in future (as we will be in the same club and we are regulars)? How do I get over this incident? ",18Nov2020,1
480,"Tw: sexual abuse, child abuse 

Some back story, my sister got pregnant at 18 from a 34 year old man. They where together for roughly 2 years and in that time they were both heavily addicted to meth. My nephew gets placed with us for a period of 9 months where they get clean and get him back. 

They now have been apart for almost 3 years and have restraining orders against eachother. My nephew is almost 4.

Now where my sister isn't the best mother she has been deemed by CPS that she is fit for sole custody and the father essentially has no rights. They have an agreement that they alternate weeks which worked out great for about 6 months 

So the problem is that BD has been accusing sisters boyfriend of sexually abusing nephew, with some really awful allegation going around. Now, my nephew is one of the most important people In my life,  I would die for this child.

Where I dont know what to do is that the police where already involved about a month ago and found no evidence of abuse, my nephew was evaluated by therapist and doctors and they said he doesnt have signs of abuse ( no aversion to being naked, not acting out, loves strangers and plays nice with other kids, sleeps fine) just overall they said he was a normal little boy.but BD, WILL NOT drop it and is sure somethings going on. Based on things he says he's heard nephew say and nothing else 

He's also a ragging peice of shit methhead who would do anything to hurt my sister. That being said I see the way nephew interacts with the boyfriend and he loves him, always running to him, always trying to find him and play in the yard.

I'm cant fathom letting him get hurt but either he's really flying under everyone's radar and BD is right or he's being drug through the wringer for something that's not happening, I just don't know what to do. Is there anything I should look for?

481,"So I'm 18 and live with my parents, not an ideal situation but I decided to take a gap year and with the pandemic and everything it really wouldn't be ideal for me to move out. But that's also the issue; I'm not sure that I could live on my own, not because I don't trust my abilities but because my parents still treat me like I'm a child, which makes me feel like one. It's the smallest things sometimes, like when I put on makeup or a nice outfit they'll regard me as if I'm a little girl trying to impress them and make some remark like ""oh, look at your makeup dear!"" even though I've told them multiple times how uncomfortable it makes me. Other times it's things like patting me on the head, talking down to me or asking to help me with simple tasks they know I can do. It's so frustrating, and it makes me feel so useless. Whenever I try to act like an adult and do things on my own, they're there to do these things and I start getting into this headspace where I feel like a lost little kid again. I want to get out there, find a job, meet people (within the limits of quarantine and social distancing of course) but I feel like no one takes me seriously as an adult because my parents don't. I can't voice my opinions to other adults, no matter if they're 18 like me or 40, because I feel like they're secretly chuckling to themselves thinking it's cute, like my parents do when I tell them something and they see as me ""trying to be smart"". I hate this. I know they still see me as a kid or whatever but I need to start taking responsibilities in my life, and they aren't helping. Whenever I mention my feelings regarding this to them they tell me I'm being mean and that I'm trying to grow up too fast, like I were still some rebellious teen. I'm almost 19 for fuck's sake, I don't get it. I'm sorry if this is coming across too whiny, I realize I'm really privileged that I have parents who support me, but this is a big issue in my life and I don't think I can talk about it any other way.

Company A actually stuck by me through lockdown (after I applied and was successful) to ensure my position when i was able to work again.

A job opportunity with double the salary and half the working hours came along, for something I’m more passionate about. I’m now torn.

486,"Hello! My flatmate recently expressed that she's fed up of how often my boyfriend stays over at our large 2-bedroom apartment. For the last month or so he has stayed over 3-4 times a week. Last week he stayed over 4 nights due to it being my birthday weekend. We live in two different cities an hour apart and he works shifts so we try to spend time together inbetween him working. If it wasn't a pandemic, obviously we would be out on dates and able to spend time at each others places equally. But we don't have that luxury at the moment, so there's no alternative. It's not possible for me to spend time at his place. Just every other weekend when I can.

When he is over, we tend to spend most the time in my room. Sometimes we will hang out with my flatmate in the living room, chatting whilst she cooks or watching tv with her. My partner makes a big effort to talk to her but she is very dismissive of him and to be honest, rude. We've always tried to be considerate of her and keep the noise down, keep the flat clean/tidy, as well as include her in conversations when she's around.

I've apologized for making her feel uncomfortable and said we'll  work on it. But in all honesty, I think it's fairly unreasonable considering we don't have much control over the situation. I've tried to explain that if we could give her space by going out some evening, we would. But we literally can't go anywhere (we're in UK lockdown). She goes to work and still see's her friends/family. I work from home all day, and apart from seeing my partner, I don't go anywhere/see anyone. I've said I'm happy to make some changes but she needs to be fair and reasonable and understand it's only this way due to the lack of alternative options due to the pandemic.

Edit - To clarify, we don't share bathrooms. We don't get in her way. The apartment is always in clean and tidy condition. I have also lived in the flat 2 years and own all the furniture/contents and she has lived here less than 6 months.",18Nov2020,1

489,"I don't have a lot of experience with women outside of work or school and never had that many friends (again, usually socialize at work).

I'm currently talking to this girl and due to my lack of experience, I sometimes wonder if she likes me more than a friend. I can't tell though. We became friends pretty fast. I also asked if I could add her through a messaging app and we exchanged contacts. She later gave me her number instead because she doesn't use that app as much.

Some of the odd things I've noticed are:

-one time she was telling me how her day went, she told me she went for a walk with ""her only guy friend"". I remember her saying it like that and it made me wonder why she had to specify his sex.

-during lunch one time, we both headed home and were texting a bit during lunch. At the end of lunch she asked me if I was at work yet. I thought it was kind of odd.

-I asked her out for lunch and she politely said she already had plans with her friend that day. What I found odd was that she mentioned the guy by name. lol I don't know him. Which makes me think it was her way of telling me she's already seeing someone? Which is fine I guess. I did get sad and later that day, she texted me and we messaged each other for a little over an hour.

I'm honestly having a great time with her. I really wish I could spend more and more time with her. But I'm happy that I'm around her at work and we're able to talk or play with each other at work. I don't really think I'll date her because I'm 33 and she's 18. Huge age difference. But the weird thing is, we talk a lot (myself in particular, I'm usually a quiet person) and we can relate with each other in many ways. Yeah, we're different, but we get each other.

490,"Hello,

I have amazing cousins who I have been very close to my entire life. I do occasional work (computer stuff, not physical) for them, for free because I love to help my family out wherever I can. They have helped me out many times too in my darkest moments. 

Enter corona. All my cousins have gone overboard in the entire “virus is a hoax” “anti-vax” etc all that stuff. Their personal social media’s are littered with it. I spoke up to them once, but got bombarded by counter arguments. It is a fight I do not want to start. 

I worry for their business, as keeping a stance like this is bound to lose customers, but more so for the safety of my elderly parents and other family members. 

I don’t want to start a fight, I don’t want to argue. I don’t want to lose the friendship and the bond we have. However, doing work for someone whose ideas are so different than your own is very hard. I personally just don’t want to do it anymore if they keep being like this, but i can’t just say hey I’m not gonna do this cuz you think differently. That’s a sure way to make things awkward whenever we see each other and ruin the family. Do I just suck it up and keep doing what I do for them, regardless of personal “beliefs”?

I hope this ramble wasn’t too chaotic. Please advice me on what would be the best thing to do here. Thank you.",18Nov2020,1

The rest of the times she's very anti-social. My family has mostly kept themselves away from the outside as a result of the ongoing pandemic. In the past month, she has made two comments about me. 1) Wishing she never gave birth to me 2) Saying I'm better off dead. 

Now I won't write an essay about my life since I'm not here for that but what I will say though is, despite my lack of achievements in life, I'm happy with who I am, because I love who I am. Even if I can't be happy with my life so far, I still try to be the best person I can be. I keep to myself. I'm happy doing my own thing. I'm a good person.

We got close in 2017 - 2019 where we were roomies, classmates, tennis team members, traveled together and he has helped me out in life. I gamed a lot and had a discord group of friends he wanted to join and we started hanging out more and so I started considering him my best friend.

We had this mutual friend who he was close to before meeting me and probably experienced more things together. In the back of my mind, I kinda knew they were best friends but I was hoping for him to consider me one as well. He used to initiate hangouts and convos more with me but things have kinda slowed down. We just had a discussion on our friendship after I felt like he should've invited me to a game but didn't (immature I on my part I know...) and how I had expectations of him and how I would do anything to support him but I feel it would not be reciprocated. In turn he said he thought he could tell me things before but realized he didn't feel as comfortable telling me his life secrets based on my personality as much as his other friend whereas I told him most things about my life. It was a mature conversation, but I left disappointed. He wants us to continue our same dynamic and for me to bring more positive vibes, but I felt kinda betrayed and think I need to step back from this to reset this friendship (which he does not want me to do). 

I'm not sure what to do with this friendship? Pretend like nothing happened and force myself to bring positive vibes or should I distance myself (which he gets mad at when I do)?

She’s 42 is 5’4” with red auburn hair. I’ve known her since I was in 6th grade and had always thought  she was hot. It wasn’t until June though when my crush on her really took off. I’ll call her Ms. White for reference.

Ms. White would pay me and would allow me and 3 of my friends to come and swim at her pool for doing yard work for her. I want to get into wild life biology to become a game warden so Ms. White had also been tutoring me in science even though science is my second best subject behind history. Well one day when I was swimming she came out in a bikini and was watering her flowers. She’s the coach of our swim team so I’m used to being around the pool with her.

In my state, technically we are allowed to have gatherings of less than 10 people, and less than 3 households. Although I'm sure that science is far from perfect...

My parents went to Texas a few weeks ago, a time when our covid rates have been starting to spike. And now they are in the Florida Keys until Sunday and hospitals here are filling up. That's 5 days before Thanksgiving. The CDC says typically symptoms show up around 5 days, but can show anywhere between 2-14 days. 

My parent's also don't want to get tested because they ""don't want the government telling them what they can and can't do"". And my dad, as upper level management at his company, says he doesn't mind when his employees are showing symptoms but then come to work the next day as long as they ""feel ok"". 

Meanwhile, my husband and I do not claim to be saints or have all the answers, but what we do know is that hospitals here are reaching capacity and people are dying. That's not something to take lightly. So we do the best we can (masks, 6 feet, getting tested, being sympathetic) because we care. Also my husband is a smoker and has shown he tends to have a much weaker immune system than me, and he also has a 14 year old daughter that I'm sure he does not want to be fatherless...

I don't want my parents to be crushed about Thanksgiving but it doesn't feel right to me. It would be hard to feel comfy when they were just on a trip and don't take covid seriously. They may also get upset when I tell them it's for covid reasons. Last moral discussion we had I supposedly ""ruined my mom's whole week"". 

I'm a person who doesn't like conflict and tend to lean more towards doing what everybody else wants... but this just feels wrong and even a little unsafe... is not going to Thanksgiving the best option?

I am also extremely sexually frustrated as I have not had any romantic experiences for three years and have to wait at least a year, or until a person likes me (which could take a long unknown period of years) relationships in general in the past have been a reflection of me, (fucked up and a mess). I have a long way to go before someone would love me.

I am also pretty autistic(diagnosed) and have difficulty understanding when people are joking with me. I get really really nasty when I am mad. I have venom in me. 

I am probably frustrated with my life too. 
Really overweight but I did just lose 30 lbs.
I wanted to be a musician my whole life but I am mediocre at best. My best option for work is retail and I am 25 and dropped out of college 4 times. I used to get depressed about this but now I just get pissed off,


I run every day, exercise, jerk off, meditate most days 10 mins, do wim hof breathwork, but I find myself saying horrible things to people all the time online and sometimes in person, if I feel slighted at all it bubbles to the surface and its bad as I am about to probably start working somewhere.

TL;DR how can I be more impeccable about my word and emotional reactions?",18Nov2020,1
506,"I am thinking about giving up. 

I am 23 years old (F) and I can‘t do it anymore. I can‘t stay strong anymore, I am starting to feel, that I am only a burden for everyone. I am losing weight, I am only 45 kilos, I don’t want to eat anymore, I don’t clean my flat anymore, and I hate it. I hate myself. 

I came in this country to help my sick father, I gave up my dream city, my studies for that. Now he is healthy again and left me here, he just disappeared and moved to an other country because he ran away from his bills. When he calls me it is only because he needs money. But I don’t have any money either. 

My boyfriend is really sick, he needs a new heart. I don’t know how long he will stay with me. I work to pay the bills, but I am really unhappy with my job. His family hates me, since we started dating, they didn’t like me, they hate me because we didn’t ask for permission to move together, they want to control everything in our relationship. I saved his life 3 times, and before I got to know my boyfriend they never visited him before. They write messages like, I am a monster and things like that. I don’t know why. I don’t even know them... they just really hate me.

My dream was once to go to the police academy now I applied, again for a long time I had some light in my life again. I was so motivated, I did sports, learned much for the test and got one of the best test results from all of the people who applied. Now they don’t want to accept my Highschool leaving certificate, because it is from another country. (I have really good grades, I speak 4 languages fluently). I already studied with this certificate at a university, I don’t understand.. My dream is falling apart again. 

I started streaming on twitch, i got since May more than 3000 followers and I have like average 20-30 viewers. But There are so many haters, they say I am ugly, have small boobs and I am thinking to stop it, it made me happy, but it doesn’t anymore. My motivation is dying and I get less and less viewers, but I don’t care anymore.

Everyone hates me, I can’t do nothing, I am just losing weight, the only thing that makes me happy is sleep. I just accepted my fate. I am a loser, everyone hates me. My mother is the only one who talks to me everyday on the phone, but she is in an other country, I miss her and my friends. I am sinking in such a deep hole, that I forgot my best friends birthday. Last year I surprised her that a flew to her country and I got in a box and jumped out of it. Now I just forgot. 

I am so alone here, I just want to sleep.

I was always such a motivated person, everyone sees me as the „little miss sunshine“. But i feel my shine is going away. I was good in everything I started, I was really good at sports, I trained 5 times a week, I don’t do that anymore, I have no energy anymore.  

I loved to cook, I don’t want to cook anymore. 

I loved to watch movies, everything is boring now.

I loved to play videogames, i find them boring now.

I loved to be Organized, I don’t care anymore. 

I loved Christmas and my birthday, now I hope I just sleep it through. It seems i will celebrate Christmas alone, because the family of my boyfriend doesn’t want me to go. But this is fine, I don’t want to stop him from
Going to his family, he loved them and I understand that. He should be with his family. 

I have strange dreams all the time, like that I am burning and that my flat burns down. Today I dreamt about that I am bleeding everywhere and   just lie in a pool of blood. 

My dreams before were like that I am flying, that I am reaching the top of the Mount Everest, and I’ve always felt happy in my dreams.

Now I am sad in my dreams as well, I want my good dreams back. I want my happiness back, I want my shine back. 
 
But maybe, in the end I am the problem. 

What should I do? I just need an advice, how do I get my motivation back? 

Thank you and have a nice day guys.",18Nov2020,1

My boyfriend has really lovely thick coily hair. He’s had it short (skin fade) for years but now wants to grow it long so he can tie it up. It’s about 2-3 inches long on top (still shorter at sides) and his hair is definitely the coiled type. However, he’s not too sure on where to start with making the coils all neat and well behaved. Some days he randomly gets a few defined cute coils and but most days his hair can’t be tamed at all! I can’t help much as I’ve got long straight hair which I don’t need to style so I’m useless!

I started in college this summer, I'm 17 now and quickly got a lot of friends here and there, one guy in particular seemed to cling to me so we've been hanging out but- recently he has been giving me some... unorthodox compliments like; ""your voice is so nice"" and ""you look really good today"" wich isn't a dead giveaway but his behaviour is just... suspicious.

I’m 16m, recently I’ve lost some hoodies in the wash. I went down to the basement where my dad sleeps and the laundry is done. I was looking around for a while, and decided to look where some of the detergent and what not is stored. On top of a metal bar in the ceiling was a cigarette box and a pill bottle. I found it really odd that he would have a cigarette box since he doesn't smoke. 

I opened up the cigarette box and there is a small twisted plastic bag where 4 pills are in. and in the pill bottle there is some more.

542,"I grew up in an abusive household. Verbal/physical/sexual/emotional/psychological, etc. at the hands of multiple adult/older family members.  I’m female in my mid-20s now and although I’m not physically near any of them, I still suffer their emotional and verbal abuse via social media and whatnot. Earlier this year I had finally gone to therapy for a short amount of time before all this covid nonsense, although couldn’t continue due to quarantine and such and I also didn’t share EVERYTHING in that short amount of time. I also do have a very supportive and loving spouse, so that has helped me work through some stuff. However, I do still struggle from flashbacks, anger, sadness, sleeplessness, nightmares, violent thoughts, etc. The thing is, even knowing now as an adult that everything people did to me was incredibly wrong and inexcusable, I still try to carry on a civil relationship with these certain family members. Even though they still try to emotionally manipulate me, constantly insult me by telling me things like I’m dumb or stupid or don’t have any authentic thoughts, say things like myself and my spouse are racist just because I married a White person, and with absolutely zero evidence of it and it’s completely untrue (Myself and my family are Hispanic/black and spouse is Caucasian and, well, this political climate, I guess.) But anytime I even slightly try to defend myself (like saying, “no I’m actually not dumb”) they attack me verbally even harder and then later try and talk to me like nothing ever happened and we are all fun loving relatives again. One particular abuser (parent) even goes so far as to say nasty things about my spouse and I and when I finally started ignoring them at the recommendation of my spouse, they tried to act all loving and say things like “What’s wrong? Why aren’t you talking to me? I love you and I would never say anything to intentionally hurt you.” Almost as if they know exactly what they said to intentionally hurt me, but don’t want to admit it? This parent has also vehemently denied ever being physically and psychologically abusive toward me throughout childhood... Logically, I know how wrong all of this behavior is. I have never, ever shared anything about the sexual abuse at the hands of certain people except with my spouse btw because I don’t think anyone will believe me, or it’ll somehow turn into it being my fault even though I was a literal child (another form of abuse was growing up with ppl making sexually degrading comments toward me, since long before I even knew what the words meant) and also because some of my siblings genuinely love this person and I’d feel heartbroken if their world was turned upside down by this thought (even though some of my siblings are also verbally abusive toward me, and this post is about them, too.) I also haven’t been able to cut ties with these people because I’d feel bad, and because I don’t want anyone asking questions like “why don’t you talk to this person or that one anymore?” It’ll just bring up questions I don’t want to answer for the above reasons. A part of me also feels like I should forgive, as I’ve never been one to hold grudges against anyone. I try not to be bitter and resentful. But at the same time, if you can really forgive stuff like that and act like it didn’t happen then why do I still feel so angry whenever I think about it? I know the same old pattern with these people. Verbal abuse, insults and emotional attacks, ignore me for a few days, then start talking to me again about mundane things like it never even happened. I’ve known this cycle my whole life, and yet I cannot bring myself to call them out on their bs and I cannot bring myself to just ignore them and cut ties with them completely. If I hate them all so much and what they’ve done and how they still treat me, then why do I still feel a sort of pity for them at just the THOUGHT of cutting ties with them? Like I’d be doing them wrong and I can’t bring myself to do it. I just keep my mouth mostly shut during the verbal abuse and then accept them back every single time they finish their rants. I actually feel like it would be wrong of me to “blame” them.... FOR THEIR OWN ACTIONS.  Why am I so angry and upset at it all, but still treat them like I care for them and like they’ve never done this to me? I can’t be the one to end a conversation no matter how trivial, I let other people end it. Even a mundane conversation about the weather, I let the other person be the one to stop texting back, for example. I can’t be the one to end any sort of friendship or relationship, I just accept it when the other person does. I kinda just “go with the flow” on everything. And I don’t understand why I’m the same way with my abusers. I tell myself every time after they do this “yeah that was rude of them to do that, but if they do THIS next time, THEN I’ll cut ties with them forever.” But the thing is, they ALWAYS do it... and I say the same thing: “that was bad but if it gets worse, or if they do it again,  THEN I’ll cut ties.” But they ALWAYS do it again. And I NEVER cut ties. I’ve even thought about giving them the same verbal treatment, but so badly that they absolutely hate me and to make THEM want to cut ties with ME, but I can’t even bring myself to do that. I want so badly to hurt them and make them feel as bad as they’ve always made me feel. I want to emotionally and sometimes even physically maim them. But I can never bring myself to do it. I don’t know what’s wrong with me and why I let this cycle repeat itself over and over again. I want to start up therapy again but it just seems like so much exhausting work to get everything out and I don’t know if I can do it. I appreciate anyone who reads this super long post.

Tldr: I don’t have the guts to treat my abusers how any reasonable person would believe they should be treated. I treat them like none of it ever happened/happens and I’m struggling to figure out why or what to do about it. Am I being too sensitive and overthinking it all? Am i exaggerating?

550,"english isnt my first language though i like to think im good at it. this glossed over a lot of traumatic events but I think this cleary explains the problem

My parents hooked up in college while my dad already had a daughter with his wife. My mom did not get along with my dad after a few years. Since I can remember all I saw was hatred when they interacted. Anyway when I was in pre preschool (3y/o) my mom moved to a nearby town with her boyfriend who was really cool about 15 minutes away in car. She left me in the same school though and decided that instead of taking me with her she would leave me with my grandparents all week and pick me up on weekends.

Because of the custody agreements, my dad got me on every other weekend. I was in a situation for years where I would live with my grandparents 5 days a week and my mom would pick me up on friday night and every other weekend my dad would pick me up from my mom's house on friday night.

I grew up of course and a few years later, when at my dads house, I would wake up on Saturday and Sunday and find bruises on my body and pains. I blamed my stepmom because it had been happening for months. I never knew for sure though. I said what happened to my mom and she didnt let my dad pick me up anymore. Go through middle school with the same kind of situation but with my mom taking me from my house every friday. I really didnt like either of my parents and for a long time i resented the idea that my parents would not want to live with me. 

Anyway that's the short version 

highschool time

Then the issue started during quarantine and my mom wanted me with her. I said no but she didn't care. FINALLY my dream come true having my mom as a maternal figure in my life for the first time.
She is a horribly selfish person. Honestly she manipulated me verbally and emotionally abused me. Her new boyfriend of only 1 year also emotionally abused me and when I said I wanted to go back to my grandparents house she said ""this is your home"".

A bit later at the last week of 10th grade I had had enough.
With fury in my soul after being denied all my requests to leave this shithole I demanded to be taken to my real home.
We fought for hours.
she made me feel like nothing
She had distorted my reality so horribly that I couldn't believe all the lies i believed

My stepmom never abused me
She had all the opportunity to raise me comfortably 
My dad fought for his right to see me
mom had physically abused me many times when I was a toddler over nothing
 
i was full of trauma and turmoil and finally understood why i felt depressed all my life. i was taken to a mental hospital you know for a ""chemical imbalance"". No one cared that my mom was shit. ""She's  your mom you should love her"". 

anyways everything went to shit 
i repressed the events again and recently remembered the depression and hatred and pain she caused me.


How do I explain to my family the pain and make them actually help me?",18Nov2020,2

He could tell I was upset because I got quiet when he started talking about it, and I asked him was she good looking and he said ""she's alright"".. and I got irritated and upset because I'm just like ""yea that's exactly what I wanted to hear that the girl you're working with is alright looking"", and I'm upset because it's like every time I get mad at him about something he's done wrong it always turns back around on me and it's so exhausting dealing with this because it's like I'm not allowed to be upset with my boyfriend at all ever or else I'm in the wrong for it.",18Nov2020,1

556,"Hi. So a little backstory. My parents aren't the best role model for how parents should be but then again no one's parents are perfect. They are still together and it's still ugly. But I've accepted it. 

I've grown up watching them constantly undermine each other, argue everyday and fight all the time. To be honest if affects all of us (the kids) but we've just gotten used to it. We haven't been on any family vacation or even outings as a family without a major fight breaking out between them.

Anyway, fast-forward to now, I'm old enough to live independently but currently I'm back at home because no job yadda yadda. And whenever it's too quiet I can hear them fighting even though they're not at that time. It's all in my head but the problem is whenever this happens I have my anxiety spiking up, I feel stressed followed by a bout of mood swings and depression. 

My parents have scarred my past but I don't want it to ruin my future. 

Is there a reason for this, why I keep hearing them fighting?",18Nov2020,1

558,"I already know I’m the asshole. I just need advice on how to fix my assholeness. Background, I have severe social/separation/abandonment anxiety. I trusted this person a lot and thought she wouldn’t hurt me like somebody else in my life has recently. She is aware of all of this. Here’s the deal:

My best friend and I agreed that we would do something together tonight and I said ‘how about we do X’ and she agreed so I said I’ll get set up for it and we can start in a minute. However, not long after she has gone off with another group of people to do something supposedly more interesting than our plans and started barely replying to me. She noticed I was a bit off and asked what was wrong but I said nothing. Then after she was done, she said it was the most fun she had had in a long time (we have been doing stuff together a couple times a week, so that made me feel like she just does those things because she feels she has to) and the whole situation upset me a lot. She knows I have a really hard time trusting people and making plans is a big thing for me because I get let down nearly every time (not usually by her). 

So I have been ignoring her messages. I am super upset and I don’t want to say something I will regret. I just don’t know what to say at all. She is trying to figure out what happened and is apologizing for ‘if she did anything’ but I don’t know how to respond. I feel like I’ve made this a massive deal when it didn’t need to be and I’ve made myself too scared to reply because I think she is going to ditch me. How do I fix this?",18Nov2020,2
560,"Hi everyone, throwaway if you can't tell by the name.

Up until recently I thought I was getting demoted, it turns out I'm losing my job!  Ah, America.

I'm taking it in stride and have had setbacks like this before.  It's led me to where I am today and I found a career I like, so I'm not \*that\* concerned.  It does create another box for me to get out of though, having a job I like means I'm only applying to those kinds of jobs.

Has anyone been in a similar situation and taken time off?  I'm not looking to go galivanting or moving to the big city, but maybe take a month off to unwind, focus on my hobbies and myself.  I'll apply to jobs that pop up but it feels like I had no time off this whole year with everything COVID.

561,"For a couple months now at my new apartment, my neighbors dog has woken me up multiple times a week. Some of my week days I don’t have to get up early for work and I am woken up between 7:30-8 because of its barking and am not able to fall back asleep (because it continues barking all day). Sometimes ear plugs work, but with sensitive ears, that often keeps me up too. Plus, I feel like I shouldn’t have to wear earplugs to sleep past 8. 

Anyways, about a month ago I left a very nice note on their door informing them as I assume it’s when they are out of the apartment that the dog constantly barks. It’s been barking since I was woken up 1 1/2 hrs ago. Not only is it annoying but I feel so bad for the dog. How can a dog consistently bark like that for so long? I asked the owner to try something to help the dog while they’re gone and I understand it’s not something that will change immediately. Well, nothing has changed and maybe I need to give it more time, but I’m tired of being woken up. What can I do? Should I write another note with ideas to soothe a barking dog?

562,"21[M] here. I feel like I’ve been very emotionally stunted, I think this was caused by my childhood ex. We dated when we were 16. She made me stop communicating with all my female friends at the time. We didn’t have sex, but we did a few sexual things. She started becoming religious over time and eventually she told me we can’t be doing anything sexual, not even hold hands. I was okay with this but then she started enforcing her religion on me. She would tell me not to masturbate and stuff like that. When I would eventually end up doing it, and she would ask and I confess that I did and she would get mad at me and stuff. Eventually I got sick of this and wanted to break up. But because we did sexual stuff before and because of the guilt from her religion she was very adamant on not having any more partners. So she started self harming and telling me it’s my fault and that she would kill herself if I leave. So I stuck with her for longer. I stayed with her like this till I was 18. Eventually I was able to break up with her. 

After this whole relationship, i’ve felt different. I thought i was just processing the break up, but it’s been 3 years and I still don’t feel the same way I did before the relationship. I feel like my feelings don’t matter and even if things hurt I should just deal with it. At times I fantasise about being intimate with women but when the opportunity arises I just can’t do it.

I’ve been on a few dates with women and it’s way more difficult to develop feelings for them. Since then I stopped looking for a girl, I know I don’t have the capacity to be intimate with them emotionally and physically.

564,"Hi,

I am seeking some guidance on how I might proceed when speaking to my local council on this issue.

I am from Wigan, UK.

The issue is that I the council received a very recent report on some children's goalposts that were left ""abandoned"" outside my property.  I don't know who made the report, but that isn't the issue.  The issue is that they appear to have acted upon this report and without seeking to investigate whom the goalposts belonged to (quite clearly this property), how long they had been left there, or why, they have taken them away, crushed them into their van and disposed of them. I witnessed them doing so, but was unable to get out of the house in time to speak to them, before they had already broken them and put them in their van.

They showed me a photo that had been taken of a PC screen with the address on, but no official documentation, no ID (although they were in council vehicles and with council coats).

My issue is that the goalposts are taken in and out of the property and are left out overnight sometimes.  It is lockdown.  My sons swimming and football lessons etc have all been cancelled and so we regularly play football on the public field behind our house.  On this occasion, as we have done quite a bit recently, we left them out overnight as we were going to play after school the next day.  They were not left in the middle of the grass, or obstructing a path, or anything like this.  They were left outside my gate, against a fence.

I have spoken to the council who have passed on my grievance.  I am just wondering if anyone would be able to offer any advice on how I (hopefully) might claim a replacement set from them.

As far as I can tell, they haven't followed the correct procedure in investigating this incident before acting and that seems to be my best hope.

I understand, before anyone says it... that if they are left on public land (even just every so often), they could be taken, broken, stolen etc.  That's fine and I accept that risk.  I just don't accept the council to be the ones stealing them...!

My son isn't home yet and he'll be gutted when he finds out that they're gone.  I hope I can get him them replaced.

Thank you for reading this and for any advice that you might be able to give me.

Cheers

So i thought it would be wise to ask people who has experience judging if these behaviors  i am going to ask are sexual behaviors or just some weird but non-sexual intimate moments shared between little girls and their mothers.

Ok ,here is the story.  When i was about 6 or  7 years old , before my adolescent,my mom would kiss my mouth ,well,no tongue sticking in my mouth ,but we would play a game the rule is  we haveto  say the same thing at the same.time  so that our lips could move together still touching each other's,if we fail to make our lips touched ,we d consider it failed.
 
Idk if i made myself clear.But i thought it was funny though.
And another one  of these weird games is that i would lie on my mother's chest 
both of us upper body naked ,and rubbing each other or something,well  i dont remember excatly what we did but  just how good it felt. oh my god ,i feel so weird about this.
And my mom likes touching me. my chest ,my belly but she never touched me down there,and she is always so possessive of me,well not only me ,there are other families.

573,"Hey, I have a problem.
My ex move country this year, I can sense she's in pain and misses me dearly. She went to Holland started a new relationship but is clearly miserable. She doesn't post on social media anymore, barely writes her friends or family. She's alone over there and seems to hate her work. She's deeply unhappy and talks about good old times but keeps a guard about moving back with me.
She's fighting to stay hard and numb, I feel her softening, I feel how badly she wants to say yes but she's afraid. How do I reassure her? How do I show her that Ive changed? How do I convince her to be honest and follow her heart.

Back story we had fights near the end, we spent nearly everyday together and she left really brutally overnight. We keep fighting until we break contact, next time we speak she's happy in a new relationship. My gut said he was a rebound, I feel I am right. She doesn't seem to like him, she's not updated her relationship status at all, no pictures of him, no selfies, no outdoor pictures, no art, just disappeared. That to me says everything. She's a very expressive intelligent woman, how do I show her that I've moved on and that I just want the best for us, I want her to know she has a home, how can I convince her to just follow her heart?

I'm following my gut and I feel that doing this helps a lot. I feel like I would give up if my gut senses nothing, but I feel how shes desperate to be vulnerable with me but is afraid, is making special effort to fight it. How do I break this barrier?",18Nov2020,2
574,"So my grandfather died a few weeks ago and I called in and had someone cover my shift but it wasn’t sudden they knew I had to be out 3 days before to scatter his ashes with my family. Well I went to visit my uncle who hadn’t been doing well since the loss and I went once at 9am and no answer to his motel door and I stayed for 20 mins knocking until I felt uncomfortable with all of the junkies scoping me out. I came back after I had lunch and al thinking he was just asleep. Still no answer I told the motel office I need to see he’s okay but the dead bolt was locked so someone obviously was in there. We got into the window thirty mins later and the front office lady found him unresponsive on the toilet. I wasn’t allowed in until EMS was there and cops went theough the room and asked me if he did drugs. Crystal meth was found on his night stand and he swears up and down it was not him and that he’s too old and in bad health to do doing that, instead it was the woman who he’s been keeping there. All her stuff was there and she had a puppy there a few days ago. People especially women take advantage of him because he gets disability and he’s always letting them stay with him when I was upset yesterday because he scared me and I normally have more than enough patience with him but I yelled at him and told him he can’t be doing that stuff but he said “I see these young girls who don’t have a place to call home and if I have room I want to help” the same womans sister took 300 out of his account and hasn’t been seen since. (He can’t walk to get his own food and eats canned food she went to go get food for him and also went to an ATM) I know he means well but he needs to be with me until he can gain weight and we find out what’s wrong with him because he didn’t know how he got in the toilet and a few days ago he passed out in the floor and was unable to get up but also doesn’t know how he got there.Cops took the meth but I needed to get him out of there. He’s coming to stay with me and I’m moving him in today because he needs out fo that situation.

They don’t appreciate me and they don’t really even like me because I’m good at what I do and I speak my mind when I have a problem... and honestly all I’m trying to ever do is be transparent.

I've been trying to deal with this for the past 4 years and now months. Ive been groped by two of my classmates (F and V), although they didnt do it together. 

F's sexual Harrasment

F was a ""nice guy"" when I met him, he had a sense of dark humor, was quiet and a talkative mix, the usual. F, my friends, and I always hang out whether it's recess, lunch or dismissal since most of us are in the same bus (including F). I don't really notice a lot of my surroundings that much because I get distracted alot, so I don't know the exact moment it started. The first time I remember him start doing that was in school, it was 2nd quarter where we were seatmates I was lying on the table not really listening to the teacher where I felt a hand in my chest, it was moving in a circular motion (forgive me Idk what that thing is called) , I couldn't move because I was scared to, I didn't know if it was chest pains or something, I needed to find out what's going on so I sprung back in the chair where the feeling stopped, I looked around that area and F acted confused I layer back down not thinking of it until it happened again, I moved a bit and I felt him removong his hand quickly. I didnt know if it was him, but I felt it. It started happening every day, everytime he was beside me. One time in computer class I was his seatmate again, I felt his hands touch my legs, then he removed it, and then he started putting his fingers inside the holes of the chair to try to cop a feel. I tried avoiding him, I would be faking sick just to be absent, try to not sit beside him if possible (he goes next to me or the teacher assigns seat),etc. this went on for months and the most traumatising thing he did to me was in February 8 2018 when we had a zumba project so we had to wear a pe uniform, it was homeroom in 2:00pm my friend brought a game to school called ""what do you meme"" and me, my teacher, my friend, and F was playing. I was sitting next to a wall. F left and we carried on, he came back but he didn't want to play the game so he just spectated, he went beside me. He started groping my chest, his right hand on my chest while his left hand was below my chair trying to use the chair's holes to poke through. I was stuck he was beside me and I can't move because I was pushed against a wall, and while all of that was happening my teacher and my friend didn't notice anything. I made a huge mistake curling myself into a ball in the chair so he can't touch me like that, but it made it worse now he didn't need to hide that much because my legs is covering my chest so his hands can go through my shirt and bra groping by chest. While that is happening he started groping my private area as well, I was stupid to not shout and tell my teacher, I couldn't speak, I was in shock, so I finished the game and went to my other friend so I can leave the space I was stuck in, I went over to them and F followed me, he was grabbing my a** and I was scared so I talked to them and asked a lot of things so my friend could follow me and hopefully F will go away, he didn't, I spent 5-10 minutes walking around the classroom with my friends trying to make F leave, he didn't and eventually they said they're tired and decided to sit down. I broke down inside and accepted defeat and sat next to my friend, F sat beside me and did it, later on it was dismissal and I grabbed my stuff after prayer (I was in a Catholic school) and left the class. He did those things throughout the whole school year. Thankfully he transferred out of the school. I decided not to tell anyone because I feared people not believing me, looking back it was stupid of me to not tell. I was scared that people won't believe me, I mean he was an old student and the class knows him, I was new so Idk if anyone would trust me of I say it. Months later I was in grade 8 and I confronted him through messenger, I asked him why he did that, but he said he didn't do any of that, i spent 30 mins telling him on what he did, but he told me he never did that, I broke down and said it was my friend who is messaging him and it was a prank, and deleted our conversation. I still regret deleting the convo, I want to know if its even possible for me to retrieve the convo, it had proof of our conversion about that in messenger, (not by deleted messages I meant the entire conversation). Still it's been 3 years since it happened and no one knows that it happened. 



V's sexual Harrasment

He was a classmate of mine as well, he didn't do stuff to me that much compared to F but it was still bad at least for me. He started groping me from grade 7 as well, I was stupid for not noticing because he would use his elbow to cop a feel at my chest and act like he bumped into it accidentally even though it was the 10th time in 5 mins, it went on until grade 9 in February 25, 2020 where I was in my classmate's house for our class project, it was 12pm and I was sitting in the couch corner and v came and sat beside me, I was stupid to not move to a different seat, he started groping my chest, I couldn't move, I don't know what happened to my mind, it's like I started blacking out in fear. I was scared, I quickly grabbed a pillow so I can cover myself in hopes he would stop, he didn't. I felt paralysed like I was scared to move and feared he might do something worse the more I try to block. I wanted to change seats, but everyone was discussing, it went on until my friend's mom picked her up and I joined her, I went home and cried for hours. 




I never told my teachers and my family, the ones I only told was my close friends that I trust. The incident is terrible, I can't sleep correctly in fear someone would do something to me while I sleep, I get scared whenever a someone is near me, I know It was my fault for this happening, for not telling anyone, not doing anything to stop it further. I just want them out of my sight. V is still my classmate and he hasn't done anything to me yet thanks to quarantine, online classes scare me every time we turn on cams and I can see his face, I get scared and want to cry because I fear they he can just pop out and do something to me, I know that's impossible but it's so hard to keep things straight. I'm scared to go back to face-to-face classes and see him again, I want to tell the teachers but I'm scared this will notify my parents and I would get in trouble, and no one will believe me because I don't have any evidence other than my words. I really need advice please help.",18Nov2020,3

He is in a loveless marriage, according to him. He is not interested in divorce, but he is interested in passion and love again. He wants to meet up with me to possibly pursue a relationship. Every time, I pull the plug. I do not want to be a bad person or ruin a marriage. I don’t think we could just be friends. I’m not sure that exists for this man. I do want to meet him.

586,"Greetings, i started a job in Human Resources about a month ago and it's been going swimmingly except for one issue, and that one is grammar.

The job is in a Spanish speaking country and while yes, i know Spanish, i am better at using and speaking English than Spanish for the sole reason i barely use Spanish on my day-to-day life ever since i am 10. I've never had a Spanish keyboard, just last year learned how to accentuate letters, and well, that's the end of it.

I have poor accentuation skills, i rely on a spell check, it's not I can't redact and write proper stuff in Spanish, is that I don't accentuate words, and just spell check all of it after i end up writing.

My boss hates that, he really, really, really does. Being that it is a remote job, i have to share my screen sometimes and even if it takes me longer to go and manually accentuate the words myself (because i am not used to at all after 12 years of writing in english), he doesn't complain, but he will the instant i pull the spell checker and spent 5-15 seconds on it.

His reasoning being i am stealing his time by doing that.

I am at a loss ... It is hard to get over something i am used to not doing, I don't have to accentuate english words and i just worried about having good redacting skills, not accentuate, i know where they go, i just don't mechanically do it.

-I have to press Win+Space bar to switch language

-Wait a couple of seconds for the keyboard to update.

-Go back to the word i wrote

-Delete the letter and press ' key + the word i have to accentuate

-And go back to my english keyboard settings, since i only have English keyboards and don't know where the other letters go on a Spanish one.

I might be being stubborn or dumb but i really am at a loss, it isn't easy to break traditions i am accustomed to, i never had this issue during university redacting class or my past jobs because i simply just spell checked it. I don't write poorly outside of not manually adding accents.

What can i do?",18Nov2020,1

592," So as you can see in the title i try to give some one i know for almost 10 years advice  
The advice is that he should grow up and learn to take responsible  
I don't really know how to start the story but ill start with me asking my friend which I will name joe  
If he want to move out with me and go to another city to further our education and be my roommate.  
A first he agree and said he would be happy to move out with me. I was also happy to move out with him but since I known him for a very long time. I though I should trust him. Just to point out it wasn't going to be only us two it was suppose to be 5 in total and when I was talking a different person he said that we should all have a little bit of money saved up. So I went to take to Joe and told him that he should get a job because you know you it cost money to move out. He understood that and then the next month he got a job at a popular supermarket. Only working 2 days a week for 5 hours daily. Everything was going good for 2 months but then school started and I notice that he was message in a group chat that we were both in during time he was suppose to be working. So one day I asked him joking hey joe did you quit your job because you started school. He response with ""I don't want to talk about "". So when I asked another friend and the other friend said ""He was too stressed out to do both school and work at the same time"". And I was like what the f\*\*\*\*d is wrong with this kid and wrote him a passives aggressive messages. The short version is if you can't handle working 10 hours an week and going to school at the same time your going to fail as an adult.  
In which he used an excuse that he has medical problem. Then after a while I started to feel bad so I talked to different friend to get more information. The kid talked to was in high school which had a lot of medical problem where he been though so many surgery as a child and he was working 20 to 30 hours every week. After talking to the kid with the medical problems it made me realize the Joe is full of shit because been to his house and never seen pill or drug or anything in the middle. With that I wrote him a message basically saying that I don't want to be friend with someone who immature. There are so many thing that he done beside this. Make angry just remembering slash writing this.  
Another thing as while he got his permit before all this stuff happened and I offered to teach him how to drive and here where I lived it 50 dollars per lesson but I was liking I am going to be a good friend and only charge him 15 dollar per lesson and a contact that if he crash my car he will pay for it and he looked at me fish eye and said that was too much an only give me 5 dollars. Really 5 dollar for a 1 hours lesson on driving. 5 Dollars can't even fill up my tank a quarter way.  
And the way I talk about the driving thing sound pretty and there a lot of some that happen and I wouldn't bring up to his face just for him to feel bad like when we hang out he 2/5 time would forget his wallet or when we will go ride bike he wouldn't have one to go so me or my friend would have to lent him one of little brother bike and remember when i said he would forget his wallet in a group chat we are both in he would always brag about how much money he has,  
I also forgot to say that he turning 20 years old soon  
I have friend who say I'm an the butt hole and should let it go but I also have friends who say that he need to grow up and stop being a child.  
So give it to me straight  what should I do  
I have though of stop talking to him forever  
Or just forgive him and let him continue acting like a kid",18Nov2020,2

The job has no financial benefits but we do get to eat for free and they are lenient about me bringing my child if I need to. I literally have no savings. I have no career plan at all. Yes, I know it's my fault and lack of determination, but I'm getting older and I have to make a change.

597,"So I'm in a Facebook group which discusses the work of the late-18th/early-19th century philosopher Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling who, to my knowledge, wrote absolutely nothing about politics. Most of the members of the group seem to be philosophy graduate students and most of the posts are either people asking questions or posting links to articles/books about Schelling. In other words nothing political. So I check Facebook earlier today and there's a normal post but I look in the comments and the first one is by a person who's name I recognize, so I google it. Turns out I was right, I did recognize his name. I recognized his name because he's a famous British Neo-Nazi. If anyone asks ill say who he is but in case it violates this subreddit's rules I won't say it here. Just to be clear, there is no doubt that he is an actual Neo-nazi, as in there are pictures of him wearing Mussolini style brownshirts, articles in academic books on the radical right about him and he's even been in jail for a year and a half for street fighting. Should I report him to the mods or could that possibly hurt me more?

EDIT: just to be clear, im asking not because im not sure if it would be right or not to report him but because he’s a very scary guy who you wouldn’t want knowing your name so if theres any chance it could backfire for some reason I can’t see I’d want to be warned. DM me and ill tell you his name (which he doesnt go to any lengths to hide so im not doxing him or anything) and you’ll know what i mean.",18Nov2020,1

I keep a Google Voice number (NY state area code) in addition to my personal mobile number (non-NY area code), and I use it when filling things out or to give out when I don't want my location easily known by the area code. I've made sure both numbers are opted out on [Whitepages.com](https://Whitepages.com), [FastPeopleSearch.com](https://FastPeopleSearch.com), [PeopleSearchNow.com](https://PeopleSearchNow.com), and [SpyDialer.com](https://SpyDialer.com).

Generally, this strategy has worked well, as I rarely receive messages or calls from unknown numbers on my personal mobile, but when I check the Google Voice app, which is synced onto my phone, I'll usually find some spam.

Last night, it seems, I received 1 text from a 248 area code (Michigan, USA) without any words. [Whitepages.com](https://Whitepages.com) reports it is a non-VOIP number. On [SpyDialer.com](https://SpyDialer.com), you can preview a number's voicemail recording, and it seems it is a number associated with TextNow.

It was a video about 10 seconds long, of a white or light-skinned Latino man speaking in English the following, wearing all black, like a SWAT team, with bulletproof vest, a Chicago White Sox cap, walkie-talkie, mask, and assault rifle, with other goons in the background in bulletproof vests, while pointing at the camera:

""...one of my girls waste time. You got fees to pay. We know exactly where you stay. Do not play wit' us, or we gon' have to look for you and your fam'ly and kill all of you. Now...""

Towards the end of the video, he picks up the assault rifle as if to aim it, but not at the camera.

Is this something I should report to 911/local police?

I should note, that despite this strange video text, I do not feel like I am in any danger, nor my family.",18Nov2020,2

Online labs have been a disaster as we are actively learning nothing. I have absolutely no clue what to do, I’m incredibly stressed.

607,"I’m a sophomore in college. I applied to transfer to a larger and better school next fall. I currently am at what I thought was my dream school, and so far it’s been eh to say the least. I had a really hard time making friends my freshman year (we’re currently on zoom for the year sooo) and that changed once I joined my fraternity but, a fraternity can only help so much with making campus feel like “home”. I got accepted at the larger school also. I just feel like if I go to the other school next fall, I’d be able to “restart” and meet more people. Maybe even find a solid relationship? Lol. 

I would need to maintain at least a 2.5 gpa for my major (which if I have below a 2.8 cumulative by the end of this semester, then I think it would be too risky for me to go because if I have to transfer back, that’d be embarrassing). I’d also have to take sophomore year over again because of my major requirements. I’d be commuting 30 minutes (which isn’t bad, I like driving). I also have my family down there as well. I was in town at my current campus the other day and I was walking around and thinking to myself “this is a really nice place” and it gets me all disappointed. 

When I think of the new school, I think of more opportunities, being able to reinvent myself, a bigger fraternity chapter. When I think of my current school I think of what could’ve been, a cute and small campus. But then I also think of how many times I’ve sat bored in my dorm freshman year and wanting to go home. Both of my parents went here and my mom has been urging me to stay to fill the “legacy” her and my father left behind. My father on the other hand wants me to do what I feel is best for me. We had elections last night with our fraternity and the new president said that we will become involved more on campus once we are back in person and the culture of the chapter will change. I’m extremely indecisive. Let me know what you all would do. THANK YOU!",18Nov2020,1
609,"Ok, so this might be a long one.

My sister is in her final year of secondary school and is due to take her exams in May/June. It is early but due to the covid lockdowns, mock exams and her, frankly, low grades so far, we have started to study now.

However, she has absolutely no motivation to revise and, at school, she has terrible anxiety issues. For example, a couple times, her friend wasn't going in to school so she broke down and begged to stay home, crying.

She always says that she doesn't need to revise because they do some revision at school but, they also did this when I was at school and, while helpful, isnt enough. 

To get to the point though, I don't think she just doesn't care about education, I think she just feels hopeless. She hates revising because it exposes all she doesn't know and struggles with and instead prefers to distract herself with video games and watching YouTube. This also makes sense why she hates going to school when her friends aren't there. Anyway,I try to get her to revise with me every day for an hour but I can tell she finds it very hard to understand stuff, especially maths where it's easy to miss a step and find it all confusing.

To also add in the mix, my single mother, who also did not get any qualifications, is getting seriously frustrated about my sister's apparent lack of care when it comes to her exams. To be fair, I can't blame her. My mum's been between minimum wage jobs her whole life and I think she's scared of my sister having the same life however, I am sure that this is not helping my sister want to revise and I reckon she feels like she's getting told off for something she doubts she could even do.

My sister also does not like taking part in family activities such as watching TV, going on walks etc but I want to find something we can all take part in because, hopefully, this would help her feel like we aren't fighting against her. 

Anyway, thanks for reading this mix of rambling and advice seeking all the way through. Any and all suggestions will be extremely appreciated.",18Nov2020,2

My grandmother passed away the morning of a holiday, so obviously what was supposed to be a festive celebratory day went to complete shit. I had brought my roommates to my home that weekend in order to celebrate so they were there when my family got the news. The weekend of they sort of awkward about it in that they sort of acknowledged that it had happened but went about the rest of our weekend completely normal. It felt like I had to put up a front of being ok even though I wasn’t because it didn’t seem like they cared about what happened or wanted to support me. Same happened when I came back to school, neither of them checked in on me or brought it up or asked if I were ok or anything. I’ve had some ups and downs with them in the past as well which I’m pretty sure stems from my depression and jealous tendencies, but I’d told them in the past that when I feel like this I don’t like to be left alone and would rather them pull me in or come to be or something, which they agreed to do but it still feels like they aren’t. I’m naturally a very physical person and physical comfort helps me a lot but they don’t seem willing to do even that for me, even though they cuddle with each other nonstop.

612,"Hi!

Im not very well-spoken so bear with me, I live in a very conservative family, in a very conservative country, obviously not great because of the beliefs that I hold as well as my sexuality, my mother and I have never gotten along. We would fight non-stop over very idle things, and it's gotten to the point where I can't even bother talking to her. I feel like I can't have an opinion, even on little things, I can't have a rational conversation with her about any remotely controversial topic because then I'm an incompetent teenager who can't think for herself. I am treated the same as my 6-year-old sister, as in the exact same in everything, which I feel like I should be treated with a little more independence, but alas. 

I cannot for the life of me get her to respect me and my privacy to any extent She isn't physically abusive (not really at least), but she is extremely mentally abusive, Her comments on my sister's weight ( she isn't even remotely overweight) drove her to starve herself, which prompted my mother to go on about how my sister is a stupid idiot that cant takes care of her self. Her comments (and stuff my dad did) towards me drove me to extreme depression and attempted suicide at some point( she found me and started screaming to me about how ungrateful I am) (anytime I try to explain how I feel or how something she may have done hurt me she start telling me about how I would be nothing without her because she gave birth to me, feeds me, taught me everything I know, etc. she also brings up every petty mistake I may have made in my life). My dad, however, is more bearable, but I think that's because he isn't home as much (my mom is a stay at home mom) I try to stay calm but I always end up breaking down, I've always struggled with my mental health and my sexuality (they will never know about the last part ill prolly be disowned) 

My dad has extreme anger issues (so does my mom but My dad is worse). My sister and I were bickering about a charging outlet AS ALL SIBLING BICKER. So I complained (immature on my part) thinking my dad would be rational and try to compromise; instead, he chased me around the house, dragged me by my hair, I tried to get away, but he pulled mine by my hoodie, my lip was cut in the process and got two bruises and skinned my hand. It got to a point where my mom had to get in between us, as well as one of the nannies, and he then wanted us to apologize for disrespecting HIM, by arguing with each other. The thing is my parents continuously argue, and it gets to extreme points sometimes. I'm not an angel, and I would admit if I made a mistake, but my parents NEVER DO, they never want to say they are wrong. I've made mistakes (not major I don't do drugs, sex, or parties, etc.) I'm a kid I'm learning, I shouldn't be afraid to tell my family something because of how they may react. ( my parents are very religious, I'm not, but I wouldn't dare tell them). I don't know what to do. I feel absolutely worthless and unloveable. I'm insecure to a point where it's not even funny, and it's all because of what my mom tells.

614,"I'm a 17-year-old in high school but due to some personal events in my life I want to take my GED and get high school over with, I talked to my parents about this and they said they'll let me drop out and take the test but only if I come up with a plan after I pass on what to do next. I love digital art and want to go to art school or collage (money is not a issue to pay for these things), but I was thinking of doing something like
1. Study and get GED
2. Study and take ACT/SAT
3. Get enrolled to a community college then a 4-year university
4. Get hired as a graphic designer w/ selling my own art on the side

I'm young and dumb so this is all I can really come up with, but the end goal is to be able to financially sustain myself with my art career, so if there is any advice on how to get to this point or anything I'm missing in the list, your advice will be appreciated, thank you in advance.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm from the EU and I've recently got an offer from my best friend's father to live with his family in Canada (for free, including the food, I just have to clean the house and stuff like that). Obviously they want to help me with my studies, but I'm seriously not sure. Is a Masters in Literature/Creative Writing/Play Writing worth it? I mean, I do have a home and food for free which many people would find lucky to have, but I'm really scared of going into debt and not doing anything with my degree. (Why would you hire someone with a Bachelor from Romania?)

They also said that they want to help me get a citizenship.

Thoughts?

633,"I currently live out of my car and work maximum hours to pay for bills, necessities, and savings for when I can finally move into my own apartment. It's not easy working 12 hours every single day, but I've been doing so for about 3.5 months and have been able to pay off a lot of debt and alleviate many money stressors

I don't think my company liked that myself and others worked all possible hours earning at least $1000 a week, so they made a lot of changes that made it harder to earn as much. They also made it harder to track how much we made. Shift bonuses were removed and replaced with a smaller bonus for long distance single-orders or doubles only. Considering there was a lot of downtime I thought this was fair, I'd just work the busier parts of our map to make up for loses.

My first week on this new system I made $800. I was sceptical about how little this seemed so I asked dispatch and apparently the new bonus system was not automatic like the previous one. Additionally, I was supposed to keep track of my applicable bonuses. That's not a problem, but at first I wasn't sure if I would have to do that or not so I asked. No reply until 4 days later, after the payments were already deposited. Thankfully I was able to get the money added but I'm sure a lot of my co-drivers aren't going to ask about it and will end up losing money they rightfully earned.

It's not unusual for a payment to be missing every now and again, but I've been catching bigger and bigger missed earnings and report almost daily. I get it reinstated to my account but it almost seems as if this company is trying to find every possible way to make us lose money and earn well below minimum wage

Fast forward to these past two days. On Monday I wasn't paid for an order immediately after I finished delivering, which has never ever happened before, so I told dispatch and they told me the systems were slow and it'll catch up. Immediately after they gave me 6 orders to deliver over an hour away, making me waste gas and time on orders I could have been delivering at my present location. The way the delivery system works doesn't allow for cross delivery zone orders, but here I was now crossing 3 different areas for only 6 orders. I could have done at least 10 orders in the time it took to finish these. When I was done I asked (politely) to not be given another set like that again. Yes this is a gig job and ""who am I to make demands yada yada"" but they knew this set was total shit and that I basically made no profit

Yesterday I was asked if I could deliver another set of orders, again an hour away. I rejected at first but was told that all other 21 drivers were busy, and if I didn't do it they wouldn't be delivered. Total bs but I took the orders anyway since I had a half day and the earnings would guarantee at least a half day's work. During the middle of my pick ups I received a company text that stated ""many orders in (the area I was already at) needed to be delivered"" and to sign in. I was already there. And signed in. ??????

I asked dispatch what was going on and was told that I was ""given special orders and I might earn more than other drivers"", which would never be true since the gas costs would cut into my earnings significantly. When I finally completed the 3 hour journey to deliver only 7 orders, they had the gall to send me another order that would require me to drive 45 minutes back to where I was originally, just to deliver a single drink. This was 30 minutes before operations would close for the night. I (still politely!!) informed dispatch that I was 45 minutes away and would be clocking out, and all I got back was a ""goodnight :]""

I don't understand why I'm getting punished for wanting to make sure my earnings are correct. If im giving 84+ hours of my life away weekly I'm going to make sure every minute is accounted for. Online the indeed job advertisement now states that we make minimum $15.50 an hour, which isn't the greatest (for where I currently live), but for two days I've made $10-$12 an hour, less if I account for the gas used

Before I get any ""find a new job"" messages I am already working on it, I don't want to make less than what I am right now but with covid and no housing it's hard to figure things out. I'm willing to bet that they're going to withhold giving me orders unless I commit to driving these tiny sets for purposely long distances. I'm so sure that I'm the only one being made to do this. NOT TO PULL ANY GOOFY RACE CARDS or anything but I am probably the only black person working for this predominately x-race company. I hope that isn't a factor contributing to why this is happening but at this point I wouldn't be surprised",18Nov2020,1

637,"Hi folks.  Just reaching a point of desperation with this situation, perhaps by proxy since my wife (and to lesser extent wife's sister) are dealing with their mother and not me.  Just hoping for ideas.  I'll keep it short!

Backstory: We're in Texas.  Wife's mother owns a rental house a couple of hours away in a small rural town.  The house is not in greatest shape, but I would consider it mostly livable.  It needs some repairs no doubt, but the tenant inside is not currently raising issue &amp; is a (distant) friend of the family.  That said, tenant and mother-in-law have often argued in the past, typically about late rent and/or needed repairs that never got done.  My wife has had to act as intermediary a number of times when they couldn't reach resolution on their own.

Problem: Wife's mother can barely keep her own affairs in order, and has no business being a landlord.  She has wrecked her car a couple of times in the last year or two, such that her insurance is now over $300/mo.  She was driving without insurance for a while after the latest accident, and didn't even know it until my wife stepped in.  She's always needing my wife's assistance with day to day things like keeping track of financial or bills accounts, logins, passwords, certainly anything related to technology of course, or even just using her phone.

She claims that she needs the $500/mo rent coming from the property, which to some extent is true, but she has SS and some retirement coming in as well (just over $2k monthly from those).  We're worried that any potential liability which could arise from the rental property outweighs that income she's getting from it.  And frankly we're just tired of dealing with this rental property business on top of all the other things she needs help with.

Well, I will leave it at that for now.  Appreciate any advice!",18Nov2020,1

So here's a little backstory  
For the past 8 years, I've been working in agriculture, as an advisor to governmental organizations, international NGOS, private businesses and various startup accelerators. Things were coming along beautifully until the start of the year when the pandemic hit.  


I quarantined but somehow still got COVID-19, so I was stuck at home. Around this time, I was still working remotely but, due to the moronic attitudes of higher-ups where I consulted, remote opportunities started drying up. I thought it'll be alright, I've experienced dry periods before, you just have to ride the wave. I had enough savings in my account that I could pay the bills paid.  


That was 4 months ago. At this moment, I have about 2 months of savings left and I'm bouncing from couch to couch, trying to figure out how to get back on my feet but its just beyond difficult. Thankfully, my grandparents have asked (basically told me) to come stay at theirs until I stabilize. Thankfully, have a roof over my head and food for some time because of them but I don't want to mooch off them. They won't take a dime off me but it's not right for a grown man to be mooching off his grandparents.

I've been working since I was 16 (I'm 30 now) and I've never been this close to being broke.   


I've tried freelancer sites like upwork but no one's replied or even sent an interview.  


I need help and I'm just trying to figure out how I'm to survive but my entire network has dried up.

My skillsets are

1. Business Plan Design 2. Pitch Deck (I've helped raised funds for NGOs, Governmental Organizations and Startups) 3. Wordpress Design (I can build websites, shopify stores etc...) 4. A little bit of UI/UX 5. Presentation Design

1. Burn out from school and work. 

2. No motivation.

3. Mental illness (depression, anxiety, and ADD)

Last Wednesday when my best friend call me and said ""I can't take it anymore, I will break up with my boyfriend"" and I dedicate all afternoon to listening to my friends problems in relationship and advise him of how to understand what was his feelings and make a good decision about the love-problem. SPOILERS: he decided to break up but it turns out that he didn't. 😒

671,"Not really sure if this fits here, but every year my parents put together a photo album to gift everyone on Christmas. I noticed while they were working on this year's that I don't like a single photo they've added of me. I have older and younger siblings who are all much thinner than me and it's very noticable in the photos. Since we've been quarantining, there's not that many other photos to choose from, but I don't think it would matter anyway.
Corona has been a great time for my overall all mental and physical health. I've been able to exercise more and have become more fit. On top of that, not constantly being around other teenagers has helped improve my self esteem. I've even been complimented a few times on looking better and healthier. But everytime I look at photos of me, whether they're from a year ago or a week, they still seem the same. I still seem fat and ugly and I am still very clearly different from my siblings. This is disturbing to me, because what I see in the pictures is not at all what I see when I look in the mirror. 
It just feels like everytime my self esteem is doing well, I see some photo and feel like it was all for nothing.
I guess I need advice on how to appreciate my hard work more, and notice good things about myself instead of everything that's wrong
I'd really really really prefer to not involve my parents. This journey has been something I've worked through on my own, and I'd like it to remain that way. I don't want them to try to help and end up putting external pressure on me.

673,"So, my (20F) whole life I have never experienced romance. I have messed with guys but it was either just for sex or money (not proud). I have caught feelings twice but it never was more than just sex. After my first heartbreak, it changed me in the way that I don’t wish/expect anything more than sex. I feel as if them having sex with me is in a way an accomplishment and I should be happy that I’m getting that. I ask people (girls and guys) why no one seems to be interested in me and they say I just have a unique personality and most guys aren’t used to my eccentricities. I don’t think I’m that different but I do agree that I have a big personality. 

I also have an external hemorrhoid. It’s not huge but it is noticeable and from my opinion unpleasant to look at. This prevents me from trying different positions because I don’t want the guy to find me disgusting. I did go to the doctor about it but they really don’t want me to have the surgery because I’m so young and it will most likely come back again. So I’m starting to think that I maybe shouldn’t be messing with guys at all and should probably just be alone because it’s not fair to them that they can’t do their favorite positions.

I guess what I’m asking is would it be damaging to be okay with not being the girl guys want to date? I think it’s crazy to lie to myself and keep trying at romance when time and time again it’s shown that I’m not the girl for that. I would love to be in love but just by looking at my life I’ve realized that no one’s ever loved me (I have no family and my friend group will most likely be nonexistent after graduation in May) it’s really just me and my dog. People look at me crazy when I talk about this but I really don’t understand the irrationality. Any advice?",18Nov2020,2

675,"I'm in my first year of a challenging grad program. I've been meeting with my therapist of 3 years regularly throughout this time, talking about the challenges and the ups and downs. There have been some really intense times this semester. It's been incredibly helpful to have her there so that I can have support and not lose momentum. I'm also building a healthy romantic relationship, and I've found it really helpful to explore that process with my therapist. I feel like I've been really growing a lot in the last few months.

Suddenly though last week, my therapist told me she can't work with me anymore. She says she feels like she doesn't have the competency to work with me. And that I need to find someone else who specializes in the areas she feels I need.

And just like that...she's gone. 

I feel so distressed about this. I'm not ready to let go, and I had no warning, and I didn't do anything to deserve this. She acts like getting a new therapist is such a simple thing. I've been looking for days now. No one takes my insurance. 

I also dont understand her reason for doing this to me. I haven't been mean or disrespectful to her. The work we do together is incredibly valuable for me, and I've been growing so much! This other area that she thinks is a vital part of my treatment (that she doesnt have competence in) is BARELY affecting my life. Up until she terminated me, I was functioning and growing and getting stronger and more independent. But now with this sudden loss and the really stressful way it happened I feel like Im falling apart. 

I can barely get out of bed. I spend the whole day crying. Nothing feels important anymore, not even grad school.

I can't handle this. I haven't been able to find a new therapist. I don't know what to do. And even if I find a new therapist, I just feel so jaded. How can I trust someone new if everyone important to me keeps disappearing. 

She means so much to me. I can't lose her. I can't do this without her.",18Nov2020,0
676,"So as the title states I'm trying to encourage my 10 year old daughter to continue her interest in animation and digital art.

So rewind a few years and her mother and I had gotten her a tablet which of course she did what other kids do and got games and other little fun apps but overtime she started looking for more apps that allow her to create small animations and rudimentary digital art.

Over the past few years though her interest in digital art and animation has only grown after finding some basic no-name apps that allow her to do so. Right now she is at a point where she wants to create animations (like what she sees on YouTube, think JaydenAnimations).

My question is, with Christmas around the corner I was going to buy her an actual name brand (Samsung) tablet with some styluses as a good starting point for her, what apps would be good for an aspiring artist such as herself given her age and experience?

I have also held down 2 jobs at one point while being in college and was able to keep my 3.0 GPA. Own 2 vehicles and pay my own bills. The problem isn’t my work ethic or money, the problem is my parents. 

I have never had a good relationship with them my entire 20 years of living. My father worked all my childhood so my mother could finish college and I was often times left alone or with my grandparents. Obviously stressed they would fight a lot and be angry at me or freak out, this made me resent them. I can’t get into detail but I will say there was lots of physical punishment and verbal abuse. One of the worst things my father ever said to me was “if me and your mom get a divorce it’s your fault”. These idiots, instead of taking the time to teach right from wrong and resolve the situations properly. Now growing up it’s still verbal abuse especially now that covid is around. I get yelled at for basically going to WORK to make MONEY to pay for MY BILLS. I get it covid is a big deal but we take precautions by wearing masks, sanitizing everything and ourselves, and actually social distancing unlike some jobs. I get yelled at if I want to go on a drive by myself out in the countryside, or if I even wanna go to my girlfriends house and stay inside at her house not even going out to party or anything. I was not like them when they were younger I don’t like partying or that crowd I like driving and relaxing with close friends or working on cars. Is that so bad haha.

Now that you got some background they already knew I was ready to move the f**k out. Only issue is I need help like literally informational help.

He is widely accepted by his friends and I've shown nothing but support, I know he is such a wonderful and beautiful boy and how much greatness his future holds for him. Even with letting him do 'his own thing', I keep trying to keep him in line and not go too wild. We've left a 6 months rehab program for hard drugs lately, and I do trust him when he tells me that he's doing better. Today he told me he would like to try stripping, because he thinks it's cool and a nice workout. 

As a mother, I'm very happy that he has grown to love and appreciate his body, and I don't necessarily find that choice of job harmful, but my main concern is that this path will draw him back into his awful habits. I have let him go too loose before, and I'm not sure how to keep him safe while respecting his wills and wishes. 

He is seeing a therapist weekly, who reached out to me the other week letting me know that there will be a change of dose with his medication, therefore there might be intense mood swings during the following weeks.

682," I want to cut my mother and sister off financially. I've been paying bills for my mom since my first job at 16. I'm nearly 27 now, and my mother still calls and texts to ask for money. Sometimes she tells me why she needs it, sometimes she doesn't. Sometimes it's frivolous, sometimes it's a light bill. In college, I would send her thousands from student loan refunds and then work 3 jobs to pay the bills I was supposed to use the loan money for. I did it, and continue to do it, because I've only had a positive relationship with her when I'm sending her money. I felt hated by her growing up, but she's so much more supportive now and I crave that. She has also plunged me into debt from opening credit accounts when I was underage and not paying them off. My therapist calls all of this financial abuse. Problem is, my mom is working on a disability claim that she has been for five years. She quits every job she gets because it's uncomfortable or they aren't 'paying her what she is worth'. I even let her use my Uber Driver and Instacart accounts which she got banned from for cancelling too many jobs because they didn't seem worth it. She has struggled financially for years, but I can't help but feel like her troubles are 80% her fault.

My sister, on the other hand, had a baby and kind of expected her family to just come through and support her with whatever she needs. I've sent so much money out of pure guilt and worry over that innocent child, but my sister has a habit of squandering all of the money she gets on partying without any regard for what bill is due or what household product she will need in a week. She gets hundreds in food stamps (thank goodness), plus a certain amount of formula every month, but she still calls me for money because she has somehow run out. The problem is obviously that she has this innocent baby that I don't want to see on the street. But also that she has a mental disorder that she refuses to seek treatment for that makes her incredibly impulsive and irresponsible.

Not to mention that we are in the middle of a pandemic and financial crisis country-wide.

From my end, I'm married and my husband and I are both working. We've been struggling to conceive for a little while now and are going to start seeing doctors about it. We rent a home, have two car payments, and are paying our way through grad school, but we also have two roommates (we just love having roommates). Technically, I can afford to keep sending my family money. It causes a lot of distress whenever they ask as I feel personally responsible for their well-beings, but I'm tired of this. After checking, I've sent thousands this year alone. The number over the past decade would be embarrassingly large. My husband is also getting frustrated but mostly because he knows how much it bothers me to keep having to do this.

So, after all that, would it be wrong for me to cut my mom and sister off financially? Any advice on how I could go about doing this would be great! Please let me know if further information is required to make a judgment call on this, and thank you to anyone who responds.",18Nov2020,2
683,"After college, I was given a job offer with a company I had an internship with about 2,000 miles from my hometown.  I was hesitant at first because I wanted to stay in my hometown with my family and friends, but I decided I should try something new and break out of my comfort zone.  


It has been 2 years since I have moved and I am at a low point in my life and totally depressed.  I tried for awhile to make friends and I found people to hangout with, but I have always been a small group of close friends sort of person, so I have not found many relationships out here to be genuine and make me happy. And now a couple months ago, the only single person I sorta enjoyed seeing moved to a different state so I have felt totally alone for months during this pandemic. 

I still play video games with friends from back home daily, but I hear about to the plans they make for weekends and trips and it makes me so sad I can't join in with them.

&amp;#x200B;

My biggest hesitation moving home is job security.  Obviously right now the job market is miserable and it would be quite risky to drop a guaranteed, well paying and forward moving job to move back home.  However this entire past year has been miserable for me and my physical and mental health continue to dive with no end in sights.  I have tried many times to help myself but I keep falling back into the same rut.

I have some money saved up and my prospective plan would be to move back home with parents for a couple months while I hardcore search for a job, and then to move out to my own place in the same city when I am a bit more stable.

&amp;#x200B;

I think the move would be amazing for my mental health, it would help me find a job I actually enjoy and I would be able to see my friends and family again finally.  I have a really good relationship with my family and it breaks my heart to be unable to see them regularly.   


Has anyone been in a similar situation to this? I really need some push to make the move because I know it would be best for me, but I have some mental block telling me this is a bad idea.

There is a disabled elderly individual that I call E. They live with their adult child (C.) C is in their late 30s, and is disabled themselves. Their disability stems from an unhealthy lifestyle, while E's is strictly medical and causes them daily pain and inability to care for themselves. They are mobile, but can not shower, walk very well, or do household chores. 

C does not help their parent in any capacity. On the contrary, they rely on E to prepare meals, run errands, do laundry and other household chores, and handle C's money for them. The house itself is falling apart, and is completely filthy on the inside. 

I have been in the picture for quite a while due to a mutual acquaintance. Once I discovered the problems in this household, I began funneling all of my free time into caring for E. I recieved no payment, and eventually C began taking advantage of me for reasons other than direct care for their parent. Including asking me for money, trying to get me to rearrange their bedroom, and perform home repairs and errands. 

The duties I would perform for E included showering, cleaning, meal prep, physical therapy, and transporting to and from doctors appointments. I decided to distance myself due to C's meddling and refusal to help their parent. 

The other night, I ran into E at the store, and they informed me that they had not been given a shower or had any assistance with physical therapy or chores since I had been over last. I haven't seen them for over a month.

Recently, I’ve started seeing a younger guy in the gym a couple times. 

Everyone in the gym always asks other gym members if they should wear a mask or not as a courtesy, so I’ve talked to him once before asking if he’d like me to wear my mask. Other than that, we’ve made no other verbal contact. 

However, yesterday, as he was about to leave, he comes over and introduces himself and gives me a fist bump (ew, in a pandemic?)

It seems to me like it would be innocent. However, I have a bad track record of believing in the best and getting burned. I have a very bubbly personality and I constantly encounter men who misinterpret that. He seems like he’s a nice, normal person, but it does strike me as odd to introduce yourself at the gym. The only reason I am being hyper-vigilant is because it is often that we are in the gym alone and I want to stay safe.

I have a drug test in exactly a week, I already have a few things I'm prepping to do prior so I can hopefully pass. I am a consistent marijuana user of 3 years, smoked pretty heavily.

My checklist includes:
- Drinking 1.5-2 gals daily
- Working Out In Layers of Clothes
- Sauna 2x a Day
- Running 2x a Day in Layers of Clothes (In Florida)
- Detox Prior

702,"Long story short I have spent almost half of a year getting my hair to how I want it. Think of Keanu Reeves in John Wick, that is the hairstyle I was going for and I have finally achieved it after many many months.

Today I went to get a slight trim just to make it a tad bit shorter since I overgrew it slightly. Let me emphasize, I WENT FOR A SLIGHT TRIM and even emphasized that I want to keep it long just to have the dead ends cut 

By the time my haircut was finished I realized my mistake in that I should have never went to the haircut place today and should have just stayed home. Somehow a “slight trim” translated to “make me look like Mark Zuckerberg” and now all of my months of growing my hair is fucking gone. I look like an absolute chode now and all of those months I spent getting my hair how I wanted it is now just gone

The first girl is my ex-girlfriend of 3 years and we broke up before college and left it on good terms, however, I feel she is more inclined to get back with me than I am with her. Also I know hooking up with your ex is never smart, but still very tempting. Another girl I had a brief fling with a while back and she is still in love with me and it’s most definitely best for me to avoid her but she is so sweet and beautiful. The third girl is very promising and kinda wants what I want but my family doesn’t get along with hers and it would have to be a secretive thing. The fourth option is my best friend for many years who I am so close with and would probably just casually hookup with but I don’t want to ruin the friendship.

710,"So... I have been friends with my sister since we were two. In high school her mother adopted me and then vacated her guardianship. Since then me and my sister have drifted apart. Things are the same when we see each other but we went years barely talking and still do so infrequently. It was a traumatic time for us when we grew apart and I wouldn’t say it’s anybody’s fault per say. However I don’t have much family and she was that for me and so there have been multiple times where we both agree that she should’ve have been there. (There are probably times I could have been there but she didn't reach out or I just was unaware.) Her mother and I haven’t spoken or seen each other in 8 weeks years. 

Meanwhile her high school boyfriend (freshman to senior year, following summer) and I stayed close. We went a couple of years without seeing each other (due to my toxic ex) however he continued to reach out, respond and invite me places. Something my sister did not. We now consider each other best friends. He truly is my best friend in all definitions of the word. 


The problem is he has expressed strong feelings for me. They are not totally unwarranted or unwanted, I love him deeply and have thought of him romantically before. HOWEVER, he is my sisters FIRST love. This feels sacred and as our relationship is just now beginning to TRULY mend itself. I don’t want this to get in the way. My sister has said causally that she wouldn’t mind if we dated a few years ago, I was with someone else so I just told her we weren’t cause we weren’t. But now that I am thinking about it I’m wondering if it’s worth talking to her about it.

711,"I need advice on how to handle stress, specifically when thinking about future finances and kids.

My fiance and I are about to move in together into our first home and we are very excited! We've gone through our finances and everything is looking good to go. My fiance is a teacher and I am studying cybersecurity (working part time in the meantime too, as well as receiving VA educational stipends.)

I can't seem to shake worry over finances once we decide to have kids. I want to be able to stay home at least 6 months with the (hypothetical) baby. If it were a perfect world I would stay home until they were 1 or 2, but that's just not practical. 

We both plan on working throughout our marriage, but emergencies and accidents come up. And there is always the risk of an unplanned (early) pregnancy.  How do y'all (I'm genuinely asking) deal with the financial stress? I am very excited to start living together and one day have children with him. I feel as though we have both planned fairly well financially and are level-headed with money. We both especially want to prioritize saving. But thinking about medical costs, childcare costs, and a lack of proper maternity leave has me feeling so stressed. And this is a good 4-5 years away!

\* cyber security is in demand (especially in my area), but it's a competitive field and I want to plan for the worst.

Now as for wanting to do 23 and Me, my dads side of the family has issues... They usually live long but have a history of cancer, as well as depression and alcoholism. My Uncle also died from severe epilepsy and my Aunt, his sister also has it. Not to mention I have a really odd immune disorder that essentially means every time I get really sick my body launches enough white blood cells that doctors call it psuedo luekemia because of the symptoms, as well as a blood disorder where our hemoglobin doesn't carry iron coagulance well and it's definentively inherited because my grandma, mom, and I all have it. 

So the question is, could doing the test which may reveal something related to my TBI affect my lawsuit which is in limbo because of Erisa liens allowing my health insurance to make a claim against my car insurance which didn't pay anything (my car insurance can pay up to 100k in medical) and we have paid out of pocket around 9k already.

We can't risk losing the 50k from my insurance because I am disabled from my CRPS and TBI. So would it be wise to not do the test?",18Nov2020,0

Unfortunately, things did not work out and I came back to live in my parents house and attend a local college. After a couple of years of living with them and attending the college, I ended up finding my former fiancé. We are engaged now and have moved into our own apartment that is 2 hours away from my house.

She always asks me where I am at, what I’m doing, who I’m with, etc. They expect me to visit them every month and “sleepover” at their house.

718,"Kind of long post, my apologies in advance.

I (19f) have dealt with various mental health issues since I was about 9 years old as a result of psychological, emotional, and some physical abuse. After graduating high school and moving out of state for college last year, I felt better than ever. I was more confident and outgoing, and I had a decent social life.

Once I had to move back home for the pandemic, I slipped back into my old, depressed, anxious self. My parents were constantly fighting and using me as an emotional punching bag (no physical abuse, just projecting their emotions onto me). I met my current boyfriend online during this time and we began a long-distance relationship. He knows all about my past and current issues and is incredibly supportive and loving.

Now that I’m back at college, I still feel depressed and anxious. I am seeing a therapist, but it isn’t working. I isolate myself and only see my roommates and boyfriend, partially due to social distancing and partially due to my mental state. I feel embarrassed and anxious when I spend time with other people, roommates and boyfriend included. I worry that I am annoying them and/or draining their energy. I extremely dislike myself because of my mental issues, and I worry that my close people will soon start to dislike me for that reason too.

Last night she was texting him a lot she said it was nothing. I’m not proud of it but while she was sleeping I wanted to see why she was texting her ex a lot more than me.

730,"Quick background, I (25m) work on the civilian side of law enforcement. I have no desire to become an officer which means my job will always be stable, but I will pretty much always be an afterthought and will probably never get the opportunity to move directly up the ladder. (A lot of horizontal movement that slowly climbs you upwards is how a lot of people get to the higher positions of civilian work.)

Due to this, and the fact that in my current position there is a severe lack of communication and as close to ""justified"" verbal abuse as you can get without getting written up I've been secretly testing the waters of changing jobs. I've had 2 interviews with a company and they seem to really like me, the problem is the huge risk I am taking if I'm transferring jobs. These are the pros and cons I can think of and I really would like to hear other peoples opinions on what they think I should do because I have a tendency to overthink every situation.

Changing jobs pros:
- I get out of an agency that operates in a way I fundamentally disagree with. (Lack of communication is what it boils down to, the only people who deserve information are the people who are ""important"")

-If all works out I will eventually make more money than is ever possible at my current job.

-If they are telling the truth, I will be seen as actually important in the new company and they only promote from within. (Actually not possible where I'm at because, again, Im not and never will be an officer.)

-I really like the way the company I have applied for says that they operate. I never thought I would find myself in sales, but I can be pretty good at it and with the way they explained everything I would most likely be in sales less than a year before I would be training others and taking on a more executive role. (As long as I bust my ass and get work done, but with my mindset thats not really a problem.)

-I would actually be able to work at work. This is going to sound strange, but due to the nature of my job and the lack of communication listed above most information is never passed down to my team or me so we sit around a lot and just wait to be told to jump.

Cons of switching jobs:
-During training I will take a significant pay cut from what I make now even if you add on the commission. Training will be around 2-3 weeks.

-Until I reach a more executive position a good portion of my revenue will come from sales. Its not that I'm worried about never selling what my company offers, its more about the unpredictability and the fact that I haven't ever relied off of a commission check to live comfortably before.

-My current job is STABLE. Best part about county work, you may not get rich, but you will live comfortably. I will always have a stable paycheck to live off of while I am here, however if I switch jobs and fail the agency is the type of employer who will not take me back on because I left.

-We may be going back into lockdown and when I asked that question during my interview today I know that the company closed for 2 of the months, but they still got their base pay. Which is great, but I was considered an essential worker and was very fortunate to work through the first lockdown.

-I love my actual job that I do. It involves helping people and getting to connect with the communities in my area and I love it... I just don't actually get to do it very often.

Lastly, it may just be the timing of everything and I will for sure still be looking for other positions if I decide to pass on this one, but what I want more than anything is to find a job that pays for the experiences I want to have in life. I don't have to get rich, but I also don't want to live in the same cycle for 30+ years.",18Nov2020,1

I was diagnosed with ADHD, ODD and I registered on mildly on the autism scale. 

Before I got with her, I was a drug addict and I was using meth, cocaine, speed and I was out of control, but she saw the good in me she gave me a chance at first I was felt as though everything was perfect and I told her like I'll stop using and I didn't stop using, I got worse and worse and she came up to me one time and said '' Babe, I'm really self-conscious about my weight and everything I do doesn't seem to work.'' to which I said ""if you want I can give you some speed it's not the most dangerous but it'll get you the results you want."" (Wasn't my first choice, I offered being more active with her) I had told her like I was going to be controlling it, like the doses so that you know she wouldn't go over the top, and it got to the point where we just started using all the time.

 I feel like a piece of shit because she never used once before and I got her to use and I feel bad for it. I also feel bad because when I was using speed and meth I would get upset at her for no reason and I would yell at her for the most of half an hour. I would apologize and things would be all right for a bit until it happened again. 

I really don't want to lose her but if she really truly doesn't want to be with me I don't want to prevent her from living her own life. something that bothers me the most is I don't that wasn't me when I was using you know I was just I had a lot of pain and anger and issues that I needed to resolve before I got into the relationship with her I didn't love myself properly and how can I love her properly if I don't love myself properly. I didn't think much of it at the time I didn't realize the consequences it had.  Another thing she wanted me to work on myself but I told her like I was working on myself but I was just so stoned most of the time that I wasn't really working on myself like I thought I did and like I had convinced her I was. 

I was fooling myself and I was fooling her and I regret my decisions that I made but I can't change them. I'm going to take this time to work on myself I've already got a counselor, I'm thinking more positive as of lately but I'm still sad whenever I think of her and I try not to dwell in the sadness but I try to you know think of all the good times we had, I don't want her to believe that I'm just this like toxic individual you know I really want to work on myself and I see that I can change for the better. I just feel like an a****** for exposing her to what I exposed her to like all the abuse and the drugs I just feel sad and I wish I never brought it to her, I just wish I worked on myself.

740,"My friend and I were arguing cuz I found out he was trynna avoid me. I had a talk with him but it got into a argument. He told me he was going to bed so I said okay good night. 

And then I see he was active. I know he’s not stupid, he knew his active status was showing and I’d see...but he’d just didn’t care. I know he has very strict parents and a specific time to go to bed so when I saw him being up at the time which his parents would yell at him for I knew he wasn’t supposed to be up. He said he was texting his fam. At 2 in the morning?? I think he was sexting some girl since he does that at the same time with me. 

I was pissed cuz he lied to me about him going to bed. 
He could’ve said he doesn’t wanna talk anymore. But he had to lie. I held back from going off so I texted the next day all calm  and it got into a argument. He bluntly told me he just didn’t wanna talk to me. Why couldn’t he fucking tell me that the other night. So then I explained to him  he didn’t have to lie and then I got heated and he said he doesn’t wanna friends anymore and I said okay i don’t wanna be friends with a liar. The reason I bursted cuz he lied so much and it got to the point i couldn’t take it. 


So he said okay. And idk how but we had a whole convo on friendships.

And next thing ik we are talking for 20 mins about his past friendships. So I stated idk why he was being this way to me and he said he just neeeds a break so I said okay and for him to text me when he’s ready. But idk why he said that cuz he just said he didn’t wanna be friends


He never ever ever ever initiates so I had a feeling that he wouldn’t ever text back. 
Now it’s been a month and 8 days. How long should this break be? I have a feeling it’s gonna be like 3 months or more. Idk if this was jisy a excuse to tell me to fuck off or his way of indirectly ending the friendship",18Nov2020,1
741,"Hi everyone! Thanks for being awesome. I (m19) have been working on a series of instructional videos (cooking) for a while (many months) and have been failing and trying again and getting better, etc... I am now in a place where I feel pretty great about the videos and they could be posted and sold at the price I am asking (I plan on selling them as a course). But they aren't perfect. I keep on rewatching the videos and finding more mistakes, and then watching them again and finding more mistakes, and on and on and on. Is this just me being a perfectionist/nervous to publish or should I continue working on it until I feel it is as perfect as can be? Would I be ruining my business by selling mediocre videos? Or perhaps is it unethical to sell something without putting in all the work I could? When do you draw the line and just post? How do people cope with the fear of publishing something personal and imperfect?

     Looking forward to your advice, thanks!",18Nov2020,1

744,"So, ever since I was in elementary school, my dream was to attend university in the United States at a large D1 school. I fell in love with the high passion for sport and camaraderie each school represented as I'd watch on Saturday night. 

I did not attend school in the US for my undergrad as my parents had a say on where I could go as they were helping to pay for it. 

I have been accepted to attend Graduate School in Texas for January and everything would be paid for on my dime such as taking out student line of credits, using my own funding and additional on campus jobs as well as scholarships. 

My parents do not want me to go in January as my classes are on online as well as I'd be paying out of state tuition (I can gain in state tuition through scholarships or TA/GA work but those wont begin until September). I mean I am an adult and can make my own decisions but it would be really nice to have their blessing. They think its a waste of money to pursue this dream too quickly and I should wait once I have a better idea of how scholarships and TAships will pan out. 

My argument is that despite classes are online, the campus is still open which includes, libraries, the rec center etc as well as the opportunity to play club ice hockey in January. 

The thing is that my life right now is rough (as is a lot of people) living through the pandemic. I have a bachelors degree and I stock at night for Costco. This opportunity was just something I could look forward to. Waiting another 9 months just seems like a mountain climb away. 

Should I just try to pursue this degree and move to Texas in January or should I just wait until September 2021?",18Nov2020,1
745," Ever since I decided what college I wanted to go to, I have worked my ass off to get there. I even got accepted into their honors college and got a full ride but technically only for my tuition and fees. I had absolutely no money for dorms and scholarships were hard to come by. It seemed like all hope was lost until I asked some extended relative on my brother's side( he is not actually my brother, he has just been with my family for a long long time) His parents said yes to me moving in with them! Everything was finally working out. But I overcame and got through everything just to get where I wanted to go. After a semester of living in this new city, 2 hours away from my hometown, I want to move home. Here's why

There is not a single day that I don't have something to complain about. I won't go into specifics and I am grateful beyond imagination that they took me in for college, but something always happens each day that annoys me extremely, whether it just be the city itself, something their daughter did, etc. I just am usually not happy with my days.

Secondly, I hate my job. I work at amazon part-time and it's not fun. Its good pay, I don't really have to talk to anybody, but I don't enjoy it one bit. I could easily get a job in my hometown making the same $ while doing more enjoyable stuff.

Thirdly, and I think most importantly, all of my classes will remain online for the next semester. Nothing about my schoolwork will be changing anyway wherever I end up going.

Fourthly, my bf and I are pretty serious and I will be moving in with him. This will not affect my financial situation or my income. He is older than me by a good deal, and while he doesn't technically support me financially, he takes care of me. I drive back and forth two hours both ways to see him almost every single weekend since I moved, which I don't mind because I love to see him and he is a manager so he works more than me, and this has racked up the mileage on my car as you can imagine. It is so much easier for me to just stay here.

I will be staying with his parents until their daughter gets out of school for Christmas break so they don't have to worry about picking her during this busy time of year. There is nothing holding me back from moving, I fully believe I will be happier down here with him. I am just so amazed at how God works because, after every obstacle I overcame, I feel like that was God's way of telling me I was right where I needed to be. 

I know that I'm making the right decision, but I'm wondering how the parents will feel.",18Nov2020,0

747,"~~Hi All, I'll try to keep it short~~. My whole life has been a rollercoaster which can only be described as darkness which I won't go into detail (unless needed for clarification) on this sub, final year of my CS degree(3 years ago) I was immensely depressed with life in general. I decided to buy a ps4, I don't think I balanced my time wisely but I still graduated with highest honours. I've been in my dead-end job for 8 years now as I have been saving all I could to prepare for leaving, I absolutely don't splurge, keep a strict budget but the pay is small so saving is taking its time.

Before covid, I hade a whole plan on travelling and possibly working abroad until I immigrate officially, but now I am stuck longer in my shitty non-tech job. It's super secure, shit pay but highly unlikely I end up unemployed, and as a person who rents, that is my main concern. So I cold-turkey stopped gaming ditched Netflix and have been going hard on refining my abilities in preparation for the lifting of travel restrictions only to be hit with some bad news that will affect my plans pushing me further into depression and I even ensured not to renew my PlayStation subscription. 

I generally have bad experiences with socializing, I'm not awkward or anything, but just tired of people right now, sounds silly writing but 5 months ago, my 3 yr relationship ended, I'm at the point where I don't even want to do the whole honeymoon phase with anyone new for the foreseeable future. I'm super judgemental (working on it best I can). So I actively avoid making friends, I always see a side that disgusts me to the point where I cant hang out, I'm no saint but I just can't stand certain behaviours that seem commonplace with the people in my country.

All that is to say, with my PS4, I've gotten along with folks outside my country more than in my own. I couldn't care less who they really are because I don't have any obligation to interact with them if I don't want to, I've also never been alone for this long since I was 15. I've only been in 3 relationships, I'm 29 now, got married at 23, to my high school sweetheart, she had a temper problem and what was feisty as teenagers who lived apart quickly became abusive adults living together and ended less than a year. Got another woman who really didn't want to work or keep the apartment tidy, I paid for her to study but she kept staying home so, that ended after 3 years. It only went on long due to my mother wanting me to be with her and they are best friends now. My last relationship is too raw to even get into but It was 100% my fault for how it ended. It was such an experience I don't even think I can date another woman ever. I literally have no interest whatsoever. It meant more to me than the 9-year relationship I had. I can't turn off the commitment switch or something. I haven't even noticed other women in what feels like forever, I can see a woman as being well dressed and not ugly but at the same time not attractive? I am not attracted to anyone so far!!, I've been trying 2 weeks now to see a woman that makes me feel something ..anything but all I feel is gross almost as if I'm being unfaithful. I think something is broken completely and it's sorta freaking me out. (Any advice is welcomed here). 

Additionally, I joined r/StopGaming and between the loss of my queen and another bombshell issue affecting my way of life all happening at the same time I feel like I NEED to talk to socialize ""my way"". I feel like stopGaming is too strict, but I also find all my excuses cited as misgivings common to people who are video game addicts. I literally don't have a family unit to support me in any way due to the ""darkness"" mentioned above and I am immensely depressed. 

I don't know if I'm being weak and shortsighted going back to games either. (Any advice is welcomed here).

750,"So I am 14 years old and I have this small group of friends with which I spend time in and put of school. Recently a new kid arrived at school and because me and another member of the group like to meet new people we went to talk with him. He quickly started spending more and more time with us getting to the point that in just a few weeks he became very close but there was one problem...

At first he told us stories about he had been in 4 different schools before being in mine and talking about all the funny stuff that happened to him in his other schools. It all seems very funny and good, way too good. He told us some stories that just seemed a little bit too much, like if he was making up the stories but I didn't know him really well so I wasn't going to judge him.

Then one he told all of us that he was gay, and here it started to seem very suspicious because he also told us that he was super catholic and at the same time he supported a super right-wing party against gay couples, which seems weird.

But one day he wasn't gaining much attention and he jumped off saying that his father just had one eye because he got burned or something, and then said that his father also just has one hand and one lung that got extracted from his back. Now this all seemed SUPER fake, or maybe his father hadn't had much luck...

And then he told that his mother had passed trough cancer three times and also had just one lung, and said that his brother had died of Covid but didn't seem too sad when talking about it, and also that other of his brothers was studying for being a preist...

Ok, so what do you think? Because me and another friend of mine from that group of friends think that he is just a liar but we don't know what to do, what do you think about all this?",18Nov2020,1

755,"TL:DR I want to cut off a friend because he is childish, plays to the worst parts of my personality and generally I feel he is stupid. 

The only reason I feel I even have him as a friend is because I was extremely shy when I started highschool and the first few days were spent in isolation everywhere until I met the guy in German class and we began to become friends in what seemed to be a friendship of necessity because we were the only ones from our class in that German class. He introduced me to another larger group of friends which I am generally ok towards. But the whole relationship feels like a sham, i would feel embarrassed to tell any of my friends from primary school that this is my friend, it's like he plays to the worst parts of my personality which I want to get rid of, again I feel like the only reason I have him as a friend is because he was there where noone else would talk to me, but now I have come out of my shell more and no longer feel anxious. But how do I end this relationship without resorting to passive aggressive tactics like ghosting. I have done this before when I wanted to cut him off but he always seems to be able to convince me that he changed in some way or made me feel bad for not contacting him.

756,"(17 y/o Male)

So, for the past 3 years in school, I have always never told my parents about class tests and they have found out at parent's nights or through grades and comments report cards.  This has always resulted in a huge argument, which I hate greatly, as my parents relationship with not only each other but with me over the majority of my life has been pretty bad, and there has been multiple instances of them threatening each other with divorce, or worse, which had a great effect on me throughout my teenage years. Throughout my high school years, I have always been quiet and been with the weird kids. However, this year I have made new friends with the ""cooler"" kids, and have been enjoying going out almost every weekend with them, even if I don't drink or do drugs with them, we enjoy each other's company.

My results in end of year exams have been pretty good, but I have been one to consistently fail in class tests and unit tests, which doesn't exactly make my parents happy, as i mentioned before. I ended up at one point just never telling them about tests. I wanted this year to be different, since it is my last year of high school, and since the pandemic I have been told that this year I have to work extra hard at school to get into university.

However, after the first few weeks, I got back into my cycle of not revising for tests and started to struggle in class, and the marks I was getting was giving me everything but motivation to work harder.

We had class tests in what is supposed to be my best subject, but when we got to them, I couldn't understand anything or answer any of the questions on it. The teacher was very concerned, for good reason, as in the 4 tests we did that week i didn't write down anything. The past 2 years in that subject I had gotten A's in that subject. Furthermore, the pandemic is once again growing and exams in my country could be cancelled, forcing the school to use class tests for evidence, for the exam board to give us predicted grades, and therefore since I have done terrible in these, my predicted grade could be a fail. In other subjects, i had gotten maybe 1 or 2 marks in tests, but not passed one yet. I have no motivation to revise, and end up just playing xbox for hours on hours on the weekend, even though I know I have tests in the coming week, because it is really the only thing I enjoy doing other than seeing friends.

Obviously, my parents, specifically my mother (who is at home during the week while my father works in a different country and comes home every weekend) would ask if we were having any class tests and I had to lie and say no and deny anything of the sort. I had to keep doing this every time she would ask because I didn't want to disappoint her about anything or stress her out more than she is already. This is what has happened for the past 3 years, but since this year is very different, it would stress her out even more.

Not only this, but I had not gone to see my university advisor until this week, who is the person I am supposed go to to get help with my application to courses and my personal statement, because I don't know what I want to do when I'm older, because no subjects interest me. In fact, I would go as far to say as the only thing I am passionate about is video games and music, however sad or nerdy that sounds, because it is. This had added more stress as this week she approached me and told me the first draft of it was due last week, and I haven't even started

This week I was approached my my head of year at school, on why I am struggling at school right now and the fact I haven't told my parents. In situations like these, I crumble and I stayed silent when she would ask some questions. She has told me that I either have to tell my mother that I have been lying to her about this for the past 2-3 months about not only having tests, but also doing well in school or she would call her and tell my mother herself. She asked me which I would prefer to happen, and I said I don't know, and she has given me until friday to think about it. What do I do? I don't have the guts to tell my mother straight up and I don't want to go home and see my mother's angry and disappointed face through the window when I come back from school. Moreover, report card will be coming in 2 weeks, so they will find out then if not this week. I don't want her to take away my xbox because it's my only source of fun for myself, which sounds really childish, I know. I don't want my dad to come home on the weekend and shout at me and question why I lied. I just it to be ok but I have been given an ultimatum to which I cannot answer. I would be grateful for any advice.",18Nov2020,0
758,"Hi, obligatory mobile warning, and apologies for any formatting issues! 

   I’m relatively new to working in Childcare (about 8 months) but the unfortunate reality is I’ve already had my fair share of experiences w/ CPS and police.

   Obviously I can’t and won’t give any specifics, but a couple recently have really shaken me and made me feel terrible; terribly sad for the child in that situation, and incredibly guilty that I can’t do more.

760,"Hi, so I have a best friend. She’s one of my favorite people but she does sometimes get mad at me without telling me why. A lot of our other friends have complained about this too, so I don’t think it’s just me being super tactless all the time. 

Right now, she’s been ignoring me on every group chat. She usually responds to what I say but instead she’s only responding to other people. She’s still super active on these group chats/ discord’s but she just hasn’t said a word to me. I kept purposely trying to bring up things she likes but I kept getting ignored. 

Anyway I thought she was just busy/ could only respond at certain times until she started being a little mean when I talked to her directly. She asked a question on discord and I tried to help answer it, but she dismissed me and made comments putting down my interests (I thought the question might have had something to do with something I know about in so I brought it up)

And then later I mentioned a band I like in a joke and she said “no one can get into them unless they’ve already smoked themselves half to death”. I know my music taste is a bit cringe and I don’t usually mind those types of jokes but that felt a bit far to me. She also knows I really hate tobacco and drugs because of the ways it affected my family and home life. I tried to make another joke about me not needing to smoke bc I can do dumb things naturally and she didn’t respond. 

But anyways, I only have one theory why she might be mad. 
There’s a guy on this discord that she REALLY likes. She’s been telling me and our other bffs about him for a while already, until we finally got to meet him via discord. Anyway, the moment we meet me and this dude are actually vibing (I didn’t know I was talking to him at first tho lol). We get along pretty well, and me, my friend, her crush, and our other friend are all having a fun on the discord and we started playing among us in the voice chat and stuff. Anyway, she was really happy when me and her crush got along pretty well.

Then, I sent a bunch of pictures of me in various cool Pokémon hats. I wasn’t trying to be hot in these pics and my friend actually encouraged me to post them on the discord because I looked super happy and the Pokémon hats were cute. Anyway, the guy she liked went and heart reacted to all of the photos I sent. Mind you I don’t think this means he likes me; he’s just a really sweet person and he just heart reacts to a lot of things. But I was thinking my friend might be jealous? 
She did post some other selfies a day before and he didn’t heart react to them, but I think it’s just because the vibe was different? Like if he hearted those photos it would’ve seemed like they were a couple. 

Later she posted a cute conversation between her and this guy, and our other friend commented “date him” and she just responded “if only you could understand”. I know that could be for a lot of reasons but before I met him I remember him being really interested in her before, but that was a long time ago so idk what really happened. 

I know this is probably a reach but I don’t know why else she started giving me the cold shoulder. She’s not the type to get offended by a joke that went too far or a slightly tactless comment (I also looked back on our convos and there didn’t seem to be any of those between us). Btw if I’m just being stuck up don’t hesitate to tell me.

So the advice I’m asking for is first, is she actually mad at me, or am I looking too far into it? Second, how do I approach the subject to her without inflating it? And lastly, I was thinking, if he does like me, should I reject him badly so that he’ll come crying to her? Would that even work? Would that even be fair? Am I being delusional?

Any thoughts are appreciated thank you.",18Nov2020,1

765,"First time here. Folks around me, that I would normally ask, would consider this a ridiculous thought, because...it's always been like that/it's funny/harmless/boy will be boys/muh patriarchy. Take your pick. They don't take it seriously and consider anything in that direction radical feminism that is just people, who are doing really well in life, complaining about made up stuff. You know the drill.   
Anyway, the nephew recently came home and wanted to tell me a super funny joke and then proceeded to ask me what women and clouds have in common. It's apparently their ability to brighten your day by fucking off. 

I didn't know how to respond to that, because I knew the joke, and I remember laughing along back when. But now, I have been exposed to so much in the world and went through some shit myself and am finally opening my eyes to some really unnecessary sexism in my world and I want this to stop with me. I know he likely has no real concept of what he's parroting back just yet, but I want him to grow up being aware of other people and not treat them like shit, just because they don't have a penis. To learn that just because he is, likely, a straight male he does not have to hate women as society expects him to. I know I can't protect him from all the influences out there, I just need him to think for himself. 

I got no idea about kids, tho. Could someone give me some pointers as to how I can go about this without being overbearing? He can style himself to be as manly as he wants to, I just want him to not fall into this 'Haha, husband hates wife, woman always complain, only think of makeup, so hilarious' thing.

We were together for 4 years straight and broke up, she got together with someone else but eventually came back. I couldn’t move past the fact she got with someone else so soon after we broke up and as a result we ended things again at the beginning of this year; it was too much for me to handle and it caused many arguments even though we were only back together a couple months. I contacted her in August and explained that I missed her, and that I had moved on from what was troubling me before, she said she missed me too and we got back together. But ever since we got back together things just didn’t seem... exactly right? Long story short this Monday she told me that she didn’t really feel like she was in love with me anymore, and couldn’t continue seeing me. I’m totally floored, I am still completely in love with her - she is all I’ve wanted for more than a quarter of my life. - and it’s torture to know that this person who I care for so much even after all this time simply does not feel close to the same time way about me. 

It feels like at this point my brain is wired to only want her since I’ve been with her from such a young age, and I don’t know how to change that, she is all I know. My sister has been telling me I should go meet new people or join a dating site or something because I’m young and handsome and it would boost my confidence - but none of that interests me in the slightest. I really love this girl and I just cannot picture wanting to be with someone else. I don’t really have a specific question for you, I’m just really lost and in a lot of pain right now.",18Nov2020,6

Well todays Wednesday and the message still says ""delivered"" so she didnt even open it yet lol.

-I live by myself (sort of - my dad works 12hours a day so I'm always alone)


My friend killed himself in September so that made me really depressed as he lived abroad. I didn't get out of bed for days and had no energy to go on my phone. I got asked ""are you OK? You can measage me about it"" once by one of the girls in the group, friend 1. Its now almost December and none of them measage me, unless it's to use me for my car. A few went to uni and the others work full time, which I understand but they literally go on Snapchat and ignore my measages for hours but are active on snap maps not long ago.

Friend 1 was my closest but I introduced her to a boy and now they're dating. It's her first boyfriend. She doesn't even tell me if they've kissed. She ignores my measages the most but is active. I always have to ask to meet (before lockdown) but always got denied, always asked to facetime but got denied etc. We met 3 times when restrictions got lifted but that's it. She can meet her bf tho.

So, I thought it would be a good idea for me an my friends to FaceTime while we were our outside activity. We were FaceTiming, friend 3 was saying how he put a sticky note in a tunnel, hoping people would call him. We were all confused why he would do that, and we started chatting again.

776,"So I have been completely in love with this one videogame character for about 11 years now(i'm 22). He is seriously my everything and often the only thing that brings me joy. I've dedicated so much to him and the game series. 


Unfortunately, it came to light recently that his english voice actor is basically a horrible predator and compulsive liar/cheater and pervert. He used his status to prey on a bunch of young fans and sleep with them, while promising marriage to them as well.  


I have stalked him before online, and thought to myself he isn't 100% my kind of person and that's okay. But for some reason after finding that out and seeing all the evidence it bothers me and I'm not able to seperate the 2 in my head. It doesn't help that this character is his natural vocal register. 


I know this may seem stupid to worry about, but this character has helped me cope for so many years. Now I feel like I have nothing. I would do anything to feel like this character wouldn't be like that. But now with context, it makes me upset remembering cutscenes where he talks to other female characters, or would do something manipulative in the story. 


Is there a way to think of this differently? How do I seperate him from his voice actor?",18Nov2020,1

The phone reception inside the ER was really shitty so I basically couldn’t call or text anyone... 

Let’s call the guy Jake. So I texted Jake before I went into the ER and he wished me well and told me to let him know what happened. He works about an hour from where we live. So once I was finally checked out I FaceTimed him and told him about why I was so sick ect ect. At first he was like “you poor thing I’m so sorry.” Then later in the night I was saying how I needed to rest and couldn’t hang out and he was like “Damn. I’m sorry. Next time you gotta pee right after sex.” Usually do my best to do so but this really pissed me off. Also even when he did say you poor thing , the energy wasn’t empathetic it was more of like oh man that sucks.

797,"I was in a very low place. My mental health was impacting my physical health mostly due to my relationship with my drug-addicted, abusive parent and immediate family. My SO ended up getting a better job so we changed my phone number, deleted social media, and drove across the country without saying goodbye. There were extended family I wanted to talk to but my parent told me no one loved me and I am not even sure what I would tell the extended family. I know my parent has told everyone I abandoned them and I am worried of being judged- or asked to reconnect with the immediate and abusive family. 

I left about 2.5 years ago. In this time so much has happened in my personal life. I was in an extremely low place for a long time.

798," I'm a guy of 18, a student of grade 11 (which is the first grade you enter in college after you finish your school in Pakistan, so basically this is my first year in college), programmer, newbie guitarist, and writer, a biology enthusiast and a \[sort of\] regular reader. I was recently diagnosed with anxiety and depression. My next checkup is due next week. I studied in my last institution from grade 5 to 10 and now I had to switch for college because my previous institution didn't offer college facilities. The college that I have taken admission into is one of the ""best"" colleges of my city (they are considered better than others because their students ace annual exams in which all schools compete). Getting there was not a problem; I was also offered a scholarship because I had topped my school in grade 10.

\[*We have to attend college physically. No online classes yet.\]*

However, I soon noticed that the quality of education there was drastically low. Teachers there are not helpful and if you don't get a point during their lectures, they hardly repeat it or help you with it. Mostly, they mock you for your questions. In the beginning, I didn't give any importance to these things, for I considered them the result of me switching institutions. I thought it would take me a few weeks or perhaps a couple of months to adjust with everyone and everything there. But I guess I was wrong. It has been three months now and I still don't feel any change, and that too for valid reasons. I have just began to feel more suffocated and restricted. One of those reasons is the presence of coroporal punishment in the institution. I know our education system is screwed up already but it's quite pathetic that the city's so called ""best"" institution punishes students physically for NOT CRAMMING.

I discussed this matter with some of my classmates who had attended school at this place too. They just started laughing, saying that teachers have the right to do so if students ""hurt"" their feelings by not memorizing stuff or misbehaving. I realized that they have been victims to corporal punishment during their school life too so it just seems normal to them; their brains have been wired that way—not that it's actually normal. Teachers there hold this opinion as well so it's pointless to talk to them about it.

You might ask then, what is my problem? Can I not simply memorize and avoid the pain? I wish it would work that way. It's not the physical pain that I detest, it's the mental pain. Studies have never been the reason for my stress or anxiety (except for this time, I reckon). But the mere possibility of physical penalizing being executed is enough to keep me up at nights (it's been a month since I barely get to sleep for two to three hours only). So, for that reason, learning extremely simple and basic topics has become extremely distressing. I haven't opened a book for the last five or six days. It's not just the corporal punishment, but the overall environment is pretty tense too.

My parents say they won't object unless they do something to me. I've spoken to them a few times and it's futile to mention those conversations here. I cannot cancel my admission either because it's too late to do so; all other colleges have closed their admissions.

I could've lived through it but the reason it's worrying me too much is that getting good marks this year is very important for me, my future and my dreams. If I don't get enough marks, I won't be able to get into med-school after two years. I have five months to prepare (which is enough time if I don't lose it to weeks of stress and depression). I'm totally stuck and don't know how to deal with this all. I just want to study. I also need to know how not to lose time anymore and get the most out of these five months, as all I see in front of me is darkness.

I'm looking forward to all your valuable suggestions and advices.

804,"Hey guys, first time here. Not sure how to start so the post might get draggy.   


I'm(26M) in my final year of my university now but I find myself extremely unproductive over the past months. Initially, it was just pushing things off, procrastinating but I still get work done when I feel the urgency. But recently, its become bad enough for me to not want to do anything even on deadlines. On one hand I feel extremely tired and burnt out, on the other hand, I know procrastination doesn't really do anything to relieve it. And it's because I'm conscious of the fact that I'm procrastinating, it feels like I'm watching myself spiral down this path of destruction.  


It's not like I don't want to change, I really do. I just can't discipline to. I'd try for a day at best and then just give up. I honestly don't know how to maintain this fleeting motivation of mine. I consulted a school counsellor regarding this issue, she gave me suggestions to write down how I feel everyday first thing I woke up, or to take 5 minutes to read a motivational book I have, as well as things like understanding my actions, asking myself on why I procrastinate.  I guess it helped because that made me a lot more conscious but it's also why I feel like I'm living as a spectator in my body.  


I honestly don't know what I should do at this point. I don't know if anyone can help me but this is my cry for help? I'm watching myself becoming a degenerate because of all this actions I'm choosing that's not helping my achieve anything. Things like doing my schoolwork, sending out job applications, learning related knowledge for potential industries. I'm not really looking for miracles here but if anyone has anything similar or knows how I can get past this hurdle, please do share.

806,"I've never really had much friends to begin with. Sadly, some friends I was really close with either hurt me too much to stay friends, or just completely shut me out for (in my eyes) no good reason.

The friends I have left now are either more like acquaintances, or people who are quite close to my heart. I didn't talk much to them before this whole pandemic, but now we talk even less. And I really miss that. I've tried a couple of times to start a conversation, and sometimes it works, but usually it's just a few messages back and forth and then it stops. Only one friend sends me messages sometimes, without me messaging first, but that's also the few messages back and forth and then silence.

Now with the pandemic going on, I kind of feel more lonely than before. I used to talk to my boyfriend every day, but since that relationship ended a few months ago, that stopped as well (I have complete peace with the ending of the relationship, it was my own choice). I have been talking to some people here and there, but that just isn't it.

807,"This is probably not post-worthy by many, or an easily solvable dilemma but I still need some advice.

I'm 21 and for the first time in my life I have a very good paying job (by my country's standards).

I have to buy a new phone in the next two months and I'm thinking about the iPhone 11 vs iPhone 12.

Yay, big dilemma right?

I'll be a first time iOS user, thus I don't have any previous experiences with Apple products. I wanna treat myself with a high-end phone because work and college have been going great. I've watched most of the videos that review both iPhones and videos that compare them. I've read customer's opinions on both of them and even asked friends and family for opinions. Most of the opinions I've gotten are ""the iPhone 12 is not worth the extra $200"", ""performance wise they're almost the same"", and ""get an 11, the 12 is not yet proven"".

Honestly I don't care about the extra money I'll be giving for the 12, I just want to treat myself with a premium phone for the first time in my life. On the other hand, the 11 is also a great phone.

In the beginning, things were ok. I got into cooking, played some video games, it was 24/7 sunlight where I live during the summer so I went biking a lot.

Now I am finding myself slipping into a funk. We only get a couple of hours of sunlight a day and the temps are dipping into the -20's finally. This makes it hard sometimes for me to choose to go outside.

816,"My little sister (F22) leased a SUV around the beginning of 2020 for school and promised my parents she had the capacity to work while attending college to pay it off. She refused to take the bus even though the rest of our siblings did so when we went to post-secondary school. She is generally lazy, has poor spending habits, hasn't had a job in years and now complains she's too stressed with school to get a job. My parents have had to help her make the payments with no concrete plan to pay them back. This is a very common theme, she runs out of money and cries to my parents and they give in and give her money. It wasn't until recently I had to explain to them that they're enabling her behavior and she will never change.

Now the payments are becoming unbearable for her so she tried to look for someone to take over the lease, this was unsuccessful as she found no one. Now my parents have decided to take on the lease themselves ($36k for the next 3 years) and take off the insurance of my mother's car and leave it in the garage for the next 3 years until the lease is up. My mother will be driving the new leased car and apparently she learned her lesson and is now willing to bus in the future for school when necessary.

Here is where I (M25) come in. My parents want me to sell my car, give the money earned to my parents and take my mom's car for the next 3 years then return it to my mom. My car is expected to last at least another 4-5 years. So after 3 years I have to buy a new car which is earlier than what I anticipated.

Sorry this came out way longer than I expected but, should I do it? This is a complete sacrifice on my part as a means to help my parents since they're already dealing with enough financial bullshit because of my little sister. My condition if I agree is that I give her a full blown intervention with my whole family present about her terrible spending habits.

On one hand I don't want to be have to have a setback in my life plans due to the errors and consequences of my little sister's choices but on the other hand, I want to help my parents to ease them into retirement.

I'm a college student who also takes a professional course on the side. Up until high school I was pretty great with my studying habits and in general work life balance. However my grades though fairly okay did show a decrease in overall performance and I found studying too difficult and not rewarding for the amount of efforts I put in.

From the last one or one and half year things have....changed. I put things off and half ass stuff. I notice that I tend to procastinate until the last day and just cram and feel like shit because if I fail that'll be because of the fact that I didn't study. I just saw myself putting in efforts sacrificing my personal life for educational success but really getting disproportionate and underwhelming results and so to tell myself worked hard and failed is something I can't accept ego-wise because in my head I'm still the straight A student.

So I just repeatedly screw myself by not studying so I don't have to face the fact that I am maybe not as smart as i thought I was.

This is really lifechanging because I find my primary identity to be that of a student. If I am great at it then there's no personal relationship that can beat the pure joy I get from a good test or exam. If that's not the case anymore, I just don't feel like studying at all but that's not an option either",18Nov2020,1

A couple years ago, I reuinited with a childhood friend and despite often getring together, we have nothing in common. The things that interest her don't interest me. For example, I post articles about art on fb. She posts pics of chicken niggets she ate that day. Additionally, she's very talkative and extroverted while I'm the opposite. She loves bars/clubs and drinking while I hate drinking and bars (not a teerotaler, just never liked alchogol or the scene). When we discussed photography being banned in certain places, I believe that it's disruptive and should be observes while she sees no problem breaking the rules. I would fear attending such a scenario with her if she risks having us kicked out. I tried to share a picture of a peacock I saw wandering around and she was visibly bored at the sight. I was just as bored at her fascinatingly talking about condiments at the Fuddruckers.

Ive been through one-sided friendships and i dont want to repeat that dynamic with her and maintain the boundaries i've developed.

She's convinced that our friendship is still as close as it was 35 years ago. Meanwhile I can't even remember more than 2 instances of our time together. On the other hand, She did things for me, like take me back to my childhood home and our elementary school when my parents refused, so I feel like this friendship is worth working on.

I have tried developing a relationship with him, I feel like i have done so, and recently asked him to help me move so I could stay with him before I left for my next journey.

He fronted the cost of the move completely. When he told me how much it was going to cost, I told him I could reduce the costs by getting rid of some of my things. He tells me later that he went with the higher cost because he felt that was right, but this was after I had gotten rid of a few things.

Later, he asks me if I can help pay for a portion of the costs. I tell him I can, and do so over two months. I do not pay for the whole move though. Two months later, he sends me an email with the remaining cost of the move.

I did not pay him rent while I stayed with him; he did not ask for it, I purchased my own food, and was told anytime I needed a place to stay I had one.

Edi im 23m from the netherlands. Message said this might be useful

So i posted here to reach more, i dont have many responses and just wanna be sure what i wanna do is not stupid or something like that. Post will partially explain why i want advice.

Hi all, i need some advice with how to approach a girl. I have some backstory first which is kinda important.

So there is this girl from work which i want to approach. We havent spoked that much and so i dont know much about her and she doesnt know a lot about me.

 Now the problem is that i only see her every saturday and this day is really busy. There are moments but not many and she is often working with somebody else. I can go look and wait untill she is alone but that doesnt happen that much.

I know she works some other days as well where i can try as then there is more time.

What also does not help is my bad social skills when nervous and my autism. It makes it really hard to do things like this and i am quite unsure if the way i want to do it is any good.

I have thought out a way in which i can do it.

I was planning on approaching her and just telling here she seemed nice and that i would like to get to know her better. Maybe ask her if i can aks her something/something weird first would be smart but i dont know. Skip or keep?

After that i wanted to ask for her phone number, her social or maybe something face to face. 

I actually wanted to aks some more things but i am not sure what and maybe it is me wanting to move too quickly.
I also on one hand want to explain to her why i went at it in this way but is that smart? Something in my mind says not tonexplain and just ask and see.

This is the part im seriously unsure about.

Would me telling her this and then asking her for her number or something be weird seeing as i barely know her and only see her once a week.

Would it be weird to approach her when on the other day while she is working and i am not.

Would telling her that im having a bit of a crush on her be smart if she asks why i want to know her better or why i want her number or social media stuff.

Also i have a way to get her number without asking her. I dont think this is smart but ehat about using this way instead of talking to her.

At the time i had the above talk written down i was happy and proud of myself but now i am not so sure. So this is why i am asking here. I am known to be unsure of myself so its no surprise.

Finally i would like to have some ways to control my nerves a bit. And something to stop me doubting myself a bit.

• Piercings (My school limit is a pair of studs, no double piercings on your ears, no facial piercings. My mum also does not like facial piercings. I already have double piercings on my right ear.)

• Hair dye (I have the ends of my hair slightly dyed, which isn't supposed to be allowed by the school but it's dulled. However I want to dye parts of my hair blonde - but my mum says I'd have to go to a professional, which I can't because of cost and covid)

Other options I can think of are makeup (also denied by my school) and hairstyles (which doesn't feel permanent enough, and I often don't have time in the morning).

Are there any other ways? Or any alternatives you could think of? 

Thank you if you read this! 

Tldr ; Any ways of changing your appearance that are similar to hair dye, tattoos or piercings that are possible for a 15 year old in school?",18Nov2020,1
844,"A little background on this, I am currently being medically separated from the military. It’s been an ongoing issue ever since I joined. Initially I had plans to make this a career but I also had a backup plan if I decided not to go on with the military. Initially when I learned about my thing I was sorta in denial? I always told myself this wasn’t happening and that I would never be kicked out. It went on for so long and when I finally saw it happening I was like “oh shit it really is happening” I stayed positive. After a while I’ve spiraled into depression and here I am now. 

During the separation process you are required to learn about all these resources you have for when you get out. Some are DOD resources some are VA etc. ever since I was officially in this process I’ve had countless appointments with countless organizations regarding this. I’m always asked, “what’s your plan?” I always say my previous plan. Continue my bachelors, major in business and do that. I’m always asked if I want to officially enter said programs and I’m like “nah” they’re always like “why not?” Etc

Truth is I am utterly destroyed, my mental health is so far down the drain. It’s hard for me to get dressed in the morning and go to work. Often times I’ll catch myself just sitting down and staring in space, I’ll look at the time and 3 hours will have passed. 

If I’m being honest, I have no interest in a life after the military. Every month I average about 3 visits to the ER where I’m poked and probed with countless IVs. My veins are swollen and bruised. My health is quickly deteriorating and it’s expected to go down further in the near future. 

So what’s my actual plan? Get all that 100% disability from the VA and use every last penny in drugs and alcohol. I want to say maybe get a house but if I’m being honest I feel like I’m going to end up living under a bridge within a few years. 

I sincerely have zero interest in any resource offered to me and have even less intentions of using them, I just can’t say because it’ll land me in a psych ward",18Nov2020,1
846,"hi everyone, my last post in here sheds light on my current work situation but to sum it up: I don’t like my company. I have been job searching the past month in hopes to get out. 

fast forward to today, I get a call from the head of HR. we discuss my experience with the company, if I like my job, etc. and he mentioned how we really need someone to work the weekends (I’ve said I’m unavailable to work weekends) and we brainstormed a couple ideas on how to make this work.

Eventually, he made me an offer. He said if I would like to transition out of the job, he can help me with that. He said he will help me get unemployment and write it as a COVÍD layoff and say my position was eliminated so I can get unemployment. He offered to pay out my PTO as well (not legally required in my state and they didn’t pay out my 2 coworkers when they left) and give me 2 weeks severance. 

Side note: He mentioned this would be more like a personal favor to me because that isn’t how standard procedure goes. Because of this he said he can’t offer me this in writing, but if I accept then he can send me all the paperwork while we’re on the phone showing that he’s doing as he said he would. (I had a previous boss that made a lot of empty promises and he knows this, he promised he’s not trying to trick me.)

Is this a good deal? I feel like it is, since I’m looking for another job anyway, but I need an outside opinion to tell me if I should take this or not lol.

So during school break my friends and I will usually go to the nearby corner store and buy some stuff. Alot of the times though, if one of my friends doesn't go, the other won't go.  (calling them K and A)

Anyway, so yeah. Basically what happens is A almost never goes if K doesn't want to, (except when K is doing something else) and I feel shitty because then i just dont feel good enough to go with. 

Overall, how do I  deal with all this shit?

at the start of when i met him i was falling deep into alcoholism, was off of my meds, and eventually started abusing drugs as well. i think i may have convinced myself when i first met him that i would like him more than he liked me, and maybe subconsciously became fixated on that? because i became kind of obsessed(?) with him for lack of better word. this is what i mean; i tend to talk to myself, and he became the person i speak to in my head. i moved out of that building over eight months ago, i don't speak with him anymore and i hardly ever did. i was always harmless to him, maybe a bit awkward but nothing serious. but now i feel like im going crazy because he never goes away, and it hurts my feelings to even think of him because i will never see him again. i am no longer (as in for months) an active alcoholic nor do drugs, and am back on meds, he still wont go away.

860,This is finals week for a girl I’ve been texting. Just wondering if it’s wise to spark up a conversation even if I know she’s been busy with work?,18Nov2020,1
861,"

Earlier this year when Covid lockdowns were serious a lot of young people turned to using this online app called houseparty that basically allows for group video calls. So one night I (17m) was on a call with a bunch of my former High school friends, all in various countries (South Africa, Nigeria, USA, Ireland)

Then two British girls, my age crashed our call and began talking to us, and one of them flirted with me, she had her camera off (It's important for the story) I joked with them and told her not to flirt with me if her camera wasn't on, that she's probably a dude, then their friends, two British dudes crashed our party and started seriously trolling all of us, (imagine a Call of Duty lobby) 

All of us found this funny, having played online games for a long time, we were used to trolling, but it started getting annoying so eventually some of us left and started another party. At this point I was lowkey interested in the girl with her camera off, because she seemed cool, so we continued talking and she told me she was going to send me a photo of herself on snapchat, to see if i liked the way she looked. In a suggestive manner, intending nudes

I was like, ""Cool"" At this point I thought I was having connection issues, because her and her friends semi-ignored me, leading me to believe the connection was bad for like 20minutes, while I actually thought the connection was bad and continued trying to talk to them, and saying that i didn't see anything on snapchat, asking if she was going to send it

When I realised that the connection probably wasn't bad and that they were probably ignoring me. At this point I was like, I should have expected that, because they seemed like they just wanted attention, hence crashing our party and flirting with me. I still kind of held on to the believe that maybe the connection was bad, So I asked, ""Are you still going to send that picture?"" For like 20 minutes, off and on. My reasoning was that maybe her connection was bad, and she would hear me. And also that if they were actually ignoring me, I would annoy them with that question till they blocked me or booted me from the party. I was desperate and very stupid, and I've changed.

Looking back, I realise that she had every right to ignore me if she didn't want to continue our conversation or decided against sending me a photo, and I'm wrong for continuing to ask that question. I was wrong to believed that I could do that online, because I felt like, ""I'm never seeing these people ever again, so why not?"" It’s not something I would ever do in person, and looking back, it’s not something I should have done online

I would apologize to her, but I deleted my houseparty app a few months ago, and last time I checked we are still friends on snapchat, but I cant remember her username. I felt bad the night it happened, but I let it slip my mind, because I felt it was harmless, and nobody got hurt. That was a few months ago, now I’ve remembered it and I don’t want to risk making excuses for myself

I’m I'm not sure if I can forgive myself for my behaviour on that night. I need advice and outside clarity to know how much of a piece of shit I was in that situation.  Am I overthinking it? Was it harmless trolling? Or was that sexual harassment? Either way, I'm never doing that again.",18Nov2020,1

865,So it all started when I got kicked out by my dad for the second time my senior year right before I graduated. My father was an ex drug addict. I’m originally from Waterbury CT.

I got my own basement room but ended having to leave because it was an illegal unit and the city building inspector came pretty much telling me I had to leave or the land lord will be fine. This was late 2019 going into corona. I then moved to an uncle before he moved back to Dominican Republic after that it was around July I started working at a cafe and living with my sister on her couch with her roommate(cousin) and her brother who also Jsut got out of prison. I haven’t had a chance to ever start college nor I have any experience with anything besides working as a barback while I’m highschool till around may 2020 again because of corona.

It’s been like this for almost 3 years. Idk where to start and where to go. Ive been denied for food stamps and public health care. It feels like the system doesn’t work with homeless youth. And sometimes it even feels embarrassing seeing all my piers in college or with there friends and parents. My main question is what rout should I take where should I start how should I start and what should be my focusing. I know it’s harder now in corona. But I jsut need some help honestly.

The pay is kind of low at $15. I’d be okay with it though because I’ll be working from home. What do you guys think? It’s only until the end of December.

I'm 15, and I live in Hungary, which I think is a really boring country, so I desperately want to move out of here. For the longest time I wanted to move to Japan, but I heard that shifts are exceptionally long, having to spend unpaid extra time at the workplace many times, and suicide rates are rising because of the stress of working in Japan. I don't want to experience this, but I really, really want to live in this country. So I want a job that has a high pay while not overworking me.

My dream job is related to creativity; my biggest passions are music production, singing, drawing, animation, sculpting, video/image editing, etc. I'm not good at either of them, YET. I work really hard every single day to reach a high level at these skills. But I heard that it's difficult to live on a creative job, because success not only depends on skill and talent, but luck as well. So I intend to do these as a hobby while working as a computer scientist. But I'm really worried that I'll be working for lots of hours a day, and that I will be too tired when I get home to do any of my creative work. Especially in Japan.

I chose computer science not just because I like math, but because computer scientists have a high pay. And I also collect anime figures as a hobby, but my parents find collecting stupid, so I have to buy figures from my own money. Except they are really expensive, and I can't work yet, nor do I get any money from my parents. So I want a high enough pay to pursue this hobby as well.

I don't want to dedicate my life to work and studying in the future. I truly want to do my creative work. I'm just really worried that I won't be able to. A lot of people say that teenagers should be hanging out with friends at this age, but I have been trying to make friends in my class for years ever since I switched schools at 12, but I failed every single time I attempted to, so I gave up. However, I learned to enjoy solitude, and I spend my time doing these creative things I mentioned. My grades are okay, but are definitely rising. I'm a girl if that matters.

Other volunteers and myself will meet Guy1 at this station and we serve food to anyone who are hungry. Today, there was a person who came and took some food, let's call him Guy2. Halfway through his meal, Guy2 shouted 'eww' and he came over to show us that there was an insect inside the food on his plate.  It was seriously gross. Initially, myself and Guy1 were staring at his plate of food and the insect. Then, Guy2 took out his phone and appeared to be preparing to take photo. Upon seeing Guy2 took out his phone, Guy1 quickly folded the plate (it is a paper plate) to hide its content and stop Guy2 from taking photo, and Guy1 began to shout angrily at Guy2 using some derogatory terms, accusing that Guy2 was the one who put the insect into his plate of food. Guy1 said he saw Guy2 reaching into his pocket and took something out before putting it into his food. 

Guy1 was shouting angrily, and quite agitated. On the other hand, Guy2 was quite composed, and he kept insisting that he was telling the truth. Guy2 did not raise his voice at any time. Guy2 said he was not being disrespectful or rude, he was merely pointing out that there was an insect inside his food. After a while, Guy2 told Guy1 that he was willing to take a truth detector test to prove that he was telling the truth. Guy1 did not respond to this provocation directly. Guy1 continued to shout at Guy2 that he was the one who put the insect in his food.  In the end, I cannot tell who was telling the truth. 

If Guy2 was indeed lying and he put the insect in his food, a possible reason is that he wanted to spoil the reputation of this charity organization. However, if guy2 wanted to take a photo, he could have took it before bringing his food back to our station and before bringing it to our attention. And then he can post it on the internet secretly. Why will he alert us to the insect? And why will he directly lie to us? What can he achieved by telling us about the insect?

On the other hand, if Guy1 was lying, it was likely because he wanted to protect the reputation of this charity and organization. Guy1 had been working at this organization for years. So it seems like Guy1 had reason to lie.  

My question is, if Guy1 was not telling the truth, should I continue to volunteer at this place and under his lead?  Since this will mean that he is a manipulator, who can easily distort the truth for his own advantage. I will lose my trust in him and this charity organization.",18Nov2020,1

I crave meaning in my life, I am sick of the routine I am in. I want to experience new things be it good or bad, anything. I kept living life so far telling myself to tolerate and focus on what mattered (studies, degree) and that sacrificing now will eventually lead me to happiness, but it has been over 13 years since I have told myself that. And nothing has changed.

I am sick of being sick and tired of my life. I don't even know what I want anymore. I find myself turning to books and movies and imagine living as the characters before I go to bed, and that is the highlight of my days, I wake up looking forward to going to bed.

I always was a wallflower, I never felt like I belonged or fitted anywhere. Being biracial and moving to different countries every few years growing up has much to do with it I guess. But even in school, I always felt like an outcast.

There is nothing particularly wrong with my life, I have supportive parents, good health, middle class financially, university degree, a few friends, average looks. And so most people don't understand why I am always complaining about the void I feel, I come off as ungrateful but I am so miserable. I wish I knew why.

I don't even ask for grand things. Just not this routine (hell) that I have been living in for over a decade. I wish I had clear desires, I wish things happened to me, I want to enjoy life and appreciate it like other people do. But I don't know how.

I tell her all the time how much this bothers me and how much I hate cleaning up after her and she doesn’t give a single fuck. I recognize that she is 12, but she is definitely old enough to know right from wrong. She is aware that it affects me yet she chooses not to do anything about it.

She politely told him she wasn’t looking for other people at that moment in time and carried on seeing him and speaking to him as a friend. She then went on a very long tangent about just how good looking he is and how he is basically her ideal man, but he wasn’t as funny as me. The exact words were “At least you can tell a joke.” There were noises and facial expressions that I would expect from someone talking about their celebrity crush.

Now I’m a big guy, I’m over 6 foot, but I weigh upwards of 120 kg (Around 19-20 stone) and this dude is in the military and you can tell. I look absolutely nothing like him. Not even close. 

Well I got upset, but I got over it. It left my mind and we carried on, made some great progress and things were going good. I even bought a ring and planned to propose. But a few weeks ago, we were talking on the phone, and she started talking about looks, specifically what she finds attractive. She started ranting about how fat people were really unattractive and that they aren’t good looking at all really, even going so far as to bring up people who are skinnier than me and make jokes about them and how she could never cope with being that size. She then told me that if we ever get married, we’d have to go on a huge exercise binge so that we looked good in the photos and that she could brag about how good we used to look. 

I honestly just saw this as a personal attack, and with my cocktail of mental illness kicking in, I went into a full meltdown. 

Again, we talked things out, but now I can’t get both scenarios out of my head... I feel incredibly self conscious and disgusted by the way I look, and I genuinely can’t stop thinking about it all. I’ve always been fat and ugly, and my family and the kids I grew up with never failed to tell me that, but hearing the woman I love degrade basically every person that looks like me was a real kick to the head while I was already down, and it’s really got me questioning a lot... 

I know the obvious solution is to lose weight, so please don’t comment with that as your only advice, I have a lot of issues that make it really hard, and I have made some progress, but it is slow and difficult for me to achieve. 

Something comforting would be very welcome and appreciated, and I really hope that people aren’t too quick to judge.",18Nov2020,1

892,"(Sorry it's long I wanted to make as unbiased as possible)

Me (F19) and my GF (F19) will have been dating for four years in January. Her birthday is tomorrow, and she is upset at me and says I do not care about her because I told her we would have to stay at least six feet apart if I come by her house. I definitely should have mentioned something sooner, and that's on me, but I knew she would be upset, and I didn't want to hurt her.   


She is telling me that I go to work and that is more risky than seeing her. I told her that I agree, but I cannot control work. I've been sick for the past month, and my mom hasn't been able to work because of it. (two negative covid tests, so we know it's just tonsilitis) I cannot afford to get sick because I will miss work and so will my mom. I also have been taking antibiotics, so I'm worried about my immune system weakening and getting sick again.   


My doctor told me I could start seeing people on the 19th, and the plan was to go to the park with her and sit away from her. I told her I wasn't very comfortable even doing this but that I wanted to see her and celebrate her birthday. Last minute, she had to work, and we won't be able to go to the park because she'll be too tired. I told her I could sit in her driveway but not in her car because it would be too close. She told me I'm being ridiculous and that she feels like no one cares about her birthday. I know that it's hard because she's not in the best home situation and doesn't have a lot of friends. (Her best friend lives in a different state) I told her I could sit with her and talk to her in the driveway, and I offered to call and play Among Us or anything to spend time together.   


After I said I wanted to stay distant from each other, she told me she didn't even want to celebrate her birthday and that she didn't want to talk to me for the rest of the day. I told her I would give her her space, and if nothing else I will drop off her gift after work. She told me not to bother, but I know that it will make her at least a little happy to have the gift. I know this feels like a long-distance relationship, and it has been worse because I've been sick and then went straight into finals, so I haven't had a lot of free time. She says I've put her on the backburner, and while I don't think this is true, I recognize that I am making her feel like she is, whether I'm meaning to or not. It's been like this most of the pandemic because my mom is immunocompromised, and I have asthma, but I bent a bit more in the beginning.   


She would tell me I was being ridiculous not to hug or kiss her and that she wasn't sick, so I'd cave a bit because I did want to hug and kiss her. I have a hard time setting boundaries, and that's on me a bit for not standing my ground. I'm not bending this time because I cannot afford to, and I'm trying to get better at setting boundaries. How do I not hurt her feelings but stand my ground?  I'm wondering, though, if I'm being too harsh. Neither of us wants a long distance relationship, but that's kind of what it's turned into. Am I wrong for this? Should I be handling the situation differently? Is she right that I'm being ridiculous?

**TLDR: My GF says I'm ridiculous because I won't hug her for her birthday, but I'm worried about Corona Virus. How do I not hurt her feelings but stand my ground? Or if I am being ridiculous, how do I navigate the situation better?**

897,"When I watch TV shows and movies, if a character does something bad, or mischievous, suddenly, depending on what it is, I will start to feel a sort of fear, or be uncomfortable at the thought of them getting caught doing it. Although I know it’s not real, knowing that there will very likely be consequences for the character, fills me with, what I THINK is anxiety. Not 100% sure if it is anxiety though. And when I see this, it makes me want to stop watching the show/film completely, and it’s basically a battle to keep myself watching. It’s like a fear on the characters behalf, I don’t know what the consequence will be or if there will be one, but it is enough to stop me watching so I don’t have to see it happen.

899,"  

Hello Reddit, I haven’t really ever posted my own threads on reddit, I’ve responded to some here and there though. I made this account to start posting threads and have a re-do. I am a M\[20\] and the girl in this story is F\[19\] She is also my Ex. We have been together a few times when we were younger, 2-3 times probably. There was only 1 time I could remember why we broke up but it was because she threatened to call the law on my party when we were like 13-14 maybe? We shouldn’t have been drinking anyway but that was fucked, it still gives me trust issues with her. But its been many years and she somehow decided to pop into my life when we crossed paths randomly in a different state about 1 and an half months ago. I was coming home from visiting the neighboring state, (\~ 1hr or so drive from me).  And I got a text from her randomly about half way home, She had a new car and I didn’t notice her. She said “You’re behind me!!” and I was shocked and was just like “ Oh shit, hey”. (She was coming home from work, apparently, she had gotten a job in the other state and was driving everyday there.) Anyway, she talked me into pulling over at the next gas station. For what I thought was going to be \~ 30 minute max conversation… Well I was wrong. We stayed at the gas station FOR 5 FUCKING HOURS! Talked about a lot of stuff and maybe about trying to rekindle a flame somehow. Okay well, I didn’t hear much from her after that, I pretty much got ghosted at the most obvious level possible. This is where it gets interesting. I thought I was over it and if she came back to me I would turn her down. Well, she messaged me that she had gone off the grid and a lot of shit happened to her, and that we needed to meet up and talk about it. So my dumbass went to go talk to her, we met at a school near her house. She told me she moved out by herself and she broke down to me in my truck that she was extremely unhappy with how she was living and feeling and offered me to come stay with her and we kept talking but this creepy abandoned school was getting foggy and cold It didn’t take 5 minutes before she asked me to go back to her house with her because she now lived by herself. Ofc I did. I learned her heat was fucked up at the time so we was just laying on the couch tryna stay warm and talk and shit, and we talked about the future, the past, the present, we just had about another 5-6 hour talk except this time we kissed got close, big L bombs were dropped from both parties involved… (The word : Love)… I feel that it is important to note after that, I have only had sex with 1 person, and I did NOT even say it to her ever at any point ever… I never slept with this girl, I turned her down to do it that night though it was the first time since before she ghosted me I had even seen her. My thing is that I have a problem with talking about my feelings/emotions/problems with anyone, and some-how she managed to get me to talk to her this night, even enough to tell her that I still loved her. I cant list everything that happened or this post will be miles long.. But, fast forward a literal day, I go to college do all my work, go pick up my brother that just got back from the military deployment, and ride around for a few hours waiting to go on a date with her that she planned for us the night before. We go on said date, drive back to the other state we originally met each other again in, and got some dinner. Afterwards we drive back a hour and drop her off, she goes and gets us some smoke, then I meet back at her house and we chill and get stoned. (HEAT STILL DOESN’T WORK) I’m freezing my ass off and shes convinced me we watching some chick-flick movie im like fuck it ight, that’s what we doin. Go climb in her bed and get comfortable and we almost did again, but I stopped it then aswell. That’s not the point here entirely, the point is I ended up staying the night and sleeping with her. That was this past weekend and I haven’t been around her since but we have talked and I was suppose to go see her later today. She has treated me better than she did in the past, but I must confess, I am the most introverted country dude ever was, and my ex has a SnakesTongue/The Gift of Gab, whatever you want to call it. She probably could talk me into some shit honestly. I need help here reddit. Do I send it or do I pull back and armor up? I have trust issues from her and other people in the past, and I don’t trust her. Im like one more go from slipping tripping and ending up in her pussy, tbh. I feel like this is moving in a odd way, I asked my brother about this and he was the BIGGEST Hometown Whore in my county, my boy was in the 35-40 count last time we thought about it. He too thought that it was very odd, especially to be dropping Love around this quickly and some other things were off. He was the whole reason I even gave her a shot, and he told me to not let my armor prevent me from knowing what I was missing, so I listened to him after a few hours and ended up doing just that, this is how this ended and I ended up sleeping with her, in a literal sense, we still haven’t shagged my G. Essentially, I let my armor down a little, and she shredded the rest of it and somehow made me a way I haven’t been since we were together the first time. I went from a hard-ass to a Mushy-ass as my brother described it… I don’t know what to do about this whole thing. Do I give it a shot or are there too many red flags? I haven’t been in as many relationships in my life as most people I know or they at least never made it very far. I do truly think that I love her because I wouldn’t have gave any of my other exes even a chance to talk to me, but I don’t know why I still feel this way, I haven’t even thought of her in a long time. But she can still finesse me and hit every sweet spot even the turn ons, and she remembers everything, I on the other hand do not. I smoked a lot of herb in HS and early college, I have something like a year or so gap I just don’t remember and some other stuff here and there I forgot, but I quit smoking like that and regained my memory back when I needed it thankfully. But I just need more outside opinions, because honestly I don’t know and I’m scared to get in a relationship in all honesty even though that hurts to admit. The ones after her were awful, but I feel it is unnecessary to go into those here as were already nearing 1300 words and I don’t see many people even responding to me, I tried to post something like this days ago and never got any feedback or comments, but anything y’all leave is greatly appreciated. I just need opinions if this sounds sort of sketchy, or like a bad idea or something that would end up with me getting hurt in some way. I would like to consider myself what one would call a CBM – Crazy Bitch Magnet… I have a history of pulling absolutely crazy bitches out of left field. She wasn’t ever super crazy, she was just a little loud, and I don’t trust her still over the whole law thing on all my boys back in the day. I think I could keep going on and on here but I think its just going to be rambling if anyone will actually even read this far.

900,I spoke to my landlord about early termination of our lease(roommate disappeared and we don’t make enough) and she stated that if we gave 60 days notice she would let us out of the lease. Now she’s screening our calls and refuses to speak with us. What can we do?,18Nov2020,1
901,"Here’s the back story: I received a text from a friend this morning voicing her opinion about how I always take the professors side when she’s venting about school. I didn’t even realize I was doing that until she sent me an angry text about “how I don’t see things through her perspective and always taking the teachers side”. 

She has a history of knowing what she wants to hear from someone, and if she doesn’t receive the answer she wants she blames the person for being disingenuous or “always being on the teachers” side in my case. She had expressed to me in the past that she purposely does this to see if people genuinely care about it. And this time I’m on the blunt end of it. 

It’s extremely frustrating because she is always telling me how she does want to surround herself around  people who are “fake”, and now she’s turned her back on me. 

It wasn’t my intentions to “take someone else’s side”, I did reply with an apology even though I knew I didn’t do anything wrong. However, her personality and way she voiced her opinion gave me no choice. 

Also, I’ve watched her to this to friends she’s been close with for years, hurt cut contact and stop being friends because they didn’t take her side of things when she voiced them.

I’m always walking on eggshells with her, I don’t know how to respond to her when she’s asking for “advice”, when clearly she already has a set idea or answer in her mind.

909,"I don't have a lot of experience with women outside of work or school and never had that many friends (again, usually socialize at work).

I'm currently talking to this girl and due to my lack of experience, I sometimes wonder if she likes me more than a friend. I can't tell though. We became friends pretty fast and it happened recently. I originally added her on a social media app (I asked first of course) and eventually she gave me her phone number instead because she doesn't use the app that much. And we've been texting each other every day since we exchanged contacts... she even texts me on her days off.

Some of the odd things I've noticed are:

-one time she was telling me how her day went, she told me she went for a walk with ""her only guy friend"". I remember her saying it like that and it made me wonder why she had to specify his sex.

-during lunch one time, we both headed home and were texting a bit during lunch. At the end of lunch she asked me if I was at work yet. I thought it was kind of odd. I figured she wanted to show me something, but nope. It feels nice having someone check on me.

-I asked her out for lunch and she politely said she already had plans with her friend that day. What I found odd was that she mentioned the guy by name. lol I don't know him. Which makes me think it was her way of telling me she's already seeing someone? Which is fine I guess. I did get sad and later that day, she texted me and we messaged each other for a little over an hour that night.

I'm honestly having a great time with her. I really wish I could spend more and more time with her. But I'm happy that I'm around her at work and we are able to talk or play with each other at work. I don't really think I'll date her because I'm 33 and she's 18. Huge age difference. But the weird thing is, we talk a lot (myself in particular, I'm usually a quiet person but I talk a lot with her) and we can relate with each other in many ways. Yeah, we're very different, but we get each other. And I still feel a bit confused as to why an 18 year old enjoys my company. Maybe I'm just letting society get in the way of things.

What do you guys think? I don't think I'll ask her out again (even though I did ask her out at the very last minute) but that may change. I just don't want to creep her out.

911,"A  few months ago I started working on a project with two coworkers, let's  call them Mark and Lucas. Mark came up with the original idea and Lucas  joined soon after. It's a fairly new project and both my coworkers were  really happy to have me on the team since the progress was stagnating  for some time.

As time progressed,  however, I started noticing a pattern. We have regular meetings and  Mark would always end up hijacking them with negative energy. Even  though we were making progress, nothing was good enough for him. At  almost every meeting, he professed a desire to quit. Then he would  backtrack and say that because this project is like his baby, he doesn't  want to abandon it.

There would  be an emotional outburst at nearly every meeting. Sometimes he would  blame Lucas for the project's ""failure"", but most of the time he just  seems deeply conflicted about his own life and desires. Aside from this  project, I don't think he's working on anything else. He quit his last  job because he had a burnout and it doesn't seem like he has many  positive relationships in his life.

Mark  isn't an unpleasant person, he's really nice. But it's gotten to the  point that working with him has become unpleasant. He's very comfortable  with venting his frustrations to Lucas and I (I assume because he  doesn't have many people to talk to), but that just turns into him  unloading all of his emotions on us, and us feeling drained at the end  of every meeting. Plus all of this made it very difficult to actually  get work done.

After months of  this, we decided to take a break from the project. Mark said he needed  one and honestly, I was fine with it. Now we're slowly picking it back  up again, but nothing has changed.

I  truly love the project itself and I think the idea has a lot of  potential, but it's become really frustrating to work in an environment  like this. He gets triggered easily. Pitching ideas to him is difficult -  although there isn't supposed to be a hierarchy within the project, it  feels as though the project is his because it was his original idea, and  that's kind of how he treats it. His vision for the project isn't  realistic but he shoots down any other suggestions Lucas and I have.

I  don't want to leave the project because, like I said, I think the idea  is wonderful and it has a lot of potential. I honestly think it would be  much better if Lucas and I continued working on it without Mark but I  would feel really bad to kick him out, especially since it was  originally his idea.

After a  particularly bad outburst last week, Lucas and I decided that we should  address the issue. I spoke to him and it turned out that he's also been  feeling frustrated - he's been working with Mark longer than I have and  he said it's always been like this. I'm not afraid of it turning violent  or anything, Mark is a very sweet-natured person. But there is  definitely a big chance that he could take it the wrong way and that he  could have another bad emotional outburst.

How do I bring this up without upsetting him?

914,"hi there 

i’m 15 and so is she 

here’s a little bit of back story. we met this year at the beginning of the school year and hit it off immediately. we were both new to the school and became SUPER fast friends.
we are both the closed off type but we gained such a trust for eachother really fast. she said that i know things about her that people shes known for years doesnt know.
we got our feelings out of the way fast and said what we want out of this and started dating.

i know this person more than i know anyone, and vice versa. 

it’s been a month and a week of dating now and we are working out pretty well.

we are both not the best mentally. since grade 7 (i am now in grade 10) i’ve been struggling silently with depression and anxiety. she said she was worried about me so after years of suffering i decided to ask my mom to book me a therapist. i want to be ok for her and i want her to know that i’m trying.

i really want to try for this person, i love them more than just a girlfriend and more than just a friend. 

she also deals with pretty bad depression and anxiety (and other things i would not like to say). i really hate seeing her like this, and it pains me to know she’s been like this for a long time.

i know that i can’t take all of the pain and hurt away and i know that it’s a serious mental issue that can’t just be fixed with a snap, but what are things i can do that let her know i am here to support her, and let her know that i am always going to be here for her?

i care for her so greatly and i want the best for her, what should i do?",18Nov2020,8

I cant tell my family about it because they’re super religious and homophobic.

He dropped the single and I finally got around to listening to it, and honestly. It's really bad. His vocals are so obviously dependent on autotune it makes me cringe honestly.

919,"To start off, he is in a relationship with a girl who's close to me. We are part of a tight friend group.

She has allowed him to kiss and have sex with other people as long as she's still his number 1 and he doesn't develop feelings for someone else too. Kind of like an open relationship.

He and I have had sex, cuddled and kissed often and I have slowly fallen in love with him.
No, I didn't simply fall in love with someone whom I have sex with often. We had a strong bond beforehand, otherwise I wouldn't have done that for so long. He became an important part of my life.

I don't want to ruin our friend group or anything with relationship drama, but I am on the verge of confessing.
We often say stuff like ""I like you"" but aren't close to ""I love you"" in our language (German), but he once told me that one time I understood ""I like you"" when he actually said ""I love you""

Now, I started hooking up with some other guy just for sex and no feelings whatsoever and he became very jealous of that guy (He literally told me). He also said something along the lines of ""Do you think if I wasn't with [his gf] I wouldn't be with you? I dont have sex just for fun with you"" and I am starting to get the feeling he might like me back.

I love the both of them being in a relationship, they take care of eachother and make sure both are healthy and happy. While a polyamorous relationship may also be an option- I simply don't want that.

930,"Hi I (16F) needs an advice ( yeah i know it's the whole point of this sub x) )

Let me explain my dad is cheating on my mom and I know this is very strange but he still leave with us even tho we all know that ( my mom too ). We all hate him ( my two brothers, my mom, my grandma (his mom btw) and me) that's legit. He gets what he deserved but he really don't care... My parents are in divorce proceedings and we are waiting for a reply for a legal aid 'cause we are not rich sooo I really hope it's gonna be okay and we will get it wathever this is not the problem. 

Let me talk a bit about my dad. He's the type of man who works with pressure tactics to be authoritarian. For example not later than sunday we were in the car going back home because we were at my grandma's house ( I'll explain why later ) and since september I barely talk to him anymore because he yelled at my mom and throw water on her ( he never hit her ) and that was a big NO for me and it was enough you don't touch my mom and I also hate him because he is making her suffer and I love my mom with all my heart she is seriously the kindest person on earth and everyone love her ( at work for example ). She would never hurt anyone. Sorry I  digress from the subject. So we were in the car and he agressively ask me ""you have a problem with me !!!!!  ?"" In my head I was like ""hell yeah you asshole"" but I didn't want to be yelled at so I said no and now I am faking more than ever when I see him coming at home after work... So see pressure tactics...  

For the fact we were at my grandma's house it's quick to explain. She is tired because recently she had a big operation to her legs and she must recover and so my dad say that he go to her house during the week end to help her. But the truth is that he give her even more work (by dirtying the house for example and my grandma is maniac so she can't let her house dirty it's bigger than her even when I tell her that she had a big operation and she sould stop doing it she continue) So he gives her more work and he go to her house just so he don't see us and so he can call the woman in the garrage in peace. I went that week end and not the other because school is giving soooooo much work and I have to keep my grades high but I go when i can to help her that's why we were at her house. And I am always wearing a mask and staying as far as possible from my grandma even tho I hate not being able to kiss her or hug her but I love her so I protect her.

It's been now 5 years that the dispute that led to this divorce has started and it's been 5 horrible years. I think a lot of people now the feelings when you don't want to go back home, you don't want to see THAT person and the atmosphere at my place is really heavy and barely unbearable. We all want the divorce to end so he can go and we can leave at peace. And now it's finally almost over.

&amp;#x200B;

BUT since we learned that he has another slut in his life ( yes this is what she is because being in a relationships with a married man/woman make you a slut/bitch/asshole ) we are learning really shocking fact like my father in 19 years never took my mom to a restaurant and he took that bitch to an EXPENSIVE restaurant and my father talked to the waitress (like you're in a restaurant that's what you do) and the slut throw a tantrum because of that (she is a really possessive woman) and my father has a strong personality and normally he would have yelled. Guess what he did... He said nothing. He's so obedient with her on the other hand he always ""lead"" everything at home (I don't know how to say that not in term like he do the laundry and takes care of his child but like the boss of the family. He say something ad we have to be obedient and do it.) I hope it's clear. 

&amp;#x200B;

And when we learned that , my mom told my brothers and I that she wanted to take revenge on him for all the trouble he caused. Because he is getting everything he wants ( the divorce so he can go away ) too easily (which I agree). He made us suffer for years and now that that bitch told him to divorce he listen to her and he get it and then they can leave happily ever after. My mom would like to tell him that she don't want a divorce anymore and if he wants to divorce well go do the steps alone and deal with it. Because currently they have agreed to an amicable divorce so that it will take less time.

Also because my father and the slut are making plans. Like in 3 months we're together and all. I hope you understand what I mean xD So it will be a way to piss them off. And we all want them to suffer.

But on the other hand my brothers and I told my mom that we would like to leave peacefully the sooner and that we understand that she wants to take a revenge but at the same time that's how we feel. So I don't know what to do anymore and what advice I could give to my mom ?

Oh and don't worry for my mental health I feel down and I am really sad and tired (mentally and physically tbh) but I have amazing friends that don't know what is going on in my house but they know that I am not feeling good and they are really nice (they came to my house (not inside don't worry 6ft apart and masked because covid) to give me my birthday gift yesterday and I am so happy with it (that's a unicorn onesie yep i'm 16 and love unicorn xD they're everywhere in my room x) )

Also I am sorry if some grammar or things like that are not perfect. English is not my first language but I did my best \^\^

Thanks and congratulations for reading my whole story :D I hope some redditors can help me and give me advice. Have a good day/night !",18Nov2020,1
931,"My (17f) dad has been an alchoholic all my life and most of my brothers and sisters lives (31-39 f and m). My family is kinda a blended family, my mum and dad are eachothers second serious relationship, they both were married before meeting eachother and had 3 (dad mff) and 5 (mum mmmfm) kids and after about 12 years of getting together I was born. My family always joak that he went out to wet the babys (me) head and didnt stop. My mum died when I was 15 and I have cut contact with my dads family because they're all enablers, luckily I am very close physically and emotionally to my mums side (we live like in the same street)

Lately he has stopped drinking again. Normally he does about 4 or 5 days without then goes back but for these 4 pr 5 days hes so pissy. (Example. I bought chicken to make a roast he opened the packet left 2 breasts (I have no issue with this I wouldnt have ate the whole pack anyways but he left the open pack on the top shelf of the fridge. On tuesday I got round to making the roast and found the chicken (important note it needed to be ate by tuesday) I couldn't use it because it had been left out to air so I binned it and cleaned the fridge. When he got home I said dont put meat on the top shelf it's not safe. Holy fuck you should have heard the argument) 

On to today I get home and the baby gate is open (we have a baby gate because my dog got into his bedroom and ate some rat poisen which he wasnt there for (fun story) and she trys to get out) and the dog tried to get out, I stopped her and asked him can you close the gate that's the third time this week I've caught her at the door (I dont leave the door open I've learnt my £500 lesson) and he flipped ""I work all day and come home and clean the house (I'd just that second walked in from school) sorry if I leave the gate open"" i replied ""ok myter doesn't matter if the dog gets out not like shes a living being"" and walked off. We later had an argument about the chicken again (now I wanna mention this was an asda pack of four for about £4.75 and I through out 50%of the pack) he came in and said how stupid I am for wasting food and he dosnt want to have to turn the sky off again (in the summer the sky got turned off because he got layed off for 6 weeks and went out to get drunk every day of those six weeks, he did not see me for a week straight and we live in the same house, this is also the time where the dog got poisoned and I couldn't get in touch with him at all) I said ""2 chicken breasts wasted does not equate 6 weeks layed off drinking all the wages"" and just keped repeating it over his arguments. He then said ""your mum would be so ashamed of how you talk to me. I shouldnt bring her into it tho"" I replied ""dont bring her into it if you shouldnt and you know what she would be ashamed off you neglecting me"" and I put my headphones on. 

I couldn't help break down crying because I know I'm a hand full and it feels like I'm pushing him to the drinking. I went into my nan's (next door) (and hop off my dick I already know I'm a piece of shit but I couldn't cope I havent spoke to anyone since the new lockdown) I feel like it's me pushing him to the drink because of all our arguments. Idk anymore",18Nov2020,1

Anyway, a little ways in he told me he liked me and I told him I wasn't interested and he said we could keep being friends so I believed him. He kept trying to do things with me and was getting angry when I had plans with other people so I told him I needed some space. He got really mad and blocked me on everything and then unblocked me a little later and apologized. The next day I got to work and there were 3 different vases of flowers. I told a coworker what happened cause they though it was cute and I gave them away. The next night we worked together and he asked if we could talk on my lunch and I said no. He came out to my car anyway and cried for the whole 30 minutes saying he was sorry and a bunch of other stuff I don't remember. I told my manager what was happening and he ended up getting fired.

 After that I blocked him but he kept making new accounts and at one point pretended to be his friend I had met and said he had been hit by a car while running and was in the hospital and wanted me to visit. This went on for three months with him making a total of at least 15 different accounts on various social media and using different numbers. He has also sent a picture to me of him at a grocery store he knew was close to my house at the time. Note: this was during the holidays when this all started. 

Then in September of last year he contacted me again and I told him to leave me alone and then just this year hes reserved some stuff online at the store I work which he knows he can't pick up cause he's banned from the store. I've thought that I had seen him a few times but it's hard to tell with the mask and I though I was just being crazy. 

Anyway no one I talk to seems to think it's concerning they just kind of laugh at how crazy he is and blow it off but it makes me really uncomfortable and I just want to know if I'm being dramatic for being worried about the whole situation. There's more that he's done but it was a while ago so I remember things at different times and the details are hazy. I also wanted to try and keep this short so hopefully someone can ready give me advice or make me feel less crazy about my concern

935,"TW: racism, censored n-word

My mom (55F) and I (31F) had a major falling out over my support of the BLM protestors and her support of the police. And later, I attempted to speak to her about the issue in a more calm manner, over speakerphone while my kids were in the tub. They were 1.5 and 4 respectively when this happened, and were happily playing and not paying us a bit of attention. She used the n-word 3 times in that conversation, which absolutely FLOORED ME. For context, this is the same woman who once yelled at my grandmother and threatened to never let her see me again because she used that word to refer to a black person in my mother's presence. The way she used the word wasn't to refer to any black person, it was basically saying ""well black people say n\*\*\*\*\* and it's not racist"", and each time she said it she immediately corrected herself and backtracked, apologizing and claiming it was an accident.

Now, to be clear, I KNOW I shouldn't have let her get away with it once, much less 3 times. I should have said something immediately, and that's on me for not doing it. In my defense, the first time I was so stunned I couldn't even react, and once I finally recovered I recognized that the conversation was already on thin ice. My mom doesn't handle pushback well at ALL. I knew that saying anything at that moment was just asking for a giant, nasty fight, which I didn't want to have at that moment, in front of my kids. Plus, each time it happened I naively thought, surely she wouldn't do it *again*?

She used it again in a call a few days later, again in the context of ""well other people say n\*\*\*\*\*\*"", not actually calling a black person that word, but I didn't care, I'd had enough and I finally spoke up. I told her she needed to stop saying that word and she said ""you know what, this time I'm not even sorry"". We yelled at each other for a minute and then I hung up on her, absolutely FURIOUS.

A few months later we spoke again over text and I attempted to find out why she said such a thing and basically what she told me was that she understands and agrees that it's unacceptable to use the word to refer to a black person in any context, but that she uses the word with her friends when discussing race and racism. She framed it as adults having a rational debate about the topic, and claimed that she's not used to censoring herself because she isn't around me or my children very often.

I tried to explain to my mom that it is unacceptable to use that word ever, in any scenario or context, for any reason, whether you're referring to a person or not, but my mother puts exactly zero value in anything I say. In her eyes, I'm just some overly sensitive, PC police, SJW, snowflake millennial and she thinks she did absolutely nothing wrong.

So, Reddit, how can I convince my mother that using the n-word is never okay? I will be sending this to my mother, so please bear in mind that she will probably read your responses and be kind. She is still my mother, after all.

I was worried sick and couldn't stop thinking that I had lost her before I had a chance to meet her. She had been really sweet and caring to me before this and had allowed me to open up on things I haven't told anyone else. I talked to her everyday that she was in hospital to get her mind off the pain she was in and to make her feel better. It took her a while but she finally got out and we continued talking. She already had plans to come close to where I live for a holiday and so we were coming up with things that we could do together.
Fast forward a bit and she tells me that she loves me. She loves me because she because she had been kidnapped and severely tortured as well as both of her parents being dead. I loved her as well for who she was and she had shown me more compassion then either of my parents had. Fast forward a couple weeks and I find out from one of her friends that she had been lying to me. She told me that she was taking a nap or going for a walk when she was actually going and seeing someone. I talk to the girl I was in a relationship with and she told me that she did love me but saw me as a close friend as opposed to her partner. This broke my heart. What makes it worse is that she has immediately moved on and is with the person she had been seeing and is trying to talk to me as if we are just friends.

So I'm 22. My mother is a schizophrenia patient since I was born : Always angry, bad memory. It hurts me seeing her like that I take care of her a lot just like she is my kid. She used to throw me out of the house when I was just 4 years old and beat me that I got visible bruises all over my body. My father is a very busy businessman and I never share a single thing with him because he didn't have time and is not interested. One day my grandfather took me with him and I stayed at his house for 5 years all alone. I was always bullied at school for being so silent and everybody thought that I have an attitude as I belong to an upper class family of my city. Fellow kids used torn my books, lock me in the school bathroom and never have I ever had a single meal in the break time because some teachers loved beating me in those 30 minutes. I was afraid of people all my childhood and then I became a victim of pedophilia at age 10 for 4 years. I started hating my body. I thought I was a junk of garbage that's why everybody treats me that way specially after that pedophile experience I believed everything is my fault. In 5 class I tried to attempt suicide but I failed.

I came back to my home when I was in 10th grade. Now in these 5 years at my grandfather house I became a popular kid at school because I was great at art. I won each and every painting, singing, poetry, acting competition at district level and had a huge following that appreciated me for my work. Girls used to come to my home in the day and even at late nights with their parents to specially binge-watch my paintings that I made on my house walls. But things were once again the same. My mother used to lose control of herself and had a really bad memory. Her condition was worse than before. She started beating me again. She would have torn my poetry books, break my color palettes and just stand there like it's not a big deal. I was scared and shattered again I lost all my confidence I stopped meeting people I stopped going to college and lost all my opportunities that I worked so hard to get in all those 5 years and lost my grades too.

We moved to another city.  I was just passing life and had zero interest in everything happening in this world. One day in my art gallery while I was waiting for my driver I met my old friend who was with a boy. I didn't talk to her much and just went home. Now we used to meet daily whenever at night I used to wait for the driver. She was always with this boy and tell me that she likes him, but he is not interested in her. I never talked to him because I thought it was none of my business.

One day he straightforwardly came to me. I was shocked at his way of approaching me as we were completely strangers, and then he proposed me for marriage. I have never seen his face before because whenever he used to be with my friend I always tried to completely ignore his presence. It was the first time I was looking at him. He told me that he loves me, and I was like “who are you bro?”  Then he tried to convince me in every way a person can be convinced. He I must say “begged to me” for 4 months and told me that he is already divorced and a mature man.

The first girl he got married to convinced him to get married to her and when he got against all his family, rebel his caste people and married her in the court, that girl left him for another boy who was rich. Since then, he was broke and alone. His family had abandoned him already for marrying out of caste, and he was living all alone for 8 years now. He told me that he had waited many years for a person like me, and he just can't let me go like that. Let's say he manipulated me at his best. I was 19 and never had an affair before and was always like a “tom boy girl” with zero interest in love stories. He cried and cried whenever I didn't respond him. He was a 28 mature man, and he cried and it made me feel so anxious. Whenever he smiled it made my soul satisfied. For the first time in my life I had someone who was standing by my side. I don't know what is love but i never ever trusted someone like the way I trusted him.

But Things were getting worst at home. My mom continued beating me, all my friends used to ask me about my bruises and I would always lie to them that I had an accident or something. Then one day I got so fed up that I told him to send his parents to my home to talk about marriage, but he simply refused that they didn't agree for the first marriage how will they tolerate this one when he hasn't met them in years. Then we went for court marriage.

He was a very disturbed person. He was always angry would abuse without reason, fight without reason, was always scared of the slightest things and had huge trust issues over me who left her family trusting him. He took us to a complete jungle kind of place away from the main city. He kept me locked in a room for 3 years. A room with no windows. I didn't have a phone and with his phone I was not allowed to call or talk to anyone. Whenever I used to ask him why he is doing this he would say I'm protecting you. After 1 month of marriage I came to know that he was already a chain drug addict before marriage and now.  He had no sleeping routine. Would wake me up in the middle of night and ask me “who are you ?”

After 10 months of marriage I had a baby. I convinced him hard to take me to a doctor for the delivery, and he did. After my daughter was born he was very angry and started beating both of us. The verbal abuse also increased to the best of filth. Then Again after 3 months I was pregnant although I didn't want to get pregnant but I didn't have a choice to refuse either. Throughout my pregnancy he beat me and my 3-month-old and tried to kill me for 3 times. My 3-month-old had bruises all over her body as I used to have throughout my childhood and watching her while giving her a shower used to give me shivers. Now My second daughter was born.  He didn't use to beat her much but me and my elder one used to take care of the younger one a lot of so that she stays away from the wrath of her father. My 1.5-year-old (the elder one) sometimes used to shock me she was not an ordinary child. She would never let her younger sister cry, she would never let me cry and just hug me whenever I broke into pieces. I took care of my husband. He shouted slapped me daily but I would simply forget as I used to believe the power of love can change anyone, one day he will realize my love and sacrifices.

One day his family intervened they got to know about us, and we moved to his parents house. He convinced everyone daily that I was the junk in his life, and he deserved better. He did my character assassination in front of me and his family although he knew he was lying. He shared our sex life and secrets with his friends and family. They were his family, so they believed him and then one day he threw me out of the house and told me that if I ever try to meet the kids he will kill someone from my family and nobody can harm him because he belongs to a powerful family.  I came to my parents home.He left me in June 2020 I cry I miss my kids they are just 1.5 and 2.5  years old. Now I'm trying to financially stable myself but it will take me a year to get enough money to support my kids as my family does not support me I tried to convince them but failed. I get doomed by the thought that my 1 and 2-year-old are away from me. And Now he has started calling me again. This is the 4th time he has thrown me out of the house and called me again. And whenever I went back he was worse than before as he always treated me that I don't have an option except agreeing to him.

This time He is telling me that I was a drug addict at all those times that's why I did all those things. I'm a changed person now I've left drugs and I'm very ashamed of whatever I did. He is telling me that I should not judge him for the things he did when he smoked weed. He is telling me that my elder one (2.5 year-old) is continuously ill and loosing weight from the past 5 months and doctors are telling him that the kid is missing her mother. He is telling me that I've changed myself for you and kids. My family is telling me to give him a chance again. And as usually my mother has started abusing me again.  
I don't know.  
Sometimes I cry and sometimes I laugh at my life And sometimes I go numb.   
Should I go back ? Should I not?

946,"I work at the front desk for a clothing store. right now the store is appointment only (but its free to make an appointment). 

so this dude came in and i told him it was appointment only but it wasn't busy so there were loads of spots available. the front desk has a bench behind it and he was booking it on his laptop so he asked if he could sit on the bench to make his appointment and i said sure. he sat on the bench behind me and he was keeping his distance still so i really didnt have a problem with it. i watched him sit down because i wanted to make sure he was far from me. so he sits for about 20 seconds while he makes his appointment, i check him in, and in he goes. no problem.

my coworker doesn't say anything to me, but then sends an email to my supervisor basically over-exaggerating what happened. they told my supervisor that i was letting the guy go around in the store, without an appointment and that he was sitting right next to me. plus there was literally nobody else in the main entrance so thats why i didn't see any problem with letting him sit there. Keep in mind that my coworker was working the register and the register is facing my desk, so my coworker has clear view of me. **Yes i agree that i should have told the guy to make his appointment outside**, but in my opinion it was such a small thing and it seems like it is being made a bigger deal than it is. 

i'm genuinely really annoyed by that. I am annoyed that my coworker went behind my back about the whole thing and lied about the details. they saw what happened and i know for a fact that they are lying to my manager. 

This is not something i would get fired for, and my manager doesnt really care, but i it still pissed me off. i want to explain things to my manager but i dont know it its worth the energy. 

I haven't responded to my manager yet and i'm not sure what to say. **Should i explain the truth about what happened or should i just say 'my mistake' and move on.**

A couple of weeks ago I discovered that my DNA didn't match my dads.

My birth father doesn't even know I exist. He got married twenty years before I was born, and is still married to the same woman.
He has two adult kids with families of their own.

I have decided to tell him about me. One of the reasons being that I feel that both him and his kids has the right to know. Yes, I would want a relationship with them, but I understand that it might not happen, and I'm prepared for that.

But how?

I have his address, his phone number and his social media account.

My mother said I should wait until after the holidays, because I could ruin a lot in their family. And that's what I'm afraid of as well. I don't want to destroy the world views of my half-siblings, or ruin his marriage.

949,"Hey there redditors,

Just looking for a little advice before I spiral down.

I've dealt with anxiety and depression for many years. Quickly approaching a decade. Whenever I have gone to a therapist/counselor, they have always focused like a laser beam on my depression, and not so much on the anxiety.

Here's the issue. My mind races at a constant, high alert level all day. I've always been wary of anti-depressants, mainly because of the stigma from family. The only thing that seems to work at alleviating my anxiety is depressants. Personally, I feel as though my depression is **directly** caused by my anxiety, as it prevents me from enjoying social situations, doing things, etc, and therefore solving the anxiety issue would solve my depression as well. However, like I've mentioned, the focus seems to be on depression, as that seems to be the ""greater concern"" (i.e. they're concerned of self harm etc. I'm not going to do that, and said I'm not going to do that, but they seem more concerned with depression being the larger issue than anxiety).

Are anti-depressants dangerous for someone who's mind is racing at 110% all day? I would assume that I need something to *slow me down* but obviously I'm not a medical expert.",18Nov2020,1

951,"My dad has had a dangerous temper for his entire life, and it often leads to very intense arguments in the family. Now, I can't tell you whether or not he's *right* in these arguments, but he's certainly always more aggressive than necessary.

The way he argues is incredibly annoying; it's always centered on a very small detail that only he cares about, yet he frames it so that it's impossible to counter him. Here's a great example of what I mean:

We went to go buy dad a suit. My mom and I split the cost, and he didn't have to pay a single penny. When we were checking out, the store clerk showed us the price and he instantly told me to get my calculator and check the price. Now, at that moment I was on a phone call with one of my teachers about a school council event. I signalled to him ""I CAN'T"". He kept bothering me about it though, saying how it's important I ""develop financial responsibility and avoid getting cheated"". Finally, when the call ended, I told him ""you also have a calculator on your phone, so why don't you do it?""

He exploded at me in anger, saying ""Oh yeah??? if you have legs why don't you walk to school?"" (My school takes an hour to bus to, so imagine walking :)). 

I tried to be logical and presented the following arguments to him as calmly as I could:

1) Calculating prices of store items is simple addition and then multiplying by 1.05 to account for the 5% tax in my city. This is something a grade schooler can do, and he should not be uptight about specifically having me do this. 

2) Even if I were to verify the store clerk's numbers, it's the staff who put up the prices. They could just say a suit is worth $5000 when it's actually $50, so even if I did the math it would be wrong regardless. This is not an effective way to avoid getting scammed.

Most importantly, he's an adult man. Who gets *this* mad about this type of stuff when they're not even paying? I can't convey the embarassment I felt knowing everyone near the store could witness him yelling loudly at a teenager. Now here's the thing. Yes, he's right that I need to be aware of people cheating me on prices, but the way this unfolded is just so incredibly unnecessary. 

Imagine having these arguments every few days. It's not always me who's involved, it could be my mom or my brother. The yelling is very loud, and it ruins everyone's mood. The point isn't even who's right or wrong (if anyone is right at all). It just happens so frequently, and I can't deal with it. I can't just ""kick him out of the house"", and no amount of ""family meetings"" has ever or will ever change his personality. I'm a university student, not a licensed counselor. What should I do? I just want a quiet life.",18Nov2020,1
952,"There is a girl in my class who has been actively trying to grope me and have sex with me. I've told her multiple times to stop but then she gets angry at me and tells me I should enjoy it.

956,"I am a musician who lives in Vermont. I am a private and socially awkward person, and I've had a lot of trouble making friends ever since i was little, so my immediate friend group has always been very very small, usually only consisting of the few people that i was in a band with at any given time. I've never been one to go out to social gatherings because they are downright terrifying, and the only time I've ever been able to feel the confidence to put myself out there has been while i was onstage. Shows that i was playing in were about the only reason i would ever leave the house besides going to work, and were thus my only opportunities for social interaction, to simply TRY and make connections with other people, even if I didn't have much success.

The scene around Burlington is not large, and everyone pretty much knows everybody, but in my case this wasn't quite true. What ended up happening was that I didnt know anyone, but they all knew me, if only by sight and what they'd heard about me. This situation led to a perfect storm for false rumors to ruin my life.

About 4 years ago a rumor began to spread about me in my small local scene about how I was supposedly using my platform in my band to prey on underage girls and that i creeped on girls at shows. At first, us in the band thought the random anonymous tweet that this originated from was referring to a different member of our band, a person who is one of the most manipulative and sociapathic people I've ever had the disfortune to have in my life, lets call him L. Every time me or one of my friends would get into a new relationship, L would go out of their way to begin talking and flirting with the person we had started to form a relationship with and manipulate from the inside, telling them all about how horrible we are behind our backs while pretending to be friendly to our faces. This happened over and over again, and furthermore we had been becoming increasingly uncomfortable with his propensity to talk to and sleep with underage girls as we were all creeping into our 20's.

Much to my horror however, it turned out that the rumors were being centered on me, revolving around half truths and lies about a  relationship i'd been involved in about a year and a half prior. This relationship had only lasted about a month, and was fraught with red flags from day 1. She was 17 and I was 20 (not exactly a huge age difference, but the fact that she was 17 is the main reason people were led to believe the ""underage girls"" part of the rumor), and she had just left her last relationship a few weeks before. I was naive enough/stupid enough to believe her assurances that it was fine. After we started dating, she would beg me not to tell her best friend, lets call this friend ""P"", that we were seeing eachother, as she believed P would be mad at her about it for some reason. I was uncomfortable with this, and didnt understand, but i respected her wishes. She then basically moved into my apartment for two weeks, but she met a guy in her class at college and she left me for him. I know now that I was just a rebound for her, and as much as it hurt I can't blame her for it. As soon as it ended though, P was in my inbox, telling me all about how she ""knew"" about all kinds of horrible stuff I'd supposedly done to this girl and how I'd manipulated her into having sex with me, etc. But none of these things were true, we had entered into the relationship mutually, and she had initatied all sexual contact (i had been very clear with her that i was fine with waiting but she jumped right into it, i think maybe because she thought it would make me happy but i can't say for sure. I KNOW that i didn't push her into sex.) I tried to tell P the truth but she straight up didnt believe me, preferring to believe her friend, which i suppose i understand and is admirable. My best guess is that my ex told her these things to deflect P's anger at me instead of at her, as it seemed to me that she was afraid of P. As it turned out, P was the person who made the anonymous twitter post that started all this, NOT my ex. The experience from that short-lived relationship turned out to be good for me in the short term, as i stopped actively seeking relationships and began to put a lot of work into myself. Unfortunately the long term effects were less than stellar...

When the tweet came out I suddenly found myself in the middle of a shitstorm on social media. People i didnt even know were like ""oh yeah that guy he looks like a creep"", and then the whole thing blew up to a yet new level, when L capitalised on the opportunity he saw to raise his own social standing and publically declared he was leaving the band and that i was a manipulative person toward him (mind you, this happened just a month and a half after i started dating a girl he'd been taking advantage of on the side of his primary relationship and she rejected him to be with me, which he did not take well). He soon after tried to retract his statement about me when none of the other members of our band followed suit with him, and he effectively lost all our friendships, but at that point the damage was done. The people of the scene only saw confimation that i was some kind of predator, despite the fact that i had/still have a loving relationship with my wonderful girlfriend and that i literally don't talk to anyone.

When this happened i didn't know what to do at all. I just kinda retreated into seclusion and shut off social media so i couldn't see the horrible things people were saying about me. I felt like the whole situation was too fucking complex to explain and that no one was particularly inclined to want to believe me anyhow. I am not a predator, and i have never been one. I do not harass women or take advantage of them. I think the thing that hurt the worst was the confimation behind all those years of me thinking ""dont be wierd, people will think your creepy"". I guess no matter what i did people were going to think i was creepy anyway.

Now here we are today, four years later, and the rumors still persist. I was talking to a friend of mine the other night about how it was frustrating that no one seems to care about my music around town, and he brought up the fact that my reputation still preceeds me here. People who don't even know me and have never met me dont want anything to do with me or to work with me or support me because they all think I'm predatory scum (which honestly i cant blame them for thinking because if all you hear about someone is that they are bad then you're probably gonna think they're bad and no one wants that association). It effects my every day life too, and it drives me crazy wondering what people are thinking about me behind their eyes. People I've never even seen before scowl at me. My friend suggested that i should just move away, and while that would be great and all, it feels like a bandaid solution, and also painfully unfair as i never did anything to warrant my crucifixion in the first place. It feels like I'd just be running from my problems, and from my home. On top of that, my girlfriend is hesistant to leave and go somewhere she doesnt know anyone, and i want her to be happy.

All I've ever wanted in life was to make music my job. I cant think of a way I'd rather spend my life than through creating and performing, but it feels like I've been cut off before i even got close. How do I make the rumors stop? How do i convince all these people that that person isn't and never was me? Is it completely hopeless?",18Nov2020,3
957,"Throwaway because I'm uncomfortable with this topic being linked to my main. I'm in my mid 20s

A couple of days ago I unearthed some buried memories. I don't know who to talk to about this. 


Some background information :
I used to be with my ex for 4 years, we're in love with him for 4 years before that. He was my first love and I really wanted the relationship to work.
There were many happy moments but also a lot of pain and tears that I tried to hide as much as possible.


During the middle/end of our relationship I'd tell him not to do xyz during intercourse because it hurt me. I'd tell him to stop doing it when he ignored it. But he'd keep going. On the one hand side I felt pleasure but I really did want him to stop because I'd be in pain, sore and bleeding afterwards every time. He knew because I told him several times.

The other thing that was way worse for me was his love for anal. No for play, big d*ck, no talking because he didn't like that. First couple of times I begged him to take it slow and be gentle. He'd try to force himself into me slowly and would give up after a bit and just finish normally. 
Afterwards I'd just try to dodge until his patience ran out. Else I'd try my best to tell him to stop. 
One time, after him having complained for months, I didn't dodge. He pressed my face into a pillow and took me while I didn't move a single muscle and made no sound. Just silently praying he'd finish quickly so the pain would be over.


I've broken up 3 years ago. I'm in a loving relationship with an awesome guy now. But I sometimes still feel like I'm not completely over my ex. I don't want to ever think of him again. Every time he pops up in my mind I feel nauseous. It doesn't happen often anymore fortunately. 

Idk what I'm supposed to do with these memories. I bet there are even more hidden away. Should I just try to bury them again and just enjoy what I currently have?
I do not feel like a rape victim. Women who were actually raped have it much worse than me. But I feel like I have to give what happened to me a name to be able to deal with it.

I'm confused and will appreciate any advice.",18Nov2020,1
958,"My dad, sister, and I don’t like our mom. When she comes home the vibe is ruined and everyone goes upstairs, she would complain about the most dumbest stuff. Bitch at everyone and everything. There was a time where my family had to sit down and talk about chores. 

Cuz it became apparent my sister was dipping the house to go out with her bf and not pipe in doing chores. So it was always my dad and I. My mom wanted it done before she came home. My mom acts Liek her jobs is all that but she literally stands around and bosses people around

. But anyways everyday my dad and I took turns. My sister  pipied in 4 times after the talk And then stopped doing them again. And we had to start over again making new rules. I wash my dishes and my sister washes hers, and my dad washed his. Then I realized when I did dishes my sister never washed her. Why? Cuz she left the house again with her bf. Making me do chores so now I stopped doing dishes all together cuz I was cleaning other peoples shit. My mom got extremely mad when she had to do the dishes again and I explained i stoped cuz I had to clean everyone’s shit. She said I do nothing. When literally for 2 weeks straight I’ve done everyone’s dishes...when that wasn’t the plan. She kept yelling I do nothing then I came at her neck with straight facts and evidence then she started saying she knows I do stuff and starts comparing that she does more. She knows she’s in the wrong but she started playing victim. This is when I started to hate my mother. I did dishes again and stopped.


 So now today my mom came home. first thing I hear is the slam of a door and yelling. She bitching about the dishes. Saying nobody did anything. I said I didn’t do  cuz I did it the other day and it wasn’t my turn. So my dad had to do it or my sister. But again my sister hasn’t done it in months cuz she leaves the house with he bf. My mom is screaming my name like Bloody Mary and I say politely “Yes?” She said “you know what I’m gonna say”...I said “you’re gonna blame me for not doing the dishes even-“ she cut me off and I said “Let me speak.” She kept cuttting me off and I had enough. She never let me speak so I said “You always let my sister go but come at me” she said she just yelled at her. And I said “But you didn’t yell at her any other time” I kept going saying that she always comes at me but I did them for weeks straight but once I stop she gets pissed and my sister does nothing nor does my dad. Then she stated comparing that she does more. Idk why it turned into a  competition. So I walked out the room. 

I don’t know what to do. I’m not crying like I thought I would cuz I’m used to it. I was so close to laughing cuz this is a joke. Literally treats me like a god damn joke. Idk... what can I do?",18Nov2020,2

961,"Long post, this post contains the Topic of Death &amp; possible Psychology.
So Trigger Warning, just in case.


My grandmother was my best friend &amp; the main parent of my life since I was 12. I loved her very dearly.
She died on 11/18/2020, &amp; of course I cried when it happened, but I got over it pretty quickly.

I am 22 now &amp; every year, I see my mother &amp; grandfather breaking down, crying about the anniversary of her death day &amp; I just don't... feel... sad, like they do? 

It's not that I don't miss her, I miss her very much &amp; place flowers &amp; jewelry she liked, on her urn, to give her a ""smile in the afterlife"".
But I don't feel the need to break down &amp; sob with an aching heart like the rest of my family...
I continue on my day with work &amp; errands as I normally do, happy to be left with everything my grandmother taught me to progress in my own life.

I was curious if this behaviour/reaction was... normal? Is it just me? Does anyone feel this way about death anniversaries, as well..? 
Any advice is appreciated!

TLDR: A family member very dear to me, died on this date, years ago. I never feel depressed about it. What's up with that?

963,"First off, let me say I am new to Reddit and have no idea how this works - apologizing in advance for noob mistakes. :) 

I am here because my husband and I need advice and we don’t really have many people to ask because well, we don’t know a lot of career pilots. My husband currently works as an aviation mechanic but its always been his dream to be a pilot. Last year, he finally decided to pursue it. He’s currently in school getting his Bachelors in Aeronautical Science and he is just about to do his solo for his PPL. 

Anywho, we now have a baby on the way (our first) and while I’ve done nothing but encourage him to continue pursuing this, he’s getting worried about balancing new pilot hours and a home life. He understands that hours will be rough starting out and he’s concerned that it will be too rough for too long and he won’t be there enough for our kid. He worries he will regret being “selfish” in pursuing this because he knows missing holidays and kiddo events is basically guaranteed. 

So I thought I may reach out and see if any pilot dads (or wives of pilots or kids of pilots) have any advice or insight to share? What’s it really like out there? How do you balance things? Do you feel absent in your kids lives? do you have a sense of guilt or regret? Or is everything fine? 

And if there’s any kids of pilots on here... what was it like growing up? Did you resent your dad/mom for being gone a lot or did you really not care cuz dad/mom has a super cool job?",18Nov2020,1

Ive had a traumatic past and dealt with a lot growing up, so I had my fair share of trust issues first meeting him. But lol, he literally changed my life for the better. He made me start to care for and love myself and I even started therapy because I wanted to be a better person for him. It feels like my life started the day I met him and now that we’re not together I don’t know what to do. Most of my friends kind of treat me like I’m being stupid because I still cared for him even after he had cheated on me and he said he wishes I wouldn’t transition and that I would be a girl. I’m sure he doesn’t love me on the same level that I loved him but I do know he at least cared for me and I just miss him so much. :(",18Nov2020,1
967,"M/26 My daughter is 6 years old and I haven't once felt anything but resentment for her, This has led to me and her mother splitting up something I desperately didn't want to happen, Me and her mother got together when we were 18 &amp; 19. We were madly in love and had been up until recently, We hadn't been together a long time maybe 3 - 5 months before she fell pregnant. Soon as the news game my partner was so happy, I was the complete opposite I hated the idea of it. I wanted her to get an abortion, she didn't even speak or listen to me about the idea and was set ""We're having this baby"" I knew at the end of the day it was her body and her discussion, I loved her so much that I thought ""sure we can make this work"" Soon as my daughter was born we moved out, I was working full time to pay for our flat and bills but I struggled to get us by. Things gotta worse as time went on started paying bills late and having them build upon us, I couldn't help but think every time I looked at my daughter ""If you weren't here we wouldn't be in this mess"" I know that is a horrible thing to say and I did my best to be in her eyes a good father. At the back of my mind, it was always there and it never let me open up and actually feel like she was anything other than a job to me, doing things with her wasn't out of enjoyment but was a task to be done and ticked off. I knew I couldn't take out the anger and resentment on her as she is just a child and didn't ask for this so my partner became my target. I started to hurt her in stupid ways, Shutting her out of my feelings and my thoughts, being disinterested in what she was interested in. Complaining about the state of our place. (I never have laid a finger on her just for clarity) We were also best friends though we had sacrificed going out and having our own lives to be together, We had always spent every night together, happy or not. We had built up common interests and hobbies together, So the more I started to shut her out the more I knew it hurt her. This circle went on for 6 years, by this point I had got myself into a depressed suicidal state that's when I moved out, I and my partner still stayed together but I told her I needed to work on myself otherwise I was going to be no good to anyone. I felt I needed to get out of being around them to start processing and dealing with my problems. That never worked out and now we're no longer together... It was me coming back before I thought I was ready or my Daughter and she chooses my Daughter and to end things between us. 

&amp;#x200B;

I 100% understand none of this was my daughter's fault or really anyone else other than myself. I have chosen to leave out a lot of details as I'm not here to make people feel sorry for me or to shit talk my ex who was abusive to me at times. I still have a  huge resentment towards her (Daughter), Now even more so as I did wanna spend the rest of my life with my ex and I believe she did as well. even if we were toxic at points together there were very good times and we really did do everything together. I am paying for her (Daughter) but have not seen her since her birthday last month, I'm struggling to even think about seeing her, I do want to be a good dad for her though I don't want to punish her life cause of how I feel. I want to love her to death no matter what happens, I wanna be the best dad I can be for her. It hurts me that I can not feel any positive emotion towards her 

I'm very lost at what to do and just am looking for any advice.

Also, I'm fully aware that I'm no saint and have come to complete terms with some of my own behavior. I've never set out to hurt anybody in my life and have always done my best to be good to people, Which makes me feel appalled at what type of person I have become.

968,"I want to thank everyone upfront for taking the time out of their days to read my struggle and potentially offer advice. Bear with me as I explain the origins of our relationship and where we are at now, as they are relevant to the questions I have as a whole. 

My girlfriend and I met at Job Corps, for those unfamiliar with it, it is a program in the USA for ""at risk"" youth to get free education and learn a trade, where you will successfully start working upon graduation. Its a very strict and professional environment. Needless to say, its not a very forgiving environment for a relationship. We knew this, but what was supposed to be a one time ""casual encounter"" (she might as well have been a stranger at the time) turned into something more. Something real. We ended up falling in love. This posed a huge problem as we lived on opposite sides of the country, and were months away from graduation. Neither one of us thought a long distance relationship would work, so we decided to get an apartment together after only months of dating. In our eyes that was the only option. The key takeaways from this paragraph is that 

1. We never had that ""new relationship"" phase where you take your time and learn more about the other person, go out for dates, and just enjoy them being them. 

2. Thrown straight into the fire. Both started brand new  careers, and got an apt together after only months together, which was both of ours first time living on our own.

3. We were supposed to be focused on ourselves, and both of us gave up great opportunities to be together. (we both graduated together, but we qualified for additional training which would have split us up, and we refused) Our perceived plan for ourselves was flipped upside down by an unsuspecting romance. 


Fast forward a little bit. We are living together, and its going surprisingly fantastic. Our chemistry is still spot on. We had some of the usual problems people have when they move in with their significant other for the first time, but we handled them with great respect for each other and worked things out smoothly. But being new to the adulting world, the stress of bills, our jobs, being away from friends and family, not being able to explore our relationship and stuff like that just ate us up. We both became depressed and focused more on our finances than our romance. She ended up having a change of heart, and quit her ""dream job"" shortly afterwards and started working at a grocery store. She needed her time and a low stress job. Understandable. Meanwhile, my job is also very demanding, and I would work an average of 14 hours a day, every day, alternating between graveyard and day shift WEEKLY. This was detrimental to my health. I never got sleep, adopted a very unhealthy diet, never got to be there to support my woman when she needed me most, and I just lost all my hobbies and everything that made me who I am. I was very vocal about this to my employers who did nothing. I am a high functioning depressed, I don't know how to stop working, i don't know how to put off all my responsibilities. I was hurting more than I ever have, but I lived in my head and stayed with the job, hoping they actually meant things would get better. They didn't. I eventually quit after almost TWO YEARS of this, but it was too late, the damage was done. We got used to not seeing each other, we got used to dealing with things by ourselves. We got used to the empty feeling.

 She decided that becoming a full time student on top of getting a jon was something that she could juggle along with her mental health and our declining relationship. I tried to plead with her, but ultimately she made up her mind and I had to be supportive of that. As you guessed, that made the situation even more stressful than it was before, and our relationship was put on the backburner, this time by choice. It hurt my feelings so I decided to go back to my old job under the agreement I'd have a set schedule and two days off a week. She didn't have the time for me anyway and I made pretty damn good money. Only this time it was strictly graveyard, no days or switching back and forth. We grew more and more distant. Every time we talk its a bombardment of new information from both of us that we never had the time to discuss, and when we did it was on the opposite end of the other persons schedule. We drowned in each other's problems.

Then the coronavirus hits. I took this super seriously at first, quit my job again so that I could work from home doing something else, and while this meant more time at home, it meant more depression in general as we couldn't go do anything even if we wanted, and school from home was rough on her. At least I got to see her though right? Well it turns out when your relationship has been filled with nothing but stress from the very beginning, you start to lash out even when undeserved. We were watching a cute video which gave her baby fever, and she said ""I need to stop watching this before i end up with something I don't want"", and I said ""what if I want kids eventually"" and she said ""well you're with the wrong person if thats what you want"" and the way she said it offended me and I blew up. I knew it was a joke but with all the problems we were working on I thought it was in bad taste, and said the words I regret more than anything in my life ""you know what? Maybe I am with the wrong person"". 

Boom. There you have it. Now we are here. A simple joke, and me lashing out when I shouldn't have, saying something i didn't mean, ruined our 4 year relationship. 
We went from ride or dies, going through hell together, working towards that light at the end of the tunnel, to completely over with. In her eyes, we had a ""mutual"" breakup because I wanted kids and she didn't. Nothing could be further from the truth and she knows that. But she's clinging on to it, maybe to help her cope with the whole thing. But I know the real reasons, I know that we haven't had a single break in our entire relationship, I know that we lost our romance a long time ago, I know that we were at a standstill. But we have not talked about any of the real reasons. We didn't try and work it out, we didn't take a break and come back stronger, no we had that one argument and have cut all contact since. The only problem, we still live together! We have 6 months left on our current lease, and are still roommates, this poses a huge problem considering she doesn't talk to me, needs her space, and there's constantly a giant elephant in the room which was our relationship, and all the problems we have failed to take responsibility of, and work out. We don't even talk about bills and important roommate stuff.Both of us are still very much in love, and this whole thing is being treated like a forbidden fruit that we both want but can't have for some undefined imaginary reason. We don't want to break up, we both love each other still,  and we are walking around like this whole reason for a breakup isn't a lie. I knew she didn't want kids from the beginning, she knew I didn't care and would love to enjoy life with her anyway. But here we are, and I just don't understand how to salvage this. The way she is acting has completely shattered my heart, because I know what the real issues are deep down, but she doesn't want to confront them or talk about them. 

She has always been reserved, quiet, and not really quick to talk about whats on her mind. I had to spend a long time breaking down those walls but they re appeared because we never had time for each other and grew distant. I want her to be herself again, and me myself. 

I have said some mean and hateful things during this time, all of which didn't help and I wish I could take back. But she is being just as mean and hateful with her actions. Or inaction, depending. She's now out and about with friends or hook ups or whatever it is (none of my business apparently) a few times a week until 3am  (I've never seen her stay up past midnight throughout our entire relationship) she's all of a sudden a stoner. (I had to quit smoking weed because she didn't like it and I wanted to make her happy), she's completely ignoring me and making me feel like a shitbag that never mattered. And just overall acting weird. Here I am, a work oriented person with zero friends and no family to turn to, left to my own devices. And I don't know if she is intentionally trying to make me feel like this, as payback for something I did but, or if she knows and doesn't know what to do, or doesn't care. But I know women tend to be a little harsher in breakups without realizing it, and when I stop letting my emotions jump to conclusions, I realize the love is still there in both of us, but she has some sort of imaginary standard for breakups which isn't in line with her true beliefs, and I don't know how to get her past that without being a dick, and ruining the small spark left inside of us. 

I guess my main questions would have to be these.

1. How can I get her back? 

2. If I get her back, how can I avoid the same mistakes and make sure it really works out this time?

3. Do I just move out ASAP and give her time and space to think? And hope she comes around one day? Or stay and keep pushing? Or stay and continue the no contact? See where it goes?

4. How can I get her to talk about these things? 

5. What can I do to show her that I am willing to work things out, or take a break and see of our relationship works in the future, given she doesn't want contact with me?

6. Is she not in love with me and is clinging on to the excuse as to not hurt my feelings? Should I just move on no matter how much I think it'll be impossible. 

I think she's the one guys, and I'm not the type to let everything good pass me by and not do anything about it, but she is that type. Even if she feels the same way.

Please do ask for clarification or any questions, as this is a long post and may have left some stuff out. Very complicated situation. I just want us both to be okay. And I want it to work out, because I've experienced our love when it wasn't beaten down by life's struggles, and  we were so good together that I feel like everything else out there is just going to be garbage. Years of not prioritizing our relationship is what got us here, not lack of love.

972,"\*throwaway account bc I don't want this person to find me\*

I'm a senior in college and working on a final design project which spans 2 semesters with 5 other people.  There are multiple group assignments that require lots of research, but one of the first assignments was an individual research paper about one or two specific topics, which will eventually relate back to our topic/system as a whole.

I was working on one of the group papers, which is due in a couple of weeks, and as I was putting everybody's individual research into the main paper, I realized (through complete coincidence) that one of my teammates plagiarized almost their entire paper (like 4 pages of text, you could literally copy/past whole paragraphs into google and get word-for-word results).  I told the rest of the group and they were pretty upset, but we decided to confront the person about it and this person basically played dumb and tried to say they didn't know any better.  I expressed how troubling this was to me and the rest of our group, because we were planning on using all of that research in our group paper, and now we can't.  Instead, they agreed to make up the research by the end of the week (2-3 days) but I still don't trust them and I feel so sick about the whole situation.  This person was completely fine with us just taking the hit as a team if that research had been put into the group paper and turned in.

That being said, I don't believe them one bit.  You don't get this far in college and not understand that directly copy and pasting large paragraphs of text from other articles and deliberately not citing it is plagiarism.  They even admitted this during the conversation and immediately tried to take it back when the rest of us pointed out that that was exactly what happened.

I've talked to a couple friends and family to try to get advice on what to do and at this point they're all saying I should turn them in to my advisor, who will then report the incident to the office of student conduct.  My problem is, they might not get removed from our team, which means we would be stuck working together for another six months, and they would definitely know it was me who reported them, which would make things awkward and my peer review score would tank (and as a result, my grade).

I can't talk to any of my school advisors because they are mandatory reporters.  I still don't know how this person got a grade for this paper because I know our school has TurnItIn built into our Canvas submissions.  It should have been flagged as suspicious, but I'm guessing our main professor just didn't feel like checking 400+ student's reports, so he ignored it.

I feel obligated to tell my project advisor because this is negatively affecting multiple areas of my life as well as our overall team dynamic and I don't see any other way around effectively fixing it, but I also don't want to make things worse and have the rest of my group think I'm cold-hearted and a snitch.

Any advice?

TLDR: Teammate plagiarized individual essay, info would have gone into group essay but I caught it before it could.  They gave a story and kinda seems like they're trying to fix it, but I don't believe them.  I still think I should report it, however I have fear of reprisal from that teammate and possibly the rest of the team.",18Nov2020,1
973,"Hi folks, any advice is appreciated; hearing from anyone who's been in a similar situation would be especially comforting right now. I moved rather impulsively cross-country after a difficult job situation left me angry and bitter towards the city I was in. I was in a very codependent and unhealthy relationship at the time, which only added fuel to the fire. Despite everyone who had best interests at heart asking me to take time and reconsider, I packed up and left for a new city on the opposite coast in the span of about a month. In addition to the move, which was expensive enough, I had to spend around $9,000 just to receive a license to work in-state. Two years in, after the end of that relationship I'm finally taking stock of what I want in life, and it just isn't here. In addition to missing my family, I don't really feel any opportunity for upward mobility here career-wise, and haven't had any luck making friends in two entire years. Over the summer, I made a plan stating that I'd start to travel more often (once it's safe) and find a new place that's a better fit within the next five years, but now I'm questioning wether I can even tough it out that long. On the other hand, walking away from the $9,000 licensing costs less than five years in feels like a crushing failure, and I'd be leaving my workplace at a very bad time, what with the pandemic and all.

I'll try to explain it all in one post. 

My friend believes he is controlled by ""entities"" that make him do things against his will. When he changes ""entities"" he says he gets really jittery and acts strange physically and he will pretend to be a character. (Usually animals)

He does this multiple times a day and some days he will just flat out block me for literally no reason. His ""entities"" usually say that they're gonna make him kill himself but eh never does that.

I have a few theories:

He has a Personality Disorder and he does this to try and manipulate me into becoming desperate for him to unblock me.

He actually thinks he's a different person, possible mild Schizophrenia.

He thinks I have the entities too, I used to believe in them but I have since realized that i have something else that is actually real going on with me and I'm trying to get professional help. Every time I bring this up to him he says I'm a ""bad entity"" who ""lies and manipulates"".

And how to take things not too heartily, as example, I really am one of these people who think a whole night long about something someone told on the internet.
Thanks a lot",18Nov2020,5
983," hello everyone. i feel like on Reddit i can find a better support system than in my own life so here i go. has anyone ever dealt with a parent who switches up so fast and is unpredictable? my dad is exactly like that. he can be all nice one minute and angry screaming the next. when my sister went to her therapist and told her about this the therapist said he probably has undiagnosed mental illness or trauma, which i can see. he gets angry over stuff that doesn't make sense and i just don't understand why. my sister and he are always snapping at one another because the tale that the firstborn daughter is exactly like their dad is very true. they are the same person, but my sister knows how to handle herself and be appropriate and not a maniac. for example, today my sister tripped and fell on the ground in our bedroom. it made a loud boom and my dad screamed at her very aggressively (he has levels, and I haven't heard this level in a while but she has). she gave him attitude back because again the same person, and they just started fighting. i haven't seen them fight in front of me since July but I know they do get into very nasty and mean fights when they are alone. he screamed at me in a very mean tone too as he went down the stairs. one fight my dad completed went off on her and said rude and insulting shit and she begged for him to stop but he didn't. its really hard to call him toxic and manipulative because he has such a sweet, nice, all cuddly side to him. but he has levels and layers that make me sick. he's such an asshole sometimes. my sister shouldn't be coming home crying from work bc of our dad. mind you, my sister (half-sister actually, her mom passed away) just moved into our house. our family dynamic is crooked and messed up. my mom is controlling, and I constantly fight back and I'm mean sometimes but they know it's just because I can't stand them e treating me like a maid and servant. i hate that they make me watch over my adult siblings when I have school to worry about. i know that I'm really mature and act like an adult but I'm not one and they don't see that. they just don't care and see nothing wrong with their actions and it pisses me off. i cant d o this anymore it's so upsetting to sit here and experience my dad criticizing and being a dick to everyone when they do something he doesn't like and when my mom is a psycho about me doing shit. my house feels like jail and I hate it.",18Nov2020,1
984,"Alright so I’m 20 years old &amp; don’t know how to drive. Parents only “taught” me in an empty parking lot then pretty much threw me onto a highway thinking that was sufficient.

I’ve been in a couple accidents &amp; I think I just had bad luck.. Anyway, I’m really getting tired of being the butt of the joke.

986,"I am 27m and I haven't done anything since high school. No accomplishments, no goals, no where to go. I feel like I am just going through the motions. I have a job, and it pays well, but I am not happy about it. I feel like I put all my effort into the first four hours of work, and then have nothing left to do. I try to waste time or ask my boss if there is anything else I can do, but it usually just ends up taking away from other people's hours.

Honestly, I want something other than entry level jobs now, something that actually means something. All of my interests aren't really good for making money, music, acting, etc. I really just want to feel like I am worth something other than walking around feeling like I accomplish nothing.

Should I go to college for something that I am not sure I am even interested in? Even if I do, I'll be behind. I have no marketable skills either, I am not good with tools or machines or computers. I feel hopeless and lost. I don't want to enter college and not have a goal with it, but I don't want to commit to anything without knowing I can commit to that field. The more I bounce back and forth with this, the more time I waste. What the hell do I do?",18Nov2020,2
987,"When I was 18 I became friends with a guy who would hang out at a coffee shop I was a barista at. We became best friends fast. I had a boyfriend at the time, and I would give him pickup advice or help him build online dating profiles etc... I know looking back that I was already delusionally trusting, but I can't change that now.

About a year into the friendship he wrote a song about me, pretty cringy, and sent it to me. I confronted him and told him that I loved my boyfriend. I told him I cared about him, and I wasn't going to be with him, so I didn't think it was fair for us to stay friends. After that he harrassed me a bit about it and eventually gave up.

Six months after that my partner and I split, and he got back in contact with me. It's been a nightmare ever since.

We tried to get together twice. We made good friends and thought that it would translate into a romantic relationship. But he would do things like on nights I'd tell him I was going out with my friends, bomb me with 150+ texts about how he was going to OD on sleeping pills and it was my fault, or message my ex and ask him if I was with him, even though he knew we had no contact. Altogether, the two times we tried combined amount to about three months.

It was already scary, he'd text me too much and talk about how he was lost without me, but it all came to a head when he shared a Reddit post with me via what I guess was an alternate username, and when I went to his posts I found some disgusting stuff. Dating back the two years we'd known each other, he posted about how the fact I was sexually assaulted turned him on, that I was cheating on him to make him feel bad about his weight (?), if he could put a GPS tracker on my car legally, and finally that he had touched me in my sleep, asking if that crossed a legal line.

I sent him a text saying I never wanted to hear from him again. He shortly showed up at my house at midnight, rang the doorbell, walked through my backyard and tried to get in the back, and waited. I called the police and they took his information and issued a warning.

I'm 23 now. It's been a year and a half since the last time I spoke to him and told him I would never talk to him again and I haven't. He hasn't stopped harassing me. I've blocked his numbers, but I can still view and listen to voicemails from blocked numbers and he left one two weeks ago. I had to delete or private all of my social media, set my phone to block all numbers not added to a whitelist, set up security cameras on my front and back door, and warn all of my friends because he's inevitably sent each of them anonymous messages. He still drives by my house four to five times every week, really slowly.

***TLDR: I've been being stalked by someone who exhibits really extreme behavioral issues for a year and a half.***

I feel dumb for being so terrified. He scares me so much. What can I do to get my sense of security back?

***EDIT: A lot of you guys are suggesting guns or dogs - those aren’t options for me as I’m living with my parents at the moment (unemployed due to COVID). Also I have spoken to my local police, they’ve said if there’s no direct threat and he hasn’t set foot on my property again - they can’t do anything.",18Nov2020,49
988,"I have a friend I've known for a bit now. Recently however they would be quite rude when drinking and stuff and say a bunch of things that I didn't care fkr the friendship, I don't take enough time and that I come across really rude sometimes. They left a few videos over snapchat last time basically saying they always stick up for me all the time while others talk shit and stuff about me and yada yada.

This has happened about 6 times within the past 3 months? But we usually sort it out the next day. They always come and apologise and admit they're wrong and that they feel bad and stuff.

So what do I do? They always do come back and say sorry. They said themselves they think it's kind of a toxic situation but I'm not sure what to do. End it? Keep it going? Things usually go back to normal after we apologise and it's great so I don't know.",18Nov2020,7
989,"So I applied to a job last week and I got an email three days ago from the manager telling me she would love to schedule a phone interview with me so I replied with the date and time that works best for me but she never replied back.

I didn't put in my phone number in my email since I assumed that she already have my data from my application, but then again if she doesn't have my number wouldn't she reply to my email asking for my number? 

Does anyone have any idea on what I should do? Should I try and email her again? What should I say lol",18Nov2020,1
990,"My dad just retired and wants to become a boat vlogger. I took my GoPro with us today when we went to move his boat to it's new harbour. I shot a lot of cool clips and B-roll footage and my dad was super excited to see the final video. I edited it for about 4 hours, did some voice over work, and went to render it.

I went to grab a USB to put the vlog on and decided to format it as it was previously in use as a bootable USB for an operating system. To my horror I accidentally formatted my SD card that had all my footage on it, and the rendering process was three minutes away from being completed.

I managed to get the files back, but they're all corrupted mp4 files. I am at a loss and am banned at r/techsupport so I decided to try here.

My old man was so excited to see the result and I worked so hard on it, my heart is absolutely shattered. Does anyone have an idea how I can fix corrupted MP4's?",18Nov2020,1
991,"My highschool best friend and I recently graduated and are currently in our first year of college. Or rather, he is, I’m taking a year off to work and save up money. And because of Corona, he actually only has 2 classes that he needs to go too, so it seems to me that he has a lot of free time. 

Despite this, my friend has denied all attempts to meet in person, or often even talk on the phone. Originally he said that it was because his younger brother was immune compromised, but since then his brother has gone to classes in person anyway, so I’m confused about his argument. Either way though, I get that he has to be safe, so that isn’t the main issue. 

What’s weird is that whenever I try to invite him to talk to me or play video games with me and our other friends (video games I *know* he likes) he says he’s been busy or gives some other excuse. 

Frankly, I don’t understand what he could be busy doing. He has two, two hour classes a week and other than that his plate is completely full. On my end I’m working 2 jobs, 40+ days a week, and taking care of my mother, but I still find time to make for my friends because that’s what friends *do*. They make time for eachother.

After months of prodding from me and another one of our friends, we finally managed to get him to join our Dungeons and Dragons campaign, something I know for a fact he’s wanted to play for years, and even this he seems to be completely reluctant to join in on. We’ve had to basically do all the work setting up his character for him, and he actually missed the first session.

I just don’t know what to do. This man is one of my best friends in the world and it honestly hurts so much that he’s been pulling away from me, and our larger group, to the extent that he has been. He’s going to a very high end school, so part of me wonders if he just isn’t interested in hanging out with “the nerds” anymore, but I don’t even know. I’m just confused. 

And I don’t know how to approach this subject with him because I don’t think he would really understand. I don’t want to just text him and be like “hey man why have you been so distant recently?” Because I think to him he HASNT been distant. I think he’ll defend himself by saying he joined our D&amp;D group, he’s still talking to me, ect, so he just won’t get how much he’s been pulling away since we graduated.

A lot of me is worrying if I did something to offend him. Did I push him in a direction he didn’t want to go? Did I insult him? Did he hear something that made him want to get new friends?

Any advice would be a lot of help. I’m having a really hard time coming to terms with all of this.",18Nov2020,5

994,"Hello All! So I've got quite an interesting situation here, I have a roommate who is also my friend, but it's quite clear he absolutely takes advantage of me. Let me start off by explaining our situation, so we live in a 2 bed 2 bath apt, we both split everything right down the middle, he has his own dog and I have mine, we haven't had any major issues and everything seems nearly perfect, my only issue is he often leaves his responsibilities on me almost daily. So we'll start off with the dogs, as I said, I have mine and he has is, I love both of them and have zero problems taking care of them, although it's become quite frustrating trying to get one on one training and personal time with my actual dog. Often he leaves him on me to and doesn't say anything, he will literally open my door and leave his dog in my room in the middle of the night when I'm sleeping and then he leaves. Which like I said, I don't mind for the most part, but it restricts me from handling my own responsibilities. Another thing is dishes, and just general cleaning, I usually do all the cleaning, even his laundry and just ask that he take out the trash, 99% of the time I end up doing all the cleaning and still taking out the trash. He doesn't seem to communicate anything he's doing either, and will often out of the blue make these random plans. I won't even know most of this until I literally call him and ask, or he calls me way later. I've had a situation where he left almost 2 entire days, left his dog with me (I should also mention he has a cat, but that doesn't really burden me at all), but didn't call me until almost 35 hours later and informed me he wouldn't be back until the following night. Call me crazy, but shouldn't you at-least inform your roommate, let alone ASK if thats okay with them (in regards to watching your dog)?

So basically what I'm asking is how can I put my foot down and make it clear this isn't okay? I'm even willing to continue to do everything I do for him, but I at least want to get that one on one time with my dog, and it often saddens me he gives his dog little to no attention. I wish I was able to relay this to him, but I already know he would take it the wrong way and see it as a personal attack. Anything considered ""advice"" to him he considers a personal attack for the most part, although even he knows those are not my intentions.",18Nov2020,1
995,"Hello, this isn't actually a throwaway account but I wanted to make a new account anyway so here we go.

&amp;#x200B;

I actually have a pretty good life, I study medicine, I have my hobbies, my social life could be better but it's fine... but I think it's about time that I admit I'm addicted to ONLINE video games.

I don't have a good PC or PlayStation so I can't play good games other than the likes of Valorant, League of Legends, CSGO etc. I can't seem to stop thinking about ""how to get better ranks"", playing better and I literally spend multiple hours nearly every day, as long as my schedule allows for it. I normally don't play in school time (I still do but much less). I can get my work done, my biggest interest is cinema since a few years and I watch about 20 movies every month in quarantine. But here's the problem: It got worse with the lockdown. The only reason I can get so much work done/have productive time is I have a lot of time since I'm home all day but I'm afraid when it gets better I will not be able to function as much.

I rage a lot, I get far too invested and I forget they're just video games. What's strange to me is that I learned to be so efficient with my work time that I can still find time to play, that's literally my main motivation. In lockdown I watched about 250 movies, I got my second foreign language to a good enough degree, I lost a little weight, I read considerably well... but you see, it could be a lot better.

When I look back at my post it feels like I don't even make sense anymore but here's where I ask advice: **I can't afford therapy, I don't even know if I need one because I study in another city where I won't have my PC anymore (I'll have a laptop) so that's kinda going to make things better but I don't know for certain when I'll move back. Do you have any advice for me?**",18Nov2020,3

Yeah so just to clarify, he’s gay and me and This other guy is not. We 3 are very good friends and have been thst since we met in High School. We graduated This summer. Our friend came out and officially told us when we graduated. We supported him a lot and thought it was brave of him to tell us like that, and told him nothing in our friendship Will change. We knew already so it wasn’t any Big surprise tbh. I told him that there was one thing that was very important, and that i’ve seen other who have come out do:

Make your sexuality to your actual personality. That was something we told him beforehand that we respect snd love you dearly, but please just be like you always have been and don’t make it something extreme. Like ofc he Can joke about stuff it’s not like it’s forbidden... just not alllll the time.

So lately, he have been really really... expressing himself weird. When he send me tik tok videos and memes lately, it’s either dumb weird, about drag queens or something about being gay. I didn’t Think about it to much until it was everyday. And he sent the stuff to my other mutual male friend as Well. We have talked about it and we both kinda like “wtf is going on”.

So Yesterday he sent me This tik tok that litterally Said “when you’re gay and you laugh at your straight male friends jokes cause you trynna smash” and a guy just saying “you’re sooo funnnyyyy...”, i Think you get it. It was weird. My other friend didn’t get the video. So i asked my gay friend oh you’re trynna smash [straight mutual friend]? ;) 

He only replied no you to me. Last time i Saw him in person, he also really wanted me to consider go to a gay bar with him and kiss a guy just because ‘you never know’ he Said. I litterally told him doesn’t the though of sticking your dick in a vagina give you the urge to puke all organs of your body out. He Said yeah. I Said i’m the same Way, but with the thought of making out with another guy.

He’s making my both my friend and i a bit uncomfortable... especially me. But idk if we Can tell him, it’s such a soft spot and he’ll hate himself if he knew how we honeslty felt. But it have been going on for a bit long time now so i’m also really just thinking that’s about it.
