0,"My son is 16 and on the taller side of things. Around 2 weeks before Christmas, I was doing laundry and I found a rather large dildo under my son's bed as well as some lubricant. The thing had to be at least 12 inches in length. At first, I thought it wasn't his because I could not imagine him having this much less using it. At the time I decided to put it back, and not address it.

5 days passed after this discovery, and It was around midnight when I was getting out of bed to get a snack. As I was going to the kitchen I heard weird noises coming from my son's room. I was half asleep so I wasn't thinking and quietly opened the door a small bit. I saw my son using the large dildo. After that, I just went back to bed. I started spying on him and peeking into his room. It seems he does this every 3 or 4 days. 

I don't know what to do or how to approach this situation. I am a bit concerned about his well-being because I don't even think he should be dealing with something of that size. Then again I don't even know how long he's had it, For all, I know he could have had it and been using it for years. I don't know if that means he's gay or not, if he is I'll be a supportive mother. I just Very confused and seriously need some advice.",30Dec2020,1

3,"I have periods of times (1-2 weeks) where I wake up after 5 hours of sleep and then find it impossible to go back to sleep. I sleep at 12 or 1 AM, wakeup around 5 or 6. Then I try to go to sleep for the next 3 or 4 hours but I end up staying awake with my eyes closed. I feel tired too, my eyes are stinging n sh\*t. Then I 'wake up' at 9 or 10. My eyes start getting heavier at like 4 PM. By the end of the night my eyes are stinging and whole process repeats. Any advice on any supplements to take or if i should see a doctor or something. I drink no coffee, maybe once a month, I dont drink, I dont smoke, I dont take drugs. Im reluctant to take supplements but its beginning to get annoying.",30Dec2020,1

We didn’t have penetrative sex and I came nowhere near her private area (half way on her belly) and it rested like a minute or a bit more as we laughed the moment out. Then she proceeded to clean it with toilet paper and gave it to me. I touched it for a split second to throw it away and then bam... can she get pregnant? It felt like a drop of almost nothing at most but I’m still worried. Thank you!",30Dec2020,1
5,She sounded so stress and turned off when talking to me. She said that she couldnt stand me and my presence and others anymore. This actually made me feel upset. How can i understand her feelings... this sounds like the verge of our relationship. Im worried... any help?,30Dec2020,1
7,"Now for the record I have nothing against non-binary people. I’m bisexual so I’m obviously fine with somebody being non-binary. 

I’m so sorry writing this if I sound like a bigot. 

My sister told me she’s non-binary. But she’s 12. 

Yes I understand there are kids who are LGBT and they’re young and I have no problem with it, but I don’t know if my sister understands what being non-binary is really about and she really truly identifies that way or if she doesn’t get it and is just saying it because she thinks it’s a new trend. 

I know i sound like a bigot saying it, but I only say this because she’s a middle schooler who loves social media and tiktok and she often gets caught up in current trends and forgets about them after a month. 

I still accept her since she’s my sister, it’s just I don’t know if she really is serious or shes a middle schooler confused about her identity. 

How do I talk to her about it?",30Dec2020,1
8,"I (F18) Have never been really great at comforting people who are dealing with great loss. I want to be there for friends and family desperately, but I feel like I never know what to do or say for them. My aunt, (F48) got diagnosed with terminal cancer last year. Needless to say, this was a tragic blow for my family, especially because we are all so close. I practically lived with my cousins during the summers. As we got older and went off to college, we lost some of that closeness, but when we get together for family occasions it's like we are kids again. For a while, my aunt was doing pretty okay. I was even feeling optimistic she would somehow be cured, she seemed so healthy. However, things took a serious turn for the worst this fall. She is extremely thin and lost her hair to chemo. She is very tired all the time and has had some health scares that placed her in the hospital briefly. It is scary for me to see her like this, but I can't even imagine what it's like for her children. She was recently placed into Palliative Care, and while it is not hospice, it seems like she is headed in that direction. My cousins and my uncle are completely devastated. We live three hours away from each other, and with COVID, it is almost impossible to get together. I can't help but think of the future when she passes. I am terrified for my family, and how her death will affect us all. I am even more afraid of how it will affect my cousins, especially the one who is only 16. It's been hard for me to comfort those who have lost grandparents, but what do I say, or do for someone who is going to lose their mom? And when she passes, what can I do or say for them then?",30Dec2020,1
9,"This literally happened 2 hours ago. He has been ghosting me for 3 days. I asked another friend who lived in his dorm to check in on him,  and he told me they stayed up late together, and my friend was fine. I knew he has been going through a lot of shit especially these last months and Corona only made it worse so I went to his house (it was 9 pm and we have curfew at 10 pm here). I knocked for 15 minutes till he opened. He was sleeping, went back to sleep and I sat there in the darkness till he woke up 10 minutes later and asked me to not talk and just leave. I wrote on a note that I'm inviting him to spend the new year with me and my gf and another friend of ours and left. He called me 3 minutes later and asked me to come back. I did. I sat there silently and he told me he decided to end his life. That he's made his peace with it. That he knows it's selfish and realizes the repercussions and meaning but he just wants to rest. He says he is still thinking about how to do it but won't tell me how or when. He wants it done in a way that will be easy on whoever finds him afterwards. He says that the more people try to help and talk him out of it the more he wants to do it and do it faster. He spoke so calmly and rationally, although I know the decision itself is irrational. He says it isn't a decision he made on a whim, it isn't because of new or overwhelming pain. He says he wants this and it's his choice. Although I know of  things that happened recently that broke his heart and mind and is pushing him over the edge though I don't know the details, a  breakup of a 7 year relationship was involved but is not the sole reason, just more coal in the fire. He tried to go to a psychiatrist 2 months ago and she gave him an appointment for January 6th 2021.. I don't know how to help him or what to say because I'm going through my own battles and I found myself agreeing with alot of what he said. We are both foreign students in Germany and don't have our families with us. We're the kind of people who feel like there is no purpose in life. He says he made this choice because he wants to rest and that just existing is a pain. He says it will make him happy and I know he's not the kind of person who would joke or lie about this sort of thing. I am still with him and decided I will not go home tonight, I used the curfew as an excuse and he bought it but obviously I don't want to leave him alone. He cooked and ate and is playing a video game and just seems fine, normal. His decision is made and he didn't make it lightly. I don't have the ability to talk him out of it. I share his feelings that life and existence is painful, but even though I get my own demons telling me to end it all, I'm still able to push through, not for myself but for the people who love me and will be hurt by my actions. I see that giving them my pain to rest myself is selfish, but he sees it's also selfish for us to ask him to live when he does not want to, for us to be happy that he's alive and with us while he's miserable being alive. I tried to tell him to wait at least for the appointment with the psychiatrist. He says ""we'll see"" but his eyes and body language said no.. I am considering calling the police or the hospital but as I said we're two foreigners in a small town and with everything going on I don't know how much attention they'd pay us. I will probably call them anyway tomorrow morning after I leave him, if I leave him. He'll probably hate me for it and I really doubt they can help him anyway but I don't know if I have any other choice. I'd rather he hate me than lose him even if I understand him and his wish to just go, to disappear. I literally have my friend's  life in my hands while I am barely dangling on the edge myself. I am.. Overwhelmed and unsure what I should do.",30Dec2020,1
10,"i’ve always had rail straight hair, and it’s always been kinda thick too. but recently it’s been being quite curly and i’m not sure how to handle it. my mom has sorta wavy hair and isn’t entirely sure how to help me either and my friends all have straight hair too. 

(i am a white girl btw) i tried brushing it like normal but it just poofs up and breaks my hair off. if anyone knows of any specific way to brush it or anything it would be really helpful. i tried looking it up but i could only find how to style it, but not take care of it. should i use different shampoo/conditioner on it too? any help would be greatly appreciated 

i also cut it to my shoulders recently to help control it, but now i kinda look like one of those troll things from the early 2000s 

really any advice about curly hair in general will help me a lot! thank you",30Dec2020,1
11,"So I’ve been homeschooled my whole life, very poorly homeschooled. So I’m not anywhere near college level  and barely high school level in some topics. I managed to get my GED at least. 

I decided to apply to college because I’m desperately trying to get out of my mom’s house due to a toxic situation. I have almost no job experience so I thought maybe a degree could help me out a bit. 

I have horrible anxiety and depression and I’m also ADHD so I’m terrified thats gonna get in the way a lot. I’m not mentally stable at all right now so I’m not sure why I thought applying to college would even be a good idea. I also don’t have the skill to motivate myself to do anything I don’t want to do so I can see myself not doing a lot of my homework. I can also see myself having to do a presentation or something and just completely skipping the class in an effort to avoid it even if it costs me my grade.

I start really soon but I was thinking I should just drop out due to mental health reasons before I actually have to owe any money because I don’t even have a job due to my mental health so there’s no way I can afford to pay back the grant I was given.

I might just be overthinking everything but I feel like I made a terrible mistake applying to college right now.",30Dec2020,1

14,"Summer of 2019 my mother directed my dad to cut several patches of hair off my head for a “drug test.” It was against my will, and it was done in a way that would make them obvious to a hairstylist doing a cut and highlights. Winter/spring after the incident, I went to get my hair cut and the stylist said “you’re missing pieces all over your head, what happened?” and I just sat in silence. Thankfully she moved on immediately, but Ive avoided all salons since. I gave myself a haircut and bangs 🙄 I like how they look but I know that they’re ultimately uneven and I need help styling them. But I don’t want to go through the awkward situation of saying “mind your own business” given I can’t think of any alternative situation to explain them.

((( non essential follow up: my parents never sent the hair in to be tested after we had a counseling session that resolved my parents ‘concerns.’ I think that shows the true intention behind the haircut, but I’m choosing to let it go in favor of preserving family ties. It’s in the past now, hopefully I’ll forget about it. )))",30Dec2020,1

17,"Hello, I have a friend from Highschool we'll call L. Her parents are extremely controlling and watch almost their every move. (So controlling that even when they were allowed a phone they could not have the name of a boy in their contact list or else they would get all their electronics / internet access revoked.) since we graduated Highschool their parents seem to have gotten worse and they are near impossible to contact. A mutual friend said the last time they were able to reach them was in April. near the beginning of the pandemic and the last time I was able to contact them was when I had run in to them on community college campus before campus got shut down. We have their address but I am wondering if anyone has any advice on how we can get in touch with them to see if they need help to get out without risking making their situation any worse. We are worried about their parents possibly forcing them into an arranged marriage and so do not want to put them at any additional risk but would like to find a way to help them.

20,"Would it be a jerk move if I get a job without telling my parents? (I mean, of course I'll tell them, but only when after getting it.)

They are very supportive, I love them very much and am incredibly grateful for everything thay've done for me. However, I'm almost 21 and live 4,000 km away now, and seek for some freedom.

They pay for my expenses while I study in college (education is free). They freak out when I mention a job, because apparently working weekends gives you an automatic F in all courses? I was never allowed to work during school either. Our college savings are enough for my 3.5 years of stuties and they know it, but they are incredibly worried and keep talking about how they need to save more for me. I told them many times that they've done more than enough, I am an adult now and will eventually work and support myself like most adults do. Doesn't seem to work.

I'm also being treated kinda like a child, they call me and advise what I should eat/wear/do in my spare time/who to hang out with/when to come home...

I just feel kinda like a burden, they've done so much already! I feel like if I get a job and maintain my grades I will prove that I am a capable adult and they don't need to worry for me. Also, as much as I value their help, after all, it's my life and my decisions, and I am totally capable of making them on my own. 

Do you think it would be the right thing to do? From experience, telling upfront will only cause another argument... I don't want to seem ungrateful.

22,"Hi guys, I've (21M) always been a smart kid, so I blasted thru middle school without giving it any effort, playing videogames and jerking off all day.

But then I went to uni and had to change my studying habbits, like start spending daily time on school work and what not. I never loved studying and did everything last moment, so my discipline was non existent. And I did not even know how to study because before it was enough to open the book, read a few chapters and do a few excercises to get me ready for the exam.

So I started working on my discipline, hoping I will start enjoying school more. I was still not liking it, but I thought thst I'm just an uninterested lazy fuck who used to abuse his kinda smart brain and get away with shit he probably shouldn't have gotten away with.

But recently smth happened in my life, which made me feel like I got over gaming and instead started working out and bought myself a guitar.

Now the problem is that since the minute I got my guitar I have been spending every second of my spare time learning it. I've been soaking every single bit of info I can get about it, including music theory and what not which I'm absolutely inlove with. I can spend hours learning and practicing new shit, with hours literally flying by without me noticing it, and even when I put it down, it's all that's been in my head.

And yet, after all this effort I'm able to easily pour into my guitar, I can't even make myself concentrate on school for even 30 minutes without getting distracted or bored and just thinking about school gives me unpleasant feeling.

Am I just a lazy fuck who only wants to do what he wants in his life, or should I get concerned that my study is giving me so little pleasure? I'm studying to become a building engineer btw. I'm ok at maths, and the only subject I kinda like is Architecture. The rest I could literally give 0 fucks about.",30Dec2020,1
23,"the title says it all. i've always been very close with my band, we came from the same school and also like to hang out when we're not practicing. not long ago, we had another person join who is friends with our pianist. recently i've realised that i caught feelings for them.

i'm not sure how they feel, but i feel like it isn't important in this story. i told a few of my friends who don't know my band members, and then also a band member cause i just wanted someone to talk about it. i feel like they did not react well at all, they thought i was using them to get close to my crush, which is not true. and they also told me that dating within the band is totally out of the question, since it can interrupt our workflow and relationships.

i agree with what they said, but it still hurt. i texted a friend of mine to vent, but then they made it worse, by confronting the person in my band, and making it seem like i was mad at them for saying that. not true, and not cool.

of course i freaked out and called my bandmate and explained to them that i would never use them like that and apologised for my friend. we talked it out, and we're cool, but i still feel awful and don't know how to properly deal with my guilt. i feel like things are so awkward between us because of it ://

and i just don't know how to deal with my feelings. part of me takes our music and friendship very seriously and doesnt want to do anything that can disrupt that. the other part of me wants to say ""screw it all!"" and properly pursue that person. i did not choose to start crushing on them so hard and i want a chance to be happy with them. having actual feelings for someone is super rare for me, i dont wanna lose this chance.

27,"Hello, I'm a student (20F) who lives far away from her parents for 5/12 months of the year. The other 7 I rely heavily on my parents (I'm an only child, who is learning to drive in a remote area so I rely on them to get around) I'm unemployed due to covid and unable to see my friends because I'm sheilding because my grandad has cancer.

Now, I want to preface this by saying I love my parents - they've had difficult lives and the life they have given me is a privileged one. I have attended private school, my parents buy me expensive gifts and have taken me on trips (my father's love language is absolutely gift giving). The only problem is that all of this is thrown back in my face every time we argue. 

The good times with my parents are great, really really great but as I have grown older I have obviously experienced changes e.g sat exams, formed my own opinions, tried to navigate myself etc etc and this has made me go against my father's view of me which leads to massive blow out arguments. The first was my dad wanting me to do a science based subject even though arts is my forté - we settled on psychology (which I love !!) The second was my dad not wanting me to come out of uni with debt so I relied heavily on him for first year (which I'm grateful for) however that meant that whenever I went against him or arfued with him he would throw it back in my face:

""You don't get to have an opinion because you've never had to face anything in your life.""
""You know nothing, absolutely nothing, you don't have an opinion.""
""Youre so ungrateful I pay for EVERYTHING!""

He would never withdraw the funds he gives me (which I'm proud to say get less and less every year but his words really hurt me and the more I spend time away from home the more I feel i deserve from him and the less he thinks I deserve. 
His newest thing now that I'm back from the Christmas holidays is just shouting ""shut up"" ""you're so gobby"" ""you know nothing"" at me over and over again until I stop talking

Now you may be wondering, what my mother does in all this (as she is my preferred parent and I would say that I am extremely close to her) well, she either sits there hoping that I don't anger my dad to the point where I cause another 5 day long argument, or she chimes with the same thing dad does trying to get me to stop before it escalates in the best way she knows how because she knows I will give up. Then she pretends like nothing has happened.

I guess what I am asking is how do I slowly inch them out of my lives - not completely because I DO love them an awful lot but I need to not rely on them at all so that I don't get treated this way anymore.

This will be difficult because my dad wants to pay for everything - and he will kick up a fuss if he doesn't (this is how he shows his love) and I do understand that.

Also my dad and mum are not the type to take criticism in the slightest, so no chats or explaining will work as it will just be greeted with ""your oversensitive"" or worse ""pathetic"" so really I need to do this completely independent from them and incognito so that one day I can turn around and think to myself that I don't need them anymore, whilst still maintaining the good times relationship.

Any advice or similar experiences would help :)

Thanks for reading all that, and thanks in advance for your help.

I’m not sure if the details, but I do know that for the first few months of our relationship he was, in his own words, “expecting me to cheat on him.”

With me, he has been fine, not trying to control me or being overly suspicious. He has never asked to see my phone or know where I am, but there have been two things that make him feel insecure. One was me making dirty jokes with our mutual guy friend, mainly stuff about how this one friend has nineteen boyfriends and this one inside joke we have. He approached me about that, I talked to the friend, and we stopped for the most part. 

The other was when I was going to bring some condoms back to my dorm to keep there. I told him, he looked at me and asked, “Are you fucking other guys?” I told him the truth, no, but he still seemed unsure.

They do the same thing in the morning sometimes a little after 7 am because they like a sounding board for all their thoughts about our client work etc.  I try not to answer but sometimes I do because I think they might need something, such as just before an important client meeting, but often when I do they talk to me the entire time right up until the meeting begins, like I have nothing better to do then listen to them, when I needed that time to prepare some final things for that same meeting.   (Pre-covid, I might be a few minutes late and they literally say to me ""where were you?"") Most people in the company do not pick up their calls because of that. However, I am a senior person reporting directly to this most senior person and I often feel that I can't dodge like that.  I do often say that I have to go but they seem deaf.  I know I need to be direct about this problem but he fired the last guy I know that was direct about an issue.  I can’t go to HR because it’s a small company and the staff person just does what the boss wants.  (Firing people randomly.)

40,"My mom is probably the most annoying person I know. 

Her sense of humor includes scaring people, getting in their face, screaming at the top of her lungs, singing really loud at 11am.

She stares, a lot. She doesn't ever break eye contact and it is very uncomfortable. If you aren't looking at her, she's still staring. This is just how she is not her trying to be funny.

She crosses physical and emotional boundaries a lot. If you are in her way, she'll push you without saying anything. 

She thinks it's funny to be racist. I personally don't mind offensive humor, but as we are mixed and she's white, i lose a little respect for her. Especially since my brother and sister don't like when she does it and she ignores their wishes.

Her opinions socially are very traditional. Sometimes she shares opinions that no one asked for. Like ""gay people make me umcomfortable but I respect them"" everytime LGBTQ is brought up. Like okay we get it your lowkey homophobic but you want to seem like you aren't, I don't care.

She talks too much. She'll have a 30 minute convo basically with herself. She'll interrupt you and get mad if you interrupt her. 

She's pretty rude about my physical appearance. Not openly but passively. I lost 40 pounds and everytime she sees an old picture of me she gasps and says ""YOU LOOK A LOT BETTER LOL YOU WERE HUGE"". Like yes thank you for confirming how ugly I felt back then.

But I feel bad. My dads a narcissist and I'm afraid I might be too. My little sister is definitely the runner up but she's also just a kid. I never insult my mom and I do feel bad for rejecting her a lot, but my sister and my dad basically go HAM. My sister is rude to me too and she doesn't see a problem with it--she thinks its okay behavior. She's almost as obnoxious as my mom (not in the same way).

Today my mom got fed up with us all rejecting her all the time. She feels unnappreciated. She was basically yelling at everyone throwing a tantrum. I asked her not to stare at me and she started freaking out. And said it was disrespectful to show our negative emotions towards her. (for example sighing when she asks us to do chores or being angry when she's trying to be funny) and that she is sick of having to walk on eggshells.

I don't think she actually believes we shouldn't get upset by her annoying us. I think that was just something in the moment of her frustrations.

She is unnapreciated. She does a lot of cleaning for us and I know I need to get up and start cleaning so she can relax. I can do that for her atleast. I feel really bad because she just wants to be loved and to be herself and that's okay but if she weren't my mother I could not associate myself with her. I know how cruel that is but she gets on every last one of my nerves.

I want to know a way I can avoid rejecting her yet somehow avoid her annoying me atleast as much as I can. 

Also disclaimer- this isn't all to my moms personality. I've had good conversations with her where I didn't feel uncomfortable or angry. I also wonder if she's actually as annoying as I see her in my head. I also have a lot of pent up anger. It's hard to forgive someone when they probably don't even know what they did. I don't want to tell her about it because the times I have, I don't feel comfortable being vulnerable with her. And I don't want to keep blaming her and being upset about those things if I can't talk about it.",30Dec2020,1

LIKE STFU

I tell him I’m gonna be paid and I’m doing it for myself  and he says that^ honestly talking with him and allowing him to take my train of thought away from grinding makes me feel like my brain is melting.

45,"*For reference, i am 15 years old teen girl

So, i have a main group of 4 friends, where we are all friends but there’s 2 pairs of best friends. We’ve been best friends for about 2 years now. The thing is, every time I try to make plans with them, if one of THEM can’t go, we cancel it entirely, but if I’m the one that can’t go, they still go to whatever they were gonna do. It doesn’t matter which friend it is that can’t go: if it’s not me, the plans always get canceled. I also know for a fact that they have a separate group chat bc they always hang out together without telling me/putting it in our group chat of 4 and then post it on social media.

Am I over reacting by being sad/feeling like I don’t belong? I will admit, I’m pretty bad at texting back, I just always forget to, but I’ve always been the one to try and make plans for all of us, especially bc of COVID, 2 of us go to school on certain days and 2 of us don’t, so we never get to hang out all 4 of us.

 I've been to the emergency twice this summer because of the effects of waiting (TMJ and a brutal throat infection). I believe I have paranoia because of my depression and anxiety along with many other undiagnosed but extremely obvious mental health issues (like manic episodes, depersonalization, obsessions, thoughts my mood changes from suicidal thoughts to complete bliss and inspiration.) 

that were brought up due to a series of events. Recently, in the span of 5 months (August-December) I had multiple sudden moments where I have almost passed out, so much that I had to leave my shift at work early multiple times. I've had really bad bowel movements, my joints always crack loudly and pop, I feel empty and delirious all the time, and my memory has gotten so bad that I can't hold things in my brain for 10 seconds. 

My appetite is so none-existent that I'll just have a few snacks a day and sometimes I stay awake days at a time without being tired.

60,"Hello everyone 
I’ve moved in with my mum and my step-dad since COVID and I’ve been here for a few months. They have two staffy cross’ which are the most sweet, beautiful dogs. They never received any kind of form training but even still are pretty obedient (come when called, wait to eat their food, hop off or up furniture when asked etc), overall I love them so much. 

One dog belongs to my mum who she got when I was about 12, the other belongs to my step dad who he got when I was 16 ish but I was very independent at that time so I hadn’t considered or had the opportunity to train them myself. Before I moved in here I thought that the dogs were good and loved and everything that good, but since being here it’s kind of been proved otherwise.

Most notably, step dads dog had a torn ACL but he refused to get surgery or even a brace for her. He just stopped taking her for walks, or playing with her, hoping natural rest would heal it. They also only fed them 1 cup of kibble a day, for dogs &gt;20k, they say they don’t exercise enough to need more (but I disagree, they are hungry by nighttime). They also often forget to feed them. 

Step dad doesn’t want the dogs inside, which is fair enough, except when step dad isn’t around, my mum lets them inside. Sometimes, step dad will see them inside and not react and otherwise he will yell at them and kick them out. When step dad isn’t home I let them inside bc I don’t actually know what the f-ing rules are and bc they don’t have any kennels or beds, just the furniture out on the patio. I am doing my best to look after them while I’m here but I know when I move away that it’ll just be worse. 

I’m only writing this post now bc mum and step dad got back from a trip (covid safe, they were out on the boat) and while bringing all their stuff inside, step dad left the door open. His dog wandered inside. I told her to go out and she started to leave, doing as I asked. He saw her and screamed ‘get the fuck outside’ and kicked her so hard she yelped. He also won’t let mums dog inside when it’s storming even though she’s really afraid of thunder and bringing her inside somewhere quiet helps her. 

There’s also other issues like favouritism (mums dog generally gets more love etc from them, which is causing stepdads dog to act out for obvious reasons) but my main focus is on my stepdads shitty attitude. I kind of want to take them when I move out but 1) I might have to care for my other, elderly dog who lives with my dad, 2) that’s technically theft and my mum would never forgive me and 3) I’m struggling to find somewhere to live and to be able to afford that, let alone two more big dogs.

I want to cry knowing that they’re dealing with this. I feel so helpless I don’t know what to do. I’ve tried to talk to my mum but she just says ‘he loves the dogs but just shows it differently’, I think he treats them like an accessory. I can’t talk to stepdad bc he’s not receptive at all, likely id just get into trouble. 

Does anyone have any advice?",30Dec2020,1
61,"It’s a bit of a strange one here. One of my closest friends thinks she’s “dumb” and an “idiot”. She’s neither of those things, and I tell her constantly that she’s switched on. But no matter how many times I try to support her and give her examples of her clever she is, she always seems to dismiss them. 

We went the the same university, and ended up graduating with the same grade. And I would argue that her degree was actually more difficult to pass than mine. She always says the only reason she got that grade was because she got ‘help’ from me and our other housemates. We’d often proof read her work for her but nothing more. She and I weren’t on the same course so I’m reality all I could help her with was grammar and spelling. Everything else went right over my head. 

It’s becoming more of a problem now because whilst she’s searching for jobs she’ll instantly decide she won’t even try to apply because she’s not smart enough. And I’m not talking about jobs which are genuinely out of her (or any other recent graduate’s) reach, but jobs which are relatively low level. A lot of them are in areas that I’m currently working in, not the exact same company but a similar area which is still hiring despite the career dip with the pandemic. But she doesn’t want to apply because she thinks they’re looking for people ‘smarter than her’, which is maddening because they hired me and I’m definitely not ‘smarter than her’.

How do I help show her this? I don’t want her to loose out of jobs she could be amazing at because she’s insecure about her intelligence. This has been an ongoing issue since I met her at university, so I think she may have always felt this way about herself.",30Dec2020,1

Lovebombing, made me feel bad when I changed my hair, posted certain pics, talked to other guys, he’d use suicide/self harm threats when I was doing shit he didn’t like. Yadayada. As long as it took and as hard as it was, I eventually fell out of love with him when he started treating me like shit and I went through the heartbreak before I left him, honestly haven’t looked back since leaving and I’ve been much happier. 
After leaving him, me &amp; one of my best guy friends started exploring things outside of the friendship level lol. We’ve always had a really strong connection but I thought platonically until I got to see it in a new light. This was one of my ex’s best friends too, I met him through the ex 3.5+ years ago. We’ve been good buddies for a long time. I know that’s a shitty thing to do to my ex, but I’m not doing it to be an asshole or to get revenge, I’m doing it because he genuinely makes me very happy and is so far really good to and for me. My ex fucked up when he was a shitty boyfriend and his feelings aren’t my responsibility anymore, though I do have sympathy for him. He has none for me. I brought him all of his shit that I had last week, and he yelled at me for this, asking if I was sleeping with him, called me names and then said, “it just would’ve been easier on me if he had raped you.” Then he made me play “bitterfuck” by Joji and told me that I made a “perfectly, nice guy into a bitter asshole.” Not true, he was always a bitter asshole. Also told me he laughed when I almost totaled my truck in the snow because he “now knows karma is real.” What the fuck? He thinks I’m a bad person and makes me feel like shit then says shit like this and acts like he’s an angel. I guess I jusy don’t know how to process this. Weird how quick shit can change so fast.

71,"So we've been married a year, we're still figuring out each other when it comes to intimacy, arguments, disagreements, etc. We already had an idea of how to handle things when we were dating, but obviously it's different when you live with the person and about 75-80% of your time is being spent with them or around them. 

Like a lot of relationships, his libido is higher than mine. He's more often than not the one who initiates sex, and since he initiates more he is also the one who gets rejected more. It's not something that lasts weeks on end, it's more like a no sprinkled here and there throughout the week. The only exemption for that is if I'm sick, he's sick, or I'm on my period. 

Last night I was checking my phone because I thought a family member had messaged me through snapchat. I grabbed his phone and didn't realize it until I got to his snapchat. For one, he didn't tell me he had made a new account. He broke his phone before his current one and couldn't remember the login. Regardless of me asking him time and time again to figure the password out or make a new one, he wasn't interested, which was fine. 

I was fine with the account until I saw the bitmoji was a girl. I thought for a second he had logged into my account, which didn't make sense since you can only log into one account at a time. So I swiped to see the conversations and there were three. All of the people he had spoken to had unadded him since the conversations took place. I also didn't know the people he was talking to were bots, I thought this was a real girl at the time. And the other conversations had been deleted by snapchat since no one ever saved them. 

I saw a girl's name and I got even more curious. The conversation goes as follows because he side wasn't saved for whatever reason. So the conversation is pretty one sided. (and the slashes are a separate response each time. If I hit enter, it just shows as a paragraph when I post it.)

Him: ""Hello? / Yeah something like that. / Yeah it's been hard for sure. / For sure. My girlfriend broke up with me before quarantine. / No chances to find anyone since I wouldn't mind. I'm kinda nervous about stuff though. I've never really sent pictures before. / Haha. / You sure? Looks sketchy. / Sorry how do I add you? / I did I made an account."" 

Her: \*a link to datingxapp\* if you will show my nudes for ur friends I will kill you lol :p"" (And the title of the site was called snapchat for sexting.)

Him: ""Ok I did. / Yeah I don't think I see you though. / Ok. / Yeah sorry I don't understand. It doesn't show you added / Sorry love but idk what to do. Take it easy."" 

I saw all of this in the middle of the night, he was sound asleep and I couldn't just wake him up for that. I didn't even know what to say. I took the picture and locked his phone. I sent him a long paragraph about what I found, how I found it, and that we needed to talk in the morning when he saw that since he'd wake up before me. 

That morning he woke up, checked his phone, read the texts and woke me up. He mumbled a few things, it was more of him thinking out loud than for me to hear. 

""... so embarrassing."" ""I'm so sorry."" And then he explained. 

""I know what it looks like... We hadn't been together for a while and I needed you, and I didn't want to watch porn. So I made a new snapchat and start messaging the bots that add you and aren't a person. I let my imagination go with it and it ended up being a scam."" 

I don't mind him watching porn. I watch it, he watches it, we're not together 24/7 so obviously sometimes that's what'll have to get the job done if either of us ""need it"". I never expected him to go and message anyone, or any bot, for nudes. I don't know what his intentions were other than looking at or receiving nudes. 

He apologized a lot, he cried a lot, I cried a lot, he said he hoped that he'd be able to earn my trust back because he knew he messed up. He offered his phone to me to go through. He said I shouldn't feel bad for going through his phone because it's just a phone and we're married, and he shouldn't have done something like that. (In the message I wanted to make it clear I didn't just decide to go through his phone and I felt so crappy for invading his privacy after realizing what I had found.)

He said it was so embarrassing I had found it. And he asked me to please delete the picture. After that he told me I'm all he needs, I'm perfect, etc, etc, etc. He asked me not to hold it against him in the future because at the time he was just weak and did something stupid. I said I wouldn't. He asked me what I was thinking, how I was feeling, he just wanted some communication on what I thought about in terms of the situation. 

The day it had happened I was working at like 2:45-8:30 and then had to stay an extra hour because our store got crazy. So I got us food, came home, and that's what he had been doing before. And he acted like nothing had gone on. (I looked at the date at the very top of the conversation and counted back the days on my calendar.)

I don't know how to feel or what to think. After we got the crying and whatever out of our system we went downstairs, ate breakfast, he played video games and I stayed on my phone. It was our normal routine for when we both have to work. 

The conversation is mostly over, unless he brings it up or something. It makes me feel like I haven't been intimate enough. It makes me feel like he's looking for something else out there that I'm either not able to offer because it's not something I'm comfortable with, good at, or it's not how I look. I'm someone who seriously struggles with insecurities about my looks, weight, etc and he's aware of all of those insecurities. I don't know how to explain it to him because I know to him, in the end, it was him looking for something similar to porn without it being porn. He knows it's a bigger deal, but that's basically what was going on. I'm scared that now he's been caught, he'll continue doing similar things, but he'll be more careful than before. I don't expect it from him at all, but that's if like worse comes to worst and he does do something that grimy.

73,"So I recently got a dab pen (with legal THC- delta 8) and I decided to take a small hit in the freezer of a fast food chain I worked at the other day. The manager caught me in the freezer and sent me home and said not to come back until I get called in. Long story short I just got fired today. Its my first job I've had for a few months, but I've accepted the mistake and currently looking for another close by. 

The thing I'm worried about is that if the work calls my school. I'm in a program that promotes a free associate degree by senior year if you do the college courses. If they know from my job that I smoke on my downtime, I'm toast. Literally overcooked, crusty toast. Before my mom passed away 2 years ago I promised her I'd get the degree on her deathbed for her.

There are secrets inside of everything, and all you need to do is think hard enough.

I can explain everything later, it doesn't really matter in the long run, but the world is disorienting. There is only one conscious person inside of it, and that's me. Nothing else is real.

I used to not understand, but I'm so sure of it now.

I thought time was real too, but it's fake, because everything that comes into your mind from your five senses is alien information. How do you trust it?

You are real because you are me, and my ceiling fan is me, and the shelves are me. Everything is simultaneously part of the void, and also part of myself; and there's no differentiating because I might not be real either. I don't know yet. I'm still figuring it out.

All I know is that if I go inside of my head, and I don't come back out again, everything will end. There will be no more stimuli.

The world will end and no one will be there to tell me about it, because you're all going to be gone because you never existed in the first place.

My job is in sales for industrial equipment, I hit all my numbers each quarter and exceed quota, so I don’t have performance issues.

However, my old manager just retired a month back and the new one is the most rude and condescending person I have ever met.
Everything you do, he will nit pick. For example, I quoted something correct, he said it was the wrong quote and called me and said “You better not have f*cking done that , this is a big issue you are going to be in.”
5 minutes later, he goes thru audit history and finds it was all correct, and he was wrong, he refused to apologize, just said I was correct.

That’s just one of the 100 examples since mid November with this guy I have had to deal with, and after 5 years at this job and company, for the first time I actually hate it.

I am considering telling him to watch his tone with me next time he pulls something like that and tell him to have some respect and be an adult, which might not end up well but I have no other option to deal with this guy. 

I did start applying and can pick something up rather quick but I like my company and customers, but the workplace turned so toxic I get up and dread the day.

I am at the point where I won’t “flip out” but I am going to end up telling him straight up to tone it down and if he can’t do that, then we will be having issues and I will not put up with his crap.

84,"This is about a girl I have been dating for a couple of years, I’m now 23 and she’s 22. We were still in high school, and I met her a year after our parents started dating, ended up playing truth or dare with her and her friend. It was boring and nothing happened but that night after the friend left we fucked and we were pretty much together. It was really weird at first, but we never got caught. We told our parents we were dating, and surprisingly they were semi-ok with it. I fell in love with this girl, but I don’t feel like enough for her, I feel like a real jackass. I’m constantly attracted to other women, and it’s all I think about. I love this person with all of me, and I love to be around them, but I wonder if it’s a dependence. I don’t have many friends besides other girls, and she doesn’t like that. And to add to it, we argue too often about the same issues. We both have insecurities from problems early on, but I’ve begun to worry that it’s my fault when it gets out of hand. I feel it’s my job to not let it but I find myself thinking of cheating, and other ways out other than continuing to try and fix this. I wonder if I was only interested in sex in the beginning, but I am jealous if she shows interest in other guys, but I am guilty of the exact same thing. This is one of the coolest people I have ever met, we’re like besties and it’s always been hard to see my future without her, but sometimes it gets easier to see that. I get tired of going down the same roads. I want to keep them in my life but I want to meet more women and be free while I’m young and be independent. I want to still be there for her but not in a relationship. I feel selfish, we have talked about it, it never leads anywhere different.

85,"I’m not too sure of how to word this question right. So I will just explain with some backstory.

In 7th grade, this kid, I will just say his name is John, was new to my class. We were living in the poorest and most dangerous area of the city and we were also separated from the other kids, who were a lot like the kids in this movie called “The Ron Clark Story”. The reason why we were separated was because we were considered “Gifted” compared to the others. There were only about 10 of us apart from the other 500. But anyways, my first impressions of John was that I thought he was cute and we had some things in common. He played mobile games all day in the back of our classes with the first person he connected with in our group (which was only about 4 of us before him and everyone else.) I had already developed a mini crush on him and I guess I was annoying him, like doing the goofing things I did, because he called me some names that were hurtful.

There were other kids in the school who were getting their schedules changed to our group’s, and one of the girls getting her schedule changed happened to be my best friend. John asked her out the moment he saw her. I never told her that I had a crush on John, and to this day she doesn’t know. We’re not even best friends anymore anyways. But I was extremely salty and neither one knew I didn’t like them together. I acted like I was supportive but I wanted both of them apart and to myself somehow. I was like 12-years-old. I was jealous that they hugged, held hands, shared photos of each other online, spoke to each other (despite how normal middle school “couples” are) and I’m unsure if they kissed. And I was just there, awkwardly staring at them while they ignored me. He of course was rude to me.

Long story short, but months later, nearing the end of 7th grade, John and I were sitting in the library chatting with one other boy. He told us that he’s dating my best friend because she’s white, with blue/green eyes, and blonde. And that he had a thing for blondes. I used this information to break them up, cause I thought it would make my best friend mad. I told her that John was only dating her because of how she looks, that he thought she was boring and etc. and they broke up, never got back together. They didn’t have a chance anyways because John got into a huge physical fight with another boy in our “Gifted” group. He left in 7th grade. John and I use to chat on Kik anyways when it was popular and not used by weirdos much. But he left the app as well after a few months.

My best friend moved after 7th grade and I was alone. But we tried to stay in touch. 

Fast forward to about 10th grade, my best friend says she found John on Instagram and that he was using the same username from his Kik. I was shocked because I thought I didn’t like him anymore after realizing how rude he was to me. But there was something in me still liking him after all. I asked if she liked him and she said “Hell no”, she said that he was weird and ugly. That she liked her guys Hispanic. (Even though John is half Nicaraguan....) We added him to a 3-way chat between us on Instagram. It seems like he was more interested in being friends with her over me, even though she was pushing him away and being rude. He followed her but she didn’t. Now, we don’t keep in contact because she drifted away from us both in favor of crime. John and I remained friends.

11th grade, I finally admitted that I had a crush on him and still kind of do and he was shocked that I didn’t tell him sooner, that he didn’t know. He flirted and chatted with me for years from 2018 to spring 2020. and in October, John asked me out on a date but never got back to me AT ALL about it. I tried reaching out to him and asked him how he was doing and all that, he left me on read. 

Now, we’re both in 12th grade, I’m most likely graduating early and we’re of legal age, yet NOTHING has happened between us. I honestly don’t believe he likes me really but I’ve had a crush on him for about 6 1/2 years now... I want to finally let go of him and just remove him altogether because I don’t even think I want to be friends with him. So...

Life is really fucking shit, it just keeps getting worse. I wouldn’t say I’m depressed cause I hate when people self-diagnose themselves, but I’ve really not doing been well these past months/year. I keep losing friends it seems, and struggle to find new ones.

I’m 15, so a nice social circle is something I highly prioritize, I fucking need people to be around, I can’t function otherwise, my anxiety just triples through the roof. (I have lots of anxiety just as a standard with no specific reason) The thing is that I have ambitions, shit I wanna accomplish before I die, but it all seems so fucking farfetched when shit is like this. There comes periods when I feel so isolated by the ones I want to be with, that I find a really fucking weird circle with people I shouldn’t be around, people who really aren’t good for my saftey. When stuff like that happens I just feel even more lost and think: “What the fuck am I doing, I’m such a fucking loser”

I want to just start over and like move to the US (born&amp;raised in Stockholm, Sweden) but when I envision it, that seems so depressing aswell, starting over. It’s like nothing will ever work out, I always find myself stuck in the past, reminiscing. The ONLY fucking thing keeping me from killing myself is my family (and a lil bit of my ambitions ig even though they seem unlikely), because I know the pain and terror it would cause them if I went through with it.

My situation is a little unique. I'm 21 but have never dated or so much as held hands with anyone. I was home schooled. That along with some other circumstances have left me in a less than ideal situation - still living with my parents, no job, no car/license, it's rough. But I'm working on things and actually feel more stable and excited about my future than ever, yet I'm lonely. I'd like to start trying to date, even if it's through the internet because I have no way around or to meet up with people.

So, I've been considering getting Bumble. I've used it a few times before but always wound up deleting it because it just made me feel terrible about myself. I can't relate to anyone my age because everybody else is all leaps and bounds ahead of me in every way. I feel like I'm still 14.

But I wouldn't mind giving it another shot. The thing is, the likelihood of anyone else my age being interested in a long-distance, serious relationship seems slim. I don't even want to put in the time if it'll be wasted. I would just love to take things slow, find a guy my age I can relate to, share things with each other, hopefully have some interests and goals in common, etc.

I also didn't last long before because I didn't feel like it was fair to subject the mess that I was upon anyone else. But I really have improved. My anxiety is better, I'm bettering myself and my situation, I actually have goals and passions now. Still...I don't know if I'm actually in any position to date, let alone attempt it through a dating app that people only seem to want to use for hookups.

The next day I only felt good wrapped up in multiple layers, and a shower, cold or hot was nearly unbearable. Sunday I got an online doctor visit and they diagnosed me with a sinus infection. My eyes hurt to look in any direction and my head and face felt numb or stuffy. They prescribed an inhaler for the cough and methylprednisolone for the inflammation. The first day I had to take six pills from the pack and felt okay but not great. The pills wane off each day and today (3 of 6 for the steroid pills) I keep feeling the persistent coldness and numbness on and off. I've slept for half the day and I feel an immense amount of dread.

94,"To start the post off, I’ve had a long, winding, awful mental health journey. I know pretty much every therapy skill, I have two therapists, a psychiatrist, etc etc. Since the start of quarantine, my depression has gotten really really good. My behaviors have slowed to a stop and I felt stable for a while. Before March, I very few close friends, which I was fine with. But once quarantine started, I got added to this group chat with a lot of mutual friends, and I just...stopped seeing people in real life, except for my girlfriend. We broke up at the end of July, and since then I’ve hung out with said friends maybe four times. I’ve always had social anxiety, but with school I built up a good tolerance and I’ve never avoided any plans or parties. Social anxiety for me isn’t panic attacks or crying, it’s more of a slow and steady process of isolation where I don’t instigate plans or conversations. Now with quarantine, I’ve lost all of that tolerance and I’m having new thoughts that are really self deprecating. I’ve never really had them this intense before. My problem is that I used to (as in over the summer) be really good at turning negative thoughts into positive ones, but now I’m actually BELIEVING them. I really do think everyone hates me. It’s gotten so bad that I’ll hide in my room until late evening to avoid my family and guests. What’s worse is that I’m totally fine with this avoidance, but any time my mom mentions how I’m not seeing people, or my sister has friends over, I get this huge rush of negative thoughts and emotions. 
It’s all so complicated in my mind, but another piece to the puzzle is my friends themselves. I have one really close friend and she’s kind of keeping my above total collapse, even if I don’t talk to her (lol). But there’s this added level of complete humiliation when I invite someone from that group to hang out, and they say “oh that’s so sweet” but never follow through, or when I see them with other people on social media. 
I talked to my therapist today shortly about this (reduced therapy for the holidays) and how it so difficult to do exposures (like FaceTime calls or actually hanging out) for myself because of the reasons I listed, and she said to process the physical response in my body, but it’s all so difficult and overwhelming I don’t know how to move past the embarrassment of having friends but also have no friends at all. 
y’a know?
One more thing, if you read this far, is that I have CPTSD, and it’s resurfacing at this time of year, and I’ve found that when I’m with anyone, I have this sort of detached state where I don’t know what’s going on or what to say. How do I even get around that?!",30Dec2020,1
95,"I (19M) left my girlfriend (20f) we didn’t break up I just moved away from her back with my family that treated her like shit and did a lot of messed up things to her and me. 

For some back story, recently my brother (20m) and girlfriend got in a argument over text she messaged him and was kinda insulting him since he’s always been disrespectful to her and our relationship in general and shows a lot of signs of being a sociopath and he said a lot of rude things to her. I couldn’t really say anything to him about it since he wouldn’t talk about it, and my other family that doesn’t like her never even tried to get to know her they didn’t like that she didn’t smoke or didn’t do careless things and didn’t need to rely on anyone since she comes from a good family, so they made her an easy target especially since she’s really shy and quiet. 

I love her and I see a future with her but I just think she deserves so much better, I want to go back to her, but I know my family will see me as weak and they already think she’s controlling since she set boundaries in our relationship that they don’t have in theirs (talking to other people, seein other people and doing drugs, etc. she’s not into that style of life) I just don’t really know what to do or what I’m doing, I just keep hurting her when all she does is love me. 

Even since I left she’s just been trying to make herself a better person and seeing her own flaws and has just been lovey to me and still expresses how much she cares about me and still loves me, I think she’s right about so much but when it comes to acting upon it I just feel like I can’t or I’m not ready?

99,"Hi all,

It's my first Wisconsin winter and I'm posting this on many different forums to try and get some good advice. I currently live in a large cul-de-sac with about 12 complexes in it. The cul-de-sac is right off of a busy highway.

My question is, our landlord posted that all cars must be removed from the parking lot by 10am if we recieve more than 2 inches of snow by 5pm the previous night. If we don't move our cars, they will be towed. I should note that we do not pay for parking spots and have no garages on site. 

However, there's literally no where to park since we are right off of a highway, and the nearest parking lot is a about 5 miles down the highway. I asked my landlord where to park since there was no where to park, and she told me to ""just drive around"" or park on the road. Which I don't believe we can park on the highway, and I can't ""drive around"" since I work from home from 9-6pm. I could easily take a break and move my car at 10am like I'm supposed to, but I can't spend my time driving around while they plow- especially in Wisconsin, where the winters are very dangerous some days. 

Any advice? The landlord is being very unhelpful with this situation. Thank you!",30Dec2020,1

106,"I’m 21 and my bf is 23. My mom is extremely jealous of my boyfriend and constantly makes me feel guilty for spending time with him instead of her. She’ll say I don’t spend enough time with the family, which I do. I have lunch/dinner with them everyday. But when I am with them, I apparently look “lethargic”. I don’t think I look that way but I do genuinely dislike spending time with them because they’re abusive. I suffer from PTSD and they’ll constantly make me hide it so as to not “bring down the mood” of the house. I constantly have to pretend to be happy in front of them and they tell me things like that getting sexually assaulted was partly my fault and that it’s not “real” sexual assault because I’m the one who trusted the guy. They also gaslight me to no end. My mom once threw me against the window and tried to gaslight me into thinking it never occurred. Luckily, my cousin was on Skype with me and heard the commotion so he was able to ascertain that she in fact threw me against the window. 

 Moreover, they always quiz me on my whereabouts and I have to lie to them because they won’t let me go to my boyfriend’s house. I only go there so I don’t have to pretend to be jovial. 

I know I’m old enough to leave but I can’t because they’re paying for my university. I don’t know how to make my mom less jealous because I really don’t want to spend more time with them.

110,"I recently made friends with a guy from my work a few months ago. We started off our friendship strong. We have plenty of things in common (video games, same taste in movies, same hobbies) and thats why we started hanging out. He has been to my apartment and I've been to his. So we became more than just work-friends. 

About a month into our new found friendship I noticed him asking me to hangout almost every weekend. Some weekends I'm busy with my girlfriend, or family and I simply can't hangout. Everytime I tell him I can't hangout, he seems to become really passive aggressive with me. One time he even hung up the phone on me in the middle of my sentence because I was telling him I'm busy and can't hangout. This was a major red flag to me. I told him I don't appreciate being hung up on and he came up with some bullshit excuse saying his phone must have glitched out. That incident really turned me off towards wanting to be his friend.

Ever since that happened he's been really showing his true colors. He's been doing weird things to me like sending me pictures of anime porn completely out of nowhere. I texted him and said I'm not into that kind of stuff and he just laughed it off. But it made me really uncomfortable. He also begs me to listen to his ""podcast"" and sends me the link to listen to it every week. He's too needy and I don't like it. 

I feel like I started off this friendship with him too quick and too personal and now I'm really starting to see who he is. I kind of find him to be repulsive and I don't want to be his friend anymore. The problem is that I started out liking him and wanting to be his friend, and now I'm completely repulsed by him. I also work with him so I cannot avoid him.

How do I go about ending this friendship the nicest way possible?",30Dec2020,1

116,"
I’m 20M my gf is 19F we have been dating 9 months she is the best thing that’s ever happened to me shes smart/pretty/funny/beautiful basically amazing I’m defo dating up I still don’t know how a piece of shit like me got someone like her the fact that I know she can do much better 

Shes really close with her entire family for her family unity is a big thing like her family knows pretty much everything that goes on in her life (feeling/dreams/fears/insecurities /passions/hobbies) they know all her friends by name and they are all very nice I met them about a month into our relationship and most of them really like me especially her dad(cause one of the first times I was over I basically volunteered and remade their wooden bench)and younger brother (cause I’m into the same kinda strategy games as him and I sometimes play with him) 

My family dynamic is the complete opposite my parents are divorced I grew up with my dad who was abusive to me (so I’m not close with him as in we talk but he knows nothing about my life except what course I’m doing and that I have friends ) and I prefer to keep it that way.my mother is a narcissistic bitch with who I don’t like speaking to at all as she robbed my elderly grandmother of over half a million dollars. I’m relatively close with my grandparents but not in the way of sharing details of my personal life with them(I don’t share anything about my relationships with them)  but other aspects of life they know a bit better as in they know my plans for the future and if i have a problem to do with household or decisions on my future to do with my career I share with them but not my personal life 

My Gf knows all of that as I’ve shared this with her(at this point she knows more about me than my entire family combined) but I think the fact that nobody in my family knows about her is starting to bother her as well as it’s starting to affect her families perception of me even though she has told them that my relationship with my family is screwed up 

There is also one more factor that bothers her it’s that I haven’t posted a picture of us on social media but that’s for two reasons I hate taking pictures I always look stupid/dumb and as though I’ve been taken hostage(which is why I’ve never posted a meaningful picture of myself the only one is a long distance photo of me playing ice hockey where u can’t even see my face) and a second is I have an aunt who follows me on social media and if she sees a pic of us then it’s gonna start a whole drama but I can’t block as I talk to her via Instagram 

Though my 3 best friends know about her and them meeting her a couple times and my best friend she knows decently as we all go to the same uni and are all in the same course plus she’s good friends with his gf 

I’m at a lose what can I do there is nothing left for me to tell her about my family she knows about them though she thinks I shouldn’t be keeping my personal life hidden from them especially my grandparents. My friend thinks I should just give what she wants im not sure I’d wanna do that if they know about my personal life they are gonna start annoying me and then would want to meet and and she would want the same 

I’m not sure what can I do any advice help is appreciated or outlooks on to my position or even worst case any lie I can use to shut this conversation down 

TLDR- gf wants me tell my family about her plus wants me to post pics with her I can’t do either due to hating taking pictures and never doing it plus having a dysfunctional relationship with my family",30Dec2020,1

However, all throughout this time I've been happier than I think I ever was. This is because I cope by daydreaming, always have. During quarantine, this has taken on a whole different dimension. I have felt more intensely during my daydreams that I think I have ever before in life. I was able to block out everything around me because I had my daydream keeping me happy. 

Now about a week ago I met this guy and we hit it off right away. He's amazing and a great match for me. However, being with him feels like I am losing everything that has kept me content and happy throughout this entire year. 

Ever since I met him I am suddenly confronted with my actual real life, a life in which I am studying a subject I don't even remotely enjoy, that will never be as fulfilling as it was in my daydream. And since realizing that, I cannot feel anymore. My daydreams suddenly feel void and empty, but so does real life. 

I am just sad and crying uncontrollably for days now. I want that feeling of comfort and happieness back that I got from my daydream, but now it's just gone and I don't know how to cope. 

All my life I have coped by daydreaming and now that that's gone, I feel so utterly depressed, it's ridiculous. 

I am genuinely considering breaking things off with this great guy, just to hopefully be able to retreat back into my daydreams, because facing my actual life is just so overwhelming, it's making me want to do stupid things. 

I'm just done. I've never felt such an intense sense of loss in my life and it's tearing me apart. I am usually extremely good at moving on and getting over things, but this time it seems impossible. 

I really want to reach out to people for help, but how do you explain grieving over the loss of something you never actually had? To everyone around me I've just been happily living my life and now suddenly I am a wreck for no appearant reason at all. I'm sorry if this is long-winded, I just really needed to get it off my chest.

My stepbrother denied everything and was shouting and crying trying to act like the victim. His mom would always defend him and would always say that I was lying. My dad sided with my stepmom and they forgot about the whole subject. It continued and even got to the point were he would show me his penis and even tried and get me to touch it but I never did. When it first started I was really young and thought that it was all fun and games until I realised what he was doing. He would often try and put his hand down my pants and occasionally smack my butt. He would always flirt with me even when he knew that I knew he had a girlfriend. When I was 10 I caught him trying to pull down my shorts and underwear when I was sleeping and that’s when I started to get really uncomfortable around him.

135,"I’m not really sure how to start this, but basically over the last couple years, but especially this year, I have been feeling increasingly smothered by my sister. I love her, and I’m glad that we have become close as adults (we weren’t as kids) but it’s like she’s turned into a helicopter sister that always has to be in my business. She always replies or likes every single thing I tweet, even when it’s clear I’m just kinda making a joke or shouting into the void and there’s no need for any friends or anyone else to respond. The reasons I want her to stop following me on Twitter are one, there’s a huge disconnect with our senses of humor since we’re from different generations. She’s always asking me to explain memes or jokes online that were created by gen z, but I find it difficult to explain to her most of the time because a lot of my generation’s jokes are implied humor, like you don’t need an explanation, just the random thing itself is funny? And she doesn’t get that, and I find it frustrating to try explaining that because I can’t really explain the memes most of the time. Two, I feel like I always have to hold back from posting certain things on my main account because I don’t want her asking about it/commenting/judging. Sometimes I’d like to talk about dating, make a horny tweet, or mention something family related, but I don’t want her knowing my business and I don’t want someone I’m related to seeing me post horny tweets about my celeb crushes, because that feels weird to me. I made a private account (which she asked to follow and I told her no) but I miss the freedom I used to have of posting whatever I wanted on my main account without having to worry about my sister waiting just around the corner to comment on it. Idk if any of this is making sense, but I know the only way about this is to ask her to stop following me on Twitter. I could softblock her, but eventually she’d figure it out, so I don’t know how to go about doing this. Can anyone help?",30Dec2020,1

I was like where is the sound coming from? So i paused my tiktok and the sound stopped. So i thought it must have been from the tiktok but when i played it again the sound wasnt there!

149,"Been with a great girl for a while now and really enjoy the relationship. The only issue, and it’s becoming a bigger one every day, is her cold sores.

She gets them very frequently. About every 2 months. All her family and friends don’t care at all about it and will do things like share drinks while she has an active cold sore. All the guys she’s been with didn’t care either. So now she takes virtually no precautions.

I actually care about not getting herpes. So I’ve been really paranoid about it, but she has been understanding. However, she just doesn’t naturally take precautions. I always feel like I have to ask her to wash her hands after touching her mouth, or to hold off on kissing me after her cold sore has scabbed over, because she believes that it’s not contagious after the scab happens.

It’s hit a point where her precautions aren’t getting any better and my worries are only going up.

Even when there is no outbreak, it is still contagious. Just for reference, of all the couples where the other has gotten herpes, 70% has been transmitted while there are no symptoms.

152,"for starters, my father (44m) and I (14f) have a very complicated relationship. he was never there when I was younger, being halfway across the world, leaving my mother to raise me alone for pretty much all of my life. he'd only come back once a year for about a week before going back abroad again if he ever came at all. it wasn't until recently (2-3 years ago) that he stayed for longer periods of time, \~6 months. 

i have no good memories with him. i don't doubt that good interactions have happened, although it's rather sullied by my truly staggering negative impression of him, not to mention that when i was little, i never hoped for him to return, rather i wished for him to leave. I also heavily avoid any sort of interaction with him along with the fact that I am extremely cautious when interacting with him.

why? to put it bluntly, he is the definition of a ticking time bomb manchild. racist, sexist, homophobic, arrogant, disrespectful, and childish would be some examples i could give of his personality. he'd heavily disrespect my mother as well, spending his entire day on his games and devices. not once did he ever do chores, and when he's home, he doesn't work. essentially he spends half a year sitting on the couch, blasting his shows on the TV, making it too loud for anyone to sleep from 5am - 1am, playing mobile games and overall slacking off. he had the audacity to say that my mother doesn't do anything and that she's lazy, even though she works a full day, takes care of two kids at her work cause they're her boss's grandchildren, come home, take care of me, my grandmother and my father, and do EVERY CHORE IN THE HOUSE, making her sleep at 3 and wake up at 6. 

i help out every way i can, whether it be dishes, laundry, or even going to her work so i could take care of the kids so mom could focus on her actual job, i did everything i could. my father then had the nerve to tell me that i wasn't being helpful and that if i actually cared about mom, i would go to her work every single day. my mother wanted to avoid that cause, you know, corona? 

anyways that was one experience out of hundreds but i think it characterizes my father well. he's inconsiderate of others feelings (ex. calling me fat with a beer belly even though im 90 pounds and below the healthy weight, and justifies that by saying that the people of his hometown were skinnier and that Americans are fat :)) or he complains about my 77-year-old grandma (mom side) about not cooking and doing every chore in the house and justifying it by saying his mom does those chores. 

I cannot respect my father. Even though im in the same house with him 24/7 due to the both of us locked indoors, we only see each other only during dinner, and our conversations would last less than 30 seconds per day. he's complained about me being too cold to him, which i acknowledge, however i cannot bring myself to speak to him as i fear another argument will ensue. he's gotten mad at me for accidentally scratching him, and ignored me for 3 months straight, without ever telling me why until my mother explained it to me. he caused my first panic attack a month ago because i couldn't hear mom calling me down for breakfast as i was sleeping and yelled at me. in truth, i am terrified of him. he's big, loud, and intimidating. i wish nothing more than for him to move away again. however, i realize that this relationship must be mended for the sake of our family. my mother always preached about how family is the most important thing and i know she would be distressed if my father and i continued like this. 

what can i do to improve my view of my dad? i am more than willing to provide more examples of our interactions to get a better look at our relationship. the tension in the house between us is high, and i worry that another disastrous occurrence will begin again. im so sorry if i sound entitled, bratty, or nit-picky, i know i am already very lucky to even have a father. i hope this post can help my view on him, i want to look at him like a father figure and respect him. any advice will help, i need to salvage this before it's too late.",30Dec2020,1

168,"Using an alt account for privacy.

TL;DR bought items from a Redditor thru eBay, didn't get them all, wondering how much to dispute and actually pay. 

I saw a Redditor with some collectible currency that he was interested in selling, and made contact with him expressing my interest in buying. We agreed on a price, and we agreed that handling the transaction through eBay and PayPal would protect both of us.  He was unsure about how to handle shipping, and I suggested very specifically a USPS Priority Mail Flat Rate box.  They are trackable and insurance can be bought.  I made the eBay purchase and paid via PayPal.  He shipped the items and sent a tracking number. 

Yesterday I received a thin envelope with less than 1/4 of the purchased items in it.  It was sealed in a clear bag by the USPS that stated ""received unsealed"".  The tracking number was partially gone so it can't be barcode scanned.  PayPal and eBay still show it ""in transit"".  

I've communicated with since then and he didn't insure the package.  He's asked me to mark the item received in PayPal, so he can get his funds released.  i. e. je hasn't gotten paid at all. 

I can only recoup at most $50 from the USPS it appears - all Priority Mail includes $50 insurance. 

Monetarily, he's out $200 purchase price total - his cost. I agreed to $37.50 per item, or $300 total.  eBay collected sales tax, bringing my out of pocket to about $330 before shipping.  Based on our agreed price, I have $75 in items in my possession of the original $300.

I didn't give him explicit instructions to insure the package, but I did suggest a *free* USPS Priority Mail Flat Rate box that would have survived, I feel like.  Instead he chose a cheap envelope that got torn and some of the contents lost or stolen. 

Should I dispute through PayPal/eBay and only pay him the $75 plus shipping (~$10), plus the $50 if I get it from the USPS? That leaves him with $135 in hand - - equaling about $100 in loss, instead of $75 profit he would have had.  That would make me ""whole"", with 1/4 of the items at our agreed upon price. 

Or should I ""eat"" some of the loss, and pay him more, since I didn't explicitly request insurance?",30Dec2020,1

171,"My (20M) ex-partner (also 20M) broke up with me a few months ago. We'd been together for 4 and a half years and it was a painful break up. Throughout the relationship my partner had always told me he loved me, thought I was his soulmate, wanted a future together, marriage, etc. We'd both struggled with mental illness throughout the whole relationship, but in the 6-ish months before the break up my mental health had taken a nose dive. Even though I did my best to not bring him down, I was quite unwell and was worried about my issues scaring him away, but he told me he definitely wanted our future together and didn't want to leave. Fast forward to less than a week after him assuring that to me and he tells me I'm too much to deal with. He said he'd been happier during the lockdown because it meant he hadn't had to see me in person. So that hurt a lot. It felt like my world came crashing down. I didn't want to but I felt betrayed. I'd always done my best to be there for him during his worse times even when it took a toll on me. Stuff like accompanying him to emergency A&amp;E visits, sitting in on intense family therapy sessions, supporting him through an incident with his brother becoming unwell/violent, staying with him for 6 weeks straight when he was in a particular rough patch, etc. So admittedly I felt let down by him and abandoned. But I also understood we are not the same person and we both have differing capacities and capabilities for dealing with certain situations, as well as the fact I did those things because I cared about him and wanted to help as much as possible, not so he'd owe me or anything like that. 

After some time and space we decided to keep talking with the intentions of trying to build the relationship slowly back up because he said he still loved me and wanted to be with me, he just thought we needed time to work on ourselves. I went to see him a couple times, and on the second occasion whilst cuddling up watching a video together on his phone I saw a tinder notification pop up. My ex didn't see why this felt off to me, he said we weren't in a relationship and he didn't plan on meeting or dating anyone he talked to, it was jus flirting so it should be fine. I told him that wasn't my issue, just that it felt dishonest to me that he'd said about building our relationship back up and still being in love with me but meanwhile was also flirting on tinder, regardless of whether he'd have met/dated anyone from there. Eventually though he'd said he didn't think we were as compatible as before and couldn't see us getting back together, but that he'd like for us to be friends.

However we did stop talking for a while after this, and during this time I began to realise just how toxic our relationship could be, even from the start. Acknowledging things that I'd always tried to overlook or justify by reminding myself that the relationship could be really good as well, and that we both had our own issues and weren't perfect. Being able to reflect on the relationship without actually being in it enabled me to see it with more honesty. Which has been kinda difficult because I'm realising my once-in-a-lifetime relationship wasn't as amazing as I thought. 
Recently we accidentally stumbled across each other on an app and he said he wanted to be friends. We talked for a few days and after asking if I was ok he'd said he was always there if I needed to talk. I said that I wasn't trying to be dickish and did really appreciate that, but he didn't have to offer since wasn't one of the main reasons we broke up because he found that kind of stuff too much to deal with? He told me it was different now, we weren't together and he was in a better place. He said he wished I'd leave that stuff in the past. 

I know we have enjoyable conversations, we have interests in common, and we can have a laugh together. In hindsight I see the break up was for the best and I no longer would want a relationship with him, I don't think I have any romantic feelings towards him left anymore. So I should feel ok about being friends, but it just feels off to me. I don't want to hold onto things unnecessarily but I can't shake off the weird feeling it gives me. I'm worried I'm being too sensitive and making a big deal out of nothing.

173,"I have known my best friend for years now and we had quite a good friendship. Around March when covid quarantine started for us I couldn't hang out with her in person. So, I got her email address and we started talking on Skype. I was very happy that I was able to still talk to her in some way. Then, out of nowhere, she quit responding to my texts. I felt really bad about that and I wondered if I did something wrong that angered her. After maybe a couple months or something I found out from her mother (both me and my friend are teenagers) that she has been stressed out and stuff with covid and has shut people out. I now haven't talked to her now for nearly nine months and I really miss her. I have seen on social media however that she still hangs out with another of her other best friends (who is a little closer to her than me) and that makes me kind of mad and jealous. I am unsure what to do or even if I should do anything but I still feel sad and a bit angry about all of this and would like some advice.",30Dec2020,1

180,"I’m male, in my early teens. During lockdown I have drifted from the small friend group I had, although when I see them in real life they make it seem as though we’re best mates again. They all have their own friend groups, many I have tried to socialise with only to be shot down and made fun of. I personally think it is because I lack the confidence to just simply make actual close friends. Most days I spend waking up late and wasting the day away on my phone/eating. It’s becoming a cycle that is slowly draining me by the day. I do not want to share these insecurities with the people around me as I believe at the end of the day it is entirely up to me to develop a more confident personality. I have made many attempts to be more conceiving of my emotions around people, but I eventually end up embarrassing myself one way of another.

181,"So I have gotten super lucky (and/or my hard work is paying off) and just got an internship in the career path i want to pursue! The hours are super demanding M-F 8:45-6. The main problem with that is: I work a full time job currently, and because the internship interview process was so fast, I don’t have a comfortable amount of time to give my employers a two week. 

It’s just a easy retail job, so i don’t know if a two week is necessary or really required, but i’m a rule follower type of person, and that would be the way i’d feel best about leaving. The major problem is my internship ideal start date is the 4th (literally just found out i got it on the 28th). They said they are flexible with the start date BUT, I would love to start when everyone else does. 

so this is my dilemma: how do i quit my job i work now, which I have come to really enjoy (i’ve been working there just shy of 4 months) &amp; the managers value me as an employee (i get the most hours out of all the PT employees/ new hires, &amp; am trusted to do the managers job when they need to step out). I would **love** to stay on somehow, but with my internship hours being what they will be... that’s nearly impossible. 

any and all tips on how to quit/ what to say/ best way to phrase things very very welcome, thank you! (sorry if the format was a little ramble-y, my mind in spinning with all this new information)",30Dec2020,1
182,"So I have an ex, Jon, who I'm still on good terms with. I was very very close to his family, especially his Mom. She was basically a second Mom to me especially when my own passed away. She did so much for me. Jon's Step Dad (who isn't actually his step dad since him and his Mom weren't married but they were together for 8 years so I'm just going to say Step Dad to make things easier) so his Step Dad, Brian, was also extraordinarily amazing to me. If Jon and I were ever going to marry I'd have Brian walk me down the aisle. In fact I still might ask him to do that no matter who I marry. 

At the beginning of this year, Jon's Mom passed away from breast cancer. It was insanely heart breaking and emotional. She was very well loved. Afterwards, we were all so concerned for Brian because he's such a sweet man that he simply doesn't deserve this kind of grief. Even after her death, Brian has done a lot for me. While I was in between housing, he let me stay rent free in his apartment while he went to visit family for a month. Anyway, he's just great.

So my sisters Mother in law, Lucy, coincidentally lives literally minutes away from Brian, so does my sister and her husband actually. Anyway. Lucy's son (not sisters husband) passed away earlier this year as well from liver disease and its obviously been extremely hard for her. Especially because she's single and lives alone too. She's an extremely nice woman. I love her to bits and she's been there for my sister for many many years and I don't know what my sister would have done without her. She's just great. She's honestly everyones dream Mother in Law lol 

A few weeks ago, I kinda brought up the idea that we should get Ben and Lucy together. Almost in a joking way but also in a ""wouldn't that be nice"" type of way. My sister told Lucy about the idea and she's since been really intrigued by it. Tonight my sister asked me for Brian's Facebook so Lucy could add him and strike up a convo. I said I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with that especially because I don't really know what Brian's thinking and he's probably definitely not at all ready for that sort of thing yet. My sister told me it's not to ""hook up"" or date, but that they just have a lot in common in terms of losing a loved one this year and generally just being single and living alone with that grief and it'd be nice for them to just connect and talk. 

I said I'd need to think about it. It IS a nice thought. Like, they're older people. But both very agile and put together for their age. They both look younger than they are and I do feel like they'd get along and they do live legit a hop skip and a jump away from each other. My only concern is Brian being annoyed at me for giving out his Facebook? But it's not like I'm giving away his credit card number, like his Facebook is out in the open for anyone to see. But he's honestly just the nicest person in the world that I'd never know if he'd be annoyed or mad or something. I don't know if I'd be over stepping my boundaries? But I don't know if I'm overthinking it and letting the two talk. What do you think?

187,"As bad as it may seem, I just can't seem to find any admiration for my mum. I know she cares and that she loves me. However, during my childhood my family experienced domestic abuse from my dad. Since getting out of the house, we moved in with my grandparents and have been here 12 years. It was clear my mum was still suffering with the aftermath of the abuse, and since this point have not felt able to to see her as a stable person to lean on (I was nine when we moved out of there). 

When I felt depressed, I told my family I wanted to drink a bottle of bleach and was told off for it and told it was a bad thing to do, and they made out  it was a bad thing for me to see a doctor. Since then, I've put my chin up and tried to get on with life. 

I've always been a tryer, a fixer upper, stubborn and never given up. These traits have attributed to me getting into university, going solo from school doing my A levels for the last 3 months of being there and achieving two grades higher in the subjects I wasn't doing well in within the space of 3 months independently. I have also launched a tutoring business that work flexibly for me during my university studies and have freelancers that have joined the team too! 

I have always believed that you need to fight for what you believe in and for what you want and that we all have a duty to ourselves and others to be who we are and to be able to support ourselves both financially and with a good work ethic. 

My mum however has not worked a job since 1999 and still lives with my grandparents. My grandparents are set to retire soon, and she still expects to live off their dime in retirement. It infuriates me and upsets me so much that she can't fight to do something for herself. On two seperate occasions I have managed to get her the chance of a job interview...

One being a school receptionist at my school at the time (she has a diploma in office work) and she turned it down as she didn't want to work on the same school as me and my brother 

Another time being right down the road at a 'cold calling' centre. She said she didn't WANT to cold call.

I absolutely despise her for that. As well as the fact that she REFUSES to even APPLY for social housing. She just expects people to fucking provide for her till she dies and it's something I can't forgive. She isn't my type of person, she just makes me hate her. 

I've tried to go the long route of saying you can do it you've got this and she just ignored my text and didn't talk to me about it.

She has a fucking obligation and a duty to provide for her family. The man she got with was an asshole but that doesn't mean she depends on state benefits and her family to do it all for her. 

I can only admire the fact she loves me and that's it - not in an egocentric way but that's the only thing she can do as a parent. The rest she has fucked. 

Even when the domestic abuse happened and my dad did stuff to me IN PUBLIC she decided to stay with him. 

There's things I can't forgive or forget and I just can't. I know my feelings are justified but I just can't - like I didn't even miss her when I went to university or when I came back. As awful as it is, I can survive without her and don't think I'll be too sad when she dies. I won't want her in a hospital room with me if I have kids and I'm giving birth and even the idea of letting her look after any kids I may or may not have gives me shivers.

193,"This is a long story and a lot of people will be dismissive because I used the phrase soulmate but nothing else makes sense or succinctly describes how the person makes me feel. Not to mention the bizarre circumstances of us ever meeting/when we met seems too  predestined to be logical. (I never believed in the concept of soulmates before meeting this individual, so the skepticism is understandable). 

I have to say I love my wife, we've been together the better part of a decade and it's been very happy for the majority of it. The past couple of years have been bumpy and being just the two of us quarantined together has just magnified the problems. One of the biggest problem throughout our relationship has been how few interests and hobbies/television shows/ movies we share. I've tried introducing her to my interests and hobbies, started new ones to do together that fell off over time, and it feels like over time we have less and less in common. 

Now 3 months ago I met a friend online through a friends discord group. We just connected, literally everything was the same and she was able to slip through my emotional brickwall without even trying. Talking with her isn't like anything I've ever experienced before. I have felt love and it pales to how I feel when we talk. It was so fundamentally shaking that i told my parents within the first week of even talking to her. I knew I loved her, it was like coming back to your bed and having it perfectly cozy from the first day we talked. 

\---My parents advice was to wait. It's the pandemic and we can't do anything about it either way because she literally is on the other side of the world. They told me just to wait and see what happens, assuming it would fizzle out and die. 

That hasn't happened and is scares me more and more as this goes on. I can't keep doing this to my wife. She's my best friend and to say I've cried a dozen times already about the idea of how badly this will hurt her and myself is an understatement. But I can't keep living trying to fit in the mould everyone has put me in. I've recently lost a close friend and a brother and it's clear that life is too short to live my life for everyone else around me. 

If I stay with my wife I'm sure I could be happy, but not nearly as happy as I would be with my soulmate. Choosing my soulmates means I literally lose everything and minimally dramatically change world. A move to the other side of the world. The circumference of the Earth is 40,075 km long and they are 17,097 km away.

195,"Hi everyone

I am very frustrated and need some insight. 

My(16F) father is travelling to South America this Friday, by himself. It is not essential and he is not exempt from the quarantine rules. We live in Ontario, Canada, and are currently in a strict lockdown where travellers must quarantine for 14 days (I believe). 

In my house there is me, my dad, and my little sister. Although my dad has his room &amp; bathroom on a different floor, he is still saying he will be coming upstairs to the kitchen / living room during his quarantine. He also is trying to make us believe he only needs to quarantine for 5 days, opposed to the 14 days im reading on the government website. I am extremely anxious, as I do not want to have to quarantine too. I need to buy groceries and work. My boyfriend and I do not live together so that would also mean not seeing him for 2 weeks, which sucks because I’m not the one travelling and putting my household at risk. 

My dad is also saying how he will leave the house during his quarantine, to go to the air strip and his business.. where he would more than likely come into contact with and talk to people. 

I have suggested him staying at the Covid Hotel in Toronto multiple times, but he refuses. 

I AM NOT able to quarantine (strictly, like not going to the store and not driving), and I have taken all of the precautions to make sure that possible. 

I just know he will sneak upstairs onto the main level without us knowing, and that makes me so anxious. What can I do? I really need him to stay somewhere else, and the COVID Hotel seems like a great option as he’s flying into Toronto anyways.",30Dec2020,1
196,"Sorry in advance if this text is a little whack, english is my second language, but i'm trying my best :(


So to put this whole thing on context, a few months ago my mentally ill brother (he has depression and avoidant personality disorder) had an anger attack. He attacked my dad and i was involved, resulting in a fractured pinky. It was really traumatizing because he locked himself in the bathroom and i thought he was going to commit suicide, but when we got the key and got in, he attacked my dad.

He got into a psychiatric ward and got better since, but i think what happened affected me.

The other day he was having an anxiety attack, and we where calming him down and trying to support him. He was crying so he went to the bathroom for some kleenex. My body immediately went into fight or flight, my mind rushed thinking what to do if he locked himself up. I was so stressed (mind u he was in there just for a few minutes) and i was in the verge of a panic attack. When he came out i couldn't even finish my breakfast because i was really nauseous and wanted to throw up.

Today we where going to the store, and my dad was watering the grass. I was talking to him in the garden while my brother went inside looking for something he forgot, when he came back, my dad jokingly sprayed him with the hose. He laughed and rushed to tickle him. But once again, idk what happened to me, but i tried to stop him and grab him because i felt danger, he was confused because it was all a joke but i broke in tears asking him to never do that again and then i started crying because i got so scared.

I feel guilty, i don't want it to be like this and i don't understand what is happening to me. I feel like everytime i do things like this, i'm making my brother feel guilty for something that was not his fault.

What is happening to me? Is this a trauma response? How do i stop this? Thank u guys for reading and i hope y'all can give some advice, ily.",30Dec2020,1

2 and a half(?) years ago at age 17, I  found out that my mom was cheating on my dad. As far as I know now, this affair is still on going. For a year at that point, she would up and go sporadically on  ""weekend getaways"" with her ""girlfriends"", leaving my sister, my dad and I alone at home either without a warning, or a warning 12 hours in advance of her leaving. This was frustrating enough. Finding out about the truth was even more difficult. I cannot even describe how broken I was the night I found out. I decided that it was better for everyone if I just kept the truth to myself. On one hand, I especially wanted to shield my sister from this information that absolutely ruined me. On the other, I could not live with the idea of me being the one delivering this family-ending news to my father.  Thinking back on it, I really fucking held it together. I started to grow incredibly angry at my mother (for what seemed to her to be for no reason), but I think it was warranted. 

This was during my senior year of high school, and I thought, you know what, soon I'll be off to college in a different country, and I won't even have to deal with my family in such closeness. I quickly realized in my 1st year of uni that this was far from the truth. Shit like this really haunts you every waking second, even when it's not totally on your mind. 

I've realized that I get easily paranoid of my boyfriend cheating on me, even though I logically know he wouldn't. I grow easily irritable towards members of my family over little things. I spiral into my anxiety more than I did before all of this has happened (which was a moderate amount already)! I don't want to be so easily irritable. I don't want to feel so numb anymore. I don't want to feel like I'm constantly holding myself on a tightrope, expecting shit to hit the fan the next step I take.

So, my friend lives about a province or two away, and their birthday is coming up. We usually we mail each other gifts.

The issue being that this year my friend never sent me anything for my birthday, nor did they send anything for Christmas.

It’s not so much that I care about getting a gift, it’s just that I’m not sure if I should send a gift to them considering they didn’t send one for mine.

They do have a daughter, and they do have a boyfriend, but as far as I know they should have been able to send something. Maybe they forgot to tell me that they can’t send one, but either way it doesn’t feel very nice not to receive the gift when I’ve been sending them ones. 

They did say happy birthday, so I’m not too upset, but I still don’t know if I should send them a gift… if I don’t I’m worried it’ll make our friendship worse, but I’m worried if I do I’ll have the same results.

208,"All names presented are fake. This may be a long-ish story. 

Tonight, myself and two friends were hanging out. We ended up prank-calling guys we knew and telling them they had gotten someone pregnant. It was a silly joke, no one really fell for it, no harm done, etc. At one point my one friend walked away, at which point my other friend Ash said “I really wish I still had Joe’s number, I really want to prank call him.” Hearing this sort of took me by surprise, because Joe was Ash’s ex who had been emotionally manipulative/abusive in their relationship. I asked Ash if they were sure, or I said “really?”, or something to that effect. Ash said yes, so I texted them Joe’s number. Doing so was a mistake, and I definitely should’ve refused, but it was too late. Ash typed in the number for the call (along with *67, so there would be no caller ID) and was going to be the one speaking on it, but when Joe picked up, Ash was completely silent and hung up after a few seconds. I asked if Ash if they were okay, and they insisted that yes, they were. My other friend came back in the room then, and the whole thing was sort of forgotten. 

Later on in the night I caught a glimpse of Ash’s phone. I wasn’t deliberately looking, but I just happened to see the screen for a moment. I could see that Ash had texted Joe — without *67 or any way to block their ID — a simple “Hi.”

I don’t like this at all. Joe was horrible to Ash, and I don’t want them getting back together because I don’t want Ash being treated that way again. The idea that the two of them start talking again, and I was the one who enabled it, is unacceptable to me. 

So now I need to reach out to Ash... right? I should say something like “I caught a glimpse of your phone and I saw you texted Joe and I really don’t think that’s someone you should be talking to, I care about you and don’t want you to be mistreated,” etc etc. That would be good, right? I’m just afraid Ash will be mad — maybe they’ll think I looked at their phone deliberately, maybe they’ll blow up and tell me to let them make their own mistakes, tell me not to micromanage their life... I don’t know. Would it be better if I just left it, pretending I never saw anything? What if the little glimpse I had of the phone screen was so brief that I misinterpreted what I saw, and the message had been sent to someone else or something? I’d really just like some guidance on this. Thanks",30Dec2020,1

212,"I’ve got a lot of deeper issues but on the surface my life seems pretty great, but it’s difficult for me to discuss my issues. 

Anyways, recently I’ve had a negative dating experience that’s really occupied my mind and I decided to see a therapist. It’s over video chat due to covid.

I’ve had 2 sessions with her and I’m left feeling like she just tells me generic things and I’m the one who has to keep the conversation going. Is this normal?
I was trying to tell her the details of this dating experience and she seemed uninterested while I was speaking about it. I mean she did give some logical advice which are things I also tell myself, but I just didn’t feel good or connected with her I guess. 

I’m sort of looking for someone who will really pay attention to what I’m saying and do a deep dive into things so I can really unpack everything in my life. Is that something a therapist should normally do or how do I know if I find a good one?",30Dec2020,1
213,"Back in 2018, I started to like a girl from my class and proceeded to get closer to her. The year ended, so I had to wait for 2019, when I got a lot closer to her and her bff. Her bff probably knew about it and helped me a few times. There was a day in which we were going back home by subway, and her bff arranges things so that the girl I liked and I had some time to talk; I kind of messed up because I was nervous, and I just distanced myself from them for a few months, which suppressed or killed those feelings I had for her.

Fast-forward to 2020, and I'm in university not having any contact anymore with that girl. That was until a few days ago, when I was having some fun with some friends, and I jokingly said I'd request to follow her on Instagram; they dared me, and, as someone that likes to make others laugh (even at my own expense), I did it. She accepted right away, and followed me back, which surprised me, because I thought, after the subway situation, she wouldn't even want to even hear about me anymore.

That got me questioning the whole thing that happened in 2019, and nothing made any kind of sense anymore. I tend to imagine scenarios in my mind for amusement, acting and analysing purposes, so this case was not going to be different: I imagined a scenario in which I asked her about the whole subway situation to maybe understand the whole thing better, but my ""script machine"" broke, and I couldn't think of a response, so it started to torment me.
At first, it was just curiosity, but I think it, since the last few days, has evoked a bit more than just that. I think it has gotten me to slightly like her as I used to a year ago. 

I'm not sure if I want to have anything with her, but I really don't know what to do; these thoughts keep annoying me, and they have become more frequent. I appreciate any kind of advice.",30Dec2020,1

215,"Hello, to whoever is reading this. I'm not sure if this is the right place to post, but at the moment I don't feel as though I have anywhere else. As the title suggests, I have simply just lost the ability to feel happy, and I have no one that sees me as a genuine friend. I don't have plans for New Years, and this is the first time of my 25 years alive that I will be alone to ring in the new year. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I put myself ahead a couple days, and imagine myself alone in my bedroom, doing nothing, on the most social night of the year - I feel pathetic, and I also feel like I will want to finally kill myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have no one to blame really for being in this position as I have made many, many mistakes over the past few years. I am very depressed and have been for about 4 years now. At this point I feel like it's a chronic illness for me. I have a bad personality and a mean spirit, and I am an alcoholic who, despite knowing this, has made no real effort to quit drinking. There have been countless nights where I have have gotten too drunk and been a complete prick to the people closest to me. I have done this enough to where I have lost all of my friend groups. I don't possess the ability to make new friends, and basically every person that I have met since the beginning of college was through a mutual friend. I am asexual, which has made dating extremely difficult.

&amp;#x200B;

Back in college, I felt extremely alive and optimistic for the future; every day felt like it had a purpose and that I was contributing to something great that was going to come to me if I just kept going. Now, after graduating and being a working man for a couple years, I am at the lowest point in my mental health that I have ever been. Every day is the same, nothing new. No excitement, no new people, no love. Just work, alcohol, weed, video games. The only thing that remotely makes me happy and motivated is playing music, which I do as much as I can but I guess it's just not enough. Every day just feels like a battle to get to the evening, so that I can slump in the darkness of my bedroom and get drunk/high and stare into my phone until 1 AM when I finally pass out to do it all over again the next day. Really, I think at this point that I would have already committed suicide if it wasn't for my family, who I think would be sad if I did. I have come very close this year, though.

&amp;#x200B;

This has sort of become a pity party, I'm sorry. I guess I just wanted to give some context, and ask for genuine advice from anyone who has been in this sort of hole themselves. If that's you, and you managed to climb out of it and feel happy again - please, tell me how.",30Dec2020,1

225,"I didn't find my close friends until I was 11. We'll call my two close friends from when I was 11-15 Jo and Tab. Tab, Jo, and I were amazing friends looking back I had most of my best memories with them up until highschool. Tab moved away to another state for half a year in 9th grade so Jo and I hung out all the time. When Tab came back we were all close again until the summer going into sophomore year.

I had started dating my bf who I'm still with now that I'm 22. Tab and Jo were pissed that my time with them was being taken away, they were jealous. So they started hanging out without me, they would let me know how much they hated my bf. They one day decided to bully me and break off their friendship with me. I made friends with my bf's friends that year. Junior year came around Jo and Tab got in a big fight and broke off their friendship for good so Jo latched onto me. Apologized, we became friends for a few months until Senior year when I hung out with Tab. Jo didn't like that I was hanging out with Tab so she broke off her friendship with me. Tab and I remain loose friends throughout HS. Jo apologized again and said she was wrong for ending our friendship over Tab.

While I did have my bf and his friends in HS they were like brothers honestly. We were like a family and I was the only girl. I didn't have any other girlfriends, I tried but never had friends as close as Tab and Jo. My problem is I was so on and off with them we never got to connect like we used to in middle school. And while they were being on and off friends with me in HS I was being bullied by a popular girl and her friends. I was alone other than my bf. I only hung out with him and his friends and I haven't made any new ones. Now my friendship with Tab and my bfs friend are fizzing out.

Whenever Tab and I hung out we used to do things. We would watch movies, go on little dates, make up dances, do eachothers makeup and hair, play video games, listen to music, etc. One time I came over to her house and we glued carpet back together that her dog chewed up and had fun.

We had a friendship. Now when she comes over it's like it's dreaded. I don't know how to connect or hang out like we used to, and we just end up talking most of the time until she leaves. I don't think it's that we can't do those things because I know our relationship is still there. But issues around it are the problem. I live with my bf and his parents. Him and I are planning on moving out soon but we haven't yet because we haven't had high enough paying jobs to do so. Tab expressed to me back in 2017 when I lived with my grandma how she hated coming over because we couldn't do anything with them around but sit and talk. She was right though.

I think the same thing is happening at my bf's house. Her and I get no alone time together because my bf's parents or my bf is always home. His parents have a major boundary issue too and get in my business when it's not necessary. I also think there's the issue of I don't know how to hang out like ""adults"" do.

What do people in their 20's do when hanging out with friends?? Idfk! The last time her and her bf came over it was so awkward. I invited them in, they sat down. We were silent for a few but I oddly made conversation. We had a few laughs and then they we're like well it's time to go! She recently had dinner with her neighbors and it looked like they had fun. They all made dinner together and had a feast. I can't do that at my home because my bf's parents. Not to mention the house is filled with trash and super messy because the only way it will get clean is if my bf and I clean up their mess for them. (that's a whole other issue and a reason my bf and I are moving out). I'm kind of freaking out because her and her bf are coming over tomorrow and I don't want it to be awkward again.

I think hearing it also turned me off completely to ever trusting someone enough to be in a relationship. Even at 13 I was like “that’s rape, that’s not good.” But because I was a kid I didn’t connect the implications and I kinda moved on and forgot about it. However, as an adult, it makes me sick.

236,"I am 17, a senior in high school, and I have been working at Burger King for about 3 months now. The manager I work with is a really nice person and I also work with a few friends of mine.

However, there are a lot of sketchy or pointless things I’ve experienced working here:

- The company overall seems to lie and exploit employees in small ways, like promoting my manager to assistant general manager but her having kept the same pay as the manager position, or minors being mysteriously clocked out for 30min but not being given a break (this happened twice and the general manager said it was an system error), or make aloof decisions like investing in new wiring and a $1000 new ice cream machine when the restaurant building is set to be completely demolished and rebuilt in a few months.

- Schedule changes are never communicated to me and I’m never consulted with when my time was changed or I’m taken off a day. Like, I get that the manager might have too many people scheduled on a certain day so he takes me off, but I would at least like an explanation why. And sometimes during my shift there’s not enough people scheduled which makes things harder for all of us working during that shift. One time my time for one day of the week was changed from my usual 9am-2pm instead to 2pm-5pm. Being used to always coming in at 9, I did just that and ended up having to stay until 5 because I was needed to stay. I was annoyed by this since I had stuff planned later to do that day and I came into work that day only expecting to work 5hrs, and ended up working 8hrs.

- One time I was asked to come in on my day off to work because they needed one more person, so I did. When my shift was supposed to end at 3pm, there was apparently no one else scheduled from 3pm-4pm except just one manager, so I offered to stay longer. On top of this, I had to learn how to use the headset without ever using it before and handle a whole fast food restaurant with just one other person, that means I was making drinks, working at the cashier, putting food in bags, serving food out the window, and dealing with customers all simultaneously (I swear I was only able to do this because I had taken an adhd pill I bought from a friend before my shift and it was basically adderall, called vyvanse, I don’t have adhd I was just taking it for it’s stimulant effects, don’t judge me I’ve only done it 3 times) Anyway I ended up staying until 5 (this time out of my own will). Later during this shift it was just me and two other people working and three workers in the break room sitting around doing nothing during their shift. My friend was the only one working at the food station and it was only me and another worker tending to everything else. My friend and I told the GM about this but as far as I know nothing was done about it, the manager I usually work with says night shift is always like that and hates working with them. After this shift though, I got a text from my general manager saying he submitted a pay raise for me due to my help that day. I was excited, however after around 50 days I have still heard nothing in regards to this raise. I assume it was not approved by the higher ups of the company but still it seemed obvious it wasn’t going to be approved, considering I’m only 17 and had been working there for only almost two months at that point. Makes me wonder why even telling me something like that in the first place, getting my hopes up for nothing.

- A friend of mine who was working there before me for about two months prior started with a pay of $9/hour for weekend shifts (she works 7am - 2pm) whereas I started at $10/hr (the explanation for this pay was because I was taking up a lunch shift which GM really needed positions for. The thing is, my friend still only makes $9/hr. I’ve worked weekend shifts before with her and it’s literally the exact same work as during a lunch shift, so she’s being paid a whole dollar/hr less than me for the exact same work. Is this even legal?

- During a health inspection, we somehow passed with an 88, which really seemed weird to me considering how I had just worked a shift at a different BK location (a much cleaner and more rule following BK than the one I usually work at) which also had a health inspection and only passed with a 68. Then my coworkers and I came to learn that the GM and the health inspector knew each other because they used to work together. Can’t help but think that’s what got us such a high score even though we had a lot of violations.

- We are forced to use these container things for taking cash and handing out food due to the COVID pandemic, but these precautions literally make no sense, just make things slower, and cause unnecessary problems. Once a customer drops their payment into the container, you have to handle the payment anyway in order to cash them out. Often there’s many old people that come through the drive thru and they often have shaky or weak hands which leads to them having trouble getting their bags of food, drinks, payment, etc out of the container. And we also have to keep the window times low and due to the containers they add on an unnecessary amount of time making it hard to meet time goals. Just overall a bad idea, I usually don’t use them 100% of the time but the owner watches the cameras sometimes and will report the manager who was working during a shift where a worker wasn’t using the containers (this happened before).

- My friend who worked here before me, same friend who only makes $9/hr, got 4 other people to apply for a job (including me) but has not gotten any sort of cash bonus for it. I believe a cash bonus was promised.

- I chose to have my money deposited into a pay card provided to me by the company, but there’s no way for me to check my paystub to see how much is being deducted and make sure my hours match my pay. My manager I work with said that the GM was supposed to give me a certain website and account info to be able to access that info but I was never given it, as far as I know.

I’m not exactly sure how unions work but from what I know about them, it’s something workers form to protect them if their employer tries to screw them over in any way. I plan to quit BK soon anyway and find a job that suits me better, but before I leave I want to see if I’m able to affect any real change because there’s people there that work there to put food on the table for their families.

Am I justified for wanting to unionize my workplace? And how would I go about doing so and/or how would I start?",30Dec2020,1

239,"TL;DR: How can I stop my bias/negative thoughts and emotions stop me from listening to valuable criticism and having a civil conversation? The story of this question is below (so read that if you want context on why I'm asking the question) but the story kind of dragged and this feels like the advice I might get could be applied in other, more useful ways.

STORY:
I watch the content of the youtuber DaftPina every now and then, specifically his criticism on animation youtubers (because those are often the channels I find myself watching), I hate what he said in these videos and always tried to find some way to argue against the things that he brought up. DaftPina recently (2 hours ago as of the time this post was made) made a video about the Odd1sOut (which was the first animation channel I watched and was the gateway into my current favorite type of YouTube videos) called ""Hidden Hypocrisy"", it popped up into my recommended list and so, thinking it was about how he said he didn't like mobile ads and still put them in his game, I clicked on the video. It wasn't long into the video when I noticed him bringing up valid points and, as I tried to find arguments for them, I realized that I had let my bias stop me from actually listening to what he was saying. I don't want that to happen again and so I want to know: how can I discard my bias when talking about or listening to others talk about these types of things?",30Dec2020,1

245,"Hi all, (sorry for bad formatting I’m on mobile and I don’t really post a lot on Reddit)

So I’m 17 Male and the girl I’ve been talking to almost every day is 16. I live in Texas and she lives in Missouri (yes I know). 

We met through mutual friends on tiktok and we just clicked from the beginning, with us having SO MUCH in common. The only things that are majorly different about us is our distance and religion (I’m Christian, she’s Muslim, and we’re both ethnically Iraqi, and we don’t really talk about religion). 

We met in mid September and it’s been such a blast honestly, from flirting with each other, to talking about what we’d do when we meet in person someday. Even near the beginning when I’d sometimes leave her on delivered due to me being busy with some things or just not trying to look desperate, she’d text me on insta AND iMessage asking where I am in a cutesy way, and not gonna lie it felt great knowing that this is the first time anyone’s done that to me. 

But for about the past week or a little longer, she started being more distant, and occasionally I’d ask her how she’s feeling and that I’m always gonna be there for her to talk about anything. She would usually say she’s fine or good, but then a couple days later she told me “I’ve been more distant because of family back home in Iraq. It’s not you or anything it was just that.”

So obviously I did feel some relief, however she would never say what exactly was happening (I never pryed, just once asked if she’d like to talk about it and she said no and that it’s too complicated so she just changed the subject). But even after this, she’s still acting the same way, sometimes even worse. Leaving me on delivered more, saying she has to nap more often, and just not having a lot of the same energy when texting. (Also I usually text her first, saying good morning and how’d you sleep, and a lot of the time I respond back quicker than I should so that might also be a factor idk)

Even if I try flirting or trying to get spirits up, she’s just not into it and just says LMAOOO followed by “wydddd” or maybe is into it for around 10 seconds then leaves me on delivered again for a while, leaving us to move on to another subject. 

I’ve also told her that if she needs time away, she’s free to do that, but she said no to that so that also gave me a bit of relief at least.

Now I have conflicting feelings on what to do: either keep acting normally and just hope to God things can go back to before, or should I try taking steps to end it or to also be more distant like her.

Any tips would be appreciated, and I apologize for the long wall of text. Thank you",30Dec2020,1
246,"Bit of background, I’m 15 and I love writing stories and have been doing it since I was as young as 3, I’ve been told that I’m good at it. Pretty much every story I’ve ever made is a part of a really giant connected universe I’ve sort of made throughout my entire life. The characters of these stories are often anthropomorphic animals, living food and other inanimate made animate.

Ok so this is where things get weird. I really wish I was a cat character in my world. Not like a self insert character sense but literally live in my world as myself but just in a different body. I know it’s impossible but I do often wish that I lived in my world.

As for the cat part, I’ve always felt a strange sort of connection with cats ever since I was really little. I feel like I share come common personality traits among them and just feel way more attached to them than any other animal. I guess the best way to put it is that if reincarnation was a real thing, I would’ve 100% been a cat in my past life. I look at myself in the mirror and feel sad simply because I’m human.

I sometimes find art to prettier than real life. Some drawings and paintings just like better than real life does, granted I don’t live nearby anything super interesting. There’s something about art both drawn and written that I find more beautiful than real life.

I honestly have no clue how to bring this up to my therapist. She knows I like writing but I can’t say: “I wish I was an anthropomorphic cat in my fantasy world I’ve been expanding my entire life.” That’s just weird. No clue what to do about it without coming off as crazy or weird as fuck. It’s kinda my darkest secret.",30Dec2020,1
247,"Hi all, if you can't tell based on how youthful and naive this whole thing is, this is written in the point of view of a highschooler.

I've yet to have a girlfriend. I'm 17. It's not embarrassing, I've just either had rotten luck with one specific girl or haven't been interested in dating. But everything was shaping up until the shittiest thing happened.

This girl I began talking to was met through mutual friends. She began flirting with me and I felt a chemistry between us. Eventually, I reveal to her my true feelings and she agrees, she has them too. Today, I hung out with her alone for the first time and it went well. She told her friends she really had fun with me and it was a good time. We planned a date in the future.

Fast forward to tonight. (Context: she broke up with her 3 year relationship boyfriend who was her first love a little while ago, don't know specifics just know it was semi recent but not within the past few months.) she tells me she had a great time and it's not me but she's not comfortable being in a relationship right now and she's just not prepared for the mental toll. At first, I was hurt and reacted a bit angrily just because it felt like she led me on. Then I came to my senses and I told her we can still hang out as friends (as she suggested) and just see how we do together. She said who knows what will happen down the road.

My questions here:

From personal experience, how did you recover from your first love. What helped, how long did it take, etc. I want to understand her situation better so I can just understand OUR situation better.

Should I still go for her? Not in a pushy way. Not in a flirtatious way. Just talk as friends, get to know eachother, and see if she becomes ready for a relationship?

Is there no hope? She said she did really like me and told her friends she'd get with me in the drop of a hat, she was really into me, had a good time.


Truth is, I like this girl. I really still want things to work but I don't wanna be creepy and pressure her to do something she's not comfortable with. 

Please, someone help me out. Could be a teen or an adult with true life experience.",30Dec2020,1

251,"Very briefly, I'm in an orchestra that now operates online. The conductor makes videos of himself conducting to which we record ourselves playing. He also plays his own flute so there's some audio to accompany his conducting. The problem is that his conducting is wrong (he's not a formally trained conductor, he just likes music). I can't add too much musical jargon, but basically he randomly speeds up or slows down when he should be maintaing a steady tempo (speed). As a player, it's really hard to follow and also frustrating, because I'm conscious that we're all speeding up when we shouldn't be. It's like if you had to deliberately write down the wrong answer on a test despite knowing it's wrong.

I want to suggest to him that he should practice conducting to a professional recording. If he follows it strictly, there's no way for him to get sidetracked by anything. However, I can't think of a way to say this without coming off as rude. No matter how I say it, I would have to tell him that his conducting is incorrect, and that's bound to hurt feelings.

259,"So I’m a19yr old, who hates their dad. My dad was never really around growing up. He travel a lot for his job so he would usually be in town for a day or two at most. The only time where he would pay attention to me was when he grounded me or told me how dumb and useless I was. Anytime I would show emotion he would get angry. If I even shed one tear he would scream at me. I could never be around my mom when he was around. He would get furious if I tried getting her attention away from him. In my early teens years my dad started to get my mom to tag along with him while he travel leaving my brothers and I behind at home. Eventually my dad had to moved a few hrs away for work and my mom, older brother ,and I stay behind. At the same time my dad had promise my aunt that him and my mom would care for my two younger cousins for a year while they went to school here. But thing is that my dad realized he need my mom to go live with him bc he needed someone to cook and clean for him. So originally, plan was for my mom to look after my cousins and make sure they did well in school but it led to me doing that as a freshmen in high school. my older brother wasn’t around much bc he was a full time college student and employee.  So he wouldn’t check up on me or let alone my parents to make sure I was doing well in class or even if I was going to school at all. I had to do all the cleaning and cooking at home on top of taking care of those two kids. I almost never had time to sleep nor eat. I had to constant clean and cook food for everyone. Every time my parents visited us my dad would point out anything and everything I did or did not do correctly. I almost fail freshmen year bc I couldn’t keep up with school work. My dad made me drop out of softball and marching band bc he said those were unnecessary distractions and that I needed to be at home. I finally had enough with everything and had a breakdown and begging for my mom to come home and stay with me but my dad just told me how ungrateful and selfish I was. I was ruining everything for them. No one will ever want me with me if I had that attitude. My mom didn’t say a word to me for days. Since then I never complained about the situation. I bottle up all my emotions never letting anyone in. I started to develop severe anxiety and depression. After a while we all started to live together again but I soon realize my parents were only looking after my brothers. My parents never checked on me if I was doing well in school nor personally. Only time they talk to me was when i did something wrong or to tell me my brother was better than me. Fast forward to me being in college now being extremely independent from my parents, they are now trying to get involved in my personal life. My mom is a lot more welcoming and warm than she was in my younger years. Yet I constantly have to remind my dad about basic things he should already know bc his my parent. He doesn’t remember what college I go to let alone my major. He doesn’t remember that I’m vegetarian nor that I have food allergies. Literally he doesn’t remember the bare minimum. Yet he manages to remember every detail of my brothers childhood and such. It is a known fact between my parents that I have severe anxiety but my dad says I’m just acting out bc I’m a spoil brat. But at the same he drops everything for my brother whenever he shows any signs of distress. It is painfully obvious that my brother is my dad favorite while my other oldest brother is my moms. Which leads to me being left out all the time. I have so much anger built up from being emotionally abandoned from a young age to being constantly gaslighted, etc. I just don’t know how to deal with this anger that appears every time I’m near my dad. My old therapist said to me that maybe me being emotionally abandoned at a young age led me to become an independent adult and just maybe I should be thankful for it.

262,"So I started working for the first time ever in my life 4 months ago. Out of all the days I’ve worked, most of the situations and concern I’ve had had, had been with getting better at my job, and fixing simple mistakes. However today, I dealt with my first “Karen” this woman was a pretty common customer, so I treated her as I usually do when I see regulars I remember. She wasn’t rude to me at all, and was understand of everything I was doing. (She ordered a huge order of food and drinks, so it was taking so time) well she paid strictly in gift cards, and in our system it’s a long process to put in $50 worth of cards  quickly. 

Anyhow, all was well, cards were used and she received all her items correctly, and efficiently. However, she returned maybe not even 20 mins later to complain we owed her money. (I’m not going to go into detail of what exactly happened). But through the process of fixing her complaint, she screamed at me and said I was too stupid to be working at the DT window, and I shouldn’t even work this job if I can’t handle gift cards. 

I’m not a wimp or one to back off easily, but I’ve never been screamed at like that, other than the times I’ve been GENUINELY wrong, like I terribly MESSED. UP. And when I do, obviously I understand I’m in the wrong and I don’t make the same mistake. (Life lesson kinda deal)

But this was different. I didn’t mess up big time, I didn’t do anything wrong. It was one of those in the moment mishaps and the lack of patience and understanding of this woman. Normally I could resolve this with “My apologies ma’am, allow me to refund you  and fix your order.” But that wasn’t enough, and it’s hard enough to say this calmly while being told I’m too stupid for my job. It’s been a few hours since this has happened, and I’m just not able to get over it for some reason, it’s just upset me so much. I know it’s no big deal, that I just need to breath, and get over this common occurrence that happens to almost everyone at some point. But what can I do if this happens again?

TL:DR-
Nasty Karen flips shit, and it’s my first time dealing with it, how do I get over it and be more prepared if it happens again with other people, or even her?

264,"  

Background story, I got into a graveyard shift call center job for a health insurance company about 3 months ago and in the beginning it was pretty tough but I worked around it for a couple of weeks and we had excellent agent support that could help us around queries and navigation after training. This is actually the first time I have worked in my entire life. The first two months taking calls were stressful and we transitioned to a work from home set-up. The job doesn’t really have any much impact if you fail to do a few things, ( though I was very meticulous even if I took longer to end a call ). I used to sign people up into a plan in my department. I performed very well in my old department and had bonuses.  
   
 

Now, we got upskilled to another department (customer service), and we had training for two weeks and that’s it for such a vast scope of business. Working from home and relying on one agent support for 12 agents isn’t exactly ideal when calls come in. Now is the second day where I take actual calls in the new department, and I feel very scared and sick in my stomach. I don’t want to mess with people’s lives if I fail to educate them or if provide them the wrong information, medications and hospital care is between life and death. My pay is still the same despite of the increased difficulty.  
 

Don’t get me wrong, I am grateful that the company hired me even during the pandemic and, I enjoyed the job even if it was stressful at times, I love explaining how a certain plan works and conversing with the customers. But right now, I don’t want to jump into a chair, take calls, and half-ass everything. Now I can’t sleep and I dread working tonight, on top of that I’m very afraid that no call center company will hire me during this tough times, and it doesn’t help if my CV shows that quitted my first job after 3.5 months. Any input and advice would help me greatly, thank you so much.

Watching these films triggered excitement, sadness, happiness, but most of all, the concept of love and romance.  


Of course, I love my family and friends. However, this type of affection was different. I was well aware of the concept of love, but I never understood what it meant in that manner.

Duluth, MN: I would have $0 debt if I have a work-study position for the entire two years. Duluth seems small and isolated, and the winters seem remarkably awful.

Feel free to skip the rest of this if you don't want to indulge my mental illness

I have OCD as well, and that has made this particularly paralyzing. I research the AIR QUALITY of the areas. I will attempt to explain this:

Pollutants in air can damage your health, from your lungs to your brain, reducing physical and cognitive performance, causing dementia etc. Therefore, I want to choose a location with very clean air. I don't want a decreased IQ, or dementia and so on. I value my cognition, however great or pathetic it is, and my OCD focuses on this.

Particulate Matter is the principle cause of the health effects from polluted air, specifically at 2.5 microns and smaller, and its concentration in the air is measured in micrograms/cubic meter. 10 micrograms is where we begin to see statistically significant physical health effects, but a threshold does not appear to exist, at least for cognitive effects.

The background level of PM2.5 in the world ranges from 1-5mcg/m³, so you want something as close to this as possible. The World Health Organization states that they see health effects almost immediately beyond 5. Places like Los Angeles or Pittsburgh are ~12 every day. A place like Hawaii is 3-4. The Seattle area appears to average 5-8, depending in where you are(Bellevue is typically ~4-5 while inner Seattle is ~7, while Duluth appears to average 5.5-7, all depending on where you are.) I cannot find measurements AT the campuses of the schools, only in surrounding areas, and my OCD WANTS the exact measurements, so the uncertainty is paralyzing me. My mind fatasizes that I will never be great because I chose an area with a worse air quality, lowering my cognitive ability, and so on.

The Seattle school is within 300m of a major, busy highway, so my OCD makes me think that I shouldn't go there due to the possibility of poor air quality, even when it seems like a great choice, financially. This air quality problem has been potentially the sole reason that I haven't left yet, if not a major reason. I could have left last fall, and I did not specifically because I was not sure that the air quality was ""perfect"".

I feel like I'm insane.",30Dec2020,1

Earlier this summer, I started hanging out with an old friend more. We went out to lunch with our parents (as they are also good friends) and we hit it off really well. A few months after lunch, she matched with me on tinder. We texted often, and eventually I decided to ask her on a date with ""do you want to have dinner with me?"" and she responded with ""absolutely"". It was going to be my first date, so I was really excited and nervous. So we went on the ""date"" and about an hour in she asked me about how tinder was working for me. I was confused and just played along and said something like ""oh I deleted it"" and then she went on to tell me about all the people she's met on there. My heart just sunk right then and there and I wasn't the same the rest of the day. I thought I had been really clear. A few more months go by and we continue to text. She continued to be incredibly flirty and I fell for a version of her that was only made up in my head. I got sick of the game and asked her straight up if she liked me and she said something like ""you're not my type"". I stopped texting her three months back and she still tries to text me every now and then. I mean I was done with her and I just couldn't play this game with a girl I liked.

281,"This has been asked before and is somewhat of an update post but I’ve changed some perspectives. 


Long story short: I’ve been into her since we met about 5 months ago. It’s been very subtle and I haven’t made a move. I like her a lot. She’s ridiculously attractive and I’ve never felt more comfortable around a person in my life. She’s caught up on her NPD ex. 

We’ve slept in the same bed before and nothing happened. We got trashed together two weeks ago. Ran into her ex. About 6 hours later, as I was falling asleep, she grabbed my thigh and we started having sex.

The next morning she told me she doesn’t casually hook up with friends, and I said I liked her, but it’s not a big deal if she doesn’t feel the same. She just said “why? I’m a mess?” I answered that “I’m just comfortable around you, and I like being around you.” Maybe that was dumb. It’s because I’m fucking crazy about her. I love being around her, I feel 100% like myself around her, I think her career is really hot, I like how she doesn’t take herself ridiculously seriously like anyone else in her shoes would, I love her mannerisms and how she has conversations, and I just want to be around her and be there with her. I’ve never been so attracted to the entirety of somebody in my entire life Maybe I should’ve told her that instead. But we were cuddling afterwards and I asked to kiss her, and she said no. She was just so casual about everything and I didn’t feel comfortable because I thought us having sex would’ve changed things but it didn’t seem that it did. 

Seemed pretty evident at the time that we just got drunk and banged. Not something I usually do, but I can read the writing on the wall and take the hint. 

We haven’t talked since. It’s been two weeks. I just don’t know what to say and feel bad that it wasn’t reciprocated. I’m friends with her roommate too and she usually will interact with me on social media/like my posts. Hasn’t since. I don’t think I did anything wrong. I guess the weirdest thing I did, still being drunk in the morning, I told her roommate I texted my therapist because I was so drunk. I just thought that I did was fucking hilarious at the time and she found it funny too. This occurred after I told her roommate “I like being friends with y’all, and I just hope I didn’t marginalize anything,” so it seemed like a funny way to end the conversation. Didn’t think it was a big deal, it probably isn’t and I’m overthinking things. 

So I’m moving only about a 15 minute walk from her and was going to have a housewarming party. I’d love for her and her roommate to come because prior, we were pretty good friends. I guess I can’t say we aren’t now, because we don’t usually text regularly. We usually only text to make plans. I just don’t know how to invite them/ not make a big deal going forward. 

Like I said, I’m crazy about her, but I can take a hint. Any advice?

tl;dr- I fucked my friend. Seemed like just another hookup to her. But I’m fucking in love with her and don’t know what to do.",30Dec2020,1

288,"Figured may as well shoot my shot and post both this here. At graduation, one of my scholarship's teacher's comments was that I was ""the most optimistic person"" she's met in 20 years. It was a trait everyone described me as, the next one being nice. Which didn't always end up well for me with some folk when I started to be a bit less of a doormat. I really enjoyed the fact I could be a good person to so many people, even if it was more of a ""fake it until you make it mentality"". With depression and anxiety there's so many intrusive thoughts that came with it, and I always tried to say the opposite of my mind or fake joke confidence for good events to come. I know HOW I used to be optimistic. 

  I think it's still important to me, and pessimistic behavior really worsens my mental health and being around it just as much. But God 2020 is bad. I was class of 2020, so that came crashing and burning just as much as my AP class grades did during it. The business start ups teacher's encouraged me to do became a waste of money. My partner is experiencing narcolepsy symtoms and had a cat die. My college classes just get tiring so quickly and are full of technical difficulties from being online. My mom got diagnosed with cancer. My sister is considering a divorce. All of things are so so terrible and it's just the big looming ones without the small bad things that pile up, since of living in America I haven't even seen anyone outside my household other then a few visits to see my 4 year old niece since March. At this point even saying ""things could be worse!"" just makes it sound in my head as ""yes, things will get worse."" Right now there's not even a particularly bad thing in sight, but there's nothing particularly good in sight either, just waiting for news about what's suddenly happening next. 

  I want to be optimistic. I want to be happy and nice to people, but I live in a rural town with high death rate right now and I'm at the point of glaring at too many people who don't wear their mask during groceries alone, being terrified of getting covid, and just waiting for what can happen next in the worst way. I know I see a lot of post like this here, but like I said, I've been in an optimistic mindset before. I can fake it to an extent still in conversation but I still feel terrible and I've given up trying to be optimistic with my household, my parents are just getting older and I know it's not looking good.

289,"First time posting, but I’m in a bit of a dilemma and thought it could help posting here.

TLDR: boyfriend and I want to move in together, but I’m worried it will cause long term tension with my parents. 

My 21(F) boyfriend 21(M) and I have been dating for three years and want to move in together this summer. We are in a very serious relationship and are planning on getting married in the next two years.
He just got a good job that would be able to support us both financially. I’m in my last year of undergrad and am unable to work that much because of my course load. He has always been very supportive of my schooling and wants to provide for me. We are both VERY excited about the prospect of living together.

The issue is my parents. I have a very good relationship with them. I am also extremely blessed by the fact they pay ALL of my tuition, books, and other college expenses. They have said they really like my boyfriend and understand (and support the idea) he will most likely be my husband one day. My parents and I are very honest with each other, and they have never brought up any issues with him or had any reservations about our relationship. 

But they don’t want us moving in together. They want us to wait until we’re married and after I’ve graduated university. Which is a fair opinion, but the way they talk about it just doesn’t make sense. My dad keeps saying that moving in together will be too stressful and my grades will suffer. He also thinks that people that live together who aren’t married have too many problems and their relationships fail, and sometimes even results in the police being called. 

I think both these things are BS? I think people can have a successful experience living together while dating, I don’t understand what will drastically change about this when we’re married. I just don’t understand what they think is going to change between this year and next year when I graduate? Why they think living together now is such a terribly and mortifying idea even though they are supportive of us getting married in the future? 

My parents said that either way they will continue to pay my tuition and books. But I’m worried that if my boyfriend and I move in together that my relationship with them will be strained and that my boyfriend will struggle continuing to build a relationship with them. I respect and value their opinions, but don’t believe they are complete fact. So the question is, should my boyfriend and I move in together against their wishes?",30Dec2020,1

297,"Will I ever not feel like a failure?

I’m 27 years old and I still haven’t finished undergrad. This is my third attempt at getting a degree and I still face the same struggles I always have. It’s been 10 years and I’m just so tired of failing over and over again. I want to find other people who struggle the way I do and get help but I don’t even know where to begin. A long time ago, I used to be good at school. I stopped getting good grades halfway through high school due to debilitating depression. I scored well on AP tests and the SATS and even got admitted to some good colleges but my parents decided I wasn’t ready for it because of my low GPA.

So instead, I went to community college for two years right out of high school, with hopes to transfer to a 4-year university. I was still depressed and hadn’t yet dealt with unresolved childhood trauma, so I was dissociating for most of those two years. I was zombie-walking through life and can’t remember a lot of it. I kept signing up for classes out of obligation and kept failing them because I couldn’t muster up energy to do the work. So in year 3 I just couldn’t keep up the pretense anymore and dropped out with a 1.7 GPA.

Then I moved away from my childhood home in an attempt to distance myself and went to culinary school. It was a 2 year program and I was supposed to get an AA. I loved it and was doing well and even had a job that I liked, but about halfway through the program I had some interpersonal conflict with some peers and couldn’t find the energy to show up to class anymore. I kept telling myself I’d go back in a week, but that turned into two weeks, then a month, then many months. My guilt and anxiety became so debilitating that I couldn’t get out of bed to do anything for months. After months of no-contact with the school or any peers I lied to my parents saying I had graduated. I went on to work in the culinary field and lived independently for a few years before I got into a car crash that set me back financially.

I moved back to live with my divorced Mom and decided to have another go at community college. I picked a major that I actually liked that wasn’t too challenging and tried to push through. Every semester it was the same story— I would sign up for 4 classes and only manage to pass 2 or 3 of them with good grades, while failing at least 1. Even if the subject material was interesting to me, I’d get overwhelmed about halfway through the semester and drop the ball on some assignment. Then I’d feel guilty about the missed assignment and stop showing up to that one class entirely, and then I’d stop doing all subsequent work for that class. It’s like a crazy snowball effect of bad time-management and anxiety and guilt. It’s like my brain thinks that if I just avoid it, the problem will go away. Online classes definitely exacerbated this issue without anyone physically around to hold me accountable, so I stopped doing those and only signed up for in-person lectures and classes. The only thing that sometimes proved to be helpful was having interesting teachers and making friends in class that I could meet up with to study together and get work done.

Somehow I miraculously managed to pull through with a 3.0 GPA and transferred to a 4-year uni this January with an AA. I moved to a new city. But then the same thing continued to happen here. My teachers love me initially and tell me I’m really smart, but somehow I always end up tail-spinning halfway through the semester. I shut down completely. And now I’m at risk for losing my financial aid and not graduating. I don’t know why my brain does this. Covid has been isolating and hard, yes, but at this point I’m tired of blaming my issues on external factors. 

Something ALWAYS comes up in my life that I am unable to work around. Like...changes in life shouldn’t be THIS debilitating. I can’t adapt or move on from minor emotional turbulences. I am sick of not functioning like everyone else I grew up around, who all are now well-settled into their careers. Why is it so much harder for me? Why can’t I deal with the pressure? Why do I always shut down like I do? What am I afraid of? Why can’t I succeed? How can I fix this? 

TLDR; I’m 27 and I just feel so useless and worthless and incapable of anything. I want to accomplish SOMETHING in life. I want to feel like I did something worthwhile. I want to finish college and prove that I’m not stupid, but I can’t stop self-sabotaging. I’m tired of being broken.",30Dec2020,1

I try connecting with a few friends more often, despite having very few friends to start with. I'm grateful for where I am in life, especially during a pandemic.

Thing is, living at home is awful with toxic and narcissistic parents where, without going into a therapy session right now, only see their kids on a return on investment. my dad always seems to underplay my success, saying i don't earn enough (i earn enough, trust me), i should have done a different field of work like engineering to make more money...etc etc. It really hurts my self esteem. My mother got significantly more religious this year, goes crazy with religion in the house, restricts us when it comes to food in particular, which sucks bc during a pandemic, the only thing you can do is have good food. She also has similar vibes of my dad, wanting more money, seeing their kids as a return on investment.

Finally, my sister [26f]. She has been unemployed for 2 years. seems to have lost motivation and opts to being a housewife. Its like i try to motivate her, but doesn't help. she gets defensive if i call her out on it. If i bring up my achievements in school this year (I'm proud of my performance and hardwork), she always has to being up how she doesn't have a job, and how i shouldn't complain. or if i tell her im feeling nervous about work, or anything related to it ( I can't even say im excited, nervous,..etc) she'll be like ""stop complaining, at least you have a fuckin job.

His parents and older sister only go to work; my parents hang out with neighbors and friends while my sister is on a club volleyball team, which she also hangs out with outside of practice with zero precautions (no distancing, no masks, etc.). I cannot handle the guilt of possibly infecting his family due to my family’s reckless behavior, but it has not been an easy feat. 

My days are getting blander and blander. I sleep longer, pushing 12 hours a night these days. I have little motivation to do simple tasks like making food for myself or showering. I have no motivation whatsoever to pursue my hobbies or complete projects that I have started, including most of my Christmas gifts for my friends. Every time I think about him and the time that we’re losing my heart sinks and I can’t help but cry. I know I can’t see him but I also have no clue how to make myself feel okay about it.

I’m sorry if this has turned into a self-pity post but I feel physically terrible at the moment. I needed a place to get my feelings out while simultaneously searching for answers. Thank you for reading if you have made it this far. 

TL;DR: Me and my partner are being kept apart due to COVID-19, and I’m not sure how to manage all of my sadness towards it.",30Dec2020,1
301,"Okay, so I (F14) have this friend who I met online who I was ten she was 14 at the time. We met up a bunch of times, so we've been friends for a good while but at the moment she is in a VERY toxic relationship with her girlfriend. Another thing is that SHE KNOWS THAT THE RELATIONSHIP IS TOXIC. She and her girlfriend are abusing each other, Physically and emotionally. She knows that her relationship is toxic and she is as well but she is choosing to stay and is getting married soon. I was invited but as someone, she always came to advise and never took it. I don't think I'm gonna go. I also think I'm about to cut off the friendship. She asks for advice and doesn't take it but always complains about her fiance abusing her and her abusing her fiance. I was born into a toxic relationship where my parents hated each other, so when my friend started talking about wanting kids. I just got a big pit in my stomach saying ""This isn't right, I don't like this anymore"". So now it's been a week since I spoke to her. I really I mean REALLY don't want anything to do with her now. I am willing to throw away 4 years of friendship down the drain, just like a snap of a finger if this keeps up. I've seen toxic relationships, and sometimes the person just can't get out and you help, but in this situation, I'm not gonna help. I just don't know what to do.",30Dec2020,1
302,"Am 19/F. 

When I was a kid, I would go through these phases where I would get really paranoid and start thinking I was being followed by people wanting to kidnap me. Every day, just a constant feeling of being watched. 

It fortunately went away with time, but I still find myself thinking people are out to get me. And I find myself getting involved in all these conspiracy theories on the internet. Especially with everything going on in the world right now. I am avoiding politics at all costs because I don't want to lose touch with reality and I really feel like that may be the direction I am headed.

I naturally do get paranoid easily due to anxiety. And I have major depressive disorder, which gets worse this time of year. It hasn't been too bad this year, but my anxiety is making everything worse. 

I had a problem at work recently where this guy was a little rude to me during a meeting, and it was like the camel that broke the straws back for me. Bc I started crying from all the stress I've been experiencing outside of work. Feeling lost, like I don't know what to believe anymore.

And because I made this big deal out of everything, I now feel paranoid that everyone at work thinks I am crazy and that they are all talking badly about me when I'm not around. Or that they'd rather get rid of me or not have me work there. And it sucks because I really love this job and this idea is ruining everything. 

But I'm scared to trust anyone at work anymore. I spend more time with them than my family, and its been 100% draining me and making me feel down. 

And then lately my brain keeps making up elaborate stories about people and things. And I'm sick of it because I want my brain to shut the fuck up. 

Does anyone relate? How do you deal? What do you do when you feel like this?",30Dec2020,1

305,"I'm 18 yo, M. I started medical school the last August, and obviously, this semester was online on zoom. Tbh I didn't feel very comfortable with my decision but I felt very excited cuz I like medical science a lot. It was very difficult for me to carry out the semester online, I felt very unmotivated to do it but I finished the god damn semester. It was awfully and demotivating to wake up every day just to pay attention to a damn screen, I could not do my best because of my lack of motivation. In the end, I failed 3 out of 12 subjects, and I thought, maybe if I couldn't do it, this is not for me. My parents don't know it yet, nor my girlfriend who is very important to me, nor a single family member. 
Tbh I don't want to disappoint my parents, girlfriend, and family members, including my girlfriend’s family. 
Now, you need to know something, I have lived on my own since I was like 15 yo, it is usual for me to be out of my comfort zone, and I’ve never passed through a situation like this before. I've always been my parent's proud cuz I use to be very independent and responsible, but this time, how do I tell my father that I made him waste his money with a failed attempt at one semester of medical school? 
Well, during last semester I had the opportunity to work on many things. It was not the first time in my life that I made my own money, but it was the first time that the pay was that high. 
Now, in the last 3 months, I've been experiencing some feeling. I want to be independent, and the sooner the best. I don't know if you understand me but I want to leave my parents home as soon as possible, but if I stay in the medical field that would take years, 6 years of medical schools plus two years of internship, and add another three or four years of medical specialty. I don’t wanna wait until I'm 30 yo to start my own life. I want my own life as soon as possible. However, I don't feel safe leaving medical school, sometimes I think it is a good idea but sometimes I don't. 

And I don't know what to do with my life. I have an idea, maybe I should pause medical school just for one semester to decide if I want it or not, and in the meantime, do as many things as possible, and get as many jobs as possible to know myself better, but I'm afraid of what my family and girlfriend may say or think.

I’m not too worried about it but I don’t know how the internet would react? Also, I had a bad phase when I was a teenager and I’d send compromising images to boys. However, I am not underage anymore and they are not either, so holding those images could get them in trouble, I believe.

310,"So it's Christmas, naturally families fight. But my brother (30) is driving me (17) mad, because he acts like a child. I also see that i am provoking him, but I don't know how to stop.

Here's an example: He doesn't believe in Corona, while we have a worldwide pandemic, while thousands of people die in hospitals. That's why I didn't want to hug him. Then he coughs in my direction. What a dick move. Later he argued it's because i didn't hug him that he felt insulted. I told him that not hugging and coughing in your face in a pandemic is not the fucking same thing. I started to cry and my parents explained him that that's not ok. He still thinks he's right. Also whenever I tell him he is wrong (which is what I like to do, but I know it's not good), he can't accept it. He hates to be wrong. 

Another situation: Our cat has asthma, so he picked him up. Before that our cat always ran from him because he just doesn't get when the cat is uncomfortable. He holds him like a baby, very tightly. Of course I couldn't ignore that and said that the cat wants to leave. He had big pupils and looked constantly at the door. I explained it, but my brother got defensive and thought that I don't like him to hold the cat. The cat ran away and he left too.

He still stays for a couple of days, but goddam what do I do? I know I shouldn't be so provocative, but I can't help it.",30Dec2020,1

312,"So uhm, to make the long story short, my cousins were here last night because we were practicing a role play we'd perform on New Year. So we were all happy and laughing and all. It was a great night. After Practice, one of my cousins and I played Genshin Impact and we were so into the game. The others started heating up water and even if they never asked for things, it was fine with me. I mean, what could be wrong with heating up water and making some coffee, right? And then fast forward everybody went home happily. 

  But when I was about to eat my snacks, I saw nothing else but crumbs. The box of cookies were emptied out and so is my small pack of biscuit I placed on the table. I felt disappointed because I didn't expect that they would eat literally everything and not leave us anything. They even drank the soda on the fridge. I know that they're my cousins but I think eating and drinking everything without permission is just too much. I told this to my cousin whom I played Genshin Impact with and she told me she would correct the others. 
They said sorry. But this morning, when I woke up, I figured that the whole ""news"" was scattered all around our relatives' compound and now my relatives are mad at me and my other cousin.

I continuously set myself back subconsciously by getting into chaotic nonsense that risk it all.

 I feel very deep inside of me that I don't deserve this life, almost like an imposter syndrome, despite how hard I have worked to get here. It's the same in relationships, I come across as super confident and charismatic, get the woman I want and then immediately feel like I don't deserve her and end up throwing it away.

314,"So let’s get this cleared up first, when I met her, we were both stupid kids. We met through Amino after I made a joke on one of her posts, and from there we became friends. As our friendship grew, that’s when the problems began. I don’t remember too much, it might be because my brain doesn’t want me to, but as we got closer, she began acting off. I don’t really know how to describe it, but she would kind of blow up at the tiniest things, when we would fight she would victimize herself to other people to try get them on her side, and at one point when I tried to end our friendship, she freaked out and I came back to her telling me that she self-harmed over me leaving. Later on, I started my own Amino for my friends and I so that we could hang out without risk of getting screwed over by the mods of the Amino we all met in. I of course added her in, but we were kind of on thin ice. She was pissed at me because I was kind of close with one of the dudes in our group, and we kind of fell apart for a bit, but we went back to being friends with each other (even dating for a little bit), and we kinda just vibed. A little while after we broke up, she left for a reason I forget why, but I knew that she had mentioned it was because of me. It tore me up, and honestly threw me into a depression. I felt like the worst person in the world. But after a while, she came back. She wasn’t pleased with me in the slightest, but went right back to her victimizing ways. I could tolerate that much, but it all ended when the guy friend I mentioned earlier sent me screenshots of her having talked behind my back to a friend of his. She told the friend that I was toxic and that I should kill myself, and it broke me. I gained the courage to ban her, but what she did left a lasting impression on me. During the first few months (I think) if she was even mentioned I would begin having an anxiety attack. Despite that, I was able to eventually forget about her. That is, until she recently commented on one of my posts on the amino where we met, and I lost it. I told my friends immediately, and they confronted her. I expected her to start victimizing herself, but she apologized. It was super unexpected, and kind of freaked me out. But I don’t know why, it made me think I would be able to let her back in and move on. I think I was wrong. When we let her into the amino I made, she told us that she apparently didn’t remember what she’d done. This pissed me off. It wasn’t fair that she got to forget the shit she did to me, the gaslighting, the emotional abuse and torment, all the sleep that I would never be able to get back from staying up to text her (we’re across the world from each other), and the anxiety and depression that she brought me into. She hasn’t done anything bad to me yet, but I don’t know why, the thought of her just being here and being able to chat with my friends like it’s nothing freaks me out. I think I want to remove her out of my life again, but I’m scared of what my friends will think. I just don’t think I’m ready to have her back in, but I don’t wanna take her away from my friends.

317,"This will probably get long...

I met my best friend as a Freshman in HS (lets call her Sarah) We instantly clicked and she came with a bonus- an awesome older sister who soon became one of my best friends as well. (Let's call her Lauren) These girls were my family and their parents were also a huge part of my life especially after my parents divorced and my mom died. Nearly 10 years go by and I have 2 children, Sarah is married and Lauren is engaged. Life is great! Everyone is going down their own healthy path and supporting one another a long the way.
 We are all getting ready for Laurens wedding at this beautiful venue. Sarah is the maid of honor and I am one of the brides maids. We are all getting ready and everyone is celebrating the wedding that is literally going to happen within a few minutes. Lauren is looking for Sarah and asks me to try and find her so we can start the ceremony. I grab my husband and we go searching for Sarah who I know is probably just putting on some last minute makeup in the bathroom. We reach the bathroom and I grab the knob to open the door (it's like a family bathroom) and it's locked..I think to myself..weird 🤔 I knock and yell her name and out of nowhere the door opened and Sarah runs past me and my husband and who do I see but Laurens soon to be husband still in the bathroom. He is obviously out of sorts and I instantly scream at Sarah and ask what the F is happening. She screams she doesn't know and the groom doesn't say a word. Im not stupid. Im not dumb. I know what was happening and I was completely broken. What am I suppose to do? Both of these girls are my family. My chosen blood. My sisters and...this? Minutes before he is supposed to mary Lauren? A complete and utter fucking nightmare. I have no words just tears and I walked away..Judge as you must but I never spoke a word of that moment and neither did Sarah. We watched the wedding, I went to bed and woke up and left before anyone got up the following day. I made up excuses and didn't see any of them face to face for weeks..
Weeks later I get a phonecall in the middle of the night from Lauren out of her mind bawling and screaming that her sister Sarah and her husband have been having an affair and are now leaving together. Long story short within a few short days Everything came out of the bag and now everyone's lives have been flipped upside down with this affair. Sarah ended up divorcing her husband for her sisters current husband and I am literally in limbo with both sisters. I try to keep both friendships but its impossible.
 The groom doesn't leave Lauren and Lauren stupidly allows it so he ends up seeing both sisters but convincing them both he isnt..its this disgusting 3 way thats filled with lies and I end up speaking my mind of how delusional this all is and the fact this man is toxic...they both end up completely stop talking to me and as of yesterday its been nearly 3 years since a word has been spoke to me. For the first time in 3 years Sarah calls me. She says her life has changed and would like to see me and invited me over to her new home and meet her new husband. She still doesn't talk to her sister Lauren but that Lauren is still with the POS. I agree to see her and as I pull into her house this evening I completely lost it and ended up leaving without even seeing her. The feeling of complete abandonment has hurt me in so many ways that I have no idea how to start over. I don't even know that I want to. I don't know her,  she doesn't know me...idk why I feel this way but my instant reaction is to run, run and never turn back...what would you do?",30Dec2020,1
318,"I know this might seem like a stupid question- but after the 3rd grade, I was pulled from public school and from that point forward never saw a doctor. For any reason. I don't remember ever having a physical, though I know I got vaccinated. My parents were very much anti doctor, so even after moving out, the fear of them remained. 

I have severe anxiety- the thought of walking in to a doctors office actually makes me cry. The only time I've gone to the ""doctor"" was to go to a 24 hour dental clinic, and only to have teeth pulled when I couldn't bear the pain anymore. However over the last year and a half my anxiety has begun to spread to other things too. I have so many questions about bumps and moles and everything else that I just need a doctor to listen and look and tell me ""No, completely normal, nothing to worry about."" Or if there is something wrong, I want them to find it now.

I'm also not sure how to tell the doctor these things. I know they're very busy people and they see so many other patients every day- I just feel like I'd waste their time. But I want to tell him that I'm scared and I want to be able to ask my questions, or the visit is pointless.

I know I rambled a bit but I just feel so unprepared and so scared of not knowing, scared of the doctor looking at me the same way my dentists have - disgusting and pathetic. I know I'm a bit overweight, I know my teeth aren't great, but I'm working on the things I can fix. I just know it'll break me if they're cruel.

For a few years it went away and I was able to express my emotions properly. Recently  I feel like I've gone back. I thought it was clear when I'm excited, annoyed, happy or sad but people tell me they cant catch on and that I'm oblivious to how people are coming off as well.

333,"(If you don’t want to read this unnecessarily long novel, the last sentence sort of sums things up)

Ok, so yeah I’m an idiot. I’m a freshman in high school and I was taking the hardest math test I’ve ever taken. My anxiety levels were higher than I’ve ever felt before, so naturally when I got a Snapchat notification from a kid in my class asking for my work, those anxiety levels heightened. I’ve known the kid for awhile, but it’s not like we’re best friends or anything. But, I helped the kid on a prior quiz and I figured why not, I was about to finish and he could probably use the help considering how much I struggled. So I sent him a picture of it, and that was that... until my teacher lectured us on academic honesty the class after. Now, because it was Christmas time, she decided to give “the cheaters” (she didn’t refer to us by name) the opportunity to come clean to her, and she wouldn’t contact our parents or the administration. We took her up on it. Now, she told us that we would be retaking it the day we got back from break, and that would be added to my grade for the test, which would be penalized for academic dishonesty (wow this is a very long post already, but just bear with me). Also, she mentioned that I really struggled on the test, which means I definitely did terrible, not something great for my B+ in the class. 

Okay, now that we have the backstory out of the way, let’s dive into the actual part of why I’m posting. So, I hold myself to a very high standard. My whole family (parents+two siblings) went to a very good college, and me, wanting to keep up the legacy, also wants to go there. Anyway, I have done pretty well in school thus far, and am in the highest level classes possible. I really want to keep a fairly high gpa (it isn’t gonna be a 4.0 because I kind of shit the bed on my sole normal class, history, and am going to get a B), but I’m worried that whatever grade I get on this test will make or break the grade for the class as a whole. I’m retaking the test on 1/4 and the semester ends on the 24th of January. What I really want to do is just do this retake and put it behind me, and hopefully keep my grade at a B, or maybe pull of a miracle and get a B+.

334,"We are a friend group of 8. Of which 2-Brie and Pam-have chosen to remain neutral and not voice their opinion. So the remaining 6 of us-Irene(17), Sam(18), Nat(18), Alex(18), Clover(18) and me are the ones involved in this.

Our friendship began in late 2018, and we became good friends, close enough to celebrate personal achievements, targets, so much so that we were friends with their parents too(at least I was/am). Sam has always been closer to Nat and Pam, Nat and Irene have a very good friendship, or so we thought, and Clover and Nat were travel buddies in school. I was and still am close to Alex and Clover, more than the others and maybe that’s why I’m in such a dilemma.

For some backstory I have had some not so good experiences with Nat, Sam and Pam. According to me Nat lies a lot over the smallest things and apologizes way too much-to the point that it becomes insincere. And Sam and Pam will choose their other friends/bfs over us at any given opportunity, and Sam plays the victim card a lot. For example- a few days ago, Sam and I met up(mask and all). We were taking a long walk around the neighborhood and I was purposefully avoiding a certain part cuz I thought her bf lived there(I genuinely wanted to spend time with her), so imagine my surprise when I found out that the area I took her too was where her bf lived. She told me that she had to text her mom that she is going to be a little late today, but sometime later she tells me that she hasn’t seen her bf in a week, and that he is currently downstairs, and that if I would mind if she meets up him for a few minutes.(I think she was texting her bf and not her mom) I told her I don’t mind but I won’t wait for her, but would go home, at this point I can see her bf across the street, she totally doesn’t get the hint and bids me farewell and leaves me standing on the sidewalk. I turn around and walk back home alone and a bit disappointed. (Incidences like this have happened in the past as well, with the other members of the group too, but I still feel disappointed every time something like this happens).

I had begun a tradition in July-Clover’s birthday-that we would deliver gifts to the birthday girl’s house (due to Covid times we didn’t begin sooner). As we had begun in July, we missed the birthdays in May-Sam and March-Alex. This is a completely voluntary tradition that had begun on a thoughtful note.

It is Irene’s birthday on 1st Jan, so naturally we began the prep, but this time Sam and Nat left the group created for that purpose. Sam told Clover-on pc- that her dad is saying that you have been giving gifts to all of your friends for the past two years but have never received anything in return so this time I’m not giving you any money. And Nat’s reason was that she doesn’t want to give anything.

Alex and I asked Clover what happened and she relayed to us what they said. We were curious to know why Nat felt that way and if she was on bad terms with Irene and was Sam reacting in such a manner. So the three of us decided to talk it out in a separate group chat. Alex initiated that. A few minutes later Sam and Nat call her ganging up on her and demanding to know why she is being so rude to the them, so she added Clover and me to the conference call. When I joined the call it was chaos. Sam was crying, Nat and Clover are continuously talking over each other. Sam was crying and saying that none of you know what is going on in my life, why are you doing this to me, I have never spoken up about this but I know very well about the groupism that you guys do, do you want to know what is happening with me huh? Huh? then going silent for ten minutes. During her silence Nat would become her lawyer and say idk what is wrong with all of you, why are you doing this to her, and then say that I never said that I don’t want to give Irene anything-this is an obvious lie because I know 

The last half an hour of our Sam had put the call on speaker and her mom had heard the entire conversation. The moment I heard her mom’s voice I asked everyone to cut it out and removed everyone from the call. This happened last week and we all haven’t talked since then. With each passing day I feel like we should have another conversation about this. Although when I talk to Alex and Clover they convince me otherwise that I should wait around for them to call first.

Should I just call Sam today and try to sort it out on a one-to-one level? Or should I listen to Alex and Clover?",30Dec2020,1

339,"Living in New Zealand. I’ve been clinically depressed for 16 (very nearly 17) years. Was unemployed for two years because of it. I found a job during our Covid lockdown at a meat works. 8 years as a chef probably worked in my favour there. But lately my mental health has been in the toilet so I've been trying to balance going to work enough to pay the bills while giving myself enough time off to not repeatedly stab myself in the face with my knives. Work doesn't like it when I take the time off but they also wouldn't like it if I did harm myself while at work so kinda screwed either way. 

Now my account is $190 overdrawn and I only worked enough to get paid about $300. Rent is due on Monday and that's $550 and only have $50 set aside for that. My partner needs $600 by January 15 and there's $150 for that. I've got no work next week which makes me wonder how I'm going to pay any bills/food. My landlord is patient enough to let me miss the rent but I'm already about $3000 in arrears. It's just so stressful to be the one who has to work 40 hours a week, do the housework for two, pay all the bills and deal with a fragile mental state, at this point the only thing keeping me going is knowing my life insurance likely won't pay out for a suicide. 

My partner has MS and can't do much of anything. She's lost her balance and all fine motor skills. Had to get her one of those cups with a lid and straw because she kept dropping cups. Last Xmas I had to get her a walking stick because the heat made her unable to walk. she's on a treatment plan to prevent more issues and goes to the physio to try and fix the damage done but it will still be months before she's able to work proper. And I wish no one had to work and deal with depression at the same time. I'd love to work from home but have no skills that will let me. And I can't afford the pay cut to go study.  

The public system doesn't diagnose ADHD and they did give me my Autism diagnosis. And I can't afford the doctors. I've only got two sick days left to last a year as well. 

If I were to make a patreon page to fund my writing what kind of rewards/content could I make for my backer? I know cosplayers offer their photos or snapchat as rewards. Different amounts of donations getting different types of photos. Some people do youtube videos or streaming but I can't do any of that stuff. 

Any helpful or positive advice is welcome.",30Dec2020,1
340,"So both my boyfriend and I are demisexual- we're also 16 (Legal age of consent). Because of this, lots of my friends and family constantly make sexual comments bout the 2 of us. While I do sometimes make the occasional sexual comment (I'm 16- I'm immature and find them amusing) I find other people making the comments about us incredibly uncomfortable. I feel bad because I constantly joke bout it, but as soon as somebody besides my boyfriend or I say it- I feel uncomfortable bout it for some reason.   


While some aren't too bad (Using a play on words to make a comment sound sexual etc), some people take it \*too\* far (Making out of the blue sexual comments describing a sexual act between the 2 of us), these make me wildly uncomfortable and have led me to break down sometimes. I have told people to stop making these comments as they make me uncomfortable but some are not stopping despite me reminding them... What do I do bout them? I really don't want to associate my boyfriend to these comments...

Sometimes I wonder if it’s schizophrenia, but I’m not sure as there’s something else to it. While not all there are some that I can control to an extent by just imagining where they would be, like picturing something in simpler terms. Despite this I can never make it go away. I can control how it looks, where it is, and what it’s doing, but I can never make it go away. Then there are some that I can only control to a certain extent and then some that I have no influence on. I’ve been thinking about it more and more and I was wondering if there is a specific name for something like this. No matter what I do they don’t leave, and I don’t know what I should do about it. I’ve always wondered if they’re just byproducts of stress, depression, or cPTSD, but I’m not sure at this point.

349,I'm 15 and have been dating my girlfriend for almost 4 years now. They are showing several signs currently but are also sick. Sometime soon their parents are going to make them go to the doctor for being sick. They are immensely sick. Fever at night with hot and cold chills. They can't eat. They have an infection. And their wisdom teeth just pierced their gums. They might have to get an x-ray.  They have a phobia of doctors. And want an abortion. But their family is not supportive and leans more towards being abusive towards them. I have a family member that can take them. But they are so terrified of their family finding out because if they did they would be disowned and lose me. I love them more than anything. But I am scared of losing them and don't know what to do.

350,"**Context:** I (19M) am currently staying with an Aunt and Uncle (QLD) in Australia. In the past (6 years ago) I lived with them after being moved on by another Uncle (NSW) who didn't have space for me in his house anymore after having two kids while I was living with him. I won't go into all the details as it's quite a long story but lets just say that the reason for me living with him has to do with a very horrible and sadistic mother (VIC), a 'kidnapping' and ending up in child protective services (SA), suffice to say I was a very messed up kid. This lead to me never really trusting anyone and spending a lot of nights crying myself to sleep and having some serious anger issues which was why my aunt (QLD) eventually couldn't deal with me anymore and put me in boarding school.

**The Question:** I finished school this year and have moved back in with my aunt (QLD) as a very different and more mature person than I was back when I originally lived with her. However, over the last few weeks I have sensed that my aunt is getting angry and/or upset with me though idk for what. I have done my best to do all the chores around the house I can think of as my way of doing my part, yet I still feel like I am not making things better. What I want to know is should I ask if there is something that I am doing wrong? I have decided that depending on the answer to that question I will either stay or move out by then end of January. I really don't feel comfortable here and was already planning to move out in June but I don't know if it's just me being too sensitive. I will ask at dinner tonight depending on what people say I should do.

355,"So my husband and I moved into our apartment May of this year without any pets. Our neighbor below us from day one was already scowling at us as she walked her tiny Maltese dog on the front grass while we were busy moving our furniture in. She is woman in her late 60s, possibly early 70s who lives alone and does not work as she is home all day every day.

From accidentally dropping a cup, to stepping off the couch a little too fast, to slipping in the shower, this lady bangs extremely hard on our ceiling to the point it’d shake items on our coffee table. She then filed numerous noise complaints to the front office. This was just my husband and I, we  both weigh less than 115lb.

Two months after living here, we decide to adopt a dog from our local shelter, a 6 year old, generally low energy, pitbull/frenchie mix. He is about 50lbs. I say generally low energy because he sometimes gets the zoomies which we stop and calm him down, but he’s been showing signs of loneliness during the nearly 6 months we’ve had him, so yes we adopted another dog. This dog my husband picked, he is a sweetheart and again is some kind of pitbull mix. he weighs 70lbs.  Neither dogs have a problem with barking or howling. Meanwhile downstairs neighbors dog barks every time we leave and enter and walk up our stairs.

We live on the upper unit like I mentioned and the day I brought our 2nd dog home, he being stronger than me, made his way over to my 1st dog for a rather loud introduction. he began immediately trying to play which made a lot of stomping, so I quickly separated and leashed the two in my living room to two opposite ends of the couch. Of course neighbor banged on ceiling because of this. I went down and kindly explained to her the situation and even offered to switch units with her to which she did not give me a direct answer. Why are you this elderly living on a bottom unit? Just switch with me!!

Husband feels like 2nd dog is not working out bc he feels it is unfair to have to keep him leashed to the couch basically all day outside of potty time or walks. I’m not working though so I’m home all day with both of them. both dogs sleep in the room with us, again leashed to opposite ends of the bed. I feel like I wanna push through the last few months we have here until our lease is up because we aren’t staying here and next apartment is for sure going to be a bottom unit. I wish our complex had bottom units as an option when we moved but top was all they had. Our 2nd dog has been in the shelter for the last 10 months prior to us adopting him and I’d hate to see him go back as he was in danger of being euthanized before we took him in. 

Our apartment is also over 900sqft so it’s not like they’re suffering. I told him I think our 2nd dog would prefer to be here with cozy blankets, love and affection, and a friend even if it means being leashed for a little while longer rather than being in a dirty shelter where they’re mistreated by staff and have to smell the dog in the next kennel over’s poop all night amidst laying on cold concrete floors. being kept in a tiny 5ft by 5ft cage. He seems really happy. We have him sleeping in the bed with us right now, snuggled under blankets. I just don’t know what to do. Our apartment knows and allows our dogs as well. 

Can anybody give me any advice?",30Dec2020,1

In their relationship he was very abusive, physically and mentally and was to girlfriends after thier devorce (in front of the children) . Also a heroin addict. since then he has gotten off the H but takes all kinds of wierd shit for the high, suppliments and things like cratem . Hes tried to be a good dad but is still kind of a piece of shit. I out parent the hell out of him on an astronomical level. still, i dont talk bad about him in front of the children and try to give him the benefit of the doubt, still this can make coparenting very difficult. For the last couple years he has been making comments and talking shit for no reason. Just douche bag stuff like the music i like, hobbies etc. for no reason except to poke.. I never did anything about it because i cant just beat the shit out of him in front of the kids, that would only hurt my relationship with the kids and complicate things in general. but lately hes been making comments on my parenting, my job and my dogs. this is where a line was crossed,i decided i was done dealing with it and he was going to get checked hard. It is well known he is a coward who only hits women and would probably run (which he did). my wife asked me very nicely not to physically hurt him, conflict really stresses her out and i said id do my best. So the next time he was in my home i asked WTF his problem was, that ive always been kind to him and done a lot of favours for him, i was looking for a simple apology and for him to know i was done with his mouth. instead i got a fuck you attitude and he just started staring me down, thats when i had had it, i took him outside and when he asked what was up i informed him i was going to beat the shit out of him and didnt want the kids to see it. upon hearing this his eyes got big and he bolted off my porch and ran to his car, i called him a coward and to come back so we could talk like grown adults. he mumbled under his breath and sped away. I feel justified in my actions, im just angry it had to get to that point, i wanted to do it much earlier but my wife convinced me to let her talk to him, and she did, but apprently it didnt stick. This felt like a last resort, either talk to him or let him keep disrespecting my family and I. Im truley dissapointed i didnt get my apology and also dissapointed i didnt go with my gut and put him down hard. but now overall im just pissed that it had to come to this. i want us both to help raise these kids but hes made it very difficult not just for me but the way he acts in front of the kids. i feel justified but shitty about the whole ordeal.

363,"My mom is VERY sensitive, and we both suffer from depression and anxiety. But she has been indirectly hurting me—significantly— with things she does, and I’ve talked about it in therapy for so many years now, and I can’t hold it in any longer.

I’m staying at home for the holidays with her and my father and sister. She woke up at 2 AM this morning, which set me off. I wrote her a letter of a few pages, pretty frantically, because it’s emotionally a lot to deal with for me, but i think it mostly captures what I’m trying to say. 

I don’t think she’s going to handle it well because it’s basically detailing all the ways she contributes to and causes my depression and anxiety. And multiple therapists have concluded that she *is* a major source of my depression (if not THE source). 

It’s 4:40 AM right now. Should I email her the letter? Or print it? Or save it for later?

I think it might feel the best to give it to her now, because I think she already knows that something is up, and she’s been chainsmoking for a couple hours now, and it would maybe feel freeing to get it over with.

But the whole reason I haven’t done anything until now is that I was trying to avoid hurting her because I don’t think she can handle the truth. But it’s been killing me to hold it in.

365,"Throwaway. Don’t know where else to ask with low karma. I’m 25 and have been having sex on average a few times a month since I was 18 when I lost it. I’m with a girlfriend of almost 3 years now and in the first couple years we were probably having sex about 3 times a week on average. Ever since I can remember I fucking ejaculate in less than 30 seconds. I thought I would grow out of this.  I used to find myself getting hammered before sex (whisky dick) just so I would last long, and you know if I get too drunk I’m not cumming at all. Now I find myself always making an excuse for why I came so fast. I don’t drink anymore and my girlfriend is super dope and acts like she doesn’t care but it’s so fucking embarrassing. I just wanna be able to go for like 20 minutes, it makes me not even wanna have sex anymore. I know there are methods like wearing condoms or those wipes that numb your dick but I want a *real* solution. There is no relationship issue on her end as I still make her orgasm but with my hands or orally. What can I do to last longer? Thank you",30Dec2020,1

369,"My younger brother (15) thinks he's the shit, the manliest of men, the top dog, and it's pushing my limits especially since we're stuck together in another lockdown. Please, tell me how to cope. I've given up hope on fixing his attitude. 

Warning: extremely long post, kinda rant like but it gives context.

He must assert his dominance (cheesy, but so tragically true) in EVERYTHING, and be the best at everything (except his art homework, which I do for him, and cooking/cleaning/laundry/groceries etc, which me and my mother do). His favourite hobby seems to be pissing me off, because every time I get angry, our mother gets angry at me and coddles him more. As five years his senior, I know this shouldn't rile me, but the condescending tone he says things in, and then later brushing it off as jokes, really makes me wanna deck him. 

Another thing that I need suggestions to deal with: his extravagant lifestyle. He really thinks he's a bougie-ass kid. Maison Margiela Replica perfume for Christmas (from me. He got me nothing for Christmas, even though I got him a job this year), the latest iPhone 12, and when the new Airpods released some time ago he immediately ""handed down"" his previous pair to our mom. He used our *family's* loyalty points to get those. When I bought my first laptop at 16, I paid for it myself. One year later, he got his gaming pc at 12 as a gift from my mom. His computer's so jacked that it still renders faster than the new laptop I use for 3d programs at school. He took my silk scarf and wore it in what he calls ""the gucci babushka"" look. The pearls my grandma gave me? His. My mom says just let him, since I don't wear them. His lifestyle is not sustainable. When I talk to him about it, it turns into an argument. He involves my mom, who will argue that one of the reasons she left my dad is because he hoards and never spends. She likes comparing me to him, because we share the same birthdate, and what she calls ""an unfortunate zodiac sign."" Our financial situation is rough but my brother likes brand name items, even kitchenware (he doesn't cook!). His mindset might be ""I'm the best so I should have the best,"" but I could be wrong. Is there anything I can do? I've tried talking to him, and reasoning with our mom, to no avail. Our dad is not an option for help, so I really don't know anymore.

He talks about watches like he's an expert, and he's also an 'expert' on perfumes, fashion, stocks (!!!) and trading, fitness, computers... ugh.

Since I'm older and have always been there to guide him, he's never really been in unfamiliar territory on his own. I thought maybe he should develop some independence, lessen his reliance (which he won't admit to) on me. During his careers course, his assignment was to write a resume. His first reaction is to ask me for help. He could see my reluctance, and boy did that bitch try to butter me up: ""you're so good at it, look at you, you got two jobs yadayada blah."" I told him firmly that resume writing is a life skill, and he must do it himself. He told my mom, who ordered me to help him write his resume. I said no, no one helped me, and I won't help him. Then she told me: ""There are two types of people in the world: after overcoming hardship, the first kind will see people going through what they went through, will know their pain, and help them. After overcoming hardship, the second kind will see people going through what they went through, and will want them to feel the same pain they did. You are the second kind of person, and so is your dad."" What a guilt trip. Of course I help him after that, but first I tell him to fix up the resume he wrote in middle school. I gave him an hour, and heard him typing away. Later, when we open the resume maker he used in middle school, he nervously says that he wasn't sure what to write so didn't change much. He used MyBlueprint, so all he had to do was fill in the blanks and it makes the resume for you. When we logged on, it clearly hasn't been edited at all. The address was from two years ago, and it hadn't been opened in two years. The hour I gave him to edit his resume he spent gaming. At the end, I went through each section with him, and left him with one task: update his email to a professional sounding one. Simple right? But oho...

That email gave me so many problems. Later, before handing out a single resume anywhere, my mom asked me to see if I can get him a job at the place I work. I had applied there quite a few times over the course of three years, and after some fast ladder climbing I was able to hire people. It was just a small smoothie shop, so there wasn't any rule against hiring family members, but my brother was inexperienced and only 15. Legally, his hours were limited. I explained this to my mom, but she insisted I at least ask my boss. Ask I did, and I thought that maybe if my brother got a job he would learn financial responsibility. I waxed poetic about all the positives I could think of to my boss, and she relented and said that I can hand his resume to the person sending out hired emails. Remember how he had ONE JOB when writing his resume, which was to fill in his email correctly? Well, the email was incorrect, and I ended up having to contact a string of people to reach the person sending hiring emails. It was embarrassing, since I recommended my brother and this did not reflect well. He didn't think it was a big deal, and now I regret handing him his first job so easily because he will never know the difficulties of getting your first job by yourself. Now he just says that he started working earlier than me, that I'm 20 and still living at home like a looser. Look what a boss he is, starting out so early! I want to move out, but do not yet have the finances to do so. No one is helping me pay for university, and the pandemic is making things worse. 

I know I should be out of the apartment already though, and I plan to do so the moment Covid ends, because this quarantine has taught me that I must sacrifice my money to keep my mental health. **But for now, what should I do?** How can I lessen the torment (without committing suicide, because I wanna eat a lot more foods still)? Our apartment is so small, that we are bound to see each other, especially since I don't have a room of my own and live in the solarium, which is separated by clear glass panels from the living room. There's literally no where for me to hide, not even the bathroom since we only have the one, so I must deal with his shittyness head on. I'm even writing this at 4am to get some time alone.

My boyfriend and I ended our 3 year long distance relationship in March but I just can’t seem to get over him and he can’t get over me either. To be fair we had a very toxic and I was verbally abused majority of the time. He’s in the military so it was a long distance relationship. We’ve known each other for over 10 years. He’s on leave right now in my home town and although I don’t really want to see him I miss him a lot. And I heard he misses me too. I gave him many chances and I don’t see myself being with him again but then again the thought of him being with someone else makes me sick to my stomach. He was my first everything and we had a very special bond. He’s been trying a lot recently to change and become a better person for me but I can’t go back into that toxic relationship.

we are watching a video link from reddit and its about Werner Von Braun.  It was something to the effect of he's a huge part of why humans have such a great space program.  I mention that the dude is a hardcore Nazi, she kind of rolls her eyes and to me indicates this is untrue.

He's been giving the vaccines, however I noticed that all the syringes (which I assume are predosed as they come pre-filed in the package) he's been throwing out still contain quite a lot of liquid in them.

When he gives the shots he pulls slightly on the syiringe and then presses, but as I said there's still fluid in them after he's done; I have no idea if that's the normal procedure or not.

The doubt arises especially because he's shown a bit of resistance to vaccines as he got a bad reaction from one years ago. He doesn't talk about it with patients though.

All of his kids live in various states so my mom thought it would be a nice surprise. I understand the sentimental aspect. 

My stepdads daughter Brooke and his son Brian invited THEMSELVES to not just stay the weekend but “drop in” early on Sunday night. With a 4 hour warning to my mother, my sister and I (my stepdad is at work out of state this week). She brought her 4 kids, Brian brought his 2 kids, all under the age of 6 - screaming, running around, nonstop for the rest of the night Sunday and into Monday. One got into my contact case in the bathroom and ripped my contacts up due to Brooke not watching them. I work nights in an Emergency Department at a hospital. I sleep in the basement of my home and this noise causes the walls to shake thus my bed too. I tried to put in headphones to be a good sport but that barely helped.

Brooke took it upon herself to call my mom today and say, “well I’m worried about *sunny’s* (my name) sleep schedule and her work schedule.” Yet this doesn’t change anything and she pushed my mom once again and asked to come early and stay the night Wednesday. My mom obliged because she 1) Feels bad 2) Does anything she can to make my stepdad happy. I said to my mom, “those kids are brats and Brooke doesn’t do anything to control them” my mom replied, “I don’t disagree.”

My sister and I have voiced our concerns over this and we are not happy. It would be one thing if it were for a day, but Brooke and Brian are blatantly taking advantage of my mom and our home.

Lately, its been demeaning talks, i remember being 12 when he came back home for holidays we were playing all so fine when my mom pops in and he suddenly goes why is her hair so dry in the front, she has the hair of a nigga. Following this, he stopped showing affection like when he would come back home whatsover from holidays he would no longer hug or say hello.

Last year, I went to stay at his place for a month and needless to say 1 month of not talking or him speaking angrily plus him acting as though I was not here. 

So am twenty now and am saying enough to this behaviour. I am no longer accepting the demeaning remarks of him saying am not an adult, not being able of holding a conversation, still a child and so on. Him comparing me with my little niece and on.

Am currently staying at my sister's place so when he invited her and her family over for dinner to which I should normally attend, I refused to go. 
Plus am feeling a little guilty, since he has a new girlfriend and she might be part of the family soon. And she might think my brother's side of the family is a little fucked up...
apparently my brother in law also had some issues with my brother and since he had to go but not me this has created a rift between my sister and him. she calls me egoistic and self centered for thinking only about me and that it would not have been such a big deal if i went with them.

Very much still alive) 

Then today me and my ex started talking about the past and how fast she seemed to move on from me and that turned into an argument and by the time I begged her to stop I was again crying my eyes out.

She has kicked out people in her group before and she still continues this today but somehow is still popular and is still gaining popularity. I cant comprehend it. 

She spread a lot of lies about me and I lost all of my friends and only for one person who stayed by my side through all of the chaos, my ex friend would have gotten her wish at seeing me dead. I was isolated for 2 years. Everyone hated me (and I believe still does). A year of falling out with me, a person who I use to be friends with warned me that my ex friend was trying to make me commit suicide. (I believe this as my ex friend use to say to me in the first year of our friendship that I would end up like her ""fake"" cousin, that my mother will find me hanging on the washing line. At that time i passed it off as her being concerned as I was going through eating issues, which she didnt help by occasionally adding, ""just because its infront of you, doesn't mean you have to eat it."") This person also told me that my ex friend was spreading lies about, that I'm talking behind everyone's back. She failed to tell me about the fake Instagram account.

In 2019 I created my first Instagram account. I know, what adult doesnt have a Instagram account; It's just an art account as I'm extremely anxious of people judging me as a person. I have found an account with my name on it. I can guarantee my life savings, that no one has my exact spelling of my name as my mother misspelled it when I was born. And also I've check. There is no other accounts with the exact spelling. I know she created that account as when we were friends, she would use a fake name on all her socials. She told me it was because she didnt want her dad bothering her. Stupid excuse really. I also believe she made it as everyone I talked to, stopped talking to me for no reason. People started to have bad opinions of me, and I was completely isolated. 

I'm not sure what to do. Should I report the account? I dont want people thinking that account is me. But on the other hand, the damage is already done. I also dont want to confront my ex friend because I'm so done with her trying to push me over the edge, and I'm not inviting that negativity back into my life.

403,"Ok so I’m from the U.K. and have been dating a Bulgarian guy for around 2 years. We have a great relationship and I really like that he has a different background to mine. 

The issue is that every time we go to meet (A) the cousin she always says something inappropriate and rude. E.g asking how to say his name every time they meet and repeating it over 10 times. Everyone knows to stop and just nod after three right?!! (How many times do you even use someone’s name anyway!!). The worst one was when she asked why he lives here and are there not any jobs “back home” and why does everyone come here and take “our jobs”. Everyone just went silent and we didn’t speak for awhile after. My bf says he doesn’t really mind and that it just shows that she’s uneducated but I feel she should be told that she can’t go around saying these things. 

She struggles with depression and anxiety but I don’t think that’s a good enough excuse for her to keep saying these things. I just think she needs to be able to filter it before she says it! 

How can I ask her to just stop? I don’t want to be mean but I can’t let this carry on. Especially if she meets his parents one day. I couldn’t cope if they were alone together.",30Dec2020,1

I feel so touch starved and while my family and I all live on a piece of land in all separate dwellings they aren’t very physical in any sense.

407," 

Basically the title. Growing up I (19m) was always afraid of my older brother and as much as I hate to say it, our relationship affected the way I treat my younger brother. I'm glad to say now that my younger brother and I have a very good relationship.

However, I'm still very much afraid of my older brother. Even a phone call from him send shivers down my spine. I remember I've gotten blackeyes from him twice and because of that I had to endure lots of embarrassment at school. Mind you this was when I was 12-13. My brother is the athletic type and as you can probably guess I'm more of the stay-at-home-all-the-time kind of guys. When I once tried to learn badminton my parents asked my brother to coach me. He berated me about being so poor. And even worse it was in front of one of my friends. I felt so ashamed.

I'm currently studying at university in Australia. My school offers free counselling which is why I'm even considering going to therapy. Currently I'm living with my older brother and I feel like I'm being used. I do most of the housework (besides cooking). I even have to hang his clothes for him. Whenever my older brother has friends around I even have to clean up after them afterwards. He also always berates me saying that why can't I do things as well as he can even after he's shown me how. I've confronted him about this before and as we argue, he always makes it seem like I'm in the wrong. Once his friend puked on our mat after getting so drunk and I was the one who cleaned it. This has got me thinking is he actually right? Am I just not doing my fair share of work? Every time I think of any argument in my head I'm always to scared to go through with it cause I know he'll find a way to make it seem like its my fault. I feel ashamed to say this but I even cried twice last year after arguing with him. Each time I feel so worthless. I keep telling myself why can't I be more brave. I have so many friends who have great or decent relationships with their older brothers only I'm the exception. Why am I the only person who has this kind of situation. I'm also suspecting that it is because of our relationship that I'm such a shy person afraid of any confrontation.

I have to be fair. I have not always been very good to him too. Sometimes out of anger, I've done many things I'm not proud of (I once threw his freshly washed clothes to the ground). But I always feel like I'm walking on eggshells around him. I really want to know if this is a good enough reason to go to therapy. Honestly, thank you to anyone who has contributed any advice it really means the world to me.",30Dec2020,1

My friend is stuck in quite a situation right now, let’s call my friend N. Recently, N has managed to find herself in this situation of a call out post in a form of a tik tok. This person who called her out is named A, and I will be referring to them as them because those are their pronouns. I will try my best in explaining and if there are parts that need to be cleared up, don’t be afraid to ask. A makes a video about their club experience and how they were made fun of, abused, and there was a good amount of racist things being said. A, N, and I were all in the same club, but i was usually sick so when drama did happen, I rarely was there and only heard the basic gist of the drama. Anyways, A then decides to make a call out post and tags people from the club (sans me because they don’t know my username). Now, my friend, N, is extremely confused and so was I. Reason being is that A and N were talking up until this point, and throughout the times where they talked, they did not mention anything N was doing that was wrong until now. Then when N decided to question them, they basically block N for a little bit. Now N is frazzled and confused because A is basically calling N a racist, which is really not true and the reason why N is a racist is because.... drum roll please.... is because N follows two people on Instagram that A doesn’t like and N is forced to talk to these two people for club purposes (different club) and A is saying that they are racist for even talking to them even though it is not N’s fault. Then N tried to have a conversation and apologizes but A is saying that it’s all N’s fault for even following the two people that they don’t like on Instagram and that N deserves all the hate and bad stuff that will come to them because of their video. that’s basically the long story shorten, however, how do I support N in this situation? I didn’t know what to say when she was telling me about it and I feel really bad because I know N is a good person, and that if A listened to what N was saying, they would see it differently. However I don’t know, and overall I just want to help my friend out, especially because we are unable to meet up due to covid.",30Dec2020,1

414,"So I know I’m definitely overthinking this, but I would just like an outsider’s view on this.

I had this crush on this guy all throughout high school. He was in almost all of my classes, really funny and sweet guy, and we had a lot in common. He actually had a big crush on me as well. It was really obvious, and his friends always told me about it. Although, at the time, I was really depressed/suicidal, and I knew a relationship was the last thing I needed, so I told people I wasn’t interested in a relationship. Word of this eventually got around to him, so I think that’s why he never actually made a move on me.

We graduated in 2016, and everyone moved on in life. I haven’t seen or heard from him since then. I occasionally dream about him and it always reawakens the feelings I had from back then. My heart always aches. I’ve tried to move on from it, but the regret still really hangs over my head.

Fast forward to now, my depression has gotten better. Someone I knew from hs found my twitter that I use (just for myself, no one follows me) and I found that he follows some other people I used to know, and looking through them brought me to my old crush’s twitter that he still uses. He’s still the same guy I used to know, sweet and nerdy. He also looks to be single at the moment.

Should I shoot my shot? I’m sure he’s moved from me a looong time ago, but... I’ve just been thinking about dropping him a follow and seeing what happens. I don’t know if I should go for it, or if our moment has passed and I should move on. What do yall think?",30Dec2020,1

We definitely don't want to kill, or even hurt the dog, but now we don't know how to make sure it stops Killin the chickens! 

Any advice on how to get rid of the dog without hurting it?",30Dec2020,1
438,"I posted about this a few months ago.

Some back story... 
I went up to Detroit and found out my ex was lying to me. We were on a break the end of September. We're both in recovery and we slipped up so I hit the breaks to go move to my home town in MD. I'm from Florida she's from MI.

We met in July, moved pretty quick, we spent three months basically non stop, while I was on a biz road trip between multiple states. I'm not one to be a hopeless romantic and like to take things slow, though this woman had me.. Felt like weve known eachother all our lives. Sometimes it felt like being in an actual movie, though we were in our own world. 

The end of September we found out our DOCs and slipped up, I was upset to the point I just had to leave. I didn't want that for myself nor for us..

After I left, story goes her Ex found out, attacked her one night in her drive way a few weeks afterwards.. I flew up there then next morning. She was badly hurt.. I stayed with her at her apartment and the next night he unloaded a 9mm into her apartment... Everything ended up being fine and everyone was okay, we were escorting out of the city by police. While they went looking for him, we were leaving for MD the next morning.. Though the following night I woke up and she was gone. She went back to him... That was about 45 days ago, two weeks ago I got a call from her and she told me it's over and she's always loved him... Seems she was seeing him ever since I left MI when I slipped up.. 

I hung up, and started to move on.. 

Just last night her mom contacted me, we've stayed in touch and have become good friends.. She told me what happen with her daughter and sent me pictures of what he did to her Xmas eve... 


For the better part of three weeks now I've been focusing on me and my work.. Seriously tbh, I almost lost everything after I slipped up.. The way back to sobriety is sometimes an uphill battle, and during this time I've been coming clean to my loved ones and friends. Now with all this... 

I dont know what to do.. I was pretty hurt by all this. I just started feeling the feeling of moving on with my life. 
Though, putting all past feelings aside.. Her life could very well be in danger being in MI. 

If she came here, how do I just be there as support? I don't want a friendship nor looking to rekindle anything at this moment, probably for the foreseen future.. If she comes to live with me, what boundaries would be healthy to discuss and make known? I would like to continue my life and getting back to living it more. 


Sorry in advance, this is long and all over the place. It's so much to all this other than the highlights mentioned above.. Apologies too it's early and my reddit etiquette is off. 

I've hardly slept and I talk with her and her mom in about 3 hours.... Any offered perspectives or thoughts would be appreciated!",30Dec2020,1

I apologise in advance if this doesn't belong here. 

We are looking to move into a bigger flat (Germany) We are gonna go look at one today. I am a fresh adult with zero clue and experience in this and my German, while fluent, is not good enough for legal talk.

Do you have some tips on what to watch out for and what could be some red flags when the real estate agent shows us the place and the documents? 

Are there any things we are entitled for? Like for example if the previous tenant was a smoker and the walls are yellow and stink, do they have to pay for the cleaning before we move in? (Just a random example)

I’m 20M my gf is 19F we have been dating 9 months she is the best thing that’s ever happened to me shes smart/pretty/funny/beautiful basically amazing I’m defo dating up I still don’t know how a piece of shit like me got someone like her the fact that I know she can do much better 

Shes really close with her entire family for her family unity is a big thing like her family knows pretty much everything that goes on in her life (feeling/dreams/fears/insecurities /passions/hobbies) they know all her friends by name and they are all very nice I met them about a month into our relationship and most of them really like me especially her dad(cause one of the first times I was over I basically volunteered and remade their wooden bench)and younger brother (cause I’m into the same kinda strategy games as him and I sometimes play with him) 

My family dynamic is the complete opposite my parents are divorced I grew up with my dad who was abusive to me (so I’m not close with him as in we talk but he knows nothing about my life except what course I’m doing and that I have friends ) and I prefer to keep it that way.my mother is a narcissistic bitch with who I don’t like speaking to at all as she robbed my elderly grandmother of over half a million dollars. I’m relatively close with my grandparents but not in the way of sharing details of my personal life with them(I don’t share anything about my relationships with them)  but other aspects of life they know a bit better as in they know my plans for the future and if i have a problem to do with household or decisions on my future to do with my career I share with them but not my personal life 

My Gf knows all of that as I’ve shared this with her(at this point she knows more about me than my entire family combined) but I think the fact that nobody in my family knows about her is starting to bother her as well as it’s starting to affect her families perception of me even though she has told them that my relationship with my family is screwed up 

There is also one more factor that bothers her it’s that I haven’t posted a picture of us on social media but that’s for two reasons I hate taking pictures I always look stupid/dumb and as though I’ve been taken hostage(which is why I’ve never posted a meaningful picture of myself the only one is a long distance photo of me playing ice hockey where u can’t even see my face) and a second is I have an aunt who follows me on social media and if she sees a pic of us then it’s gonna start a whole drama but I can’t block as I talk to her via Instagram 

Though my 3 best friends know about her and them meeting her a couple times and my best friend she knows decently as we all go to the same uni and are all in the same course plus she’s good friends with his gf 

I’m at a lose what can I do there is nothing left for me to tell her about my family she knows about them though she thinks I shouldn’t be keeping my personal life hidden from them especially my grandparents. My friend thinks I should just give what she wants im not sure I’d wanna do that if they know about my personal life they are gonna start annoying me and then would want to meet and and she would want the same 

I’m not sure what can I do any advice help is appreciated or outlooks on to my position or even worst case any lie I can use to shut this conversation down 

TLDR- gf wants me tell my family about her plus wants me to post pics with her I can’t do either due to hating taking pictures and never doing it plus having a dysfunctional relationship with my family",30Dec2020,1

Straight to the point: I currently work at a bar in Denmark being paid the equivalent to 15$ an hour, its not a super stable job (even less so with Covid) but it's a job I really enjoy and one where i can generally get the hours i want but never really being able to hit the hours of a full time job.
During this latest lockdown i got offered a job at a laser printing factory/warehouse, paying roughly 20$ an hour plus pension fund and a few benefits like double pay for overtime, it started as a Christmas helper position, but now I'm being asked if i would like to come back in/after January as a fulltime job. 

I realize something like this has probably been asked many times but im really unsure of what to do, stay in a non-secure less paying job with a bit more freedom and fun/passion for it, or take a stable job which is a bit more physically demanding and boring but that pays better? 

Any and all advice would be great, if you have gone through something similar personally, what did you do and do you regret that choice?

445,"back in 2019, my good friend (I will called him C) and his husband J wanted to have a dinner party. they made a guest list, planned a menu, and set a date in spring 2020. we all know why that got cancelled. in November, they decided to try again with their dinner party with some quarantine precautions. They were going to cook the meal and deliver it to the guest at their house so we could have the dinner party via zoom. they made a list of everyone's dietary preferences and allergies so everyone would be comfortable. one of J's guests called him and asked if they could include his new gf on the guest list. J said sure and his friend hung up before they could get her dietary info. that was 2 weeks ago. the dinner party is planned for new year's eve. C and J have all the meals cooked, packaged, and ready to deliver everything when J's friend called on the 26th and informed J that his gf is vegan and he is started going vegan. C called me on the 28th because he wanted to verify my address and he sounded like he was going to cry. I asked what was wrong and he was a bit stressed over J's newly vegan guests due to them not having enough vegan ingredients to make their plates (since C made them the plates with meat and animal by-products in them.) I suggested why not remove the trouble couple off the dinner party guest list and have a more private event with them on a later date. I didn't know C had me on speakerphone and that J was on the phone with said trouble guest. I heard the guy calling me all kinds of names but J didn't say anything. I gave C and J my love and hung up. C messaged me yesterday warning me that the vegan guy and his gf are looking for my Instagram so if I start getting harassed by some random couple, it's them. According to C, J is considering my suggestion but is a bit conflicted about removing his friend from the guestlist plus the guy has not stopped bitching and gaslighting about my suggestion for the past 36 hours.",30Dec2020,1

I moved into new appartment 1 month ago, and the walls are so thin that my neighbours can hear everything that goes on in my appartment. 

This is really starting to piss me off, not so much that I can hear them, I can live with that, but the fact that I feel like I can never be myself, because these people can hear everything I do. My old place was very soundproof so for instance if I wanted to scream/shout to get something off my chest or laugh out load on the phone with a friend, I didn't have to worry about pissing neighbours off, this is what pisses me off, this is my home so I need to be able to recharge my batteries here, but I cant because I cannot relax fully when I know these people can hear whats going on in here.

447,"Three years ago, my two best friends cut ties with me because of my own toxic behavior that I act out towards them during the peak of my struggles with my mental disorders. It ended with them blocking and refusing to say a single word to me. Since that night, it has left me extremely heartbroken and unable to move on for years. I really loved them as my best friends, and I want nothing more than to have the chance to be able to apologize for my behavior and at least end on good terms. As mentioned before, I haven't spoken to them since that initial night, I've been blocked on all social media by them. I've changed and matured drastically since then, undergoing big mental health changes. I feel mostly cured of those struggles that I went through then and see all the errors in which I behaved. About a year ago, I asked a mutual friend if they were willing to speak with me again and they said they weren't ready yet (2 years after the breakup). So, now another year later, I'm wondering if they could be ready now. It's been 3 years and it still pains me and haunts my mind, I feel like I can't get over it without closure.

450,"We just moved to a new house/neighborhood about 7 months ago. Everyone we’ve met has been super nice and neighborly, but we have these neighbors directly behind us with two incredibly loud dogs. Our backyards are facing each other and only separated by a chain link fence. They have a German shepherd that barks anytime we go outside/walk to our cars, or if she sees another neighbor. They just recently (maybe for Xmas?) got a new dog that seems to be some sort of hound mix. The hound howls and screams incessantly from about 7 am until whenever they get home at night. These neighbors are also gone all day every week day and they leave their dogs outside, so they aren’t even here to hear all the noise they make. I can’t imagine we’re the only ones who are bothered by it since we all live in such close proximity. I was willing to ignore the shepherds barking because we can barely hear it if we’re in our living room. But the other dogs howling is so piercing, it just echoes throughout our house. Each day we’re woken up at the crack of dawn by these dogs and I’m beginning to grow very resentful towards the owners. What should I do? I don’t want to offend them, but I also want them to know how inconsiderate they are to have two incredibly loud dogs that they seem to never be home to care for.",30Dec2020,1
451,"I’m not sure if this is the right place to post this but I need some advice.

Sorry if this is long winded.

I am 24F and currently living with my mom and stepdad and my younger sister (who has learning . I had lived with my mom since she bought the house, way before my step dad came on the scene. I had moved out when I was 20 with my boyfriend for 2 1/2 years, but in 2019, two weeks after my dad died, we broke up. Which means I had to move back into my family home. (as we rented together, and I could no longer afford the rent on my own) I try to earn my keep as much as possible. I pay my mother rent, I help out with the house work, I cook and a pay for my own perishables (like food, toiletries, cleaning supplies ect..) I'm doing my part as much as I possible can. I even make my step dads lunch box up, because he doesn't want to do it himself.

In 2019, we got into a fight. My sister had come down from uni, to my moms house after hearing we'd lost our dad suddenly. She was put up in the lounge / dinning room on a blow up bed so she could be with us. I was asleep in my bed, when she came in crying, saying she could hear my step dad shouting and screaming because he couldn't eat his dinner in the lounge (this was at 1:00am). Similar to the argument I had with him a few days ago, he said we were ruining our mothers life, we were a burden, we treat her like shit, he walk all over her, we never give them space. And we'd just lost our dad, on that night!

I even sympathized, that me coming back wasn't going to be the most ideal thing. So me and my sisters, all treated them to several getaways (before the pandemic) so they could enjoy each others company. I've even hide away in my room for days on end, trying to appease him.

I can cross my heart and say I've never treated my mom anything less than what she deserves. She's been the best mother and support system, I'd ever need. Even when I was diagnosed with depression at 14, and she didn't understand it, she was there. She she knows how much I love her. And I accepted Richard wholeheartedly, and secretly in a really selfish way, hoped he'd replace my dad, so maybe I wouldn't miss him as much. And the hole in the enter of my life, wouldn't been so big without him. I've never disrespected him and we've always gotten on after this first fight occurred. This argument was never resolved, more like forgotten. Until two nights ago.

The crooks of the arguments are that I’m leeching and ruining my moms later years, when she shouldn’t have the burden of her kids still weighing her down. But right now, financially, I can’t move out. I desperately want to be living my own life, independently, but I can’t afford to. I work full time, with crap wages and I am slowly saving - but renting in my area, even for a small one bed flat is close to £600 pm, which I can't afford right now, so I've got myself a help-to-buy isa and I'm saving. Especially with how the world is with the pandemic, moving out with no security for your job, in my opinion would be stupid.

Tonight was a awful night. My step dad has had one too many glasses of wine and let loose. And by too many glasses I mean, two bottles of decent red that he got for Christmas and half a bottle of white. My mother is a happy drunk, she always has been. My step dad is vile when he's drunk, truly nasty. That night he screamed at me, called me a waste of space, a disappointment, pathetic excuse for a daughter, a leech, an embarrassment and said ‘someone like you should just give up and stop breathing’

I only made one comment. Because my step-dad loves to have serious conversations when he is drunk, which he can't comprehend fully, and it always causes an argument because he can't hold his tongue. (he does it with his middle child and my mom.) I could see him getting nasty with my mom, so I said to BOTH of them 'it's getting late, (we all had work early and the shouting was keeping everyone up) you've both got work tomorrow and you've had too much to drink' (it's 12pm at this point, my mom was complaining that he wouldn't let her eat and she wanted to go to bed.) 'I think it's time we call it'

Our relationship has never been 100% but I’d never say it was bad, and his words truly have shocked me. And tomorrow, because he’s drunk, I’ll have to pretend it never happened because he won’t remember it. 

The thing that hurt the most, was my mother stood there and let it happen. Eventually I lost my cool, and shouted and screamed right back - and I was told to calm down and that I was acting like a different person and that I was drunk! When I'd been on tea all night and not touched one drop of alcohol. She never once turned to him and defended me, and the smug smile on his face sealed the deal. That my mom will let him make me feel uncomfortable and out of place in my own home before putting him in his place.

I personally believe, because he's said it in the past, he never wanted kids. And he ended up with three. He's disowned one, doesn't speak to his youngest - only on birthdays and seasonal occasions. His middle child, (who i'll call Sarah) who is my age and has had to move in with her boyfriend and his mom (due to horrible personal reasons with my step dads last marriage) he doesn't contact her at all. The only reason she sees him, is because me and mom include her. Sarah tested him once, and waited to see how long it would be before she'd get a phone call or any effort off of her dad. And he went a month quiet easily without so much as a text - until she gave in and called him. I really think he wants to go back to his youth when he had no kids, no responsibilities and could do and say what he pleases.

I wish it was as easy as just getting my own place, but I really can't. So for now, I'm stuck in a household that makes me hate waking up in an morning. And I'm worried that when I do have the means, to move on with my life, I'll be leaving the only parent I have behind.

I don't want my mom to choose, I want her to be happy, I don't want her in the middle.  But why is he allowed to treat me like shit and get away with it? But if I respond, I'm the bad one? It's not his house, it's my mothers, so why am I treated like an unwanted guest when I was living here before him. 

Home life has become unbearable and my depression is at an all time low. I don’t know what to do anymore. 

This year has really been shit.
Even if you don’t have any answers, to know I’m not alone with my crappy life, would help immensely.

How can I encourage her to become more passionate about this? I understand it is a ""leading a horse to water"" situation.

I am not going to lie, the benefits of the gym on her body is something I would like to see &amp; enjoy as well. I work hard to have a strong, toned body for her (and obviously myself) to enjoy, and sometimes I would like to get the same increased joy from her body.

463,"I don’t know why all this has only hit me now. I suppose it’s after a period of self reflection which I had never really engaged in before, but what’s only hitting me now is all the bad shit I’ve done in my life. I’m a 19 year old male in my second year of university, and only recently have I been sort of accepting, that from about 12 to 16/17, I was absolutely horrible. And not only am I accepting this, but I’m feeling the guilt to an intense degree, like I’ve never felt before, and it’s deserved. The thing is, I don’t want to feel this guilt anymore, because I feel like I can’t move on and actually contribute positively to the world. All I can do is sit and and think about how much of a piece of shit I am. I just want to vent, and see if anyone could look past the horrible deeds I’ve done and help me with moving forward. I’ve no intention of being that person anymore, I want to be better. 

I suppose the main aspect of what I’m disgusted at myself for is the way in which I used to treat girls. I was a horrible inconsiderate asshole. The most disgusting thing I did, which I’m so ashamed about, is when I was about 14, when my friend got sent nudes by his girlfriend. My friends and her, and a few others were all one friend group. Anyway, I had always liked her, and was jealous about my friend being with her. My friend though, who was also a scumbag, and I can say, while this is disgusting, has grown up and changed a lot since, shared her nudes. He sent them around the friend group, I can’t remember the reason, not that there is any valid one. Anyway, she found out, and was very upset, but with none of us really understanding the seriousness and how awful this was, she forgave him. Anyway, another fall out happened in the friend group (I can’t remember why, I think she may have cheated on my friend), but everyone turned against her, myself included. I started being horrible to her about what she sent my friend, calling her awful names and slut shaming her, and essentially bullying her about the fact I had seen her nudes etc. I think a lot of this was fuelled by my jealousy. Anyway, everything fell apart, not just for that reason, and we all stopped speaking. I knew I was being a dickhead, I never grasped, however, just how despicable my behaviour was, and because she always seemed to brush things off and never got overtly upset I never realised how much this would hurt her. That’s no excuse though, the way I treated her was horrible and borderline sociopathic. To make matters worse it was a running joke among the rest of us (about 5 guys) that we had seen the nudes, until we sort of just forgot about it all.

In the last year or so I started remembering this, and fully grasping the seriousness of it. I was, and still am absolutely disgusted by myself. I went back and deleted all chats from that time of my life. I didn’t want, for one, such embarrassing messages for her to be accessible to me, and also I wanted to try and move on from that time and better myself. I saw her again one night when I was about 15/16. She didn’t seem hostile to any of us (the story I just told wasn’t the reason that we stopped being friends, I think she started seeing someone else instead of my friend and that was it). Nevertheless, the way I acted was abhorrent. I would like to apologise to her, but I feel that would be selfish, as I highly doubt she’d like to hear from me or be reminded of how the others and I treated her. 

There was also another girl I said some mean things to when I was about 12/13. Nothing as serious, but I reached out to her and apologised recently, and she said it was absolutely fine and she had always thought highly of me in the intermittent times we had seen each other between now and then. I think she forgot how I treated her, and to be honest, I have to an extent too, I just know there were times I acted rude towards her and called her things I shouldn’t have.

On top of this, I cheated on my first girlfriend when I was 16, kissing another girl. I barely cared until I heard her crying on the phone. I realise now how damaging that can be to someone and I would never ever do anything like that again. I feel awful that I could’ve done that. 

There are probably other specific things, but it’s also the way I got on and spoke when I was a younger teen. I would make horrible sexist or racist jokes for the shock value, even making rape jokes and saying the N word at times. I look back at that and cringe so much and hate that I ever thought these things were okay. When I was around 15 I fell into the alt-right rabbit hole watching those “SJW gets owned” videos, and while not digging at anyone’s political views, I allowed myself to justify being discriminatory or problematic and saying really awful things that I deeply regret now. It was only a year or two later when I started considering other political views that I was able to pull myself out of this and realise that some things that I was saying was unacceptable and really hurtful.

Also, in secondary school, I wouldn’t hesitate to make fun if some people if it would get me laughs. These people were my friends, and I still would be friends with them, but I took things way too far at times, and these were guys who were traditionally easy targets. I feel like a lot of this was down to my own insecurities and low self-esteem. I wish I had spoke up when they were getting ripped into rather than joined in. Again, I’m in contact with them and have good relationships, but still wish I hadn’t been such an asshole at times cause I realise now this probably hurt them way more than I thought.

That’s just some things that have been plaguing me with guilt, and there are definitely  more, probably all along the same lines. I suppose this is a vent, but I also just really want someone’s advice on how I can move past these things and be a better version of me and actually benefit peoples lives. I have CBT and an assessment booked for anxiety etc for other things, and I think i will try to deal with some of this guilt im feeling then, but if anyone who’s ever felt like this, or just has advice could help me, I’d really appreciate it.",30Dec2020,1

As an adult I’ve continued the cycle but abit less often. Usually it was because I was depressed, but recently I’ve started up again. I have a good job with great benefits and decent pay. I even like my job and all my coworkers. My girlfriend is probably the best friend and partner I could ask for. She does everything to support me and push me in the right direction. My home is decent and I have all I want. Literally couldn’t be better but recently (this past

466,"I'm F(21) a college student who lives in my uncle's house together with him and his new family. He's my mother's sibling, and there are 5 of them. Basically, my whole life we've been just living with my cousins' because among the siblings, my mom couldn't raise me and my brother alone(she's divorced). My uncles and aunties are all successful; happily married, lives in a big house with their family and have good-paying jobs. So as I mentioned, my mom couldn't raise us both so we just live where there is an extra space among her brother and sister's house(my uncles and aunts). 

In 1st grade, while we were living with my Uncle 1, My mom told me that he will send me to my Uncle 2 because he promised my mom that he will give me a good life. As a kid, I only cared about one thing; I get to live with my closest cousin and play with her more. I happily agreed and never thought about it as my mom giving me up because she can't provide for me. It was from a city to another. My uncle is rich. Anything he gave to her daughter, he gave to me. I'm the same age as her. For 2nd grade(my age was 7), my uncle sent me to a private school. It was the first time I went to one. I met many friends and a few close ones, but the difference I noticed is that I was happier when I was in 1st grade and I was kind of missing my friends from my old school. 

As time goes by with living in their home, I was noticing that my uncle's wife, (now his ex-wife) doesn't like me at all. She looks to me as if I'm an obnoxious kid. I can feel that since the way she acts and talks is that of a rich woman to a poor and dirty kid. She would scold me for the smallest things and watches everything I do. She doesn't like it that I'm too close to my cousins(her children). 

One night when we were all gathered in the living room, their whole family were talking about random stuff, I thought it was the perfect time, so I told my cousin to tell her dad, my uncle that I want to return to my mom and so she did, my aunt heard it and she told me to do what I want and that they were better off without me. She finished it off with telling me that I looked dirty before I lived with them and if I go back to my mom I would look like that again, implying that I look like what a poor girl would do. What hurt me that time is that they all laughed to what she said and I was sitting just across them holding back my tears, and I was only 7 at that time. 

After one year, my uncle didn't want me to go back but instead he insisted that my mom and my brother live with me and them instead. So we did, my mom worked for them by doing chores and doing the cooking and pretty much anything a maid would do. I felt happy because I get to live in a big house with my small family. After a few years, my aunt's treatment toward my mother changed. She would let her overwork herself and give off only a few money enough to provide our needs. My uncle believed whatever his wife was telling him and whenever each of them is angry towards my mom, they would both gang up on her. I felt really bad for my mom, and she endured that for years just for us, her children. 

A few more years, the family went separate ways, my uncle left my aunt because of affairs on both sides. We were left in the home with our aunt. It was still the same. Now that my uncle was gone, she would treat her worse. When one time my mom made a mistake, my aunt would shout on her and hurt her by throwing things to my mom. My brother and I was there when it happened and we were just crying for our mom since we couldn't do anything because we were too afraid. 

In 2016, my mom couldn't take it anymore and finally left there and went back to my other uncle, where she opened up a small store. I went to live with my Uncle 2 again, this time with his new family. Thankfully, his new family treats me better, but here's the issue; My uncle is still the same to my mom. He looks down on her just because she's indebted since my uncle technically provided for me until now. He thinks he can say anything towards her and thinks that she should always listen to what he says and stuff. I hate it when he does it. Just because my mom isn't as rich as him and he provided for us doesn't mean he can do and say anything bad to her.  He would occasionally do it to me too, and make me feel like I should be thankful because he gave me everything. I don't say anything towards him, I don't like what he does to my mom and me but I respect what he did for us. 

I'm in 3rd year college and I still live with him but my mom now provides for me; my school fees and my basic needs. I feel like if I graduate and finally get a job, I'm gonna have to repay what he did for me and I feel like he thinks that way. He might think that I would be able to help him financially as well as to anything else.
I don't like the feeling of not having a choice to what I am able to do. I feel obliged to return the favor, but I didn't ask for this. I didn't ask for my mom to send me to him, I didn't and I am not asking anything from him, he just keeps giving me stuff, and I am thankful for that, but I feel stuck and responsible for him because that's what he makes me feel. I may be able to help him sometimes, but I don't think I can do it all the time. My uncle is the type of man that gets angry and upset if you don't do what he wants, and I always go with it as long as I'm living with him since it's his home. He's proud and thinks he is always right. 

Can anyone tell me what I should do? I feel indebted and I feel like I forever will be.",30Dec2020,1
467,"NOTE: Before you read this and/or comment, I fully understand the potential health risks in relation to COVID-19. Australia (which is where I’m from) has pretty much suppressed COVID-19 transmission (excluding NSW) and everything is pretty much back to normal in my state. The whole point of this post is to ask for advice as to how to spend New Years outside home, when you haven’t got anyone to go with. Thanks for understanding.


Like most people probably know, this year has been a year no one has liked. I want to end it on a high note.

I’m thinking about spending it outside home and visiting a bar/club, but the only issue is that I haven’t got anyone to go with. Most people would probably think that it’s weird because they’re places that people go in groups and/or with friends, and that makes me anxious, especially when you have no one to go with.

Also, I’m 21, and still living with my mum, and my mum isn’t a party animal. She doesn’t let me go outside the home after 10:00pm, and I’m not usually allowed to go to a bar/club on my own. My mum will not be happy if I’m not home and am out late.

If I want to spend New Years outside home, and if I have no one to go with, what should I do if I’m on my own? By the way I hope everyone has a safe and happy new year!",30Dec2020,1

470,"Long story short this relative needs to put their house on the market by end of this week. The house needs to be cleaned up for pictures. Me and a few family members are going today and the next couple of days to get stuff done. 

The house owning relative is emotional. Cries when they get stressed, literally everything stresses them out. They will be zero help to the process. 

What’s the best way to deal with this behavior while still getting stuff done? We have a couple ideas to get them out of the house for supplies so we can have some uninterrupted time but need some back up advice too. 

The house isn’t dirty it’s mostly just clutter. Magazines, grandchildren’s toys that they’ve outgrown, stuff piled on all counters and chairs. Things need to be put in boxes and containers in the basement. 

The thing is this reLative has a clear list from their realtor about what needs to be done and they are wanting to do anything other than what is on that list. It’s frustrating. And they are argumentative. Cry immediately when questioned. Their typical line is ‘it’s MY house!’ Yes but YOU need help with YOUR house and It needs to be done!

I know I’m not going to get a thank you for my hard work and I don’t care about that. I just want this situation over with. I am determined to get this house cleaned. This relative has a fantastic opportunity that will not come up again if they do not sell this house right away. Friends of mine have pulled strings and favors so I just cannot let my relative fuck up this opportunity. 

The bones of the house are good. Realtor believes
It will sell quick if we can just get rid of the clutter. The mess is not the challenge, my relatives stubbornness and desire to add as much stress to every situation is the challenge. 

One example would be I suggested boxing up some of the dishes from her cabinets that she won’t need for the next few weeks. So if people want to see inside the cabinets nothing falls out on them. I suggested just keeping a few plates and bowls, and storing the other 30. She hysterically cried and claimed I was stressing her out. 

I don’t want to harm her mental state but damn it this just needs to get done! We don’t have time to huddle around her and console her as she cries over ridiculous things. She wants this move. All she’s complained about for years is how it’s too much house for to handle on her own. She found a new place perfect location everything she wants she was so happy. Now it’s time to clean her house she claims to hate so much and she’s putting in zero effort to get anything done. 

I’ll take any ideas or tips or tricks or anything from anyone who has gone through anything similar. Abandoning ship is an absolute last resort, I want to make sure I try my hardest before it gets to that.",30Dec2020,1
472,"So, my two roommates and I have been friends since middle school and are now in our early 20s. We have all three struggled with mental illness, but I am well now, and my roommate (L) is doing very well as well. My roommate (I) however; is dealing with some pretty serious stuff, some anxiety, depression as well as self harm and eating disorders, which she is getting help for, but is only in the beginning stages of recovery. 
A thing thats really difficult for her is when people are over for long periods of time, and when strangers are staying over. L has begun a pretty active dating and social life, now that her anxiety disorder is under control and she has guests over quite often. 
She had a booty call here from 4pm yesterday to 1pm today, and at 4pm today a friend of hers we have never met is staying over for the next 6 days. 
I has not come out of her room all day, and so I knocked to see if anything was wrong and she was sitting in the floor crying; she told us that she feels watched all the time and that the many guests make it very hard for her to relax and feel ay home. I totally understand that and am in the same way for the most part; and so was L all throughout high school where we had to go through a lot to be there for her and support her. She must have forgotten this because she didn't really connect the dots that having a stranger stay over for a week, when our roommate and friend is going through some rough things might not be a great support, but I don't really know if I can say anything. Her friend is currently living with her sister in the same city as us, so I don't think it would be a problem to maybe ask if the sleeping over visit could be cut down to maybe not quite as long. I just don't really know if it's in my place. I mean it is Ls apartment too and she can have people sleep in her room as much as she wants but I also feel like we should respect that I is going through some things, and it would be nice to accommodate her as we did for L a few years ago",30Dec2020,1

476,"My brother and I (35 and 32 years old respectively) moved into this great, affordable apartment in September 2018. Things were great until April 2019, when our downstairs neighbours moved in. They play loud, thumping electronic music up to 20 hours a day (and no, I'm really NOT exaggerating... my uncle and mom have come to visit and they simply can't believe how late it goes and how early it starts).

In April of this year I wrote an email to our landlord explaining what was happening. I pointed out a few things that I've tried to live by (and that my mom taught us as kids):
1) Listening to music, even loud music, is fine for brief periods during the day, after 10AM and before 10PM typically
2) I like electronic music personally, but cannot understand how they can listen to it for that many hours each day
3) That we had stuck a note under their door asking them to turn the music down after our upstairs neighbours banged on the floor one evening (assuming we were the ones playing the music, presumably).

We got a response from the landlord saying that he understood why we were so frustrated and would tell the superintendent to tell them to turn it down. And, for a short period (about 3-4 weeks) they actually did. It was blissfully quiet, or, when they did play music, it was fairly quiet.

But then it just slowly ramped up again. Last night, I was getting very annoyed by it (around 1AM) and so went down and knocked on their door. I asked them to turn the music down, and here's how the conversation went (paraphrasing):

""Hi, can you turn your music down please?""
""Are YOU going to stop?""
*pause while I try and think what we could possibly have been doing, sitting quietly reading at 1AM*
""Stop doing *what*?""
""Dragging your chair across the floor all the time!""
The conversation got pretty rapid fire back and forth as I asked what the heck he was talking about, we don't move chairs around, and then we both were getting angry. I pointed out that we literally were being deprived of the right to enjoy our living space, and he said that he couldn't enjoy his living space either (doubtful). He told me to have a good night, slammed the door, and I came back upstairs. Shortly afterward the music turned off for the night, thankfully.

Now, I need some advice on what to do next. After coming back upstairs, my brother and I discussed what was said, and it took us about 10 minutes of thinking to figure out what *might* be the issue. My brother has a chair and ottoman set from IKEA that he uses daily (especially as we are totally locked down right now) and when he gets up and sits down he, naturally, slides the ottoman slightly as he gets up. We think this is probably the noise they are referring to, but a) it's not *that* loud, b) it lasts for about half a second maybe once an hour, and c) playing loud music as ""retaliation"" doesn't do anything to solve the problem. I wish I had asked them ""Why is this the first we're hearing about this? Why haven't YOU complained or asked us to stop making noise? We would have *immediately* fixed the issue if it meant no loud music.

I could text the superintendent (which I think I'll do anyway just to let him know this confrontation occurred), email the landlord again, or I could potentially escalate by filing a noise by-law complaint with the city, or applying to the Landlord and Tenant Board under the ""unable to enjoy living space"" clause. Those are kind of nuclear options as they draw the landlord in and could be seen as us escalating.

I could stick a note under their door asking what I said above -- why is this the first we are hearing of this, how is turning your music up going to solve anything, how can you even HEAR a chair sliding around over your own music, etc.

Please, give me some advice on what to do next. I would rather de-escalate, but the guy seems... well, as someone with prior experience, he seems like a tweaker of some kind. I can't be certain, but I thought I could smell faint whiffs of crack smoke (it was hard to tell with my mask on) so I really don't want to make things worse with people into that sort of thing.",30Dec2020,1

Yesterday morning she wanted to talk again and she said that I cannot be more than a friend to her (She said she really liked me less than month before), so she went away all day and in the night finally she was able to talk.

It’s 5am. I haven’t slept and I need advice/to get this off my chest)
Some backstory so I absolutely hate awkwardness and tension. I tend to lack communication in the friendship department especially when they do something that gets me upset. I noticed I tend to bottle everything up until I cut them off then later regret not communicating. I’m a very sarcastic person especially around people i’m comfortable with. The type where you can’t tell if I’m serious or not sometimes. 

So i have this friend that can absolutely get on my nerves like none other. Ive tried having some serious conversations with her but it’s like talking to a wall. When something gets me very upset I tend to ghost her for 2 weeks pretty much then come back. Coming back she’ll sometimes say “Omg I thought you were so pissed and were about to drop me!” (And this was my most recent issue with her) and i don’t know how to be like “Yeah I was debating it because all you do is act like a white savior but then when I bring up you and your fucking family  being straight up racist to me for years. You suddenly can’t talk?!?” No apology not even a recollection. Not saying I want her to start sobbing at my feet begging for forgiveness but it’s just annoyinggg. I probably should stop being a snowflake and just let go of the past for that scenario but that’s not just it. It’s other things that just get me heated like perhaps the fact I can’t tell her shit because everything I say goes in one ear out the other. 

You maybe wondering why i’m still friends with her. Well at times we vibe when we hangout and can have a great time but also i stick around because a year ago she was at her worst and i left. I mean doing hardcore drugs at 14-15 years old. At the time I lived in a different city and after months of seeing her struggle and trying to get her help I decided to say “Either you get help or i’m leaving because I’m not going to watch you ruin yourself.” She y’know wasn’t too happy about that and chose drugs. Til 7 months ago she sobered up and reached out to me. I apologized for not sticking with her and We’ve been close ever since. Her mental health is unstable. I mean like truly bad. And I don’t want to fuck it up more (she’s admitted she’s codependent on me and all her other friends left when she was at her worst)

how am i suppose to set this straight?
do I need to rip off this bandage and put my big girl pants on and confront or are there any gentle people out there that have a different approach?

482,"I live in a condo in a good complex near a bad area. Last night I was watching TV in my living room when I heard someone open the storm door. At first I thought it was the wind. Then I heard the main door being manipulated. I was trying to comprehend why this was happening...was it a delivery person?(Amazon? FedEx?) Did someone that lives in my home get locked out for no reason late at night? None of these made sense, so I went to the door. I turned the doorknob to see if it was locked and when I did I could feel someone turning it against my hand. This meant the knob wasn't locked and someone was on the other side trying to open the door. Luckily the deadbolt was engaged so whomever was out there couldn't get in. But I definitely felt someone turning the knob against my hand. This freaked me the hell out so I punched the door to try to scare them off and it worked. This happened at 1120pm last night. I have a condo with 4 adults and 2 children living here and did not want to scare the kids so I didn't call the police. Instead I sat at the door with a knife for an hour or so and kept checking to see if anyone came back. During this time I tried to wake up my fiance who was dead asleep. Again, not wanting to scare the people I live with, I didn't make a big deal of it. I stayed up for another 5hrs until I fell asleep.
        I woke up at 650am when my fiance wakes up for work. I told her what had happened and she got upset that I didn't call the police. We have her brother, his wife, and their 2 toddlers living in our basement due to Covid. Sleep for all of them is not a common thing so I really didn't want to alarm everyone in the house by having police show up in the middle of the night. I kept thinking that there was some logical explanation to why someone was turning the doorknob at 1120pm on a weekday, and that calling the cops was an overreaction. Maybe a drunken neighbor during the holidays who went to the wrong door? 
        Overall, I need to know that the people in my house are safe. My fiance parks her car in the lot in front of our unit. For the almost 2 years we have lived here, she never felt the need to lock her car, against my advice, as this is a nice neighborhood.

485,"So, my mom declawed my sisters cat a while ago without telling me. 

I think it’s inhumane and I hate her because of it. 

Every time I play with the cat, i think of how painful and weird it must have been for him, and how he can’t climb trees like he used to. 

He can’t grab his toys and when I give him a toy with catnip in it, it’s hard for him to grab it and I can tell he gets a little depressed. 

She did it because he was scratching the furniture, but she also didn’t get him a proper scratching post. We had this cheap cardboard one, but she complained that the pieces would get everywhere. 

Ugh, I get so boiled up just thinking about it.

I don’t know where she went to get it done, but I hear most vets advise against it, and it was only after visiting a cat shelter that I learned just how cruel it is to have it done to a cat. 

So, I’m just wondering if this is the popular opinion, to think it’s terrible to declaw a cat? 

Also, if anyone had any tips for keeping my cat emotionally happy despite this procedure, that would be great. I try to be around him and keep him entertained and happy, despite my annoying , terrible-with-animals-parents.",30Dec2020,1
486,"I have baby fever. Not just like babies are cute, but like obsessively looking at maternity clothes and baby room things. I read about pregnancy and raising children whenever I have a moment. It’s consuming me. I’m 23 and married, we make fine money and own a house. I just got offered a position that I know will lead to a fruitful career. 

When I think of having baby we always said we would be 30 with a good savings living in our “forever home”. Somewhere up north like we were raised. I read about people being lucky to be young moms and running around at 40-45 with a young child is too tiring. Then I read about older moms saying they are so happy they got to live life first and make good money and travel.

491,"So I had a wreck back at the start of the year and it still runs, but just barely. Like the washer fluid reservoir is crushed, the radiator is damaged, the fan is destroyed, the hood itself is bent, the frame’s bent a bit as well, and basically the whole front frame needs to be replaced, body and all. It’s his car, under his name and on his insurance.

Well he gets other people who want him to work on their cars, they want him to split, load, and deliver wood, and to look at tree trimming/cutting jobs.

My car has been sitting at his garage for almost a year, and halfway through the year he got a donor car for it, and in the meantime to get to work and school he gave me his old car. However his old car started to have issues with the timing chain so he get extremely worried when I drive it.

492,"When I was seven and my friend was nine we always used to go to this girl house, which had a big garden and we used to play hide and seek for entire hours. One day I was the one seeking, and after 10-15 minutes I saw my friend with this other girl in a room, I was about to shout their names when I saw something that my seven years old brain could not elaborate: this little girl was naked on the bed and my friend was asking her to “jump” and to show private parts. I did not understand, as my main goal that afternoon was to find them and then drink lemonade, and I didn’t think about it for years. Now I’ve lost contact with my friend and I am 15. Some weeks ago I met the girl with the father, walking down the street, and it all came back in my mind.
I literally can’t stop thinking about this and I feel crap, what should I do? No one knows anything, and the girl doesn’t even remember what happened.",30Dec2020,1
493,"My sister called me to complain that her husband was being hot garbage.  She and I are in our late 30s and we've grown apart so I don't know 100% of everything that is going on with her.  She didn't invite me to her wedding.  If she had a baptism or christening ceremony for her kid, I didn't get to even hear about it.  It's like the only time she wants me in her life is when she wants to cry about her husband over the phone.

I will refer to my sister and her husband as Anne and Steve.  Anne got married and has a three-year-old, Billy.  Anne despises Steve.  Steve also wants a divorce.  Anne refuses to get a divorce because she's afraid of the negative effect this will have on little Billy.

I feel as though I've joined Team Divorce and we're recruiting.

Steve quit his job shortly after Billy was born, thus leaving Anne as the sole breadwinner of the household.  Steve has also claimed that he is too depressed to do much more than play with Billy.  He doesn't cook or clean, or search for a job he can handle.  He does, however, have the energy to spit on my sister, he verbally abuses her and he broke her nose at the beginning of December 2020.  She blames herself, which annoys me to no end.

My sister's therapist who I will call Dr. Kirsten, doesn't like to talk about my sister, she likes to talk about Steve.  She blames my sister for Steve's depression and says that my sister's abuse of Steve (occasionally hitting him, and certainly sometimes verbally abusing him right back - I have not witnessed these things, and don't know how they go) is making Steve worse.  Dr. Kirsten encourages Anne to blame herself.  From her profiles online, it appears that Dr. Kirsten is a drug addiction counselor, but as far as I know my sister is not a drug addict.

I told Anne to ditch the therapist since Dr. Kirsten is NOT helping her to manage her anger or talk in a coherent way with Steve.  I think the therapist is making things worse.  Anne has not followed my advice.  Anne was depressed before, now after two years with this therapist she's depressed, angry, and unstable.  I think she should take an anti-depressant, or at least talk with a mental health professional who can proscribe one, not Dr. Kirsten who just has state-issued licenses for talk therapy.

Actually, telling Anne that she needs to take her money out of their joint account and do other divorce things just runs into, ""I don't want to get a divorce, I'm afraid of the effect it will have on little Billy.""

Steve is a rich kid, and his plan seems to be to get alimony payments from my sister (50/50 custody of little Billy) until his mother dies and he inherits.  I think the more he provokes my sister, the more he can expect to get.  Steve has been divorced before, but hasn't had any other kids.  Steve also thinks he can continue to hold Billy as a sort of hostage and live in a house owned by my Dad, rent-free.

Anne doesn't really want my help or advice, she just wants a sympathetic ear.  She wants a therapist, or some authority figure that I will never be to tell her what to do.  As things are going, that person is going to end up being a judge.

What are the chances that Steve is going to put bruises on Billy and say they came from Anne?  Or put bruises on himself and say that he hit her?  He LIKES making her look unstable.",30Dec2020,1
494,"So me and this guy have been friends for 3 years now we used to be really close and hangout everyday and talk everyday till a few months ago he became super distant and pulled away like he takes hours on hours to reply back to me and then on top of that he never wants to chill with me anymore he’s always “busy”. I tried asking him if everything’s ok and he said ya and then I asked him why he’s moving like this and if I did anything wrong and he was trynna play lost and told me he doesn’t know what I’m talking about and that he’s just been really busy lately but idk if I believe that. 



What sucks is I have feelings for him and I would’ve done anything for this guy and he knows that too but yet he chooses to treat me like this now. So I know I need to Move on even tho I don’t want to. Now my question is how can I do that? 



Every time I try to he always pops up in my head like I can’t stop thinking about him and I can’t seem to hate him no matter how wrong he’s done me. I still miss him even tho I don’t want to.

497,"Also posted in r/dating_advice

I (17m) don’t know what it is, but I keep getting rejected. Okay so, here’s the deal... I get that rejection is apart of life and you can’t go through life WITHOUT being rejected. No one has ever not gotten rejected in their lifetime, it’s something that happens to everyone. However, I’m constantly, consecutively, getting rejected. 

As a little backstory, I’ve been talking to girls here and there and it usually ends up with us talking before they abruptly say “hey, I think we should be friends” and whatnot. So far that’s happened three times, one of which one girl(16F); I had asked her if she was willing to go on a date, she agreed but she was really busy. Then we eventually stopped talking and I figured “Yeahh, it wasn’t going to happen anyway.”  Then, with another (16F), we went on a date and it was perfectly fine! The date was really nice, actually. We had fun. Then push come to shove once I get home, I message her, she either says one or two things and then she gives me the big message. And after that, I had a feeling that maybe I did something wrong during our date. Maybe I didn’t do x, y, or z, but it looked like it was a good time. Flashback to now, I went on a date with ANOTHER girl (16F) and it was great. We were both awkward, but it was really cute. We took a selfie, walked around (since COVID), she even said how she wouldn’t ghost me and that she was willing to go on another date and said I was doing really well when it came to my cues and my hints at stuff and whatnot. After the date, we part ways, I text her, she doesn’t respond. The next day, I text her, not a response. Today? I get a response. 

She messages me saying how she reflected on Saturday and that, while I am a great guy, she’s not really looking for a commitment/relationship or anything right now and that she’s just putting it out there, and she thinks we’d be good as friends. Now, I’m no rocket scientist or dating expert, but I think that means I have no hope with this girl WHATSOEVER, if at all, and we’re probably not going to talk again. I told her I really liked her and that if she ever changes her mind she can let me know. Although, I’m convinced it’s best to leave things at that and I shouldn’t talk to her in mind that I’ll get lucky and something will turn up. No. 

What am I doing wrong? I swear I’m trying my best, I’m doing everything right. I really don’t want to die alone, that sounds so painful. I’m picky when it comes to dating in general, and the one time I think I’ve found the “right” one, it just... no. Doesn’t work out. Now I’m not gonna go on a rant and say “it’s not fair” or “nice guys finish last”, I’m just sick of hearing the same shit when I feel like I’m getting somewhere. Now I feel like every time I go on a date I should take it with a grain of salt and already think I’m going to get rejected ahead of time. 

So what should I do next time? What am I doing wrong? I’m trying the best to my abilities, but there seems to be an error? All the help is appreciated, thanks.",30Dec2020,1

501,"My brother is 23 and for as long as I can remember he has always been a bit of a hermit. He doesn’t have many relationships outside his online gaming, and never stays in touch with old university friends. 

He’s had a few jobs, most notably teaching English abroad in Spain, but because of COVID that has fallen through and is now back home. 

The problem is though he has become increasingly negative and angry. My poor mum (60) ferries him back and forth to his job and she admits to me she has becoming increasingly stressed. He is seriously ungrateful and literally saps the joy out of any event or situation. 

Whenever I come home from Uni they are constantly arguing, butting heads and never see eye to eye. He believes he is never wrong, arguing and arguing so he can prove his points. 

I think he was diagnosed with depression and given medication a while back but I am not too sure. I’m scared to ask him because I’d just be shut down and shouted at, or given some stupid look making me feel awful. 

What should we do??? Does he need to go back to the doctors? Is anger a sign of depression? I just feel so bad for my mum. She should be winding down and looking to retire soon, but she is so worked up and stressed because of my brother, life for her just is not enjoyable.

506,"this is a really long post sorry about that! btw sorry if this is written poorly

I have been friends with this girl for about 4 months now. At first it was great and all like most friendships and she did inform me she has anger issues and is deppressed. She mentioned that she has bad parents, and even though most of the things she classified as toxic were just her parents trying to help i dont want to invalidate that. Sometimes out of nowhere she will just start responding with ""k."" or saying things like ""shut the fuck up"" and when i get her to talk it ends up being because of a missunderstanding or something minimal. Once time i got a bit tired and she started threatening suicide so me and another friend of hers decided to tell the counselor. (that must have been a mistake on our part.) the days after she kept sending us texts of how badly we hurt her and how her parents yelled at her for it, and we both appolagized many times, i felt really bad about it. i just wanted to get her help. when i thought everything was resolved she would randomly just start getting mad at me and talking to other people about me so they would hate me, which resulted in them sending me harsh messages and blocking me which kind of hurt. The thing is she didnt do this to the other friend who told as well, because she had a crush on them i guess. she would do really mean things to me and then randomly stop and expect me to just forget. Last time she got mad for 3 days and just kept shutting me down and eventually she just said she was just mad online and not irl and she didnt know why. she would get mad about me hanging out with others even though i invited her, and then she just says stuff like ""oh nobody wants me there"" or ""i would just ruin it"". I dont know what to do anymore it all seems so random. The other day one of my friends texted me that she was talking to people in the bathroom about ""killing snitches"" but i dont understand since shes mad at me and not at the other person who told with me? i know she deals with mental illness so can i really blame her? what am i even supposed to do? i dont want her to hate me. i myself suffer with ADHD and am neurodivergent so i struggle alot with understanding this kind of stuff so im just really confused.

509,"So yesterday, I accidently blocked a friend while trying to turn on notifications for the chat that we were in. Until I blocked them, I didn't know how you could unblock someone. After finding out how to unblock them, I unblocked, but I then noticed that the chat that we were in didn't show up on my end until she messaged me back. When I was looking for the chat, I noticed that i could scroll down a little further down to people that I had convos with previously.(Usually there is a cutoff after a set number of people ) After realizing that I could just block and quickly unblock people to scroll down further and still be able to talk to people that I usually do when I get done, I decided to use it to message everyone that I have ever talked to on here ""Happy Holidays!!!"" since Christmas had already passed. After about 3 or 4 hours of me sending ""Happy Holidays!!!"" and then blocking and quickly unblocking people , I was able to go a little over two months back before the messages stopped sending and instead it turned grey and read underneath"" Failed to send Resend | Delete"". I just figured that I just simply couldn't text people after two months on not messaging at all. That was fine with me tho, it took a very long time to message all of those people , and I was getting kinda tired. So I decided to text the one friend from the beginning again... the same thing happened and i wasn't able to send the message. I tried with other people that I usually talked to, and once again, none of my messages went through. So now i can't talk to any of the people that I usually do because I sent too many messages to people that I haven't talked to in a while who most likely wont even respond anyways and I don't have any friends IRL.

510,"Is this weird/creepy?
Just to get this out of the way. I know it's normal for cousins to hang out/spend time with each other, but I think this is kind of getting out if hand.

So, to try keep this short somewhat, my cousin 26 (he) seems to hang with our younger cousin (she) a lot, aged 16.

Now this may seem normal at first, but they play footsies, hold/touch/poke each other a lot, like pretty much the whole night, and she puts her leg on his leg among other things.

He also use (lasted about 4 months or so) to have her finger print saved on his phone so she could pretty much unlock it whenever, and he doesn't even stop her looking through his phone (instagram, fb messages etc). Like, I and I'm pretty sure most of the population wouldn't let your own sibling use your phone.

There was also a time where we went out to eat, and I'm not sure if I heard correctly but he said that he carried her on his back so she doesn't get her new white shoes dirty.

The thing is, he can hang out with his cousins within his age group - like go try food places etc, which is generally his excuse when he hangs with her. Another excuse is that he says that all her friends switched schools, I don't see how this is his problem.",30Dec2020,1
511,"Title's maybe a little alarmist and throwaway for reasons. This is going to be a long one but I want to get as much of the story down and correct as I can because I am very much at my wit's end and need any help I can get.

Okay, so I work at a large university in the US. I'm in a very specific field that helps teachers do the stuff they need to do. My office is made of two teams, let's just call them Team 1 and Team 2. The teams merged a while back and now we're all one big happy family I guess. I am specifically an employee of Team 1, as everyone in our office is clearly designated to one of the two teams despite our merge. Confusing, I know, but bear with me.

Within Team 1, there is a singular manager (let's call him T), and he reports to the overall head of the office (let's call her K). I report to T, like everyone else on Team 1. T is not a manager-type and has no management experience prior to this position, which he has only been in for 2.5-3 years. He's a frustrating man to talk to even when he's not your boss (this has been confirmed by a number of teachers within the university who have shared opinions with me in confidence over the last couple years). When he IS your boss, he's insufferable.

**EXAMPLE:**  
Our university has been making a big to-do about work-life balance since we shifted gears for the pandemic. That was back in March. I, and everyone else in our office, work remote. I have been on a project for T for a couple months now and he's really been micro-manage-y about it. What's frustrating about him in this regard is that he wants things a specific way but never communicates what that is. So he micro-manages while *simultaneously* providing no guidance or expectations. So every project is a shot in the dark. So I'm working on this thing with him and I get a piddly question about it at like 7:30 PM one night. I had Outlook and Slack on my phone (I do not anymore), so I get a notification. And I respond to him with an answer and ask, respectfully, that next time something like this comes up, to please contact me during business hours.

BIG MISTAKE. He immediately schedules a meeting with me the next morning with no description or title (just ""check up"" which is always what his one-on-ones are called). This is how I knew I was in trouble because every time any of us get scheduled for a ""check up,"" it's disciplinary. But we're given no details or context (personally I believe it's so we can't prepare). So we have our little Zoom call the next morning and he first asks if I have any ""additional context"" for my email from the night before. I say no. Then he proceeds to talk for about twenty minutes straight about what employment at our university means, how we are classified as ""non-exempt employees,"" and how we are expected to work beyond normal hours from time to time. I am an adult man so of course I know this and have spent plenty of evenings in the office or on campus to do one thing or another in the past (not that I ever get thanked or credited for that). He tells me my behavior here was ""highly inappropriate"" and that was basically the end of that. I didn't really stand up for myself, something I'm still kicking myself over.

T has a powerfully fragile ego. He likes to joke around (he's not funny) and all when we're in bigger meetings, but the second anyone questions him at all (and I mean even completely innocent clarification stuff too), he changes on a dime. It's like working for two different people. There's the guy who wants desperately for you to like him and there's the guy who can't take any kind of criticism or input from his subordinates (though he would make sure to call us ""colleagues""). Personally, his whole being is just an antithesis to who I want to be as a person: he's disingenuous, scheming, and full of himself. He also does that thing where he will restate something a woman just said in a meeting as if he's presenting new information (I am male, but it's easy to notice because he does it *so much*). That's a little extra info just for you.

Then we've got K, who is... a bad person. All the way around. Being in administration has warped this woman, I guess. I hear stories about her when she was just a teacher many years ago and how she was this powerful feminist voice and super inspiring. But now, she's a complete drain and we all have to treat her like the Queen of England. There's no direct communication with her, everything goes through our HR/organizational person, unless she wants to get to US of course. She has no concept of how normal people live (she lives in a really nice condo downtown and makes a quarter mil or so a year). The stereotype of the person of ""clout"" who sees other people as ants? That's her. To the letter.

**EXAMPLE:**

Every year we have an employee ""retreat"" to team-build and such. The last one we had was the first following the merger, so it was different for everyone. There was a lot of tension going into the retreat and we kind of assumed it would be a for fun event to calm us down. Well... it wasn't. First off, they didn't tell us when or where the retreat would be until about three days beforehand. I raised some concern about this via Slack because if we're going somewhere, I have things I need to sort out. A number of my peers do as well: one had a pregnant wife ready to give birth any time, another had a medical condition they needed to be assured wouldn't be an issue, those sorts of things. I used the phrase ""dropped the ball"" in my attempt to get more info.

BIG MISTAKE. Turns out this whole thing was K's pet project (I had no idea) and questioning her leadership at all (even indirectly) was unacceptable. One of my colleagues has been with Team 1 for a very long time and she let me know K called her that evening and actually *yelled* about the ""disrespectful young men"" in the Slack channel. Keep in mind I, and the two others with issues I mentioned, were only trying to get information as we had TWO work days before we were going to go *somewhere* for this event.

I won't bore you with ALL the details of the retreat. But it was a nightmare. First off, it was hosted by a workplace mediator (YEAH), who was an old friend of K's by the way. So we got to communicate our feelings about things around the office we thought could be better, but our mediator essentially kept telling us ""management does everything they can for you, really."" And THEN we got called into private meetings WITH K to discuss the concerns we had brought up. Not to look for answers, mind you, but to be interrogated about WHY and HOW we could possibly feel that way. Mine was relatively calm and she was very kind to me directly, but I knew about the phone call and a couple of the other meetings and had been sweating it for days.

**CONCLUSION:**

So here's where I'm at: I'm miserable at my job. BUT we're still in a pandemic and economic gray area. AND the university isn't really hiring people right now (certainly not in my field) so I can't just transfer. AND I have to last until a bit into 2022 to keep the admittedly generous contributions to retirement that the university has put in as part of my benefits package SO quitting feels like leaving on the table on top of being scared shitless of the world outside.

One of my problems is that there is no separation from the work. Our management tries HARD to never let us go. K brought bottles of wine to each of our houses over this Christmas break. I don't know if they were hand delivered or through a service because I wasn't around when it showed up and also found it on my stoop two days later. Inside was a card thanking me for doing things I have been actively punished for by her and T, especially in the past year. They are so controlling that even though I've had a week off (and have a couple more days from now), part of my brain has been obsessing over this shit and driving me nuts. I'm going over arguments in my head that I wish I'd had, basically regretting not standing up for myself, but simultaneously acknowledging that any time I do, there are negative repercussions. I feel trapped and desperate and like I'm losing my mind. I KNOW I need to disengage from this stuff more/better and I have been trying, believe me. I'm reading a book right now about mindfulness and that follows finishing one on modern insecurities. But so far the information has not made it easier to live in my brain.

So, Reddit... What in the hell do I do?",30Dec2020,1

513,"This is a really tricky situation but I’ll try to explain it to the best of my ability. 

I’ve been best friends with this person since I was seven years old. We are now both twenty, so we have been friends for about thirteen years. 

He started hanging around this new crowd of people once we started going to college, and a lot of them have been victims of parental abuse and negligence. Now, my friend has this serious problem where he likes to one-up everybody because he enjoys being the center of attention, so recently, he has been making up stories to his friends and trying to get me to go along with them. 

He recently went as far as to posting about these stories online, where people we both know can see them, and I’ve had people reaching out to me about them. There was one story he posted where his dad “beat him until he was black and blue” and he had to stay home from school for “weeks in fourth grade because of it”. Many people believed him because he did actually stay home from school for a few weeks in fourth grade, and many people remember it...but it wasn’t because he was “beaten”. It was because he had salmonella poisoning. I visited him multiple times during the two weeks he was in the hospital. 

Whenever his friends want to talk about a problem they’re having with their parents, he has to tell them “his” problems instead. He’s making his parents out to be such horrible people. I’m not sure if there maybe times before we met where they had abused him, but every time I try to talk to him about it, he laughs and tells me to “calm down”. 

I’ve never heard of anyone lying about being abused. I mean, it seems really messed up, in my opinion. Maybe he isn’t lying, but all of these stories come out of nowhere and it’s just hard for me to believe them after being friends with him for so long, practically living at his house for numerous years and never seeing a single sign of abuse. 

What should I do here?",30Dec2020,1
514,"I am extremely thankful for the holidays because I needed time to break the monotonous routine of university online. 

At the same time, my brain has been lately focusing on issues which I would call trivial. For example, I have acne and scratch mark scars on my chest and belly and I find them hideous. Its taking a while to recover although I do have the correct products to treat it. 

Second trivial issue is the fact that I have these 2 lines on my neck although I am not that old (early 20s). Third trivial issue is the fact that I am not using my time as wisely before (this can be fixed though if I just do a little  it everyday). 

I might seem fixated on my looks probably but I do have skincare based goals that I want to meet. Overall I find the brain to be a scary thing because bad mindsets and focusing on trivial things wastes time and energy and its not very healthy for the brain. 

Despite realizing this, I am still falling victim to these trivial thoughts.",30Dec2020,1
515,"My girlfriend and I broke up today after a few attempts at a break up before. We still love eachother but aren't IN love and that makes things quite difficult but easier than if one of us had cheated or if it was sudden. We are still living together since we're still in lockdown and my financial situation won't allow me to move out. She says I can stay as long as I want which I appreciate and I honestly don't think things will be much different since we've been acting like friends for basically the last year(been intimate once since August 2019). 

My main question is how do I move on from this in my late 20s? I've always wanted to be a Dad and now I feel like time is quickly running out.

Also what do I do with all the trinkets and items we bought/made eachother? Surely I can't throw them out? How do I deal with all the positive memories we've had and deal with the fact I might never see her again? 

Apologies about the messy post. Can't think straight even though I know this is for the best.",30Dec2020,1
516,"Obligatory, mobile, bad formatting etc. 

My girlfriend got invited to a small NYE gathering and is planning on going. We have had a discussion and she knows this is the wrong thing to do as we talk about people we see on social media (including her friends) breaking the coronavirus restrictions we have in the UK. The current scale of COVID here in the UK is worryingly high, I haven’t seen any of my friends in months and have just been staying inside. My girl friend has been mostly the same although has seen friends here and there (potentially worth nothing we are not living together, although we did spend the whole of November together during lockdown).

Understandably, she feels lonely and wants to see her friends but I told her despite this, I would be disappointed in her if she went to her NYE gathering. She even knows it’s the wrong thing to do and is still planning to do it and it genuinely does annoy me that she’s being quite selfish about the situation but, I don’t want to fall out over such a small thing. 

We left it last night as me saying ‘you do what you want, you know my opinions on this, but I don’t want to go on about it and lecture you’.

My main question is, should I be prioritising her feelings over the risk of coronavirus? I obviously care about her and she has been feeling pretty shit and lonely, but so is everyone and I just think it’s quite selfish that she’s deciding to go out on NYE when we’re in such brutal pandemic.

Neither of us are in a bad mood at each other and everything is okay, but this situation is just playing on my mind and I’m wondering if I should just leave the situation as it is, or again air my concerns that she is doing the wrong thing and putting other people at risk? (Even though she knows this is the case and she cares about it, but it seems like she doesn’t care). I don’t want to stop her going out but I also know that this virus is not a joke and will not get any better if people keep having these little gatherings.

Again, sorry for any formatting issues and the rambling style, I’m just getting my thoughts out. Any advice is appreciated:)",30Dec2020,1

519,"I have always been very sexual and never really thought to much about it until the last 3 years. I have been married for 7 years and we have been together double that. Whenever one of us is traveling without the other instantly start planning and being a perv online. I find people and online play of sending them pics and vids of me doing inappropriate things. This never use to bother me until 3 years ago when I really thought about what I was doing. 

 These thoughts all started from a coworker coming on to me and I allowed her to touch me over my pants very briefly at work. I very quickly stopped her but let her do it again before telling her this can't happen and needs to stop. I told my wife about it and she didn't blame me since I never asked the lady to touch me. However I have felt guilty since that day and can't get it off my mind. I also did not tell my wife the lady tried to sext me several times after that and I would responded and few times before eventually telling her this needs to absolutely stop and she continued. I knew this was going ti cause me problems so I quit the job to get away from her and told her not to contact me and blocked her. She recently years later came out of the wood work and contacted me again, and Ignored it. But it brought everything back up and I feel like shit over it. 

I currently still watch way to much porn and while working from home during covid have been doing things for people on reddit. I can't seem to stop I have tried many times. I need to get help but I am afraid of what my wife will say if I go to therapy. I feel stuck and I feel awful and thinking back have done many terrible things I am ashamed of.

522,"I (25M) have been friends with let's call her B (25F) for a couple of years. We started as work colleagues and before you know it we became really close friends. B has been in a long term relationship for nearly 10 years (been dating her BF since HS). We both understood that our friendship is strictly platonic and I assured her I would always respect her relationship. Over the past couple of years, we spoke nearly everyday with each other about all sorts of topic. We would send long texts, voice messages and played video games online together while on the phone. We did activities such as biking and meditating. It was a really great friendship. However, the past few months I started having feelings for her. I felt really guilty but I consciously made sure I did not say or do anything that would disrespect her relationship. I held my tongue about my feelings until recently. Due to COVID we could not meet in person so I sent her a message something around the line of 

""Hey I have feelings for you but I told you I was always respect your relationship so I think it is best that we stop speaking. Etc...""

She responded kindly saying she is sad but appreciated me letting her know. She agreed that we should stop talking and also mentioned she cared a lot about me as a friend and wishes me the best.  

Side note - I had major depression that B helped me through. I remember one day in particular (maybe few months back) I felt really down and she called me to just listen and be there for me. A few weeks later she sent me a gift which really touched my heart. I have talked about my depression to many friends but no one went to the same extent to help as she did. I think it was at that point I realized I may be in love (which sounds silly but I can't control my feelings).

I lost a really dear friend and now I am thinking I should have just kept my mouth shut and held my tongue as I'd rather have her in my life as a friend than nothing at all. I am not sure if I did the right thing or not. I really miss her and it just sucks so much to lose her as my friend. At the same time I am in love with her and think about her everyday so maybe its just a bitter sweet ending. A memory I should just cherish and move on.

Its been about a month since we had the talk and dk I am just confused and heartbroken about all of this. I am mainly heartbroken that I lost a best friend not because she does not share the same feelings.

Did I do the right thing by ending our friendship? Or should I just message her and let her know that although I have feelings i still want to be friends and see her response.",30Dec2020,1

524,"Hi everyone. I (23F) am an international graduate student at a university in the US, but I had to attend the fall semester from my home country because they kept cancelling my visa appointment. I fully attended the semester online with synchronous classes for which I had to wake up at 2 am because of the 8-9+ time zone difference. All my meetings with professors, school conferences and group projects were a pain to deal with because I constantly had to adjust to the time in US. I basically had no schedule during the entire semester &amp; it was most definitely one of the hardest school terms for me. It took a huge toll on my mental health &amp; had to start therapy because of how worse I kept on getting. 

Now, my family doesn’t care mental health. As long as I’m home, they are happy with that, but more so because my parents felt safe that I was with them during the pandemic &amp; they didn’t have to worry about me being alone. My home country has finally lifted the travel ban which has been in effect since March I believe. And because of that, we have very few cases &amp; life is back to normal. Masks are mandatory everywhere but all businesses are open and we have less than 200 cases in the country daily. Now the numbers have dropped below 100. Because I really don’t like my life in my home country &amp; my mental health declining in fall, I wasn’t really happy with my circumstance. My visa appointments got canceled five times &amp; each time I got more upset. I did my undergrad in the US and I loved my life there. I have freedom from home &amp; as a woman, I feel more at comfort in the states. I never knew life had so much to offer until I left which is why moving back home has be extremely difficult. 

Currently, I’m on winter break &amp; I finally got my student visa and I can travel! I really want to be in the US for my spring semester and I know for sure that I don’t want to deal with the time zone difference again. However, my family is NOT happy with it. They think I shouldn’t travel and don’t think being depressed justifies leaving my home country. I have been very cautious in terms of social distancing &amp; only leaving the house when I really need to, but they don’t think I will be safe there. I’ve tried to convince them that I won’t leave my apartment, and I will only be focusing on school but they are still talking me out of it. I understand where they are coming from, but I wish they’d at least respect my decision if they cannot support me. 

I fully understand how bad the cases are over there but I’m know I will be much happier there because being home feels like I’m suffocating. In the US, I will gladly stay in my apartment 24/7 if I need to as long as I don’t have to deal with the time zone difference. I also have to work next semester at my department because I need experience in my field. Although my work will be remote, it will be much easier for me to do my best if I’m fully awake and not half asleep on Zoom. 

I’m not sure how else to seek help or a little support, hence this post. I feel really confused and lost. I want to leave but I have too many doubts now. If i do end up getting COVID in the US, my family will be really upset and it won’t go well for me. But, according to them, if i catch it in my home country that would be okay cause I’m home. Now do I still go? Or do I make myself suffer through another semester?",30Dec2020,1
525,"Awhile back I started dating this girl. It was my first relationship and I was fairly excited about the whole thing. It lasted about 6 months until it fizzled out and we decided it'd be best if we remained friends.

_____________
We continued talking for another good 3 months until she went to someone and said that during our relationship, I was trying to ""force"" nudes from her. That I was emotionally manipulating her for them and that I wouldn't back down.
____________
The thing is, that isn't the case. At least from what my view on it is. Yes, I asked. But I'd always made sure to add stuff like ""if you're uncomfortable, please don't force yourself to do so"" and ""It's fine if you say no"".
To add to this, it wasn't like I was asking at random times. I'd always do it when I thought she was in the mood, which was quite often mind you.

_______________
She'd always send me hentai and yiff related things. And this was All. The. Time. Morning? I'd wake up to 5-8 images. Afternoon at school? Have a batch of 10 images. While I'm laying in bed? Check out this really hot hentai image I found.
______________
I always took it as she's in the mood, I'm now in the mood. Wouldn't hurt to ask if I could see her.
This also relates to the whole thing... someone who talked to her showed me their DMs between them. They asked her if she ever confronted me and told me that she was uncomfortable. To which she responded ""no, it should've been obvious"".

_______________
It wasn't, at least to me who has no prior knowledge on dating and how to read someone's text as being uncomfortable or anything like that.

_______________
Am I in the wrong here for asking for the nudes? Or is she trying to blow something out of the water here? I'm really trying to get a concrete answer for the next time I date someone so I don't do the same thing to him/her.",30Dec2020,1
526,"I have an amazing guy that I want to be with, but there are two things holding me back. I am a big overthinker so I just wanted some other opinions to help see things from a different angle. First, he's not very good at making decisions. To further explain it's like the decisions don't even come to thought. like he can't think of choice a or b alone. For example: He fell asleep while driving into his neighborhood and hit a neighbors mailbox. (don't worry I went off on him for it!) He didn't remember hitting it so they came by the next day and told him they saw him do it, and that their mailbox was worth $200 and that he would have to pay that. He was just okay with it, but I told him to go over there and see the damage himself and see if their mailbox was worth that price. I understand what he did was wrong, but that doesn't mean someone can't take advantage of you when you were in a weakened state. The thought to go look at the damage never came to mind, and this happens frequently with other issues too. I always find myself having to break things down for him all the time and doing some hand holding. I know I have to decide if it's a dealbreaker for myself, but am I overthinking that this is an issue? How would you handle a partner that's this way? Secondly, whenever I do give my opinion his default response is majority no. I know I don't want him to accept everything I say as right, but it's like without even taking into account what I said he's like no right away. For example: He ate at a restaurant he hadn't eaten at in years yesterday. This morning he told me he wasn't  feeling well. I said well maybe it's the new restaurant you ate at yesterday. He automatically said no like that couldn't be an option. He said he ate there 12 hours ago, and already used the bathroom afterwards and was fine. I said sometime it doesn't happen right away it takes time to get sick. I asked him if he tried any other new foods and he said he tried new chips. He kept telling me it was the chips and not the new restaurant food. Now, I know I can be wrong but it's like he's always ready to tell me I'm wrong automatically. I'm really bothered by this and I can't stop thinking about it. Am I overthinking? Would you be able to be with someone like this if everyone things else is perfect?",30Dec2020,1
527,"I (turned 18 this October) used to play a lot of games. I was very fond of games since my childhood. I used to play on whatever platform I was offered to play games on. In early childhood, coming from an under-developed/developing Asian country, I had not much to game on other than keypad mobile my parents used to have, T.V, video game that was gifted to me, and later  in our PC that was brought home for my sister when I was in grade 3 and used to sneak in and play whenever she was not home.

I was not necessarily the most hard-working student yet I was sharp minded and used to do well in class despite low to no effort and end up being the class topper. I had no PC of mine, I was still sharing PC with my sister until grade 10. As I was going into higher classes, I was being more hardworking and meritorious student. I ended up being a Valedictorian with a GPA of 3.90/4.00. I used to play games like age of empires, CS source with bots, Need for Speed, Road Rash, WWE, GTA, World of Warcraft: Frozen Throne, Diablo 2, FIFA 2005, FIFA 2007, FIFA 2010 etc. which were usually offline. I was extremely fond of each and every game but had limited access and were offline so I wasn't addicted as of that time though I could go hours playing If I had no one home.

I got own smartphone once I graduated middle school and sister already had her own laptop so the PC was also officially mine. Didn't have the latest specs, but was okay enough for moderate gaming. I installed COC in phone once I was done with middle school and played up until TH7 and I was bored and switched to Clash Royale and  then comes my first addiction. I was so hooked I used to push ladder, play average of 3-4 hours of Clash Royale daily for 3 months continuously. I did terrible in my exams and my parents knew I was addicted knowing how often they saw me engaged in phone. Also, one day I was hardcore pushing ladder and I lost of game because of internet disconnection and I raged and ended of punching my phone and broke it's screen. I instantly regretted and my parents said they'll have it repaired once I was done with board exams of grade 11. I studied well and scored 3.75/4.00 GPA. My phone was repaired and I was no longer addicted as I knew the game itself wasn't so fun and had me raging most of the time. Maybe the phone broke for good.

I was doing well in studies, had normal life, everything was fine. I wasn't addicted to any specific game but I was addicted to gaming itself. My classmate used to play Counter Strike 1.6 since our PC didn't support CS:GO and we couldn't buy it either. He used to talk about CS and he didn't encouraged me to play, I wasn't pressurized but with my history with CS Source, I wanted to try CS 1.6, play with friends, have fun and be good at it. I started playing CS passionately after I returned home from school for 4-5 hours daily even when I had no friends to play with. Playing random pugs with random people was my daily lifestyle. I started skipping assignments, flunked Chemistry classes and was hooked on CS for so long that I was average/ below average student. I ended up scoring 3.40/4.00 in 12th standard and was disappointed in ownself as well as disappointed my parents.

I was on a vacation there onwards and decided to pursue degree in Computer Science and Engineering. My PC hard disk was dysfunctional suddenly and I only had my phone in the vacation. Again, back to Clash Royale but not as addicted as earlier. Moderate gaming, heavy Youtube and movies. As the vacation was ending and my entrance exams were nearing, my parents bought me a brand new phone, Galaxy S9+ which was latest flagship of Samsung at that time. PUBG mobile was extremely popular and almost every friend were hooked on it and one day I decided to play it ownself too due to peer pressure and wasn't fond of it and didn't play it at all then onwards. I gave my entrance examinations, was enjoying vacations binging web-series and playing Clash Royale once in a while. Did pass the entrance examinations but wasn't eligible for scholarship and coming from upper middle class, my parents could barely afford my education which is quite expensive.

Now comes, MAJOR addictions.

College was about to begin in a month or so and then there was hype of Call of Duty : Mobile and I was also hyped for it and played it in its release of first day and LOVED it and was hooked on then onwards. I was addicted and I knew it and thought I would stop ASAP once the college starts but College started and I was pushing rank in COD : Mobile playing at least 6 hours a day to even 10 hours a day. The addiction was real and I wasn't even well aware of it. Took college lightly and played games after college to late night. My sleep schedule was already messed up since couple of months of vacation and late night gaming. I used to play at least till 12 A.M everyday and sometimes even upto 3-4A.M. Used to fall asleep in class and also scolded by professors and excluded from class. Yet, I played and played. All of a sudden, I lost my phone on my way back home and we did report to police yet it was not to be found. I was super addicted and I had no functional PC and no phone that could run COD: Mobile. I used to sleep most of the time then onwards, started doing assignments due to compulsion yet deep down inside I was desperate AF to play games and  had my PC repaired and also upgraded it's graphics card, added extra RAM.

Now comes another tragic addiction. CS:GO was already F2P. I had a lot of my classmates playing it, I/We even used to go to cyber cafes and spend a lot of my pocket money playing CS:GO and lying at home making excuses to waste money and time before I had my own PC rebuilt. I started playing CS:GO and I was super addicted. Board exams of first semester were near and Parents knew I was addicted. They decided to unplug PC until my exams were over. I still procrastinated and didn't study until eleventh hour and studied before 10 days of exam. I did barely enough(results aren't out yet) in the exam as I didn't prepare well. Remaining 5 exams got cancelled due to COVID outbreak.I was actually starting to feel better without any games, frustration of ranking up and  without raging. Life was fine, I started talking to a girl I had a crush on. Turned out she liked me too. I started spending my time binging series, building a relationship with her which felt so much better than gaming and it's frustrations. I did almost nothing productive in near 5 months quarantine yet I successfully forged a relationship with her.

Online classes resumed, we had less time to talk. Parents bought me a new laptop, better specs than PC, sister bought herself a new phone and handed her old phone to me which was also S9+. I started playing CS:GO like crazy again.  Since we shouldn't be going to college and all day at home, I pened Zoom in background and play CS:GO almost 6-7 hours daily and I even had 128 hours of playtime in two weeks at a certain time , watching live streams, watching every CS:GO event and what not. I was crazily addicted. Semester ended and I had no freaking  idea what was taught, paid little to no attention. I did do assignments, but, it was all copied from friends  as I was doing it just for the sake of doing assignments and I had no clue what I was being taught. Exams date were published and exams of first semester which was postponed due to COVID outbreak was to be resumed too.

I decided to quit gaming  altogether as It brought be no joy and fun playing, constant stimulation of brain, dopamine overdose that I was not a happy person as I used to be, frustrations, rage, lack of sleep, extremely poor academics and pretty much everything was fucked up by now. I stumbled upon this sub reddit and was motivated to quit gaming and I did quit CS:GO but, it lasted only for a week.I played for a week and find it no fun and only frustration and removed steam and every game on my laptop and PC. I still watched live streams since I was easily bored and resisted the temptations to play CS:GO. And now comes another addiction, I stopped playing CS:GO and had no games on my phone either but since It is so easy to remove and reinstall games in phone, I installed COD: Mobile, Clash of Clans and I started playing again. I used to play COC while playing CS:GO too. CS:GO in Laptop and COC in phone. Since, I uninstalled CS:GO, I was hooked to COD: Mobile all over again and started pushing rank not because I was enjoying it a lot but I wanted to achiever top rank(Legendary) which I had already achieved in season 1 and wanted to achieve again and grinded again, everyday 5-6 hours, COC around 1-1.5 hours and social media too.

Coming to present, I have my exams extremely near, to be exact January 14th onwards, and I know almost nothing and how I'll even pass the exams. I played roughly 40+ hours COD this week and I played COD from 8:00 A.M. to 3:12 P.M. with breaks in between and thought I am done with gaming and all this shit dopamine that it releases and frustrations and I'll stop wasting time over it and uninstalled both COD and COC from phone and I have no game in my PC either. Also, I wanted to write this post back then as soon as I stopped gaming yet I wanted to study for a couple of hours and see If I, once a valedictorian, can even study at all and I studied for 30 minutes or so before I was sleepy and had headache due to intense gaming and improper sleep since a week or so.I took a nap, woke up and did little bit of studying , had dinner and posting this right now.

So, I am just 18 year old guy and already in second year of college( I was bright student in childhood so I skipped grade 1 and grade 6 as teachers and parents thought I was capable of recovering by the end of middle school and it'll be better for me in the long run) I am/was in process of ruining my life due to severe gaming addiction of all sort. A lot of damage may have already been done, but, since life is long and I am strongly committed and determined to quit gaming once and for all this time( I actually hate gaming, I don't want to touch games at all, even moderately). My academics are extremely poor and it is my major concern as of now. In the long run, I want to be happy person, , quiz, listening podcasts, improving academics, being more social as I was earlier, enjoy reading books as I used to enjoy before being addicted to gaming.

I have a family that loves me, I have a wonderful girlfriend who loves me, handful of genuine friends. The only problem is with my addiction and my extremely poor academics. I am in the abyss of my life right now.

I feel like shit right now and my exams are from January 14th and there's high probability I may flunk all my exams but I don't want to. Wondering If It's even possible to make it at least barely enough that I don't fail. 15 days preparation leave and then 3 days gap for each exam and total of five tough subjects exam( Jan 14th-Jan 30th) . A lot of damage has been already done and I wonder If I can even recover and how long it may take?

Firstly, I am very glad and thankful to whoever took time to read it and I would like any queries If you have any and also, most importantly advice and suggestions. :)I hope you have a great day ahead. My best wishes are with you. &lt;3

Well she told me yesterday she's been selling these vids online for a couple of months now, Apparantly there is a big market out there. Right as I heard this I just walked out of the house and went home.

She's been blowing up my phone calling me unsupportive. And tbh I am not unsupportive she can do what she wants but she didn't tell me.

532,"I’m a young female. I have an older sister and younger brother. Let’s start with my older sister. She’s more religious, I’m not as much. She lives in the suburbs and has kids, I live in the city and don’t and pretty much live independently. We live about 30 miles from each other. 

Ever since we moved to this country together, she’s been trying to act like a mother to me instead of a sister. Over the phone, or every time I visit her, she always has something to say about my lifestyle or unsolicited advice to give as to how to “fix my life”. At first I took it but now it’s too much. It’s gotten to the point where it’s incredibly overbearing and she always wants to control me and get angry about something to do with me. 

Not only is it about my lifestyle and values not matching hers, but she also now (and has been for a while) hurls insults at me when I do something she doesn’t approve of. So far she’s called me whore, street walker, lazy, loser. Now it’s spilled into her saying I “always cause problems” for example when I call my brother out on our family chat for making fun of my friend fiancé ‘s appearance (he always makes fun of my friends). 

When I call either of my siblings out for this behavior, for example on our family group chat, they always lie and deny that they were trying to do what they did (for example, control me or make fun of my friend’s), just so they can appear good to my parents. Then my parents get angry at me and think I’m instigating problems when my sister does 99% of the time. 

Why are my siblings like this? Why are they always gaslighting me? They make me feel crazy. I’m unemployed and have nothing stable in my personal life either, and they’re both gainfully employed and coupled up or have kids. I didn’t ask for my life to be this way. I’m trying to fix it. Yet I feel they’re always attacking me when I’m the weaker link here, just because I call them out on their bullshit behaviors.",30Dec2020,1

536,"Honestly not even sure where I need to start with this. Some setup, my divorced dad (call him Bob) got remarried when I was very young to my stepmom (call her Kelly), and then they had my half-sister (call her Elizabeth). Elizabeth is about 19 right now. I’m 12 years older, got my own family, and living 4.5 hours away. Elizabeth was living with Bob and Kelly, and just finished her first year of college. My parents and Elizabeth have had issues ever since she was about 15 years old, but since I’m living so far away and only see them at most one weekend every other month, I had always chalked it up to normal teenage angst. It got bad, and it stayed bad all the way through now. That’s the setup.  
  
This is the incident that caused the whole thing. I guess I’m the neutral third party, because a couple months ago, both Bob and Elizabeth separately called me bawling their eyes out telling me two very different versions of the same story. According to Bob, the fight started because Elizabeth was staying out late, partying every night, skipping class, misses assignments, and culminating in her bringing home a 40 on her first exam. It turns into a full screaming match, Elizabeth tries to leave, the fight continues into the garage, Bob went to grab her by the shoulder to stop her from leaving, Elizabeth loses her balance and goes to the ground, Elizabeth looks at Kelly and says “Are you just going to stand there and do nothing, you useless fucking whore?”, and Kelly slaps Elizabeth. According to Elizabeth, the fight started over nothing and Bob just started giving her shit for no reason, ends up in the garage, Bob grabs Elizabeth by the throat and bodyslams her to the concrete, Elizabeth says, “Are you really going to stand there and do nothing while he assaults me?”, and Kelly punches her in the mouth while she’s on the ground. In both versions, the boyfriend (call him Cole) shows up to pick her up and she’s been living with him ever since.  
  
What sucks is, I don’t know who to believe. To my knowledge, my dad has never lied to me, even on things that makes him look bad. At the same time, I have caught Elizabeth lying to my (and other people’s) face, so it makes it hard for me to trust what she’s saying. Growing up, Bob slapped me on the face one time, and that was it. Beyond the pale not ok, but he was by no means a serial abuser towards me. Given how bad this got, even though he said he didn't, I would have believed her if she said he slapped her in the face (again, not ok at all, not excusing it). But grabbing her by the throat and bodyslamming her onto the concrete is completely unbelievable to me. The line about Kelly punching her in the face is also unbelievable. If Bob himself hadn’t told me, I wouldn’t have even believed she had slapped Elizabeth. She’s a very timid woman, I’ve never once seen her raise her hand in anger. She didn’t even spank growing up. A slap blows my mind. A closed fist punch in the face while Elizabeth is crying on the ground is something I can’t even wrap my mind around.  
  
All of that was a couple months back. Part of me wants to say it’s not my business and taking sides will only make things worse. I’m not even in the same state as them, she’s living with someone else and off to college, I’ve been doing what I can on the phone to calm tensions where I can, and that’s about it. My hope was the distance between them would cool things down. Unfortunately, it’s just been festering ever since. My do-nothing strategy has predictably done nothing, and it’s only getting worse. My sister called me not too long ago with more allegations against my dad. A couple years ago, she injured her leg pretty badly falling off a horse (she races them). Had to do physical therapy, wear a knee brace, whole nine yards. She is now claiming that what actually happened was Bob kicked her in her knee hard enough to do damage, and made her blame it on the horse. Bob, of course, completely denies this. FWIW, I talked to her on the day it happened, and didn’t sense anything was wrong. She was mad about falling off and mad she was going to miss time before her next race, but at least on the phone, I didn’t get any indication at all that my dad had abused her to the point of going to the hospital, needing physical therapy, and then forcing her to lie to me about it. I got the sense she was frustrated (not scared), but again, it was over the phone, so I can't say for certain.  
  
And that’s where I’m currently at. At face value, I’m tempted to believe my dad’s version of events. To my knowledge, he has never openly lied to me (Elizabeth has, multiple times), and his version lines up closer to my own experiences with all three of them (Elizabeth’s description of how everyone behaved is beyond foreign to me). So at face value, I’m tempted to believe his version of events, or if the truth lies somewhere in the middle, it’s probably leaning his way. But at the same time, if Elizabeth is NOT lying about what happened, then that makes him a serial physical abuser spanning years, and I can’t just ignore that. My wife has put her foot down and is forcing me to get involved after she got to witness firsthand the latest blowup this past weekend, but how am I supposed to get involved when I don’t even know what’s real? I’m 4.5 hours away hearing one-sided versions of events at a later time, how am I supposed to fix anything? But on the flip side, as I said above, my do nothing approach is doing nothing, and things are only getting worse. I’m in an entirely different state listening to my family tear itself apart one phone call at a time. I do think I have some advantages in this situation. Even though I’m not physically there, I’m on good terms with both parties, I can openly contact both parties, and I’m hearing both sides of every story. I’m hoping that means I can do SOMETHING to help. Any advice on what that something is?

537,"So my sister’s school has been giving out rations for weeks now because of the pandemic. Once every other week we get a bag on our doorstep that is FULL of food, water, cereal, produce, bread, milk, toilet paper, napkins, sanitary products and more. We’re very grateful for this but we recently realized that we may have been accidentally put on the list to receive this. I talked to to all my friends (who are also not getting this) and we think that the people getting this are probably the families that are listed as low income, or the people who’s kids get school provided lunch. Again, we’re very grateful, but at this point we’ve gotten 5 bags and we’re getting worried someone should be getting them instead of us. Other than perishables, everything from the last 3 out of 5 bags is untouched. We’ve contacted the schools and whoever we were talking to said they don’t know how it’s determined who gets these. Out of 4 people in my house, 3 of us still have a job currently (Mom, Dad, and me.)

539,"I'm just a complete failure and loser in every way possible. I've never been talented at anything and never will be. I wasted my childhood and my potential being a moron and playing video games instead of thinking of my future. I actually had one at that point, but now I'm fucked.

I'm 20 and have achieved absolutely nothing. I will never amount to anything now because I'm stuck being me. A waste of space. I can't change who I am anymore because I'm too old and who I am is set in stone. I'm destined to be this stupid, ugly, worthless, loser for the rest of my life.

All I have are negative memories, thoughts, and feelings, 24/7. I don't think I've actually ever been truly happy once in my life. Everything I've ever done has been a coping mechanism to escape reality.

542,"Sorry, this is a long one.

So I’ve (F24) had this friend (M32) for about 4 years now. We’re work colleagues and when we met I was a student on a working placement year at university. 
During our first year of friendship he told me he had feelings for me but it wouldn’t effect our friendship, he just thought I should know. I am not attracted to him whatsoever, I just wanted to be friends. 

A year ago he was promoted to team leader and is now my boss, but I don’t think of him as my bos because we’re close friends.

Everything was fine until September of this year. The pandemic has been hard for him as he lives alone.
In september, he went on a holiday for a week. While he was away he started messaging me regularly, which was fine. He came back and everything was fine and normal.

Then he started messaging me every evening, asking what I was up to and trying to make conversation. I didn’t always reply because:
a) Sometimes I didn’t have the energy to have a long conversation with him after spending most of the work day with him and talking to him then.
b) I’m gaming with some other friends and I’m not looking at my phone.

So it went on like that for a couple of months.
Mid November, he send me a long message about how he’s not sure where the line is in our friendship, he wasn’t sure if we were flirting. I made it clear again that I’ll only ever see him as a friend.

Start of December, I went on a date with a new colleague (M24 who is a placement student like I was when I started with the company 4 years ago) on a Saturday night. We’d only decided it was date the day after when we went on a run together. We decide that we don’t want to tell anyone in work because we don’t know where’s it’s going and it’s early days etc.
So Monday my friend asks how my weekend was etc etc and I was vague about it.

So my date and I decide to have a date at my place the following Saturday. 
So Saturday night I get a call from my friend saying that he bought some beer for himself and he bought some for me as I might like it and asks if he can drop it off. I panic and say yeah because I’m an idiot and couldn’t think of an excuse as to why he shouldn’t.
So he comes over while my date is upstairs so I sort of just stay at the door and don’t invite my friend in, which is probably what I would’ve done even if I was alone.
We chat for a bit and then he leaves.
He messages me later on saying I could’ve said no if I had someone over, so I cave and tell him that our colleague is at mine.
He replies saying that he had his suspicions but he’s really upset that I lied to him about being alone etc and he wants to speak to me the next day.

So Sunday he comes over and we have a long chat, he says he’s been trying to get closer to me the past few months because he feels we’re really good friends. He says that he tells me things that he doesn’t tell anyone else and that I’m such a close friend. It really hurts him that I don’t reply to him all the time and he’s really struggling with being alone. He can’t believe that I felt the need to lie to him about having someone over etc etc 
So I promise that I’ll be better and reply more.

So now this is the week before christmas and I’m off work until the new year.
He calls me monday night, tuesday night and then we go for a long walk on Christmas eve and to me everything feels back to normal and great.

So Christmas day, I was unable to go home to visit my family due to UK lockdown restrictions. Luckily my sister and her girlfriend live a couple of doors down from me so we were able to have christmas together. 
My friend is able to visit his family on christmas.
So my friend messages me xmas morning and I reply until sort of mid-morning when my sister and I start cooking the xmas dinner. I don’t reply to him the rest of the day because i’m on video calls with family members and just generally not on my phone.

Boxing day I send a message saying that I was really busy. I may have sent it a little harshly I’m not sure.
But to start he responds with ‘sorry, I’ll leave you alone now’ but then sends another saying ‘Actually I’m
not sorry’ and goes on a long rant about how he feels he’s putting so much effort into this friendship and I didn’t realise when he came to my house the week before that he’s ‘close to disaster’ and he can’t eat or sleep and is constantly checking his phone to see if I’ve replied. 

I respond saying that christmas is family time for me and it was emotionally exhausting being away from them and I wasn’t really on my phone. 
So I also changed my whatsapp status so people can’t see when I was last online because I KNEW he’d bring that up.

The next response from him is that he can’t keep doing this and he just wants to be my closest friend and I keep building walls that he just keeps hitting. He’s felt like this for months, but he only told me about this last week. He got upset that I felt the need to hide my online status as well. He wants to take a break and not talk to each other outside of work or group video calls (we’re both in a friendship group with 4 other people).

I respond saying that I’m his friend not his partner, if he’s ‘close to disaster’ I suggested to speak to Better Help because I’m not a therapist and if talking/not talking to me is hurting him so much he should actually speak to someone OTHER than me to get perspective on it.
I say that sometimes I don’t reply because it can sometimes feel a bit weird and flirty because he likes me.
I apologised for not replying to him but it’s also only been a week since he told me that he’s felt like i’ve been ignoring him for months.
I ended saying that I agree and we won’t speak to each other outside of group hangs or work.

Now Monday he sends me snapchat of one his hobbies and a just sort of brush it aside and give him the benefit of the doubt. In the evening we have a group zoom call to catch up and do a quiz all together. This is fine and there’s not problems because we don’t talk to each other directly.
So Tuesday, bearing in mind we’ve agreed not to speak, he messages me to ask if I want to go for a walk, but it’s okay if it’s too soon he just thought he’d ask.
I respond thanking him for the invite but it is too soon and I have plans.
He responds that it’s okay but he thinks he owes me an apology that may help me??

Wednesday (today) he’s sent me another snapchat and a message asking if I have 5 mins to speak.

I really don’t know what to do because I don’t really want to speak to him right now after he blew up at me on boxing day. 
I thought we were close friends but apparently not close enough for him.
Obviously we have to work together next monday and I’m dreading seeing him in person.
I’ve spoken to other friends about all this drama and they’re saying he’s been quite manipulative.
I still want to be friends with him because it’s great when we’re in person, he just gets really clingy when we’re outside of work.

I just feel like I needed to write it all out and get others perspective on what to do?",30Dec2020,1
543,"Disclaimer: This is kind of lengthy, I'm sorry in advance but I don't want to leave out too many details because I feel like there could have been some type of lawsuit for one of the incidents at my company so bare with my story.

I (22F) am an advertising assistant / receptionist at a low incoming housing cooperative. I do a lot of clerical work aside from the advertising part of my position. A little background on my company; I work with 4 immediate people in my office, my office manager (Pam), my Property manager (Jeff, whom is my actual boss), sales associate (Debbie whom is Pam's Sister), and then there is my Board of Directors President (Gary whom is Debbie's Husband). I personally cannot believe this company has family members working here because it causes so many problems. I find this company to be a bit of a show. 

My issue is with Gary. A bit more background for his position, The Board of directors do not get paid and to be on the board you must live on our property. The other members on the board are whacko as you may think, they're the best of a crazy bunch since I work for low income housing. The President does not work for us and has no clue what us employees jobs entail. He gets to sit in some meetings and create little plans and pick colors of things and occasionally send out complaint letters if he feels up to it. Let me tell you, this guy is a douche bag and everyone knows it. He has his own little office and acts like he's the boss nitpicking shit he has no clue about. 

The problem with him: I would like to describe him and his wife as people from a different time. Very little respect for younger generations, say racist remarks, all of the above. They're people that wont get with modern times. (I've also been employed here for over a year now and have been exponentially praised. I am the only young person here with a college degree and I do a lot for them from programing to in depth excel work that they could never even understand. I like my job and make decent money for what I do and I would like to keep my job, but do not plan to be here forever as I think this company has no idea what they're doing and they are poorly ran with no structure.)

Continuing my main issue with Gary: Couple months back he asked me to create a phone list for him which he has no idea how to do this through our systems programming, and its through a partnering company. This day, they updated the program meaning the steps I take to create this list were unavailable at the time and I put in a request to speak to someone to get it figured out. That takes too much time for Mr. Impatient. I presented him with a secondary option while he wait for what he wants, not needs. Absolutely nothing I can do in the mean time just how it is. Any normal person would accept that. Wrongly assuming, he calls my line and yells, ""(my name) I am going to SMACK YOU"" and me being absolutely terrified of an old man telling me he is aggressively going to smack me, I frightfully ask why and then he proceeds to tell me how I suck because I could not provide him with said report. Whatever, I caused a scene about it with my boss and my president apologized to me and the entire company because he is a complete douche bag. Whatever. Me and him clearly have disliked each other here on out since I outted him in his own ""workplace"". 

The recent problem: Yesterday he isn't in office, Pam is having a cigarette outside, Debbie is in an office in back (unavailable), Jeff is off the property, and I am on the phone with a resident with an important issue. The phone system will first ring through to Pam, then Debbie, then Jeff if I can not answer the phone.  I have worked here for a year and no one once said to put calls on hold to answer other ones. I was never informed that Debbie was not in her office at the moment but it wouldn't matter anyways because we have a answering system and I would call back anyone, had I received a voicemail. We all let the phones ring through if we are on a phone call. Its never been a rule. I guess Gary was trying to call his wife, Debbie's personal cell but clearly she did not answer because she's BUSY. He calls the main work line, I don't know his number by heart so when it came up I did not know it was him, and to be honest I didn't even look at the phone ringing because I was busy on the phone. He's trying to reach Debbie about things unrelated to work, in my opinion INTERUPTING OUR BUSINESS. He calls Pam's cell as she gets in because they are family by marriage. Me and Pam are pretty tight, so she has him on speaker, he starts going OFF about me on how I suck, im terrible, I don't know what I'm doing, she needs to fix the issue with me because its bad for business not to put people on hold. I get that slightly, but I was never told anything about holding peoples lines to answer a phone call from someone whom is attempting to DISRUPT BUSSINESS FOR PERSONAL REASONS BECAUSE HIS WIFE WONT ANSWER HER CELL ON THE JOB. He's being so disrespectful at this point that Pam takes him off speaker and I'm not even surprised. 

Next day Pam brings it up to Jeff, he was already told about the situation, and were all pretty tight. Were laughing about it, Jeff is assuring me I'm valued here (as I think he's a bit nervous to lose me) they're reassuring me that we all do that and Gary has no idea what he's talking about, he has his flaws, keep doing what I'm doing, don't worry about it, all whilst warning me he will probably try to chew me out when he gets in office next. So when he does, I want to stick up for myself in an adult way. He is definitely going to be rude. 

 I ignore a lot of his remarks, he even threw one of my papers on the ground once just because he wanted to and then says to my face in the most condescending way possible, ""Oh I'm sorry did you find that disrespectful? It was just a joke"" I literally said nothing in return. I don't even know what I would say to that. The problem is I am an extremely feisty person but I also know I am at work so I can't say much but if this was not work, he would have been absolutely CHEWED. 

I am okay with constructive criticism, but I am not ok with disrespect and I am good at shying away from standing up for myself, and predicting he does disrespect me when he brings this topic up to me I want advice on how to go about it since this is also my workplace and I can't just tell him I think he is a straight up douche bag mcgee. Can anyone help with an appropriate way to approach the situation or if I should just get disrespected and move on?",30Dec2020,1
544," I suggest u all to read this post to the very end. Not only cause i want advice but also because reading this can very possibly teach u new things. This is simply a repost.

&amp;#x200B;

Hope ur all finding a way to enjoy urselves despite the pandemic. Want I wanna address isnt something that hurts me, but a decision I do feel a bit concerned from time to time that will impact my happiness in the future. First off, my family is a literal joke. No emotional bias or anything. A pure joke straight out of my own logical thinking. Ill start off with my uncle. He is literally the most spoiled person I know. He demands money from my grandparents every week. He tried to fuck up my future life of heading to a good uni so many times only for his own convenience. He is also really dumb as well. My aunt is just as money-hoarding as well, except she is much smarter and more cunning. My grandparents arent much better people either. Although they do grant my uncle money(not sure whether it is because he is still their favorite child or if they are doing it out of fear) they are extremely greedy. They do not want to help others, even if they were to see a child starving they would just ignore. The hilarious thing about this is that when they are in trouble or in need of money or sympathy(my grandma got a stroke last year and hasnt recovered), they would act as sad as possible in order to gain sympathy from others. When others refuse to help them they would judge him or her as a greedy person(Hypocritic as fuck right?).

Next is my cousin. She is literally goes on tinder to meet new people to have sex with. She literally has no concern for people around her and complains when the slightest thing does not go her way. I saw her messages when I was 15, she said that she liked ""big tennis rackets"" n stuff. She also has a huge problem controlling her temper n shit. She physically assaults our grandma at times and even did it to my grandpa a few times and refuses to leave the house. She accuses others of wasting money yet can't do jackshit against her own father who is the biggest parasite in our family. I do not respect those who claim to have some kind of moral compass yet cannot do the same to someone less lenient and tolerant of getting criticism. This is just cowardliness. In my opinion this is one of the easiest ways to lose the respect of those around u. Finally, when she actually had a bf in her life once she literally kept going around threatening to break up at one moment but then beg for forgiveness the next moment. Her actions causes me to believe she may have Borderline Personality Disorder.

Finally, ill talk about my parents. My mom is literally brainwashed by religion(christianity). It feels as if she can no longer see reality around her due to her brainwashedness of it. However, I know she is a bullshit excuse for a Christian since she hates helping others in need. Lmao she wouldnt bring a piggy bank full of coins when she was orginally going to give it to the poor just cause it was too heavy.

Now lets talk about my dad. Ever since I was born he spoiled me rotten. Like everything i wanted i would get. At first I loved getting this all but now that i have become an adult I realized how this destroyed my character. I felt like the world was centred around me. Like my cousin, I would get pissy when the I even had to go through the slightest inconveniences, such as when my parents promised to buy me a toy the next day due to the rain. You may think that my dad was overall a good father, he just didnt now the right way to lead me to the right direction. This is the opposite. His ""love"" for me is utter bullcrap. As I grew and realized my mistakes, I would feel distance towards me and him. It was like he was losing his interest in me. I didnt think much of this at first, but I realized he loved the moments when he spoiled me. He loved how I could be his ""little teddy bear"" to mentally damage. I remember him cussing me out a few times also recently. Although I dont want to go into the detail what this was about, I admit that it was really fucked of me to do such an action. However, him calling me such stuff is not the reason why I call him a pathetic excuse of a dad. It is because he can swear at me when hes angry, but he cant do it to other people cause he is afraid of them. He literally was never able to stand up to his parents when they favored his brother(my uncle) over him his whole. His brother exploited him alot as well in the past as well, and my dad was only able to stand up to him like once which was a frickin long time ago. He knows that ""peaceful communication"" wont work yet he still keeps being soft towards them. Imagine the respect I would have lost for him everytime he would cuss me out due to his cowardliness.

As much as i hate to admit it, if it wasnt for a certain person in my life I encountered, I would have been the worst among my family. My dad literally spoiled the crap out of me, and would have destroyed my social skills, dignity, and empathy. Not only that, he literally would pet me everywhere i go, even in the public place like at transit or around strangers, like i was some sort of puppy. Spoiling is seriously the worst way to treat a child in my opinion. In a way, I see it as worse than constant physical abuse. U could love someone that was physcially abused his entire life, and there is a good chance he will slowly warm up, but this does not apply to someone spoiled. Like physical abuse, the spoiled child loses empathy and other kinds of mental skills. However, the difference between a spoiled and an abused child is that an abused person has anger towards society. He despises everything around him for treating him like he was bottom-level trash. However, a spoiled child believes that the world is centered around him. He will see himself as a prince and feel as if his slightest conveniences will matter more than the wellbeing of those around him. Not only that, a spoiled child will almost certainly remain dependent on others, whilst being a literal parasite to those that support him financially or mentally, etc. And the worst thing is, if he commits an extremely unjustifiable act, like bombing a preschool full of little kids, he will expect others to sympathize and understand him that he is dependent on others instead of feeling remorse like he must be. No matter how much love or sympathy u show to him, he only gets worse believing that it is mandatory that people must love and empathize with him. If any of u guys reading this are parents, read from the last paragraph with the greatest amount of concentration if u lost track. Chances are that u seriously underestimated how bad spoiling your own child can be. Who knows what I would have ended up like if I didnt change. Ive just started changing tbh. Im trying to control my spoiled urges nowadays. I now have the cognitive sense that every human is equal, regardless of position, race, gender, etc. Higher social statuses, such as being a government official or president, were meant to help bring the benefit to everyone in society. They were only chosen to be in that position because they were believed to have the biggest potential to bring about the benefit to as much people as possible.

This realization now brings me to one thought: I dont believe I should have children. I have no confidence that i can lead my future child to the right direction. Every person in my family is a filthy degenerate bottom-level garbage and I would have became the same. I cant stand the thought of my child possibly inheriting these genetics from them and only to watch him struggle in life, like a fish on land being desperate to get back to the surface of the water. I do not want to be harsh on a child, nor does he deserve such treatment. Thoughts like these tell me that perhaps im better off avoiding marriage or even dating. However, I know the reality of human beings. Most of us are social creatures, and we are dependent on things like love and comfort. People from rural areas manage this well and are overall happy with their life of solitude, but even then they still do desire some social interaction from time to time. Perhaps making friends is a short term solution, but what happens if they make families and slowly drift apart?

As much as it seems like im hurt and distraught from this realization, im not. I feel fine and for some reason this realization didnt do much of a negative impact. It just made me consider my options in the future. Sorry for this long post. I feel as if to really get good advice i felt that giving a long backstory was necessary. If u want to criticize me in any way, feel free to do so. That is how i learn to think more rationally.",30Dec2020,1

Thing is, when I would wait a day to text, she would also wait a day. It was a pretty good cycle. Now that I’m texting about twice a day, she waits like 2-3 days to text back.

During all my time in the US I didn’t contact my old therapist because online therapy was really hard for me: we always had connection problems and it felt very cold and I never had the privacy to talk to her without anyone listening since I had several roommates.

I returned home and I still didn’t talk to a therapist this whole year and I decided to start a new one. However I’m still not sure how I feel about doing it online.

560,Hi guys this is one of my first posts on this subreddit so please bear with me.  My mom is adamant on me wanting to become a doctor because she thinks being a doctor is the only way to live a good successful life and having the immigrant Asian parent mentality.  I’m studying statistics and information science.  She thinks I’m too dumb and I won’t succeed even though I showed her my transcript with 4.0 in all my classes.  The reasoning? Because she’s my mother and she knows me better than I know myself. I’m also in the final round interviews for a position as a healthcare data analyst in NYC which has a decently high starting base salary  with stock option signing bonus.  My mom has always tried to control me since I was a kid and would always guilt trip me if I didn’t go through with her request and I’m going to be graduating college in the spring.  I would always give in and feel guilty due to living in an Asian household and growing up with a filial piety mindset.  I would always tell her that medical school was too expensive for both my dad and mothers salary and I want to pay off my student debt and start working so I can help her pay her debt from when she was studying to be a physical therapist.  I want to be financially independent and help my parents and I have all the pre-reqs for med school done but I just don’t want to be a doctor and put myself and my family in more debt than we already are.  My mom is also very stubborn thinking she knows what’s best. My dad is supportive of me but my mom definitely has the final say in everything.  I do feel guilty because she and my dad paid for my out of state college and my college is known for being amazing in STEM classes.  I really want to work in data analytics and eventually become a data scientist but my mom always tells me that the job market is saturated and I won’t find a job which is the opposite (I’m pretty sure).  How can I get my mom to come around the fact I’m not going to be a doctor and have her not lecture me and guilt trip me for making my own decisions.

565,"Let me explain my situation: 

I am a 27 year old woman temporarily living with my boyfriend who is 24 years old. His family consists of his mother (50) and his sister and her girlfriend (both are 29). 

We live in a ridiculously expensive country. Therefore, we cannot simply move out nor can we rent as prices are ridiculous (example, a small studio flat is £1200 or over). I lost my job due to COVID and I do not have the financial means necessary to rent at these prices without an income, nor can I put a deposit down for a house. 

Now, the actual situation that is causing us serious mental damage as well as hell on my bf’s severe anxiety. As I mentioned, we are currently dealing (not living) with my bf’s sister and her gf. These two women are evil. They constantly fight and have extremely vicious arguments. They also do not clean up after themselves, are heavy smokers (both fags and weed, and they do not pay rent nor contribute (it is a government rented house and therefore neither bf or his mum own the place. 

It is a constant battle of patience and perseverance, as we can no longer stand the sight of those two brats. The mother does not want to know at all. We’ve gone to her so many times to complain and to ask for help and she does nothing. She won’t even give the rights to the house (aka the bill payments and name placements) to her son who needs it to be able to evict the two women. 

I’ve thought, what if I call the Police? But then I realise I’m not living here legally (my name is down at my parent’s but they’re control freaks and narcissists so I’d rather not deal with them if I can) and that would give me more trouble than I can handle. 

If anybody has any advice whatsoever as to how to permanently remove these brats from the household legally and in a safe manner, please message me or comment below.

581,"So, to give this question context, I (F20) have never been moved out of my parents house. If it was up to them I could stay here until I was 40, but I want more privacy and independence so I’ve been saving up to move out. Both my boyfriend (m23) and best friend (f22) already have experience with being out of their parent’s homes, and both have talked to me about wanting to move to the same main city I plan on moving to. 

Now every time I’ve talked to my best friend she’s told me about moving into the city and living life with me and how it’d be so fun. And I’ve agreed with it, just because at the time, the plan seemed far away in the future and wasn’t even sure it would happen but it seemed like a cool idea. The same thing happened with my bf, he brought up the same thought and I didn’t shut it down because it also seemed not realistic since I didn’t think my parents would be okay with me living with my partner before marriage. (Turns out they’d be fine with it)

Anyway, now it seems like these plans are becoming realistic and are coming closer and I still haven’t shut one down. I’ve read stories about how living with your best friend is never a good idea, and sometimes living with a boy you’ve known for less than a year isn’t a good idea either.

582,"Pregnant girlfriend is abusing me. Help?

This is such a tough spot I’m in. 
I (m21) met a girl (21) this summer and we fell in love, hard. We started dating and moved in together quickly. We did everything together and we believed that we wanted to be together. 

Then things turned.
I remember the first time she made me feel crazy and sick. We were laying in bed one night and she randomly brought up a girl I had dated a year ago. The girl and I were still friends and broke up on mutual terms. Nothing weird have happened between us since we broke up, But my gf went out of her way to accuse me of wanting to be with that girl (something I genuinely had no interest in, I hadn’t even spoken to that girl since me and gf started dating, I actually told that girl that I couldn’t hang out anymore since we had dated and I was now in a new relationship and she was fine with it). She grilled me about it for the better part of an hour until I was crying and shaking, begging her to stop being so mean to me about the hypothetical situation in her head. All of a sudden a switch flipped in her and she became shockingly kind shockingly fast and held me and told me it was okay until I fell asleep. 

This pattern continued, she stopped working, she never left our bedroom. If I asked if she was going to get a job she would scream at me and threaten to hurt herself. Once she actually did which resulted in a 3 am trip to the hospital where I had to save her life. 

She has called me all kinds of names in regards to my insecurities (fatass, stupid, bitch, piece of shit), she constantly brings up my relationship with my family and how my parents have been financially good to me and have helped me when I need it. She shames me for that even though I pay all my bills and have my own house and a nice car that I pay for myself with my 45 hour a week job. She tries to make me feel isolated from them. She threatens to call them whenever we fight and tell them that I’m bisexual because she knows they wouldn’t approve.

She talks to all my friends and tries to isolate me from them, she tells me they hate me whenever I question the things she says about me. Then I talk to my friends and they say that they never said anything negative about me. 


Fast forward to October, we found out we’re pregnant. Our child is set to be born in May. I do my best to provide for her and take care of all her needs but she still treats me like absolute shit and screams at me and threatens to hurt herself.

Yesterday she took it a step too far. During a fight, when I told her I thought her stories of doing drugs from the past weren’t positive ones, she literally spit on my face. I remained calm and drove home. Now she wants to act like nothing happened. 


I fear for my safety. I miss my life the way it was before. I want to leave and split custody. I just want to get away and give myself time to heal before our baby is born. I can’t do this anymore.


What can I do? Why am I so afraid to pull the trigger? Please help.",30Dec2020,1
583,"Well, long story short, I need help talking to my mom and step dad about chores around the house and cleaning.. 

And before you start judging me about, 'why is a kid asking for help with chores?' I'm 28, my boyfriend is 31, and we've been together for over 10 years and have 3 kids together. All 7 of us live together now.

There are dishes that needs to be done, floors to vacuum, tiles to sweep, tables need to be cleaned off, animals need to be fed and taken care of, trash needs to be taken out, laundry needs to be done, grocery shopping needs to be done, dinner and lunch needs to be made.. and I feel like, ever since they moved us in with them, I'm solely the one who does the majority of those 'chores'. 

I'm freaking tired. I'm so glad the kids and I are on xmas/new years break, but there are still things that need to be done..

My boyfriend works, my mom works, my step dad doesn't, and I don't, but I have kids, and I go to school too. He doesn't.

What I'm mainly wanting, is advice on how to approach this conversation with them, respectfully..

They help watch the kids when I have appointments, they let us live here when we had no where to go. I love them, but I am also an adult with my own responsibilities. I feel like they are still treating me like a child who has to do chores every day, and if I don't do them, I get bitched at, sometimes yelled at, and even ignored at times..

We had agreed to split the household duties before we even moved in, but my step dad appears to be doing jack shit. Barely even takes care of his dog now, I have to. And my mom has been 'slacking'. She works a lot, and I love and respect her so much, so I would never tell her she is 'slacking'. I usually end up just doing them and don't say anything. However, lately she's been starting to bitch at me if she sees a sink full of dishes, even if I already did the dishes once that day.
 
I'm pissed. I'm hurt. We're not the only ones who use dishes in this house, and I don't feel I should get bitched at every day by my mom when I'm a grown a** adult doing my own thing.

I've tried talking to them, or trying to bring up things like. 'whose making dinner tonight? I did it all week' and they're always like, 'oh I guess we aren't eating tonight.' Or 'if you're not going to make anything, we'll go get some fast food for ourselves.' I've even bought meals for a week in advanced, told them what would be for dinner certain nights, and if I don't cook, neither will they. Even if I have to leave around dinner time, I'm like, 'hey, I have to do this thing, I'll be back in an hour, so and so is for dinner, start it whenever you want.' I'll leave, come back, they haven't even moved. I end up having to do it.

My daughter has even noticed I do a ton around the house and they don't. She makes comments here and there about, 'mommy makes dinner every single night' .. 

I'm just tired. I just want a break. And I can't go anywhere. When I try to talk to them, I get ignored, or reminded of how ungrateful I'm being, like wtf ? I'm just so sick of this and nothing I say seems to get through to them..

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",30Dec2020,1
584,"Hi everyone, I’m (26/F) engaged to a 26/M. We’ve been together for almost 6 years. We are very close, moved in together in May, and everything is perfect. Besides his family. They are very dysfunctional and my fiancé has taken on the brunt of trying to fix them. We are doing marriage prep and it has shown him they are dysfunctional, and he’s learning boundaries. Basically, his parents are very poor with money management, his younger twin brothers are very immature, diabetic, have learning disabilities and a lack of life experience, and his little sister (12/F) is autistic. His mother has autoimmune diseases, a syncope condition, and it’s her way or the highway. His dad works 60+ hours a week, is passive and clueless at times. 

My fiancé wanted us to buy a duplex and let them rent on the other side, but he realized it’s not a good idea. He has a lot of guilt and feelings like he abandoned them. His mother even told him he abandoned the family. They asked my fiancé for so much money and time over the years, and he’s learning to set boundaries. His parents are asking his brothers for money, but still ask us to pick up/bring home his brothers. 

His brothers have no life plan, are hanging out with a younger bad kid, and don’t care to take care of themselves, even being T1 diabetics in the middle of a pandemic. It’s very stressful for my fiancé and I, and I’m worried his guilt will impede him from finding happiness. His family has been the one thing we haven’t agreed on, up until recently. My fiancé accepts the reality of the situation, but doesn’t like expressing his feelings on it much, and feels guilty.

I've matured into a person I really like; I'm kind, empathetic, generous and smart in a wise sort of way. But every year when I go home for the holidays, I revert back to my childhood self who shuts down emotionally. I think I have a sort of resentment towards my mother because she doesn't help pay for school or rent or anything. I'm about $30, 000 in debt right now. So when I go home and see all the expensive things she's purchased and shows off, it makes me a little angry. I try not to acknowledge it because I know that it's immature of me. Actually, I've admitted to my mother in the past but she got angry at me. Then there's my sisters, who don't act like normal people in the sense that they don't consider other people's feelings when they say things.

586,"Tl;Dr: bf internet browser history shows he looked up his ex girlfriend that he dated for 5 years, been split since 2. In the history it also shows chats. 

Hey guys, so I’m looking for some advice. I found the other day that my boyfriend was on onlyfans and the girl he was looking up was his ex girlfriend from 2 years ago who he was in a 5 year relationship with. When I confronted him, at first he said it’s not a big deal, then I said who is this person? And that’s when I found out it was his ex. We got into an argument and he is claiming that he only showed it to his guys at work because his coworker ex also now has an onlyfans. 

The even bigger problem, the links show that he went into a chat and returning to chats. Which leads me to believe he is talking to her on there but he is denying it saying he has no idea how that happened. I’m struggling right now to believe him, he said that it was stupid and he regrets it and wished he hadn’t. On the flip side, he says I’m being sensitive and making it sound way worse than what it is. He also mentioned one of the reasons he even looked her up was because he wanted to know, like that’s who I was really with. Which makes me think he wasn’t over her, probably still not, because I’m not looking up any of my exes, especially an onlyfans. 

He is jumping back and forth. One minute asking what can he do to fix it to being like pack your shit and leave. I feel like I’m on a rollercoaster.

590,"Hiya! Recently my ex (Who I will call Z for anomonity) has been messaging me again.

Z and I met the first day of my freshmen year, he was a upperclassman (Only a year older) and we became friends fast. We were as thick as thieves for a year or so until my sophmore year. We started dating in January of 2019. 

Our relationship was a normal and healthy one. We had occasonal arguments and I was skeptical of one of his female friends for a while, but nothing was wrong. July of 2020, he dumped me out of the blue. I didn't understand why, because our relationship was good. He just said that he wasn't happy anymore. I just accepted that and tried to move on.

Z messaged me a couple of weeks after the breakup and said that he was in love with the female friend I was skeptical about. I was LIVID, I cussed him out through messages and I spend the rest of the day sobbing. When Z said that he made me feel used, unloved, and not good enough.

From then on, he messaged me sportically to try to reconsile and maybe be friends. I've been ignoring him. This recent event happened yesterday. Z was wanting to chat, and I just learned to chat and then ignore him so he could finally fuck off. I did this yesterday and now he won't stop messanging me. I don't know what to do.

Guys. First of all, thank you. I can't say that enough. 

Thanks to so many of you who commented different organizations who could help my daughter and I, we are now safe. 

I got in touch with a few organizations and one of them was able to get my daughter and I on a plane on Christmas Eve. I left our things, with the exception of whatever we could fit in two suitcases and left without saying a word. We arrived that night and some amazing people from the organization were there to pick us up and take us to housing. 

We can stay here for up to 18 months, but I totally plan on getting on my feet before then. They have childcare, connections to lawyers, psychologists... Everything we need. They had an apartment ready for us, with a Christmas tree and everything. They had presents for my daughter to open on Christmas morning and even a couple for me as well. 

We have now been here for 6 nights and for the first time since my daughter was born, I have had a full nights rest. I have talked to a lawyer who is helping me get an order of protection so that if we were ever found, I know I will be protected by the law. 

I feel like I can do anything. I can go to school, I can get whatever job I want, I can spend time with my daughter without being in fear. This is such a blessing. I feel like I can live my life. 

For the past 2 1/2 years, I have been stuck in the mindset that to protect my daughter and myself, I couldn't act young. It was work and home every. single. day. Getting to separate myself from my terrible situation made me realize that I can be a responsible mother for my daughter and be 20 years old. I get to enjoy being a young a parent. It doesn't have to be so scary. 

So once again, thank you to everyone who helped. I wish I could hug every single one of you in person. I am eternally grateful. 

And so I don't break any rules of the subreddit... Any advice for a young mom in a new city?",30Dec2020,1
592,"Long story but hear me out. I have a B.A in a double major of political science and cultural anthropology and just got my Masters of Professional Communications at 23 years old. Right out of school I landed my first job at a small non-for-profit with only 15 people on the team. I was the only ""communications coordinator"" of the entire company, that was active and well known on an international level.

I was not properly trained (Assuming I am the only comms person), just thrown in and told to sink or swim. Most of my work was done relatively decently until they started piling up so much work all at once. I had 8 directors and a CEO give me materials of their own projects that I needed to work on in regards to its communications and it got overwhelming. Every task to every director and the CEO was a ""priority"" and my task list was overwhelming. I would get the job done but would make small mistakes in the details and directors and the CEO started getting upset and frustrated. I couldn't balance getting so much work off my desk quickly but also flawlessly. I spoke up to my CEO regarding how I felt but nothing was done and no one really cared about my workload and why some smaller and very careless mistakes happened.

Fast forward, the CEO of the company really was keen about me, he mentored me and then I started realizing that his comments would become inappropriate (commenting on my body) and would always find time to talk to me at my desk or in his office about his life, etc. We went on a business trip and he tried to hold my hand and I pulled my hand back and felt physically ill the entire trip. After that business trip, the CEO told me he can't talk to me anymore in a ""friendly"" way because people in the office spread rumors that he was ""favouriting me"" not even being there for more than a year that situation alone led to a few women in the office despising me. After this incident I was treated poorly and some even encouraged me to leave.

That is just a GLIMPSE of my past job, currently I found an AMAZING job with an amazing team of people and a boss who is absolutely incredible. I am SUPER happy. However I have a lot of issues that followed me from the experience of my last job. For example, beating myself up for small mistakes I make at my new job in fear of getting yelled at, worried about harassment from team mates, i find myself always overly apologizing for small mistakes or things i've missed that my boss sat me down and told me to stop worrying and that mistakes are normal. I have fears of being fired and I am extremely hard on myself if i'm not perfect at my job. I know I need to get rid of this anxiety or trauma from my past job but its so hard to shake off. Also past employees of my previous job have been looking at my linkedin profile constantly, i've deleted them and one of them even tried to re-connect with me a few days later. I want to shut that part of my life completely from the trauma i dealt with and move on. Any tips on what I can do to address this? its been constant anxiety everyday since.",30Dec2020,1
593,"My sister was just diagnosed with genital herpes / herpes simplex virus (HSV) She is only 20. She is feeling extremely worthless, shocked, suicidal, etc. To top it all off it’s a pandemic and she hasn’t been working or in school, so she spends most of her days home in bed. I think this will only spiral her depression further. 

I have been her rock. Telling her that while these things happen because of careless actions - it’s still not her fault alone and it is not something to be ashamed of. It’s unfortunately quite common and although it can’t be cured, it is manageable. She’s afraid no one will want her, she’s disgusting/dirty, and she will not live a fulfilling life now. 

Our mom was very upset at first but was able to calm down, and our father doesn’t know. They DRILLED into her head the importance of using protection and general sex education. Our dad will feel guilty and most likely want to kill whoever gave it to her. She is terrified for him to find out.

The next mistake I made was agreeing to do a group presentation about any relevant thing concerning media with my friends.

My friends somehow seem to be in their stubbornness want to fail by choosing to make as much fun of feminism and women in general in the presentation they can get away with despite the presentation being something quite different.

They're reasoning is that the worst the teacher can do is give them a poor grade and it's worth seeing her pissed off. I had thought this would be a subject I won't have to do anything for. I didn't help in the presentation, I won't be presenting nor answering any questions but if we get a bad grade I'll have to study later to make up for it which I don't want to do for a subject I don't really care about.

With that being said, there is this person from my past. Long story short, they are totally ""the one that got away"".

They taught me so much and I know I wouldn't be in the relationship I am in today if it weren't for this person. 

I recently moved back to my hometown and I learned that the person I went to high school with has also moved back to the same city. We talked for a little bit over text in the fall and it was really nice and so comfortable. For the first time, I found myself questioning my amazing relationship.

601,"Hey! I'm a 19yr old uni student with a motorbike, I got my provisional license back in 2017 (I dont know if its different elsewhere but you can ride a 50cc bike at the age of 16 in the UK)

Anywho, this year, I heavily upgrade my bike to a geared one, I was used to Mopeds and took a fairly big change onto geared bikes. I picked up quickly and have loved riding around on it! Seeing amazing places with my uncle and cousins and having experiences I wouldn't have had, had I not been riding!

But, the later half of this year, I've not spent that much time on it. It felt like a chore having to wear all my protective gear, helmet, and just mindlessly ride about when I had no plans. You're supposed to ride bikes as frequently as possible to stop the battery from dying, and keeping it clean, as you would any other vehicle. However whilst at uni, I had left my things for cleaning the bike at home accidentally and was forced to stay at my accommodation due to COVID. Not only that, my workload has increased substantially, so when I did break from work, it was to relax, I didnt want to ride the bike.

Unintentionally, I left my bike for a while and the battery died. I had no way to charge it and I was ridiculed by my parents. ""WE MAY AS WELL SELL IT, HE DOESNT CARE ABOUT IT"" (Hurt enough using the wrong pronouns but they dont know about my gender yet, which is whole other thing)

When my mom came to help collect my stuff to return home for the holidays, we stayed way longer than intended cause the bike needed to be charged, and then push started.

And ever since I've got back, I've started it once and its snowed since so I havent been able to go out on it, which is also giving me slack from my parents. ""Just start it! Go out tomorrow and start it."" - this was yesterday. Today, I say ""Mom, I'm gonna go start the bike"" and my dad says ""Its too late now, start it tomorrow"" 

I started it anyway and of course, it's not fully there.
I'm just thinking I may as well start it but, I'd lose the one thing that connects me with my uncle and cousin. We always used to go on rides. I dont want that to end but this motorbike is more a chore than anything.

605,"This is a long and complicated situation and for simplicity I am leaving a lot of that out. So just keep that in mind as you read this. I am 20(M) and when I was 8, almost 9 my parents divorced. I have been separated from my dad for more than 3 years now. He lives on the west coast of the US while I live on the East coast with my brother and mom. And recently I decided that I want to send a letter to him. The problem is that I know my father for kind of being dumb, and occasionally being an asshole. 

To give an example of this my dad once decided to take credit for me deciding to run track saying that my mom didn't get the insurance that was required by the state for me to run until he stepped in. See I know that is BS though because I told him about all of that after we had gotten the damn insurance. Despite repeatedly stating that though he has gotten it into his head that without him I wouldn't have been running track. 

And in this letter I want to try and tell him about everything that has happened to me since I left. As well as a few words stating how BS things like that were. What I want advice on is how I should handle it. Because I don't want him to make a scene out of it, and I don't want him to think that these letters will be a common thing. And here is where I have to do a lot of explaining. 

So to start off the reason I don't want him to think that this will be a common thing is that I do not feel comfortable talking to him all that much. The reason for that is that at first when I left the west coast we did keep in touch. The problem was that I left the west coast because my father remarried a woman who was mentally abusive. He is still with her today, and while I was still in contact with him he would say things like oh it's great over here. If I mentioned something about school that I was having trouble with he would say how I probably wouldn't have had to deal with that over there. As if the abuse that I went through was nothing. And I didn't have the courage to say stop I do not feel comfortable with you saying this. And instead I ran away from the issue and stopped talking to him. And I am fairly certain that even if I did tell him that I am not very comfortable with it he would defend himself and still do it. As I said before he can be pretty bull headed. 

And I am scarred that he will use some things that I want to add, such as one instance where I had to go to the centers because I wasn't in a good headspace at the time. And he might use that as leverage to sue my mother. Unfortunately I am not exaggerating with that because during my first year away he did try to sue my mom, because a few hundred $ worth of toy trains my dad used to have that were lost. He only dropped the charges once my mom threatened to counter sue for child care. Child care that he claims to have already payed my mother.",30Dec2020,1
606,"This is my first real post and I’m kind of nervous, I’m sitting in my room and I’m extremely anxious. I (19f) live at home with my family, who I love very much. We live in a beautiful upper middle class home/neighborhood, which is one of the many reasons I feel conflicted. Growing up I was always a daddy’s girl, and with two employed parents working full time I grew up getting the best of them, it was always “fun time” and we didn’t clash or fight since we were well-behaved and felt lucky when we were able to be a family unit. My father worked a federal job and took pride in “getting the bad guy”. This is where things took a turn. We moved to a different state and in middle school, tensions started building in the household. My dad became incredibly controlling and paranoid. He would bust into my room at all hours of the night, throwing stuff across the room trying to find what I was allegedly hiding, he tore down my confidence as a person and I was always on edge. I struggled with my body, I struggled with friends, and I fell into a deep depression. I never had privacy and to this day I still believe he somehow is watching my every move. I have told him that I am depressed, I briefly saw a therapist (which he pulled me out of after he believed I was trash-talking him, he came into a session and made me “confess” that everything I said was a lie) and I was diagnosed with multiple anxiety disorders and chronic depression. I’m trying to make the best of the situation but it’s killing me. My older sister and I are now extremely anxious about money and being a burden, and I have been paying for my school for the past two years as well as other things so I can lighten my weight on my family. My mother is sad, she sees what’s going on but my dad just gets angry and says we’re conspiring against him...I miss my dad and I want him to get help. I wanted to move out on my own and go off to school, but my dad told me he wanted me to stay at home and go to a community college in order to save money. While it is a cheaper option, I wish I had just moved away like originally planned. He has gotten in my head and told me I would fail if I leave, i would ruin my life, but staying here is incredibly hard on my mental health. I feel emotionally crippled, I know I’m a hard worker but I don’t have anything to fall back on. I don’t even have a license. My dad crashed the car I got with scholarship money and now I have nothing. Recently I have been spending all of my time with my boyfriend, and he is furious. I accidentally fell asleep at his house and he told me he never wanted to speak to me again. Overreactions like this make me afraid to talk to him. There are many more things that have happened, but I don’t have the strength/energy to mention here. How do I confront my dad without crumbling? I know what I want to say but I am terrified to say it. For some context, my boyfriend would let me live with him if I get kicked out, but I’m afraid that would burn all bridges.",30Dec2020,1

I have one coworker who most everyone at work loves, 51M. HE NEVER WEARS HIS MASK. He regularly comes into work buzzed/drunk, and just sits around. No problem our job isn’t hard and we aren’t busy this time of year. Well recently, he’s been getting into peoples faces and “play fighting” with them, as he calls it. It’s just small shoves, and fake punches. When he does it to me, I politely ask him to stop and remove myself from the situation. I’ve reported it to HR, several times, and they always say, oh we’ll look into it more. I know this means nothing. On to the incident. Yesterday, he was once again getting into people’s faces and not wearing his mask. When he approached me, I asked him to back off, but he wouldn’t. He then shoved me particularly roughly, and I hit him. I’m not proud of it, but I stand by it. Unfortunately, I knocked him out, and he’s in the hospital right now. I feel terrible, and almost everyone is telling me I’m terrible for that. I’m really worried I will lose my job, rightfully so, but I believe I defended myself, so I’m not sure.

608,"i met her (19m) in a high school class. i thought she was kinda cute back then, but never thought of doing anything back then. later i realized she was one of my friends girlfriend and asked her about it. we started talking about it. i asked  her basically all the stuff about the relationship, then we talked about other stuff, and eventually i became really good friends with her. i even became an in-between/friendly third wheel between her and her boyfriend, being that im good friends with both. 

to this day, theyre still high school sweethearts. i couldnt be more happy for them. the male friend moved away for a snowboarding scholarship, but they really made it work. now hes back for the holidays and its like they never left. i look at them and they are truly in love with each other.

theres just one problem. for some reason im starting to kindle an attraction to her. its not that i never found her pretty before this point, its just that i knew she wasnt my type, and she clearly wasnt interested because she was taken. but around this time last year, i really started knowing how pretty she is. it didnt really concern me. just thought maybe it was a part of being a horny college student. i didnt think much of it, and our friendship was never affected. but seeing her on her snapchat, im realizing for some reason my feelings for her have escalated.

now im not sure what i should do. should i stop talking to her and hope this goes away? should i address it to her just so she can be wary of it? should i try and find a girlfriend so my mind can be taken off of her? should i just go on like it isnt there? im so unsure of what to do",30Dec2020,1

627,"2020 has been a year of constant shit hitting the fan for me. In January I ended a 3+ yr relationship with someone I wanted to marry because when my family member became very sick, and I became depressed, she told me to find someone else for emotional support. I didn't leave my apartment for \~5 months except to go to Uni for classes (while it was still open until Covid clapped our cheeks) and run errands so I didn't starve. My life for the first half of the year was (literally) get up -&gt; eat -&gt; class -&gt; gym -&gt; eat -&gt; cry -&gt; sleep/repeat.

Since June I've been trying to ""make friends"" which has done nothing except make me very aware that most people are extremely selfish, closed-minded, and have shallow personalities that cannot see past their social media poisoned realities. I tried dating apps, got a ton of matches, but every single woman on those apps has no clue what in the heck they want in a partner. I had some great dates - made a couple friends - and some interesting experiences :/ nothing sexual, but my gosh the conversations. Been off the apps for a while now.

The best thing to come from this year has been a growing appreciation of the peace and calm solitude brings me. Even when I am spending time with my friends(either virtually or socially distanced), I get exhausted from the minute aspects of life they create drama over. Between losing a relationship that I put my heart and soul into (consequence - RIP my confidence lol) and these shallow social relationships I've become keen on distancing myself from people emotionally for this year.

(He was in the mood to play at some point that night but that was while my family was in the middle of an argument so i missed that window). He said he wasn't in the mood to play games, we went back and forth a bit about it since I was feeling emotional(and probably immature) that he didnt want to play video games with me. 

He said he just wasn't in the mood to play anymore and said maybe thinking about our anniversary dinner tomorrow (aka today) would make me feel better. I also expressed to him that im not sure if im in the wrong for still wanting something from him even though he said hes tired and doesnt want to play or if hes in the wrong for just saying hes not in the mood and leaving it like that.

He then said I would feel worse if I guilted him into playing with me (which has happened in the past where I basically ask him to do something since he didnt act on it himself). He responded with (him) playing games with me isnt the only way I can cheer up and at the end of the night said that he hopes i find a way to feel better.

Is it wrong of me to want him to ""do more"" or be more willing to help?

638," 

I apologize for anything wrong I'm doing, first post.

This happened the day after Christmas. My (F18) uncle (M50+) had shown up unannounced to my family's house. My dad (M52) seeing his brother and great-nephew (M8), had no problem welcoming them into our house with no masks on. We aren't a great state to be doing this in, however, we are a very small state.

When my uncle and his grandson came in, they immediately sit down and the kid starts yelling to get the attention of our dogs, basically spitting possible droplets on us. While my uncle and his grandson were across the room with my dad, the rest of my family sat on the stairs and were moving up the stairs (farther away) repeatedly. We tried to emphasize to my dad that m uncle had just come from 4 other households and he shouldn't be in our house, putting all of us at risk but he didn't notice.

Once they left, after 20-30 minutes and my dad literally wrestling with the 8-year-old, we asked my dad to shower as he could have covid on his clothes and his body after such close contact with someone who isn't particularly safe. He rolled his eyes and then didn't help as my mom and brother went to clean the entire downstairs and disinfect it.

Finally, my dad showered after my mom begged him to and then just left. He drove away without telling anyone and tried to book a hotel to quarantine at, despite the fact that my uncle and his grandson didn't wear masks so if they were infected we all are breathing that same air now. I understand he was trying to be nice and respect how we all were feeling, but at this point, it felt more he was trying to make it seem like he wasn't the bad guy when he is the whole reason this issue happened.

My sister (F21) left to sleep at her boyfriend's and my dad left a voicemail apologizing to her, but not to the rest of us. She showed me the voicemail and it sounded scripted which frustrated me more.

Because of my dad's actions, he put my brother and his girlfriend who are up visiting for the holidays from 4 hours away, my sister and her boyfriend's family, me and my mom at risk as well as not allowing me and my sister to see our boyfriends during winter break from college for NYE.

To top it off, when I asked my dad about getting a rapid covid test (not reliable, I know, but it's hard to not spend time with my boyfriend's family during the holidays because it's what we're used to) he refused because he didn't want to use insurance and pay for a test because ""he gets tested for free where he works"" so I should just wait until then.

It is wrong for being upset he hasn't apologized and wanting to have a family sit down to talk about the repeated disrespect my dad has shown. Even after 4 days, I'm having a hard time being civil around him because of my frustration at his actions lately.

I’ve worked for the same company for several years as a mental health case manager and done some counseling on the side as a graduate student. This job was the golden ticket for me: getting to actually do counseling, doing outreach in the community, and a bit of a raise. 


Reality: most of my job right now is outreach for the program, getting the word out about what we do and try to build community partnerships. I am the only person working for the program (full time) right now, adding to the strain. The problem is, no one is responding. I mean no one. Hospitals won’t talk to me, even though I’m trying to put things in place that will benefit both staff and patients. Community organizations won’t respond. My emails and phone calls fall on deaf ears. I am running out of ideas. I’m not actually engaging with the public at all. I haven’t done any counseling. No one will agree to put up signs advertising our hotline. No one is calling into the hotline. I want so badly to help people and right now all I’m doing is sitting alone in my living room and staring at my computer, twiddling my thumbs.

Well it turns out he found out that I asked about him, and he took it the wrong way. He flipped out for some reason and thought that I was talking trash about him when I literally asked one question to like 2 people about him that was it.

648,"I’m 29M, and a 35F and I have been Instagram friends for a few years. Some casual convo here and there but nothing with sustenance. The couple weeks, we’ve hit it off and she invited me to her place (first “date”). We just watched a movie and then I left her place by 9p as she said she had to get to bed so she could walk up early for work; she’s a pharmacy manager for CVS.

A few days go by, and she tells me she’s really interested in getting to know me and dating; isn’t looking for casual/hook ups and has always thought I was attractive and mature.
So texting turns to FaceTime a few times but for a couple minutes each time. She said she works long hours at her job and is working hard to get promoted to district manager; her current position already has her working 50+ hours a week.

So, we haven’t hung out in weeks, I’ll text her some days with a good morning and ask her about her day or how her meal prep is going.. or recently , how her short visit back to her family was .

Sometimes I don’t hear from her for days, and most days I do hear from her it’s one my two texts back; a “hey good morning to you too, and a hey I’m really tired gonna go to bed early” (usually by 9-9:30p).
I do find her schedule a bit frustrating but I also understand she is pushing herself to excel in her career. I also have a demanding schedule: I work 8-5 as an engineer, run a catering service (I’m a chef as well), and I’m in process of setting up my restaurant . I guess, because I’m always on my phone answering clients, it’s easier for me to reply to her promptly or be available for conversation. 

I guess what I’m trying to understand is, what is the outcome of this becoming serious if she and I barely talk and she’s only available 1 day every other week? Has anyone faced a situation similar ? I do like her, the little time we have talked, it feels quite natural, and her maturity/drive/sense of humor is something im fond of. But I also know, this just the initial emotional aspect of getting to know someone... but how can I ever actually get to know her if she is seemingly unavailable but tells me she does like me and sees potential in dating ? 

TL:DR known a female through social media, just starting “talking” with the intentions of dating but her schedule is filled and I don’t know if she has availability to date.",30Dec2020,1

I'm started college in two weeks after a gap semester. I'm terrified of going, most of all because of the social scene. While I am glad that my school has extremely strict covid regulations, I know it will make making friends that much easier. In high school, I made friends easily at times, yet other times felt left out (ex. not being invited to any parties after dances or graduation). Although there will obviously not be a large party culture this semester, I would still love to be invited to events and valued as a friend. Do you have any advice to deal with having some social anxiety and fomo going into college?

I basically told her I’m closing this chapter and I’m done going back and forth. All she said was okay. I blocked her number. But I feel crappy because I didn’t get the chance to make my point. The things she said were just so rude and untrue. I felt defenseless. How can I get rid of this feeling of “I could’ve said this instead”",30Dec2020,1
651,"So backstory, I was friends with this guy back in kindergarten. Not close friends just a now and then play date. He was a bit slow but back then I never noticed it as we were young. His mom thought it would be a good idea about 3-4 years ago if we meet up and just hung out again so we went to a park and our parents caught up while we were left to do our own thing at a park. He just seemed off. In a quiet way.  Fast forward to yesterday. He visits my house while I’m not home. Mind you I don’t consider us friends. We never ever talked. I don’t know anything about this guy. I don’t live with my parents anymore. They said when they answered the door all he said is “where is he.” They thought that he’d leave after telling him I don’t live there. But he continued to stay and in my mother’s hospitality she let him in. While talking to him I was told he gave one sided answers and didn’t seem to pick up on queues. He proceeded to over welcome his uninvited stay to around four hours. And along with that he seemed to daze at a photo of me framed. She said he stared at the ground and shuffled his feet. This just isn’t sitting well with me. It deeply creeps me out. My mother gave me his contact info and I messaged him explaining to him how unsettling it was. I asked him why he visited and he said he wanted to catch up. And I asked him how he knows where I live and told me my mom and his mom talk. Which isn’t exactly truthful, they’re friends on Facebook but that’s it. Last time my mom gave his parents our address was 15 years ago.

I don’t want to leave the clinic because of the patients (I want to look out for them and keep their best interests in mind) and my coworkers (we all feel the same way). I don’t know what to do. There are mental problems unchecked and possible abusers of their medicine that aren’t properly addressed, among other things.

I want to quit because I don’t like feeling so stressed and angry about the things that are happening. How should I go about doing things? It would easy to just leave, but the manager (doctor’s wife) is very, very, very verbally abuse, so any future references are not possible.

But they often just talk for the sake of it, ie just talking about covid tests endlessly or commenting how lovely the food is 4 times in one sitting, or just asking endless perceivably meaningless questions about my friends personal lives, this could be perceived at showing interest but it comes across more to me as just trying to cover a potentially awkward silence.

My father is often just straight up wrong about some of the stuff that comes out of his mouth. But I just can't even muster up the energy to correct /question him about it. For example he bought this jam from Aldi (German shop) (we're in the uk) and said it was special German jam that had more fruit and less sugar, I later read the label, it just said classic country jam. I don't even get where this bullshit comes from, it's like he just loves talking so much that he'll just say anything. He also keeps repeatedly telling about how he's 10 minutes quicker than the average person at running a 5k for his age according to strava. ok welldone! But it's just so painfully boring, I really do not care, how is his self esteem so low that he has to boast like that it's pathetic. 

I'll happily debate with you or talk about something meaningful but just chitter chatter for decades, it's starting to make me feel really tense around my parents.

Me personally, I love peace and quiet. I love joking around too but that takes some level of meaningful conversation, ie truth and honesty for that to occur in my experience and my parents always avoid talking about real shit.

659,"TRIGGER WARNING: drugs and self harm

Tldr: step mom and my dad are on drugs bad. They claim it is severe psychological issues and misfires. Step mom believes she's being drugged with feteynol and I think she believes it herself. She is delusional and I'm scared for their lives. I need advice. 

So..I keep rerighting this because I don't want to add all the sob story and trauma..i just need advice. This is a bit long though so bare with me. 

Basically my step mom and dad have been on and off on drugs for as long as I can remember. I lived with my mom but my step siblings had no choice but to live with them. We were all used to the drugs and sneaking around but we were all taken care of. My dad never missed a day of work and they always put aside time for us kids. Bad habits aside, atleast they stayed good parents. 

Well the drugs got bad recently and my step brother and sister moved out within hours of a huge fight. Step mom was acting eradict, staying up all hours of the night, fighting, breaking things, saying "" I'm afraid I'm going to hurt the baby"" (her grandbaby that is living with them) my sister finally had enough and left. I didn't know the extent of what was going on until I visited on Christmas eve...

My step mom has always been loving and intelligent. A good talker and super silly.  Normally I would be embraced as soon as I walked in but this time I was really taken aback. She was in her room rummaging through things and I said hey how are you? And she responded with this long explanation about how her body is growing glass and she has found 500 peices of glass comimg out of her foot. Not only was this super bizarre but I didn't even get the typical hug or a hello for that matter...by the time she left the room she was stumbling and slurring claiming that it was her vertigo (she always claimed that her highs were just her vertigo acting up) her eyes were rolling all around. She kept dozing off waking up, rambling, and then asleep again. I have never seen her like this. My sister wasn't fazed, this is what she's been dealing with for months. 

My dad on the other hand is his normal self for the most part, he cut back on drinking from a 12 pack a day to a 6 pack a month, he even switched from cigs to a vape..but he's so sickly skinny.. my dad was always been super muscular and tall. His severe back injuries and surgeries obviously have had an impact on muscle mass but I've never seen him so skinny before, and it happened within a few months. He's struggled with heroin on and off the last few years after his brother overdosed. I'm afraid he's using it again. 

And with all these signs, they convinced me that step mom has severe psychological issues and health issues that doctors won't look into. I was made to believe that my dad randomly passing out were possibly mini strokes. And that step moms passing out were neurological misfires and it'll happen for a few days at a time..he told me he'll take her to the ER if it continues for more than 24 hours... (obviously bc she won't be high anymore) 

It took a lot of reflection for me to realize I was being deceived. It sounds so obvious but they've always been ""honest"" about their drug use so they would be honest now right? 

Step mom also told my sister that she believes she's being drugged and that's the cause of her health issues. She buys percs of the street for her pain and claimed it's being laced with feteynol. And i genuinely think she actually believes this. I think she's completely delusional from all the meth and past childhood abuse that's been brought to the surface. Shes also self harming and is covered in cuts. They are also in contact with family that are HEAVILY on meth and heroin so much so,, that they're not even human beings anymore. 

My dad also just won a lawsuit for a car accident and now have $ 20,000 at their disposal...

I'm just so so sick to my stomach and frustrated with everything. I'm desperate..how can I help. When my sister confronted them it ended horribly. They called it disrespectful because it's their house and they provide everything they need and blah blah blah. I can't lose any more family to drugs. I've already lost 2 uncles to heroin. I cannot lose my dad and step mom, I feel like im.at a breaking point and im.not even there living it..",30Dec2020,1

My boss said I need to go home and be with family but I can’t stand to look at my mom. I try to post on my social medias like Fb, Insta, and Reddit like nothing happened so I can convince myself things aren’t that different. 
I have been living with my mom since my parents split in 2009. My sister lives with my father 30-40 minutes away. We were so close and always on the phone. She had a boyfriend who was so sweet to her. The thing that hurts the most is that she was bullied in school. She was born with a skin condition that wasn’t that noticeable, I think the other kids just liked the way she reacted when they picked on her. They were so rude. Now, I’m told by her best friend, that they act like they were all her best friends. Last year, when she was 15, my sister had to be admitted for trying to take her own life. She never told me what the other kids thought about that or if they even knew where she had gone for two weeks, but the harassment didn’t stop. All I know is that, one the 27th, my father went to wake her up in her room and she was already gone. He called for help and they deduced that she had suffered an asthma attack. My parents had a big fight over whether to do an autopsy or not but my mom won and they’re doing it. Still waiting. 
I’m just hurt, crushed, defeated. I feel like my heart just split in half because she was half of my heart.

665,"For quite a while, months even I've been so at war with myself. I'm a 20 year old guy with Asperger's. Growing up, I was clingy, didn't understand social cues or boundaries, fixated on certain things and people. Add in a large amount of dysfunction between my parents which inly escalated when I 6th grade. It's only in the past couple years after graduating high school that I finally feel like a normal person in terms of social intuition. I still have a bit of discomfort interacting with people, and aside from that the whole situation with 2020 hasn't helped with limited social opportunities.

There is this constant feeling that crops up, similar to what I felt not long after leaving HS. Seeing many of my former classmates who had relationships, or had a better, funner time while I was an awkward introvert and was sorta the weird kid in middle school. Even now I don't have friends minus someone from elementary school that I got back in touch with online. He actually was someone who I was clingy to along with a couple of his friends, but he doesn't even talk to them anymore and made it clear he doesn't hold it against me.


I've had other social failures in the past, but realize that middle and high school kids aren't known for being perfect. At all. But yet, I still feel the sense of inferiority and self loathing. And it does worry me since I was a borderline ''nice guy'' in middle school, asked out two girls but was rejected both times(I had been a bit creepy towards them already). I'm not proud of who I was yet, and I guess there's the question if I even deserve to be on par with others. It would have been nice to not have been on the spectrum. And I don't know what opportunities I'd even have with COVID, and I don't like the idea of apps and I can't help but imagine the worst case scenario of things going wrong or it just being impossible.

666,"So, for a bit of context:

-my parents have been married for 12-14 years, they are separating due to my dad not having a job, and my mom being upset about that. Though we are okay economically speaking, my mom is mainly upset that my dad has no interest if working and wants to be sort of maintained by here with nothing in exchange. He always around all day, barely helps around the house (unlike my sister, mom and I) and my mom worries that's is the example he is setting to us

-I have a bad relationship with my dad, since he doesn't really seems intrested in knowing me as a person, and feel like he only speaks to me whenever he wants mr to do something for him (from chores to cooking) and I have it. Both my parents are conservative evangelicals and have a mentality of ""women's purpose in life is to get married, have children and do everything for their families."" And I don't agree with that. With that in mind, he always expects for me or my sister to do stuff for him since that's ""our job as women"". Because of this, we even have to do the simple ofjobs for him, like take the dirty dishes from him, serve and deliver his food and what not.

-Both my parents are depressed and take it out on me sinecim the oldest of two. They both take these feelings out on me in completely different ways. Mom tends to get angry and insult me in ways that hurt too much, though it happens once in a while. My dad tends to make hurtful remarks (not as bad as my mom) but they do tend to be constant. 


-I was depressed already since my wish and what I had fight for, will not be happening (already explained that on another post).

Well...

So back before Thanksgiving, my mom (accidentally) broke the news to me that they will be separating by December 30th if my dad doesn't get a job. 

Fast forward to today, December 30th. I don't see anything packed, my dad doesn't seem to still have a job or intrest of doing so. I was really expecting for them to separate and I a way, I wanted it to happen though I did know it was gonna hurt. I wanted him to go away for good. Because I just wanted him to be out. And now, I don't see anything packed up and haven't heard nothing on my dad moving. I'd suppose they are happy again but it's not likely since my mom is as angry as she always has been. 

Just today I heard them discuss; my mom telling my dad to ""get his ass off from bed and be an example to his daughters"" and I'm just so confused, angry and frustrated. 

In a way, I feel like I got depressed for nothing and I was lied to. Because it somewhat hurted me that they were separating (not necessarily hurt for myself, but my mom since I know it can be hard on her, and I don't blame her for wanting a better example and just a much more loving man)

(though i kinda want it) and it really affected me on my academics, my teachers got so concerned that from a 90 I lowered to a 50 in just one bimestral. Had to explain that whole separation ordeal because it really kept me from focusing on class. Because I'm so busy being my mom's right had man and just having to listen a marrying falling apart is kinda heartbreaking.

in the other way I feel like I thought a weight was going to be lifted off my shoulders but it's still here.

This isn't a pity party btw, I'm genuinely trying to change but nothing is working. When I run, I don't feel good about myself, I just feel tired. One night j tried being nice to myself and physically and involuntarily laughed out loud. I just don't buy affirmations, sure I'd like them to be true but just because I want something to be true doesn't make it true. I'm also terrified that I'm secretly a bad person and that I'm just faking being good for like social acceptance, though this my just be OCD (I have been diagnosed). I'm also fairly convinced my parents are disappointed in his I turned out. They've denied it repeatdly but I mean come on, you think they'd ever say that to my face? Only an asshole would do that. So, I have a lot of negative feelings and the things that are supposed to make me feel good have no effect, I'm just empty and tired. How do I change",30Dec2020,1
669,"  I'm young, just turned 18, and already feel like I'm messing up everything in my life. I've been in high school for four years, but stayed back my freshman year. I'm supposed to be graduating the class of 2021. School has never really been a big thing for me, I've never been good at math, have never really been able to focus in classes and such. I can do things like basic algebra, and my vocabulary is pretty good, but I personally fail to see why I need to know what they teach. I was put in ALP (Alternative Learning Program) last year for one-on-one teaching, but even then, I just kept finding negativity while there. I haven't been to school much this year, and I feel like I'm messing up. I know I'm messing up. And adding to that, I'm afraid to work. I read that employees everywhere get yelled at and that they're always tired and overworked. I get anxious in large crowds, or when I'm around a lot of people that I don't know, and feel drained when scenarios like this occur.I already don't have much motivation as it is, and I'm scared that if I go into the working class, that I'll learn I'm not ready and can't do it. I have worked once, when I was 16, and I ended up quitting due to a shitty manager and smelling like rotten food everytime I came home. (I was a dishwasher and they tell you to empty the sink at the end of your shift, it's revolting.) 
  The only thing keeping me going to be honest, is my dream to become a singer, or the lead vocalist of a punk type rock band. I don't mean to sound cocky at all, but I know I'm good at it, and I push myself to be good, and to get better. I feel like it's what I was meant to do, but I know about the chances, and for me? They're quite low, as being conventionally attractive is, well..*usually* a must. I believe I could do it, I believe I have what it really takes, but what if I'm just getting my hopes up, and I never actually get there? 

 I'm so scared of my future, and not knowing where I'm gonna land. 

 Thank you.",30Dec2020,1
670,"My husband and I just bought and moved into our first house about a month ago. We noticed pretty early on the neighbors keep parking on the opposite side of the street that our drive way is on. This makes it difficult to back out of our driveway and we’re worried about hitting their cars. As you can imagine this is frustrating and annoying. 

We do have an HOA, but I’m unsure of who it is or how to get in contact with them or even if they’re really violating anything. 

We barely ever see them either so it’s been hard to ask them and we don’t know what to do.  My husband is cautious about asking them to move the cars as they have american veteran license plates and he doesn’t want to make them an enemy in case they’re the aggressive type.

I thought about writing a note, but I’m unsure of how to word it so as to not come off angry?

671,"I would love some advice here. I’ve been feeling very frustrated recently with my mom and sister. They are both unhealthy and very overweight, and it makes me feel like they don’t care enough to do anything about it. 

The main problem currently is my mom. She complains to me every day about her back hurting, all the weight she’s gained, and her stomach problems. A couple weeks ago, she started bleeding and I had to take her to the emergency room. She’s now getting a colonoscopy as I type this. I find it so frustrating because she never goes to her yearly doctor appointments or gets checkups when things are concerning about her health. It took something as extreme as rectal bleeding to make her go in. 

Every time she complains, I ask her to go to the doctor or call the physical therapist or go for a walk with me each day, and nothing gets through to her. Now she could have a serious health problem and she’s been ignoring it. 

It makes me feel really selfish to say this but it makes me angry and I don’t want to hear the complaining anymore when she won’t do anything about it. I think the anger comes from anxiety about losing her. When I was 16, my dad was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer. He had known he was sick for a long time but didn’t go to the doctor until it was too late. He died when I was 17. 

To see my remaining family members do the same stupid stuff drives me crazy. I feel like I’m gonna be left alone because of their health problems and it feels like my family is just being lazy. I would love some advice. This most recent scare has made me realize that I need therapy as well to deal with these anxieties. However, I don’t know what to do in the meantime and I would also love some ways to not be so angry at them.

674,"Okay I don’t want to her specific in case she finds this because she is a super crazy mega bitch, but basically I work with animals and we have a new attendant manager. 
I trained her. I’ve been there longer. We were cool prior to her becoming manager. 

Now lately she’s been super nasty to specifically me and whenever I tell anyone else they said that oh she’s so nice and oh she’s probably having a bad day be nice or oh it’s a mistake it’s okay 
Like no... it’s all the time. 
She’s directly being mean to me and only me and I don’t know why. 

She keeps saying I don’t know what I’m doing, she keeps making me stay late to show me things over and over. When I ask what I did wrong she won’t tell me, she just says to watch what she does. Even when I do it exactly the same it’s wrong. 

Meanwhile there’s workers who come in and don’t work, they sit down, sleep at work, talk crap, tell new people not to listen to me, etc but legit I work super hard. I do care about the animals. I barely sit down. 
The doctors love me. The clients love me. The other workers mostly love me. Idk what I did to her! 

I don’t want to get specific but for one we have to check off anything we do for the night and lately I have been doing legit almost the entire list. Christmas night the list wasn’t there and I texted 3 ppl asking where it was or what do I do and I just got “idk” 
So we didn’t do the list (neither did the other two shifts) but only my shift got in trouble 

Even tho I do the most physical work I get in trouble for everything. I was told to stay late after punching out 45 minutes and was ignored when asked why. Finally a technician told me it was a “mistake” which is ridiculous 
She legit ignored me whenever I try to speak with her. The docs don’t like her. She fired my friend too. 
She made me train a bunch of people but refuse a raise and insist we have a pay cap but we don’t. 

She gave me shit for posting photos of the pets that live at my job meanwhile at the same exact time she had , and still has, photos of pets from the hospital too!!!!!! 

Anyway she wants me to stay late tomorrow to speak and it’s for a stupid reason. She made me cry this morning and I had to leave without even punching out. I hate her. I can’t do anything without Trouble and even when I show texts of her being nasty to me no one cares. 
When I ask what I did wrong she won’t tell me. 

She wants me to stay late because I wrote idiot on a piece of paper that I MADE UP to weigh the cats that live at my job and she’s acting like they’re legal documents even tho they go in the trash at the end of the week. 

My moms wants me to put in two weeks but I need the money and I don’t know what to do. Is that giving up? Should I stay? I can’t handle the stress but I need money ugh please 
I need her to stop being a super megacunt to me 

I’m gonna delete this in a few days but ugh I’m so stuck in

675,"Hello! I (23M) think am in a vicious cycle of overthinking and need some help.

So firstly, some background. I grew up in an unstable household, with a father who left when I was 12. Neither of my parents had much education, stable jobs or really any career drive which means I've never had a role model or an adult for advice when growing up. I always imagined myself getting a good, high paying job and supporting my single mother. I was fortunate enough to enjoy school and did well, despite problems at home. I got into one of the top universities in the country (UK) and finished in the top 10% of my class, winning scholarships and awards for achievement along the way. A professor noted my ability and threw a funded PhD in petroleum engineering at me, which I have been doing for the past year and 2 months. All sounds good, right?

Here's the problem. I absolutely hated my undergraduate degree. I nearly quit half-way through, I found most of it boring and it completely put me off a job in that field. I didn't pay any attention to what career I wanted, I would attend lectures and return to my dorm to watch netflix and forget about life. I didn't get any internship experience in the holidays - instead I chose to relax and recover from what I deemed a depressing environment. At the end of it I had no idea what I wanted to do, but the petroleum engineering PhD offer was on a topic I was kind of interested in and the industry links through the professor would be excellent. Having said this, I didn't think I would enjoy it (although I hoped I was wrong). I did it because of the potential job at the end, to buy more time, to be a student for 3 more years and for the title at the end. You can see where this is going...  


Yes, I hate the PhD too. I'm not motivated to read on the topic, I'm not excited by any work I produce and my productivity is abysmal because I (literally) prefer to lie on the floor and stare at the ceiling than do work. In a real job I'd have been fired long ago. I feel like I'm being dragged through it by my supervisors. They claim to be happy with my work, but I'm not because I know it's not my best effort. Three months in I brought up that I didn't think it was for me but was persuaded to stay. My mental health has really suffered at times (spontaneous crying is a thing?) and I've felt like I'm drifting the entire time. I've given it a year and I'm still not enjoying it, so it's time to look for a job. I want to leave ASAP, as I can't really take much more of the mental ups and downs I currently experience. Covid obviously hasn't helped any of this, but I can't imagine it'd be much different in normal times either.  


**Now to the question**: How the hell do you pick a job when you're not sure you'll like it or be good at it?

I've ruled out the fantasy ones that everyone has — I'm not going to be a rockstar or a famous athlete.

I've ruled out those passions that I'm not qualified or suited for — I love animals but can't afford to train as a vet and the remaining jobs are poorly paid. I love health and fitness, but personal training seems unstable as a career and retraining as a physiotherapist is financially unfeasible. I always wanted to be an RAF pilot, but my eyesight is poor. 

  
I thought about what I like doing, and teaching seems appealing as I have enjoyed being a private tutor. But I researched the job and it seems 50% of it isn't actually teaching, most say the work life balance is poor and the pay doesn't reflect the commitment. I like working with numbers and so accounting seems like a reasonable option, but I have no idea whether I would find it boring or if the work/life balance is manageable. I have some ability computer programming, which I could develop further, but it's not enough to be employed without training and in any case I'm not sure I truly enjoy it.

&amp;#x200B;

**How have you fully functioning adults managed to navigate this?** Do you just apply for things that seem to suck the least and hope for the best? What if you're not entirely sure you can even do it (programming, in my case)?  It seems so hard trying to balance what you like, what you expect your salary to be, where you want to live etc etc. Any clarity is appreciated, thank you if you got this far! :)

678,"To provide background, I (24) am the youngest child of immigrant parents (from the Philippines). Growing up, my family struggled with money, lived paycheck to paycheck, and frequently bickered over finances.

Both my parents have jobs, but my father is financially abusive. To name a few examples, he opened credit cards under my sister's and my name (3 for her, 2 for me) when we turned 18 and maxed out all of our cards with purchases such as plane tickets for himself (I have paid them off since then). My mother earns more than my father, but he continues to deposit (&gt;75%) her paychecks into a secret account. They also file taxes jointly, so my mother feels she cannot experience financial freedom. He also urges my mother and sister to pick up more shifts at their job (my mother, sister, and I are registered nurses).

Fortunately, I do not have any student loans. However, my sister owes a somewhat significant amount, and my father made my mother sign nearly all of the parent plus loans in her name.

My mother has - please excuse my language - busted her ass to support my sister and me, but my parents are not financially literate. They are also in their early 50s/approaching retirement. My mother does not have anything saved for retirement (unsure about my dad), and my parents expect my older sister and me to support them.

They also expect my sister and me to apply for a mortgage/purchase a home under our names next year. We live in Chicago, and I hope to attend graduate school out-of-state soon. As much as I tell my parents how wary I am about buying property, they continue to push this idea.

I love my mother and am grateful for my parents. I acknowledge that the position I am in is the unfortunate result of circumstances beyond my control. However, this entire situation has left me feeling trapped.

686,"There’s a lawn service that comes out to mow my family’s (I’m 18f and live with my parents) yard. We’ve lived here a year and this same lawn service has been cutting our yard ever since we moved here. They never knock on the door, they just park out front, start working, finish, then leave when they’re done. My dad deals with all the paying/setting appointments, and I’m usually busy inside when they come by, so I‘ve never spoken with any of them. 

On rare occasions when I’m outside when they arrive, the mower’s already running super loudly, so we’ll all nod at each other and that’s it. But that’s rare. 

So one day, 2 months ago, I’m inside exercising, wearing a tank top and some shorts, and the doorbell rings. I peek outside to see who it is and see the lawn truck outside. They’ve never knocked before so I’m like “must be important.” 

I didn’t really recognize the guy (30-40 years old.) since it’s usually this husband and wife, and sometimes they bring a person or two with them.

He introduces himself (let’s call him Aidan) and says he’s with the lawn service. Aidan tells me they’re going to mow the neighbor across the street’s yard before they do our’s.  I’m basically like “ok, thanks. Bye.” just in more words. I start to shut the door but notice that he’s still standing there so I peek my head out (doing that half inside half outside thing) and he doesn’t say anything for a moment. He’s just quiet, staring at me with his hands in his pockets. 

Finally, he opens his mouth and starts talking about our neighbor’s lawn. He says they have brown patches. It was definitely a sort of random thing to say, but I figure he was going to tell me that we have brown patches too or something, but no. He says he hopes it rains soon. He starts moving forward slowly and starts talking about something else. I don’t remember what, but it was obvious he was trying to keep the conversation going. He went from 3 feet away from the door to like 3 inches away in like 15 seconds. I kind of scoot back into the house a bit more and my nephew yells something from the other room. I start to say some excuses about going to help my nephew and Aidan tries to stop me by continuing the conversation, but another guy with the service yells out to him so he finally says goodbye. 

Ever since then, Aidan has been knocking on my door whenever they are in the area. All of our conversations go about the same: 5 minutes of awkward silences and stilted conversation. He’ll even knock on days when they’re just doing the neighbors yard and not our’s. I tried to ignore the door a few times but he rang the bell, waited 40 seconds, rang again and then waited another 40 seconds until I finally answered. 

He stopped by again just now, wanting to talk. He hasn’t outright been flirty with me, but he’s always so uncomfortably close and stares at me way too much. It just rubs me the wrong way. He never knocks on the neighbor’s door. He’ll get out of the truck and head straight to my house while the others unload their gear to do the neighbors yard. 

Tldr; one of the guys that works for the lawn service that mows my yard keeps knocking on my door to talk. Very awkward conversations ensue, ending with him basically standing in my door-frame and me feeling very uncomfortable. No matter how many times I try to subtly say goodbye, the guy never wants to leave. Doesn’t matter if I ignore the door, he keeps ringing.

&amp;#x200B;

To sum it up as best I can, this year has been the lowest point in my life. I can only describe it as a fever dream with depression, stress, and anxiety all in the mix. Most nights, especially over the past few months I've woken up drenched in sweat, muscles tensed, and my heart pounding out of my chest. I can't recall any specific dreams/nightmares, but I know they're about death and dying. I have this reoccurring feeling of time passing in a blink of an eye, and me being trapped in an empty void. I have this intense feeling of having to get out of bed and do something, or at least move around. It's definitely one of the scariest feelings I've experienced and it takes me several minutes to calm myself down.

&amp;#x200B;

Since graduating from college two years ago, I've had a lot of trouble figuring out what I want to do with my life. When I graduated I felt like I was ready for the world. I was ready to expend all my energy into a pursuit that meant a lot to me. I wanted to use my creativity, take risks, and create a positive impact on the world. Graduating with a BA, I was lucky to get a job out of college. It was an entry level digital marketing job and I was excited for this new chapter in my life. I quickly realized that I was way off with my expectations. I felt like I was adding nothing of value. I felt like a cog in the machine. Each day I went into work I felt more depressed, unmotivated, and alienated. Those around me seemed happy to be in the same position as me, so I kept lying to myself and saying that I was happy. After about a year at my digital marketing job I had had enough and decided to quit my job and work for three months on a book I wanted to write as well as an app I wanted to create. I took the LSAT and prepared applications for law school. The planned three months I was going to use for creative projects and to prepare for further schooling turned into 10 months of being unemployed and no end in sight due to covid.

&amp;#x200B;

During this time I descended into a very dark place. I became very depressed and spent most days not talking to anyone. I felt an extreme loneliness that I've never felt before. I wouldn't wish that feeling on my worst enemy. I thought I was developing amnesia and felt like I was on autopilot every day. Trying to maneuver my way out of this dark place and the existential thoughts I was having, I got into philosophy. At first I think it pushed me even deeper into my depression and I started having the night terrors I explained above. I desperately wanted answers, but all I received were more questions.

&amp;#x200B;

I started having suicidal thoughts that I didn't have since high school. Instead of them being about my insecurities, self-worth, and debilitating depressed mood, these were coming more from a place of absolute numbness and the realization that nothing in this world matters. What always got me through tough times in high school was knowing that suicide was a permanent solution to a possibly temporary problem. I still use this line of thinking today, but fear that, as time passes, my temporary problems will become solidified into permanent problems.

&amp;#x200B;

Through the peak of this recent depression I really started to dissociate. I felt like a character in a play or a video game. Things around me started to not seem real, like I was living in a simulation. During this dissociative episode my comfort zone disappeared. I started going on long walks through my city (10+ miles) and striking up conversations with random people, which I never would have done. I downloaded dating apps and went on dates almost every other night for two weeks. I've never been in a relationship and up until recently considered myself to be on the aromantic spectrum.

&amp;#x200B;

What I realized throughout all of this was how emotionally repressed I've been all these years.  Since having a traumatic experience with a death in my family at the age 13 my coping mechanism has been to block out all my emotions. I hated asking for help and I never liked stepping outside of my small comfort zone. I always felt anxiety whenever I got too close to my boundaries. Through this out-of-body episode I finally came to realize how damaging I've been to myself all these years. I started to feel sorry for myself. I finally came to the understanding that I was robbing myself of a lot of love and happiness over the years.

&amp;#x200B;

For most of my life I only saw my value and self-worth in terms of what I could do for others, never for what I could do for myself. This has brought me to the crossroads that I'm currently stuck at. I've applied to law school for the 2021 cycle and I can see myself having a fulfilling and meaningful career in law. I also want to travel, meet new people, work on more creative pursuits, and get out of my comfort zone more. I have this itching desire to get a work/holiday visa and wing it in Australia. The problem with law school is that I'll be doing nothing but studying for the next three years of my life and I'll be immediately tied down by my future career and opportunities. I feel like I've only recently started to understand how inauthentically I've been living and I want the opportunity to explore and experience life in a way that is truly authentic to myself.

&amp;#x200B;

I don’t want to live a life where I rob myself of all feeling. I don’t want to live a life where I succumb to my vulnerabilities. I don’t want to live a life that is not authentic to who I truly am without my insecurities and emotional detachments. Life is finite. It ends. It’s dreadfully short. What pains me the most is realizing that in this short life, I will never get back the years I’ve suffered alone with my debilitating thought patterns. I will never have the experience of branching out in high school. I will never have the experience going through college, experimenting and pushing the boundaries of my comfort zone. I will never get back the 11 grueling years of feeling like I've barely kept my head above the water instead of being at peace with being alive and experiencing the world.

&amp;#x200B;

I've finally made the decision to reach out and try to get a therapist. The weakness and vulnerability I felt thinking about getting help from others was overpowered by my fear of going through life as a shell of who I truly am. Anyway, if anyone has any advice that could help me navigate through this crisis I would be forever grateful for it. If anything I'm hoping to see that I'm not alone in feeling this way.",30Dec2020,1

696,"I am 21 years old and I've never been really good at making my own decisions, and unfortunately I had to go through a real life dilemma. 

A couple months ago my father brought over a coworker to stay with us for a few months at our house. I will call this coworker by the name ""Julie"" and she is around 30 years old. Before then it was just me and him who used to live in the house. When Julie first moved in, nothing odd seemed to happen but as time moved on until everything unexpectedly took the turn for the worst. 

My father became controlling towards Julie, not allowing her to speak to her friends and never gave her alone time both at work and at home. He would come to her room at night, and this would cause her to have sleepless nights. When she decided to speak back to my father, telling him that she wanted alone time, he would respond with aggression and yell at her. She was always frightened of him. I decided to help and speak to her every time my father left the house and one day she drank alcohol because she wanted to forget about the previous nights. She told me how she wanted to leave the house but at the same time she also wanted to see my father get better. I told her that she will need to call the police to leave, but she refused. The only thing she wanted me to do was to convince my father to stop coming to her room at night. I've always tried but my father never listened to me and always told me to leave the situation to him. I'm suspecting my father is mentally unstable and I wanted to get him help but he always refused. At this point I just broke out and cried the most I've ever in my life. I felt helpless and I didn't know what to do. 

 When my father came back, he got angry at her for drinking alcohol. I spoke out and told him to please stop while I was also crying. Julie ran behind me and I can tell she was really scared. Eventually he called my name and then said ""I'll kill you"". And this was when I could never see my father in the same way. Now at this point even I was scared of him. 

A couple days later my brother came over and I already told him the details beforehand. On the night of December 23rd, me and my brother told my cousin about the situation and we eventually decided that calling the police would be the best choice. I wanted Julie to get away from the house and leave to my brother's house. When the police came, they told us that any of us could leave at any point since we were all adults. However, Julie lied about the situation and told them that everything was fine and told them that she didn't want to leave the house. Right here I cried, and I didn't know what to do to help her. The police wanted us to hurry up and I eventually made the decision to leave but she decided to stay. As me and my brother walked to police car to be driven to my brother's house, Julie said goodbye to me and whispered that everything will okay. I told her to please stay safe and I kept saying sorry. 

Ever since that day I've been having nightmares of alternatives things I could have done and I've been crying endlessly. I just want everything and everyone to be okay. I called my cousin, talked with him for a while and he told me that there's nothing I can do since Julie is an adult and it was her decision whether or not to leave. I completely agree with him on that but I had too much of an emotional connection with Julie that she felt like an older sister and my emotions were still overwhelming me.

Fast forward to today, December 30th, I called Julie to check up with her. I can tell from her voice that she was not okay and I told her to please tell me what happened in the past week but she just told me that everything is fine. She wants me to come home and I think that's because she still feels scared.

I'm really worried for her and I want her to get help to call someone but she won't do it. Is there anything I can do at this point?",30Dec2020,1

699,"Hi all,

Was hoping to hear some other points of view regarding my living situation.

I moved into an apartment owned by 2 brothers back in September 2020. Myself and one other guy are the two tenants, and he has lived there for 3 years and is now pretty good friends with the owners.

When I moved in, things were pretty much fine, however as time has progressed things have gotten worse. He consistently leaves dishes in the sink overnight, leaves cooked food out on the counter overnight, and has his personal belongings all over the living room all the time. He spilled a container of raspberries in the fridge 3 weeks ago and is yet to clean up the juice. I have mentioned it to him multiple times but he has not made an effort to clean it up. He also works from home so his work equipment is generally always at the kitchen breakfast nook where he works. Additionally, I find that he drinks pretty heavily and almost every night. This worries me to a small extent.

Additionally, he asked me the other day if he could have a few friends over for NYE (4-5). I told him I wasn’t really comfortable with it. I myself am going away with my girlfriend and her sister to PA. He tried to compare the two situations and say it’s essentially what I’m doing. However, the three of us got covid tested this week and came back negative. He on the other hand does not regularly get tested. I am worried he will have people over anyway regardless of what I said I am comfortable with.

I really am not sure what to do in this situation as we’ve talked about these issues before and not much has changed. I think I need to sit down with him and talk about these things in a more serious manner. I recently got a new job in NJ, so I may end up moving there. I partially want to use this roommate situation with my landlords to break the lease, but I don’t really know how I would even phrase it or go about that without paying the early termination fee.

The expressway is where things get bad I sweat profusely my hands are slipping on the wheel were I can’t even get a good grip on the wheel I’m constantly imaging myself crashing into a medium or gettin lost it’s seriously getting in the way with how I live... another example would be elevators...  if there are 10 floors of steaks I rather take the stairs than being inside of one alone gives me serious anxiety, I’m extremely cluster phobic and the thought of getting stuck inside seems like the end of the world to me.

Everything was alright for a while, but now he will not stop playing video games. He plays all day while I’m at work and stays up playing all night talking to his friends and using his mechanical keyboard (which is very loud) and it keeps me up. I have to wake up at 9am on week days and 7 on Saturday for work, so him playing that late has been making me extremely tired and agitated. I’ve tried talking about it, but he tells me I need to just go to the guest bedroom in the main part of the house so he can play his games.

I want to share something with y'all I was too afraid to say for a long time. 
So my mom and dad really love me. (Well I guess so) But sometimes... it's lie I'm unwanted. Like I'm the bad kid that's a mess.
I don't know if it's disrespectful to call it abuse. My parents raised my pretty good, besides my suicide thoughts, self harm issues and some other stuff.  They raised me to be friendly and polite. But I don't know if the way they raised me is too good. 


My dad... well he has some problems with anger and everything. Sometimes he slaps me or something in that way. Nothing too big, I guess. Others have it worse. 
But my mom. My mom sometimes scares me. She isn't physically harming me too often. Sometimes when she angry she grabs my arm etc, but well, not as bad as others have it.
But the way she interacts with me is really... strange? 
Sometimes she randomly starts to scream at me for little things or nothing. And after that she
A) get through the day with me as nothing has happened

B) acts like I screamed at her and plays the victim, says that I want her to die
or
C) is too friendly to me calls me her ""lovely Daughter"" ""Sunshine"" etc.

But there's never an apology.
I never really heard her apologizing to me. That's a thing that heavily hurts me. Also sometimes she completely ignores me or interrupts me every time in the middle of a sentence. 
And if she notices that I'm angry she starts to get super friendly and loves me. 

There's a lot of other things that I could mention but it's too much, I guess.

709,"On mobile, sorry for the crappy format. 

This sounds ridiculous, but it’s driving me up the wall. I’ll try to be as short as possible. My (25F) mother owns a salon. Two years ago, my mom had a bigger salon with a manicure and pedicure area, yet no other stylist was interested in Nails at the time, so her and the 3 other stylists moved to a smaller building. There is a stylist that has worked there for 4 years. This is my first year working there and I have accumulated a lot of clientele because of my hard work and promoting myself. I’ve also started doing nails. This other stylist only schedules through Facebook and has less clientele than myself (but only because she never promoted herself).  Once I started taking off, she started promoting herself online and mimicking everything I did on social media. Although I have a cosmetology license, I’m a self taught nail tech and I have busted my ass for over a year practicing. My mom agreed that since there’s still room for a manicure area, I could do nails in the salon if I provide my own things. So I start getting even more clientele. The stylist I’m having an issue with, starts making snarky, backhanded compliments and remarks to me. And I was the only stylist that didn’t receive a Christmas gift from her (which doesn’t really matter but it goes to show she has issue with me). She approached me last week and told me she was somehow added to the nail groups I was in and has now bought her own nail supplies. But there’s only one manicure table, and that’s my paid for manicure table. And if she tries to do nails too, it would overlap 
With my clientele. I feel as though she had a pretty big  leap to do this before I came, and I don’t want to share my paid for area/station. It may be selfish to a degree but I’ve done so much for this person and she has so much hostility towards me. I gave her my cricket machine for free as well as my vinyls, etc so she could make stuff on the side. She has spent more time doing that than focusing on her hair career and now she’s trying to take up nails and I’m so irritated over the whole situation. She’s also been a smart ass because my mom and I had to put locks on our cabinets because she was stealing our product. But my mom feels bad for her because she has no family left other than her husband and children. 

Side note: I’ve also had clients call me and cuss me because I never called them back to schedule an appointment and “they left a message with someone” and I’ve never gotten those messages. This has been at least 4 times. I may be paranoid but I think she’s really just out to get me out of there or feels some type of way that my moms the owner.

712,"Hello, I've decided to delete social media and go hermit mode for a while because I was tired of dramas and all the fake friendships that were only adding to my already broken situation in my personal life. 
One guy that I've been friends with a few years ago but we never kept in touch, suddenly decided to act like a friend (again, after 3 years of barely talking once 6 months, after he broke up with his ex) he saw my ig and how many guys want me,  text me everyday and keep me company although i had made myself clear i don't want a relationship, he said he's in the same boat as he broke up with an abusive ex, and exactly like him i only had toxic relationships, so we both were only interested in a friendship. (he said although girls want to be with him, he can't have sex with just anyone cause he needs to feel some type of connection, and that only because i wondered why he's so avoidant about being in a relationship but still talking about wanting sex occasionally). 
He became the only person I've been talking to, the mood was always friendly and fun, i was feeling really nice after a long time of painful events and lost relatives and friendships. 
Everything was fine, we've been talking as friends for 3 months now, and even helped each other, he made me feel less alone and also made me slowly open my heart again, but.. about two weeks ago we started talking about more intimate stuff, i told him we should put on some boundaries, he accepted but the next few days we only talked about sex, basically crushing any line i put before us. He suddenly became like this, almost unrecognizable. 
He admitted that he likes me (we live on a distance) i told him to go find someone else cause i want to work on myself before i even get in another relationship, he said he'll wait for me, that morality is important and his feelings are already with me.
Now.. All of those past days he keeps bringing sex in the comvo and what we'll do if we met, sometimes he adds stuff like ""i wanna hold you and cuddle with you"" and then sex again, and the problem is, I already invested feelings. 
Is it normal for someone that says ""i have feelings"" to only talk about this? To keep asking me for boobs pics?(i was never the type of girl to ever do such things). 3 months of chatting is nothing much to me, i wanted to get to know him better and be 100% about this, i even told him this might take a year so again.. ""Find a girl to fulfill that"", but he keeps feeding me with ""no, it's not only sex i actually like you, i wanna make you happy"" 
It's just hurting me, people always had those types of interests in me and now that i open up, it seems to be happening again. 
We were also about to watch a movie yesterday and a porn ad appeared with some girls boobs and he kept talking about that ""how hot her breasts are"" i told him that's hurting me because I'm a bit insecure about mine and it's just not right to watch a movie with a girl and talk about others breasts, he apologized but he still asks for this stuff from me. 
What should i do? He says that there's no magic in any other girls if there's no feelings. 
I don't think using the fact that you need to feel something for a girl so you can have sex with her, is an excuse for acting like a nympho towards me. He gets very descriptive, and i don't feel the friendship connection anymore, I'm almost feeling forced to continue his perverted conversations and even meet with him, because I'm afraid to break this, he's become my only friend that i truly felt a connection with. 
I don't understand anymore, what should i do?

We are in the process of selling our house, and we need to get rid of pretty much every furniture we have. I'm using Aptdeco to sell some of the cheaper stuff, but I have a couch/coffee table set that we bought for $15K a decade ago. That one is giving me a headache.

My niece is 3 years old, and she definitely has something going on with her. My mom suspsects autism and has since before she was 1 year old. 

Throughout her 3 years, she has been behind on learning to speak, potty training, and does behave like a child developing normally.

She is has violent tantrums often. She will pick on the cat who swats at her and runs away, and she hits and shakes her infant sister. She does not respond to consequences in any way. My mom says she'll give her an ""evil, blank stare"" and scream and hit things. 

She also throws and smears her feces on things and tries to put things into her anus and vagina.

My sister is refusing to take her to preschool, presumably because she is afraid of how she'll behave around other children.

All of this, and my sister is in denial. She says the doctor said there's nothing wrong with her (we do not believe her). She barely addresses when we bring up these major behavioral issues. And to top it all off, her and her husband spank her VERY often.

It's all driving me mad, and living so far away makes me feel helpless. Her child needs help and she needs to stop hitting her, and I don't know what to do. My mom already considered calling CPS, but there will be not evidence of abuse and their home is very nice and adequate. I argue it will be a wake up call, but others disagree.

I had an abortion about 10-12 years ago, before I my met my ex. Once we got together he was very bothered by it and would always hold it against me (call me a slut, said I had a “past”). One day I had had enough and outright lied and said I was.. taken advantage of.. for lack a better term. I told him I said no to the guy but I didn’t. I take full responsibility for the situation and having to have one, but I am so so so bothered that I lied about this. I only told this lie to my then boyfriend, I never gave any names and would NEVER tell anyone else that, it was like in the moment I was so tired of being shamed I resorted to such a low lie and I am ashamed. I am now concerned I’m a bad person. How should I handle this? Thanks in advance.",30Dec2020,1

721,"To give some background information, I (19F) am Chinese and grew up in a pretty conservative household where I was not allowed to date until I graduated, I had to recall every single detail back to my parents when I went out with friends, and was expected to get straight As in school. I was told that I didn’t have to worry about anything and to just focus on my studies so I never had to cook dinner or even pay rent. I wouldn’t say I was privileged, but I definitely had it easier than other people.

I have been living with my parents my entire life and as of recently, things have downhill at home. My mental health has not been the best and my parents are not making things any better. We are not on speaking terms at home right now because I lied to my mom about how late I’ve been staying up to talk to my friends. And so they set highly ridiculous rules like how I can’t stay up past 12 and I had to wake up at 9 in the morning everyday, and my phone has to be outside on the charger and my laptop too (it’s usually in my room since I do online school). Because of COVID, I haven’t been able to see my friends so I used Discord to gain some sort of human interaction, but they didn’t like that I was talking to random strangers on the internet. It’s been my way of coping with all the stress of school right now, and when they told me delete the app, I felt angry that they couldn’t see how unhappy I was. Keep in mind that mental health is pretty taboo in asian culture so my parents just think that I’m acting up. So of course, I broke the rules and continued to stay up until they threatened to kick me out of the house if I did it again. 

I’m feeling trapped at home right now and that my parents don’t value my freedom and privacy as an adult. I don’t want to feel like every single aspect of my life is being controlled so I’ve been having thoughts about moving out but I’ve been sheltered and babied all my life so I have no clue how to even get started. My parents treat me like I’m a clueless little girl, but that’s because I am; I don’t know how to cook, but groceries, or even do my taxes...am I capable of being a responsible adult and keeping up with schoolwork? And what if I’m just being overdramatic? I don’t have to do anything and it’s just a few restrictions I have to follow, so what if I’m better off just sucking it up and staying at home, especially with the pandemic going on? I’m feeling very lost and would appreciate if someone would take the time to help me out.",30Dec2020,1

I am a site manager for a huge Carwash and am trying to find a way to get the Wraps that clean the cars looking shiny and new again. Currently we are scrubbing them with a soap we use in the wash and dawn and it’s working okay. But I think there has to be an easier way...

The wraps are made of a foam like material, very similar to what workout mats are made of. 

Here are some ideas I’ve tried and ultimately failed at...

Dawn and vinegar
Let soak in soap and spray off
Pressure wash deep (best clean but time consuming)
Dawn and a high PH acid soap
Dawn and low PH acid soap
Detergent
Oxiclean (actually turned out pretty good) 

Now there is one huge disclaimer... the wraps cannot come down. I’ve thought a million times to just put them in a washing machine but they are physically attached to the metal.

So, normally this would be a welcomed thing. We've been ""loosely"" trying for about 4 months, and to be honest, we were expecting it to take a bit longer. Problem is, we're not exactly in the best spot right now. I am finishing up grad school in roughly a year, and will likely start working after taking a certification exam and getting credentialed, so likely around Jan/Feb 2021 if everything works out. She was laid off in September and hasn't had much luck finding another job.

Her parents are wealthy, successful people. Since we're in a tough spot, they graciously offered to help with living expenses while my wife finds work or I finish school (I am unable to work during this phase...I have an erratic clinicals schedule). We've been surviving on student loans and money from her parents in the meantime.

Simply put, we're terrified of breaking the news. This would be the 1st grandchild in the family, but they have always preached the ""wait until things are settled"" advice, which I agreed with. But here we are. We either think they will be very excited/happy, or the complete opposite and be incredibly upset. Given my wife's age and since we're married and do have enough in savings to float us, we're planning on going with the pregnancy.

Neither of us have been in this situation, or have any siblings who have as well. Just looking for some advice or guidance on how to make this the best situation possible.",30Dec2020,1

737,"This is a long and crazy story that I will do my best to summarize. I've been thinking about posting on here for a while but I'm a little nervous of the backlash I'll receive for this, as I've suffered many consequences and bad treatment in my real life, but I want some honest opinions from uninvolved folk.

I used to work at a very upscale, well-known restaurant. I worked there for 5 years. The community at this restaurant is like a family. Like most restaurants, but even more so. Many employees have been there 15+ years. That being said, we are all up in each other's business. About a year into working there, I met fellow employee, we'll call him X. We had a friendly work relationship and there was no denying that there was an attraction. To be honest, it was very obvious on his end and at times made me uncomfortable, especially because he was married. There was a lot of joking at work and I could tell that he went out of his way to speak to me sometimes. It made me a little nervous and uncomfortable and my boyfriend at the time even had issues with it, just seeing us speak to each other when we came for a visit. It was like he knew he was my type, maybe, although I really tried to hide it. I really honestly never said anything suggestive and went out of my way to talk about my boyfriend and his wife when we talked, but there was definitely no denying that there was a spark.

About a year after meeting, him and his wife split up for a little while. He ran into me outside of work at this time and asked if we could hang out later and I said no, even though I was single at the time. Him and his wife got back together a few weeks after that.

His wife then send me a facebook message saying I shouldn't talk to her husband and I need to ""know my place"". I said that I was sorry she felt this way and had a misunderstanding of my intentions toward her husband. She never replied.

Fast forward a few years, and we didn't speak much, just casually at work. I never saw him outside of work, and his wife was always, always a bitch to me anytime I saw her. She went into business with one of my best male friends, and it did seem like after some months, she was accepting that I was around and not after her husband. She still made it clear that I wasn't invited to any of my best friends gatherings she was at (even his birthday parties) which really sucked and hurt me a lot but I respected that.

X went on a solo vacation without her, and when he came back, he talked openly at work with a few of us about having serious issues with his wife and being really unhappy. Like, she hadn't spoken to him in weeks, like she was going through all his emails and phone and getting upset with him for years constantly he was never good enough. And some other deep seeded issues that seemed present for the whole relationship. Sort of same stuff he was talking about last time they split up. Around this week, he was talking to me more, and I was feeling some of those come-ons that I had felt back when we'd first met. He was talking to me about his relationship, and I was happy to listen, but I wanted to make it clear that we were just friends. I didn't want to talk to him at work about this because I didn't want it to be seen by others as there was something going on, so we met for coffee. We were together for about 45 minutes, at a place close to work, a public park. I didn't go into this meeting feeling like I wanted to hide, it did make me a little nervous but I thought it was important we talk.

When we talked, I said I was aware of the energy between us, and while I sympathize with his relationship troubles, I am not going to in any way be involved with him. He said he understood and confessed that he thought about me a lot and could see us being a good match, and at that point I told him this is not a possibility for a long time as he's going through whatever he's going through with his wife. To be clear, we did not touch in any way shape or form EVER at this point. We parted ways and I went to work.

While at work, I got a text from my best friend saying ""Why did you hang out with X today?"" and I responded ""I had a coffee and a conversation with him, why?"" and this was basically the last time my friend spoke to me. A few hours after that, a (drunk) co worker found me on my way out and told me he was going to ""slap me in my fucking face"" and I should follow him to the porch. I went with him, thinking he was kidding, and he said, ""Who have you been fucking? You fucking slut"" and took a glass of wine and threw it at me, and broke the glass on the ground. I was in shock. I know now from hearing this from drunk co-worker later on, that wife had sent him a text saying ""\[she\] has been having an affair with my husband for months"". Long story short with this part, this drunk co-worker got fired for this confrontation at the workplace, as he was still working, and walked out on his tables after this blow up.

This is where everything got so much worse. Everyone in the community obviously heard about the guy getting fired, and it got around that it was because I was having an affair with X. The wife wrote to the General Manager of my restaurant tell her that I was having said affair, so that she would sympathize with the drunk co-worker, and that's when they tried to demote me from my manager shifts. They said I wasn't in a good place to manage because of things going on outside of work. I told people that the rumor wasn't true, but barely anyone but my best female friend, and a few others, believed me. The drunk co-worker told everyone that I had gotten him fired, and that I was lying about him throwing the wine (my sweater covered in wine says otherwise...) and people believed him when he said that I had gone to management and said he had to be fired because I was ""afraid to be around him"" which I NEVER said.

I ended up getting a lawyer and a cease and desist for the wife because she was trying to ruin my reputation at my job, and successfully had me demoted and sympathized with drunk coworker. When I told upper management I had done this, they gave me my shifts back. They originally told drunk co-worker (according to him and his friends) that he could have his job back when I leave (?????!!!) making the problem with me and making a bunch of people angry I worked there.

Of course at this point I was furious with X. Wife had gone through his texts and found one of him saying ""Still on for 2?"" and confronted him and although he told her nothing had happened she kicked him and he didn't really fight it. In 24 hours, she had trashed all of his things, kicked him out, took all their money from the joint checking, and told everyone she could (literally, even regulars at my restaurant were talking about it) that I had an affair with her husband. I was angry with X and didn't want to speak with him, even though he reached out to apologize a lot, he didn't seem to understand at the time how messed up my life was.

I lost almost all my friends. It was an exceptionally horrible time for me. It was a terrible lesson in who my real friends were. People who really knew me, knew I couldn't have been having the affair. Even male best friend knew but wouldn't talk to me. 2 months after this happened, I reached out to X to see how he was doing. He has doing terribly, as you can imagine, going through a separation with this woman. This was in December, and in March, we hung out, and he kissed me. At the time, I was really scared about what it meant. We slowly started spending little time together, a walk or going to lunch. Now that I didn't have to hold back, I really, really fell for him.

It's been a year and we're still together. He told his ex that we were seeing each other a few months after we did and she of course lost it. She then told a bunch of people I had sex with male best friend (never) and another person at my work. Everyone assumes we were having the affair now, so it's really uncomfortable to be around anyone in that community. People don't speak to me when I'm around and give me looks. It was actually really surprising who totally cut me off, some of them don't even really know the wife and I thought knew me. I've reached out to some friends to say, ""Hey, if you ever want to talk to ask me any questions, I miss being your friend and would like to explain"", but no one has taken me up on it. My old best male friend still hasn't spoken to me.

I'm thankful for the life I have right now. I feel really respected and understood by my friends who stuck around, my family, and X. As someone who has always really cared about what people think of me, it's really hard thinking all these people hate me out there, but I know the truth of what happened, and never had any bad intensions. Am I the asshole in this situation? I know I'm not perfect, and that I could have acted differently, but did my actions deserve all this? Am I wrong for being with him now?

Thanks for listening.",30Dec2020,1

740,"I’m beyond angry right now. Getting denied on your own accord is one thing, but my roommate said she “forgot she was supposed to pay rent twice in December because she was behind”. First of all, there’s absolutely no reason she’s that far behind on rent. I know we’re in a pandemic, but she has worked the entire time. Second, how do you forget about a whole month of rent?? On December 15th I dropped off her rent check (she doesn’t have a car) and I assumed it was December’s rent. It wasn’t, it was November’s rent. Which she failed to mention to me. Which she continues to say she forgot, but feels like she just lied. We’re in Washington, where the rent moratorium is still going on, but as we still have jobs if we can pay rent, I feel we should at least try to stay up to date. 

I’ve been wanting to move out 90% of our time being roommates. And I’ve finally had enough band decided to apply for a place on my own. I get a call from the new apartment I’m applying too, and they say there’s a balance on our current place, so they can’t approve my application. 

Here’s where I need advice, I have some savings. Should I just pay that month of rent for her ($1100) obviously making sure she pays me back, so that I can get approved for the apartment? Or is that getting into dangerous territory. It’s 12/30 now, so I’m running out of time before she’s already late on January’s rent. 

TL;DR: Roommate is 30 days late on rent, with no intention to pay by January.  My apartment application for a new place got denied because of this. Should I pay her rent with my savings, hoping that she’ll pay me back ASAP just so I can move out?",30Dec2020,1
741,"HELP! I don’t know what to do! (mother-daughter)

I’m at my wits end and idk where to go from here.... so I’ll try to start with a brief background 

I’m an only child and always been with basically just my mom. We’ve always been beyond close, closer than most any mother and daughter. Music festivals, shows, dinners, beach days, etc together. My absolute best friend all my life. Was always very trusting and always had very few restrictions growing up and through high school. We lived apart for 2 years shortly after I turned 18!while we both lived with boyfriends at the time. We ended up both leaving our relationships at the same time and ended up moving back in together.

I agreed to pay her every month to help with rent and always did. Our cats did not get along and we had to keep them separated. This caused my one cat to have MAJOR issues with peeing everywhere. 

When COVID happened she got fucked hard, while I was blessed to maintain a good job the entire time almost. Her life flipped upside down. We were no longer going to be able to afford the place we were at. She pushed me to find my own place. We had been fighting all the time over stupid shit around the house; or her yelling at me because I wasn’t home enough for my cats. She urged me to find my own place. She would say things like 
“I know it’s scary but once you make it happen and you come home to an apartment that’s all yours where no one can nag you or tell what to do anymore, you’re gonna be so happy.”
She gave the landlord a 30 day notice so I found myself a place for me and my 2 cats ASAP.

I have really good credit, hers got tanked this year. However I had no rental history so she co signed on my lease to fulfill some rental history for me and gave me the ability to get the apartment.

I come up with deposits and everything on my own and it’s time for me to move in. My fist apartment!!! No roommates, just me. The fighting was ending. 

I was there 3 weeks. In those 3 weeks I spent more time at home, my cats had free roam of the entire 700 sq ft apartment, no other animals. No more peeing outside the box, no more crying meows from being stuck inside a room. Me and the cats were finally so happy. 

The first of December came up and the landlord of our old place was selling the house, so we had to be out. I was out already. My mom was still unemployed and had no money to move nor nowhere to move into. So after only 3 short weeks of finally having my own space, my mom moves in with all her shit, her cat, and her dog into my 1 bedroom apartment. Shall I mention that the lease had a no dog policy due to the landlords insurance and her dog has been here for a month now with her?!!!

I held faith that although a shitty situation, things weren’t gonna be the same. She said she would respect  that she was now in my space. 

My mom is very very OCD cleanly person. She spent the first few weeks deep cleaning the dump of an apartment I got because she rushed me to find a plane so bad. Everyday I would come home into my apartment and immediately get bitched and screamed at about not helping her clean the place up and how she was doing all this shit around the apartment for me.

Meanwhile, our cats now have to be separated again, therefore my cats are often now locked into a bedroom. My cat starts peeing everywhere again, and crying constantly: 

I can no longer stand to be inside of my own apartment. 

I start staying over at my boyfriends as much as possible, while still making sure I am home to feed my cats twice a day, and take care of them. Everyday, it’s another fight with my mom. I’m miserable all over again. I can’t believe this is happening.... 

It’s now been almost a month of my mom staying in my apartment, waiting to not only start her new job, but save the money to move. She constantly screams at me about not helping with stuff around the apartment.

Tonight, everything went to shit.

Im at work and suddenly my mom is blowing my texts up with long messages about how I neglect my cats because I’m never there and I need to give them up. Half the reason I’m in this shithole of an apartment is because I needed a place that allowed cats...

Send me pictures of them with the caption “their existence...” send me pictures of the baskets of clean laundry and says “how many times are you going to walk past this laundry I did for you???” 

PICTURES FROM INSIDE MYYYY OWN APARTMENT.

She’s done a lot for me. Which is why I’ve been very tolerant of her behavior since staying with me and her trying to still tell me what to do under my roof. But tonight was my breaking point and I completely flipped out. 

She went on and on about how I need to step up and do my part and take care of my animals. At one point I said “if you hadn’t had to come stay with me, you wouldn’t even know when I was it wasn’t home.

Her response: “well too bad cause I am here and I do know” 

Begins to threaten to “expose” me to all of her social media how I neglect my pets and “choose my social life over taking care of my beloved animals”

Counties to go off on me.

Eventually I go off. I mention how the cats weren’t locked up before, I was home more often when I had the place to myself and didn’t have to come home to constant screaming and bitching. 

And this is where shit went absolutely over the edge. 

I said “when I lived with you, even though I was an adult you were able to say “my roof” so why don’t I get that same privilege now?”

She says...

“It’s not YOUR roof little girl!!! I am on the lease!!! Remember?!?!”

And then says that she is going to pay my rent and give my landlord a 30 day notice and that we both have 30 days to figure it out.... 

Now I’m sitting here crying after working so hard to find my own apartment. She used her co signing and turned it against me and now I’m loosing my first apartment..... 

What can I do?! Am I fucked because I let her co sign??? Do I have any legal rights at all or am I 100% screwed. My landlord has no idea she’s been living here for the last month, and especially has no idea she’s been sneaking her dog here too.. 

I feel so sad, angry, defeated....

Now she's dating a new guy and sent us both messages trying to halfway apologize (she's sent similar messages to my sister before and been ignored but this is the first one I've ever gotten) and somewhat rekindle the friendship but while she really does seem to want to apologize, based on her wording and failure to acknowledge a lot of her own actions during that period I kind of doubt she's actually put enough thought into it to genuinely do that yet and understand why we were truly all upset in the first place. So I'm hesitant to say I ""forgive her"" exactly.


But even ignoring the whole apology message, this happened right after highschool for me and it's been almost a decade. I can't exactly say I've forgiven her in the way she probably wants me to but I'm not really mad at her anymore either, I've just moved on and rarely ever think about that time in my life anymore. I've also changed a lot as a person, she probably has too and based on what I can see of her social media, I probably wouldn't be friends with her now even if she were a stranger without all the bad history. There's nothing wrong with how she lives her life as far as I can tell but I just don't see us having that much in common and I have no desire to chase a highschool friendship that probably would have fizzled out by now anyway.


So is it worth it to reply to the message and tell her that? Or would it just be mean to basically say ""I don't even think about you anymore or really care, leave me alone and have a nice life""? I know she probably also wants a chance to ""talk it out"" and explain her side of the story more but I honestly have no desire to rehash it all, I mean why bother for a friendship I don't even really want? I'm not trying to be cruel here but I don't feel like I owe this girl a redemption arc just because she doesn't think she can move on from her shitty highschool mistakes without my blessing ya know?


Tldr: Had a falling out with a friend, she wants to apologize now but it doesn't really feel genuine, plus I really don't have an interest in being friends again as it's been almost 10 years and we've both changed and have very little in common anymore. Not sure if I should just ignore the message or reply and tell her as much.",30Dec2020,1
745,"Hi everyone.

I recently got a new job as a bikini barista to help pay off my debt. 

The girls at the stand always work alone, except I’ve been training the last couple of days so I worked with one other girl. 

The problem is that no one wears masks. Literally no one. I felt weird so I didn’t wear one either (stupid I know). But now I’m thinking I should (obviously). 

My question is, if I’m wearing a mask on all of my shifts, but I come in after a girl who isn’t wearing a mask for her entire shift, and we only are in the same room for 10 minutes or so, am I still at a pretty high risk? I’m considering quitting this job because I’m starting to get paranoid about it. I feel like they’re gonna think I’m weird for wanting to wear a mask but I honestly don’t care, so I’ll wear one but I won’t keep working there if that isn’t much protection since no one else wears them.

She has also been a little difficult, sometimes blaming people for issues that we are still working on fixing, but this project makes up a big part of our grade so I don't want to take it away from her.

However my friends are insisting on entirely taking her name off the project. I don't think this is possible this late into the project, but if it is I'm conflicted. She hasn't done the appropriate amount of work but I think they are overreacting.

I’ve told my landlord about this and he’s done nothing. He’s told me not to approach them, as in his words “they’re always drunk and aggressive”.

My mom told me that I'm to naive and not malicious. I know my mom is tired and everything because she does a lot but I do my best to help her.

780,"I just received a large inheritance after my grandma passed and feel a bit frozen.

Hey guys, 

This is an alt account for obvious reasons. 

I’ll start with a short sort of all encompassing summary and then get into details for those who have the time. In short, I’ve recently come into a large and unexpected sum of money after my grandmothers passing. 

To anyone willing to read further I really appreciated your time and am just posting here to get any advice that one may have to offer because I know this is a rather precarious position and it’s really just something I have nobody to share with and quite overwhelming. 

My family is pretty broken apart and has been for a long time now including my childhood. My mother passed away when I was young and I have little to no relationship with my father or his sister and her family (my aunt). I spoke with both my aunt and my father when my grandmother passed away but things went pretty silent after that again for a time.

Recently my aunt sent me a wonderful Christmas gift and we have now been speaking a bit both by text and by email. 

My Grandmother passed due to complications that were not covid related but certainly during the pandemic.

I was informed that I was a large part of her will pretty quickly after, which was surprising, but I’ve had some time to process that over the last few months and quarantine. My Grandmother was very reclusive and owned a few properties in New York where she lived. My father hasn’t spoken to her in years and I grew up without hardly knowing her. 

The only real communication that we had was through our letters to one another. I used to send her poetry that I would write as she was a writer and I would also send her cards for her birthday and Christmas ext... but we had a very sparse relationship. I can’t remember two real calls between us, including one around this time last year. 

As I understand it my aunt has been left all of my Grandmothers land and property which surprisingly also encompasses a house in Florida that I didn’t know existed.

It was my aunt that sent me the paperwork and I only really just recently dug into them after a voicemail from her asking me to please get my paperwork notarized.

The will is odd, it is quite short and is largely redacted. It’s the only will I have seen before so maybe it’s not that odd but it felt weird to read. After some googling it seems that redactions are quite normal but there really just isn’t much to read. However the sum of money is mentioned and for the sake of detail my grandmother left me over five million dollars. 

I’m currently essentially the epitome of a struggling student. I live in a small town and really have just struggled with money for most of my life. I’m lucky to have a wonderful landlord who even during covid has allowed me stays on my lease after I lost my job last spring. Recently I’ve been making rent again after regaining that same job. But I guess what I’m saying is I’ve been fortunate to not be homeless, to be in school and to have work and food but beyond that I have no financial savings, or knowledge of stocks or what have you. I also of course have student debt and a little medical as well. 

In all honesty I know this is a life changing amount of money but currently I just feel like I’m struggling. I guess I pose it as two parts anxious about how to properly save this and utilize the wealth and one part just lonely I guess as it’s just a reminder of how broken apart my family is and my grandmothers loss hit me pretty hard even though I only knew her a little a bit. 

I actually didn’t even have a single person in my life to tell about  this huge event or to talk about my grandmas passing as I just currently don’t have close friends beyond people that I talk to exclusively inside class (now largely zoom) and my father and I rarely speak. So this whole will and inheritance just highlights the framework and seams of my current life I guess. 

I know that this post is dragging on but that last addition I will add that is really quite huge and stressful is that as far as I can tell my father isn’t a part of the will beyond some pieces of property and a small sum of money. 

The most recently I spoke with my father about my grandma was last month and he nearly made a joke about not being in the will. I also have an email from my aunt where it is mentioned. The will itself is basically blacked out though. 

My aunt and I rarely speak but have been in communication over the past few months that has been increasing in frequency. She has been helpful in sending these papers and she also just sent me a book for Christmas which was wonderful. It’s been great talking to her and she also just this morning send a text message that included many family members from her side, her husband and daughters. It’s by far the most family communication I have had and couldn’t come at a better time during Covid and just a lonely time for everyone including anyone reading I’m sure but it is still shaky. 

I needed to say this ‘out loud’ in part I guess. But I also know there is a lot of responsibly and pitfalls that come with money and feel a little frozen at the moment. 

If anyone read this far thank you! It’s such an overwhelming situation that just writing it out feels like a good step. If there is any advice or if anyone has had experience with anything like this I would welcome any comments or help there. 

Happy New Year all!",30Dec2020,1

785,"So basically my father was an alcoholic cocksucker who banged random b\*tches all the time while he was still living with my mom and my sister. Last year around this time he died of testicular cancer. It was the perfect Christmas present. I know this sounds harsh but I couldn't stand that f\*ggot. He never spent any time with me growing up. Beat my mom a couple times although not too often. He also would scream at my little sister for not knowing how to do everything on her homework. 

One weekend while my mother and my sister were away for her aerobic competitions he brought me to this church and I got booty r\*ped by the pope. I told my dad but he never believed me. I've had to carry this around all my life. Like I said this was all growing up so when I found out he was diagnosed with cancer 2 years ago I threw a notebook and a pencil on my desk, sat down and began writing lyrics. It was initially going to be a song about how heartbroken I was but the memories of him and his shenanigans clouded my head and I couldn't concentrate. In the heat of the moment I thought, f\*ck it, I'm making a diss track. I had already made about 5 or 6 diss tracks before, most of them were just petty back and forth high school beef, others were more serious, but you get the gist of it, I already had experience with this. I couldn't wait to end this f\*ckers life before the cancer got the chance to. 

Unfortunately he did end up passing away before I was done editing and releasing the track, so I just had to change a few lyrics in order for the lines to make perfect sense post-death. It gained a little bit of traction on soundcloud but my mom found out about it eventually and wanted me to delete it. Of course I didn't do that since this was finally my chance to become the next big thing. I put the track on private and it's been like that ever since but I'm thinking of moving out, putting it back on public for the world to hear, and becoming famous. At least then something good will come out of this situation.",30Dec2020,1
786,"Hey, I'm not sure this is the best place to ask, but it's the first I thought of. So, my apologies if my question doesn't quite belong here. With that being said, I'm trying to get ready for college. I haven't quite singled out what I wanna major in, but I'm doing research on astronomy, physics, and, most of all, astrophysics. However, I'm not quite sure exactly what I should be studying/refreshing myself on to prepare for those topics. 

So far I've done basic research on fundamental particles and organic chemistry(mainly hydrocarbons and how to illustrate molecular, empirical, and structural formulas - don't think it'll help, but I feel it may come in handy). I also have trigonometry, spectroscopy, ""More on 4 basic forces,"" and ""Info on planets, stars, black holes, etc..."" as stuff I may wanna do further research on, but I was curious if anyone here had any idea on stuff that I should look into doing research on to help prepare me for college.

I do have an issue with my friends: I have a total of 4 friends. We’re a small close group of girls and all quite different but my problem is that they’re not very similar to me. They study a lot and never really go out, and when they do go out, it’s not to do what I really wanna be doing.  

We’re all really good together as we make each other laugh and have fun together but I’d love to have other friends as well as them to hang out with and be close to too. 
I think I’m a pretty likeable person and I would click well with lots of people but I just don’t know where to find them and where to get started as I’m quite shy at times.

Keep in mind I cannot join clubs and stuff due to COVID and also I feel it would be hard to join a club where everyone already knows each other.

790,"I live with two adult relatives and one other adult. one of them is very passive aggressive and sometimes downright aggressive. We have to walk on eggshells around them and once in a while they will roar at one of us and the tension in the house is unbearable. 

If we try to talk to them and say they can't speak to people like that, that they can't take their stress and upset on us, they just walk away. Then they'll sulk for days. I can't sleep at night because of the tension. 

I don't think they would be violent towards us but I think it's only a matter of time before they start smashing things up and losing control.  I'm not sure what we could do in that case. I know it might seem silly because it's only a possibility but I would like to know what I could do should the situation arise. I'm in a constant state of anxiety over it?

791,"I'm on mobile, sorry folks.

So as the title says, someone has been stalking me recently. The first time I noticed it was when I was walking home from my first day at my new job (I worked less than a week before injuring my ankle and being told by my doc I am under no circumstances allowed to work till I see a podiatrist due to the fact it's my 4th ankle injury this year alone and sprain my ankle almost every year since 2013) and it was about 1:30pm when I left and I noticed this guy was behind me. No big deal, sometimes you go in the same direction as people, right? But I started making unnecessary turns just to test the waters as I have PTSD and BPD so I'm always extremely paranoid about this stuff due to an abusive ex who would do the same. Every turn I made, every time i crossed the street, he did the same thing. I decided it would be a bad idea to go home so I went in the opposite direction and headed towards the nearby beach and he was following me. He got within 15 feet of me and I was panicking so bad that I was jogging on a healing 3rd degree sprained ankle (I sprained it Nov. 3rd and Dec. 17th- this happenee Dec. 16th) and called my friend (I don't call anyone unless it's necessary) and she dropped everything and picked me up. As i was on the phone with her he started backing off and I made many short turns so it would be hard to find me. All was good until Sunday this week where i was walking from the store and noticed he was following about 8 feet behind me around 7pm. I freaked out and booked it and didn't see him for about an hour where he was walking towards me, so I called my friend yet again and she dropped everything to pick me up. Today, he was walking outside of my apartment (my friend lives in the same building) and was just walking back and forth for quite a few hours starting this morning till about 4pm. My friend and I are both scared because of this and the only reason why I think this could be happening is because of my mother. I'm going to court against her for some personal stuff due to what she did to me at the beginning of the year, and of course court demands you give them your address in front of the other person even if you fear for your safety. My mother threatened to kill me in March if i went to court over what happened and I'm scared that's why this person is stalking me. I saw him at my mother's house quite a few times throughout the spring and summer this year and I have no idea what to do. I'd really appreciate some advice.",30Dec2020,1
792,"there’s a TLDR at the bottom of the post &lt;3 and apologies if it’s very lengthy, i tried my best but i think the more information you know about this (in order to give the most relevant advice), the better. :((

so i’m 16, (f) (live in australia) and i want to move out from my parents place. i have my horse riding instructor, (who is like my best friend and life teacher - he made me aware of the emotional abuse), who my family has also known for 4 years now. they trust him and care about him. he would sign over legal guardianship of me. from the research i have done, that means that my parents also have to sign the form as well or go through some legal process to enable me to live with him instead of my parents (like emancipation?). 

now i’m not sure how to convince them to let me stay with my horse riding instructor (let’s call him fred to make things easier). he would look after me, take me to school and everything. apart from the problem surrounding my parents actually agreeing and signing, i also have another problem. fred is planning to move to queensland and buy a property there (we’re coming from victoria). in the next few weeks he will look at a few farm properties for sale in person and fly over there. the only thing i’m worried about here is if this requires further legal action considering i’d be moving states too ?

now the reason for me moving out at this age is because although i’m thankfully not being physically abused, i’m being emotionally abused constantly, by both my mum (who is divorced from my dad and lives in a different house), my dad and my extended family. i don’t see however how i could get my parents to sign this form because they don’t realise how much they’re affecting me and they say it’s all in my head, which it isn’t. i am thinking of talking to them about it soon, and gently bringing it up since i have overbearing and overprotective parents (part of the issue!).

so any advice around maybe convincing them or any legal advice, even just support would be appreciated. thank you for reading this far and for helping me out. please be gentle with your responses, i can go into further detail too if you’d like in replies.

TLDR; i want to move away from my family to queensland with a family friend whom my parents trust and care about. the family friend would look after me properly. i just don’t know how to convince my parents to let the family friend sign guardianship over me, and sign their own names too.",30Dec2020,1

797,"Hello,

first of all I'd like to wish everybody a lovely new year, full of happiness, joy and health.

I am a student in Germany, but thanks to the Plague, i have been studying online and residing in my home country of Bulgaria. 

Sadly my university has shown no desire at all to organise online exams - last summer we needed to be present, for the exams from the winter semester we need to be present as well. 

**TLDR** Should I go to Germany to write my exams? 

I have no idea what to do. The thing with German unis is (at least for mine) is that if you don't write an exam this session, you need to write it either next year or next semester. I am at the very end of my Bachelor and prolonging my studying isn't really appealing. On the other hand I do not wish to travel in the current pandemic, not because of fear, but because everything is so chaotic and if, by some cosmic chance, my uni decides to cancel all exams I'd need to fly home again.

I beg for advice. Thank you for your time.",30Dec2020,1

I already got kind of bullied but now no one wants to do things with me and make shitty excuses so that they won’t need to.

799,"Hi! So recently, this person (we'll call this person ""Jim"") told us that he's gotten messages from an anonymous user that used two different Twitter accounts that have very similar names. The first account said ""Hi Jim"" and then the other account sent an article about exploitation on the internet, a site to the ""Internet Child Exploitation (ICE)"", a gif of a person with a gun and a text message that said ""Your Secret is Out!!!"".

I assumed that this AU is poking at Jim's past when he was in grade 11 (he would be 16-17 years old at the time) which is also when he was allegedly making explicit moves on multiple people like myself in the same grade or people a few ages younger. So what peaked my interest in this particular topic is the fact that this AU knows a piece of history that not many people outside of our friend group knows.

However, my friend group concluded that this AU was ""Jaydan"" (which is not his real name) because Jaydan is one of the many people who Jim made explicit moves to. However, I feel like I want to be really sure it's Jaydan because there were times when my friend group has a history of making stuff up because of a popular opinion. Mainly, their input on this is that ""They don't care about it anymore because Jim has been in so much drama and bad stuff"" and ""there's boundaries that shouldn't be crossed"" which refers to me wanting get to find out who this person is. While it may seem like I want to figure this out because I care about Jim despite having him make moves. I have truthfully told people what it looked like when Jim makes advances on people like choosing words to sound like they're better than anyone and constantly make people more sympathetic towards him. 

So, I guess my question is what should I do?

Should I give my group a benefit of a doubt about their theory that it's Jaydan? Or ignore them and maybe ask Jaydan himself? I really want to know people's take on this.

Side notes:

- the responses and the Twitter accounts are made this month which is evident to their account 
- the first Twitter account was temporarily restricted due to unusual activity... which is strange.
- me, Jim and my friend group knew this happened because we were all in a discord server together
- Jaydan isn't actually friends with anybody or have been in any server with either my friend group or Jim because Jaydan had issues with both parties. But the only person that Jaydan is friends with is a person that doesn't go online often because of work
- I have brought this recent new to Jaydan and his responses are weird... it's either because of me or him, especially from someone who haven't talked to him much... also if anyone is curious of what they look like, I can provided that. But I'll be censoring Jaydan's name and profile because of their privacy. Lastly, if you do look at the screenshots. I don't think I asked him if he recently created the Twitter accounts and the messages.

Ohh lovely. Can I at least get a decent care, like hugs here and there? No. When I step out of my room, I only get stared at, if they need me to buy something they'll tell me that and that's it.

814,"My sister (a minor) works at Chipotle, a new store and she’s been there a year now. She’s leaving for a new job, but because they weren’t giving her enough hours. I know, the title might seem contradictory but believe me, he managers are assholes who take advantage of her work ethic. 

She’s had days where she stayed in hours and hours longer, even though the managers there get huge bonuses to be able to the the stores booty calls (whenever they need workers, they’re supposed to drop whatever and go work) but they’ve just been using her as that. Calling her in 30 minutes before they need a worker, and because she’s a hustler, she always goes in. They’ve had her stay by herself until 2 am closing, again she’s a fucking minor. Today she came home and she literally pissed herself because they had her working a 7 hour shift without any breaks. She was in tears and called me on the road here saying she was doing 100 in rain.

 God, I know what they’re doing is fucked up, but is it even legal? She’s leaving this week I believe, but holy fuck these people have no conscious. They’re still paying her a dollar less than the new people who joined months afterwards. Kept promising her a managers position once she turned 18 (a couple months) but giving her 17 hours a week and calling her whenever the fuck someone doesn’t show up is so unjust.

815,"So, this will be a tad lengthy as i need to provide backstory to give proper context.

About 2 years ago, my department got 2 new employees. I noticed interest from one of them and we proceeded to have a casual relationship. Within the first month of said relationship, i came to understand that she is currently engaged. Around this time she also began claiming she was pregnant for me. I begin asking for pregnancy test to confirm this, all the while preparing for what could be my first born. She denies all attempts to confirm she is pregnant, and it began to stir a rift between us.

Around the same time, i began hearing rumors that she and another co worker were involved. Rumors that were confirmed when he suddenly stopped being friendly with her after her family confronted him about security footage of him at her house around 2 AM. This, plus the alleged pregnancy, plus the rumor of her possibly being engaged was enough to more than justify ending the casual relationship with her. This did not bode well with her.

Less than a month after, she comes down to the floor i am working on, demanding i assist her with a task that a single person is more than capable of handling. Think mopping a floor or stocking a shelf. it nice to have help, but you can handle it solo. i deny her request and head over to a stock room to grab supplies. She follows me inside, and blocks the only door into and out of the supply room to demand my assistance once more. i want to put emphasis on blocked. As in arms were spread across the room and she is standing directly in front of a door that opens inwards. She did not move until another co worker stumbled in, bumping her out of the way. i took my chance and slithered out. moments later, within the same shift, she comes down a hallway cursing me out over the incident, and even made remarks to my ""sexual prowess"" in front of a customer for the company. From this point forward, i began ignoring her phone calls, blocked her on social media, my phone, and removed any way that she can come into contact with me. Outside of the blatant disrespect, i just dont want any parts of being accused of doing anything so i am leaving you alone.

A few months after this incident, my company gave my department a new director and also had a whole sexual misconduct workshop which now required people who were involved in intimate relationships to have a document filled out that will be kept on record in HR. I filled this out and gave it to my director and explained my disdain for my coworker to my new director and from what i interpreted, she understood why i would rather no work with this individual.

Fast forward to about 2 days ago. She was working the unit and fell ill and needed medical assistance. This coming after her christmas vacation. People grew concerned and were plaguing the department with questions. Well, not as much questions about are you ok, but are you sure you know what you are doing. You just came back from vacay, and now you are suddenly ill right after your break ends? Heads were scratched, but the issue was left at that. Even before this incident, she had a habit of using her sick time at the most ill advised of times. On a friday right before her weekend off, on a monday right after her weekend off, or just any time in particular to extend her time off from work. It was looking like a pattern, but who is anyone o judge. She could actually have issues. But point being, its getting harder to prove that with this consistency  

Now for today. Not even 5 minutes into my shift, i get called into my directors office, and she instantly says that she needs to be explicitly clear that under no circumstances can you discuss a coworkers health on the job. My eyes grow big and my eyebrows go as far back as they can. My director informs me that i had been accused of discussing the health of the same coworker, who 2 years prior i began ignoring.  Me and my director then proceed to get into a lengthy debate, where in which i do bring up the current climate toward how easily a woman can just accuse a man of an occurrence, and we are expected to believe her, but here i am trying to state my side of the story, which i have documented and reported to HR, and i am not even being heard. I became furious. I was verbatim told ""i am not allowed to tell my accuser to leave me alone"" **WTF**?!?! i asked on several occasions would you(my director) give that same kind of advice to a woman has she come across a similar issue.  I kept my composure, and luckily enough my director is an understanding women and claims she will discuss the matter with her because this is just a case of hearsay. 

With everything up to date, i am curious to what are my options for defending myself against any further allegations in this scenario.",30Dec2020,1
816," long time lurker, first time poster.

so the thing is, i used to be in an incredibly abusive relationship with my ex bf. i don't want to get into detail too much, but he basically controlled and manipulated me, lied to me, cheated on me, sexually harrassed me and over all just... abused me. he ended the relationship a few months ago because he couldn't deal with my general state of being as well as me being suicidal any longer - it was only then i fully understood how much he had abused me.

i suffer from several chronical illnesses, including mental health issues like c-ptsd. for the past two and half years, my over all health has declined immensely and it has taken its toll on my will to live. being in physical pain all the time and dealing with trauma just doesn't provide a lot of actual quality in life and some days it's hard to see beyond that.  
this obviously affected the relationship with my ex bf; it was troubling to say the least. we kept trying to work out ways that would relieve him, including me encouraging him to befriend my best friend's husband as they are similar in some ways and have shared interests (his actual friends are not really what you'd consider a support system in that sense). during our relationship, they met up for coffee once or twice and would kind of bond when we all spent time together, but they were not close, rather friendly.  
a few months ago, i had a complete breakdown and was preparing to die. he basically left me there to die and called my best friend and her husband (they are like my family) as well as an ambulance when he thought i was already dead. a week later, he broke up with me because he saw himself as some kind of suffering martyr who just could not take it anymore and said to me, several times actually, while i was still suicidal, that if he'd left, i'd be alone, i'd have no one. needless to say, i was overwhelmingly relieved when he finally actually left - only to be suddenly overwhelmed by all kinds of memories of him abusing me. i talked a lot about the abuse to my friends and the more i remembered, the more the people around me seemed to have the glass shattering moment as well - and i learnt more and more about how he had made them feel uncomfortable and how they had noticed his behaviour but just... couldn't believe he would actually be like that i guess? this was particularly intense with my best friend because she's like a sister, we have been best friends for more than a decade, so i could talk freely and she was incredibly supportive and insightful.

after the break up, he contacted her a few times in order to meet up for coffee. upon learning all the things he had done to me, she declined, he was understanding about it, but he did this with the excuse of wanting to talk about my suicide attempt. they had also scheduled a group appointment with a therapist in order to figure out how to support me after the attempt and then we broke up; yet even though the appointment was after the break up, he still wanted to go. my best friend then asked him not to come.

i am also friends with her husband, as in we hang out alone sometimes, and last time i saw him, he told me he was not sure whether he should tell me but that he's been meeting my ex bf for coffee. i was taken by surprise and didn't really know what to say so i just asked 'what do you mean' (you know, like a dumbass) and he then told me that my ex bf had hit him up a couple of times and that he had actually just met him before i came over and that he had made him promise not to talk about the things they talk about to my best friend or me and that it seemed like he just needs someone to vent to.

and this is where i'm conflicted: if he would've broken up with me and this was about me being heartbroken, i wouldn't even mind if they hung out or got closer. it'd be uncomfortable and awkward at times, sure, but no big deal.

but there are several things about this that make me feel uncomfortable. first: he abused me horribly and my best friend's husband still wants to be friends with him? does that mean he doesn't believe me? does that mean he thinks my ex bf did nothing wrong? or does he not know about the extent of the abuse (idk how much my best friend told him, we talked about it as well but not as in-depth)? also: she knows about all of it, the abuse and their coffee dates, does she think it's okay? second: part of his abuse strategies was controlling me, in any way really. this included always showing up or calling under some sort of pretense when i was hanging out with my friends, demanding complete insight into my entire life, isolating me from people i love, you know, text book stuff. so what if this is an attempt to regain control? or to trash talk me and deny the abuse? i don't want him to infiltrate my life like that?!  
i know this sounds paranoid, but he has been doing other small stuff online that was more directly targeted at me ever since the break up (like posting about me or my suicide attempt and adressing me as 'you' in his posts - as in i am the target audience of the post, while presenting himself as the hero of the story). i also have to file a report against one of the doctors involved in the aftermath of my suicide attempt because i was sexually harrassed (while my ex bf sat idly by) - and i need my ex bf as a witness. i wasn't sure if he remembers enough to make a statement and i really only want to go through with this if i can be sure that the statements are bullet proof enough for the bitch to get charged; so i contacted him about this and asked whether he would make a statement to the police/if he even could. he encouraged me to file the report and told me he'd sent me his memories ""in the next few days"" and then obviously didn't; when i asked again two weeks later because it started stressing me out always having to be ready to read about the sexual harrasment that had happened to me, he didn't even reply. i feel like he's playing mind games and trying to get me to hold on.

i feel ridiculous typing all of this out, but i am genuinely scared and conflicted.

though i was just confused and surprised at first, i felt really weird and sad when i left my best friend's place and i don't know how to go on with this. i mean i obviously don't want to forbid them to meet. but this makes me trust my best friend's husband (and my best friend) less and i have been avoiding them because i don't want my ex bf to be able to know about me or my life in any way - i just feel like i might be overstepping boundaries by expressing my discomfort considering i was also the one who suggested they'd hang out in the first place. and i also understand if my ex bf wants to talk about my suicide attempt to someone who was there, so if it's about that, i don't wanna take that way from him - especially since i am responsible for this possible trauma, but.... i just don't know.

so... what do i do?

tl;dr: my best friends husband hangs out with my abusive ex bf despite them not really being friends before the break up. ex bf has a history of playing games and infiltrating my life just like that and it's scary but expressing my discomfort might cross a line as i encouraged my ex bf to befriend him during the relationship and don't want to take away the possibility to talk about the trauma of my suicide attempt",30Dec2020,1

823,"So my brother just bragged to me that he might live on campus and even though we’re going to go to the same college, I guess he’s looking into some sort of scholarship or something. I doubt there’s a scholarship since my brothers the type of person to make outlandish claims like that, but my mom just said sure to it, when i pleaded and begged to stay on campus as a freshmen and was met with laughter and mockery.

Also it’s important to note that there is no financial aid or anything of that sorts for family bc we make too much money, and my parents didn’t allow me to take out a loan. 

I don’t even know how I would handle it and it makes my blood boil just thinking about it, and I don’t think I’d ever talk to my parents the same bc they never seemed to be that supportive of me with anything. I would literally just cut contact off with my parents bc I suffered everyday just feeling left out bc I had to live at home and commute to college. My mom doesn’t even let me spend the night at friends house and it’s such a hassle to do anything bc she’s a helicopter parent. 

I almost doubt that my brother would get a scholarship covering 17,000 dollars (plus food and tuition) when he didn’t even pass the SAT portion to get into this school. Like I said I think he’s just making a wild claim but I’m probably gonna ask my mom about it later bc it’s bothering me so much. 

Plus classes are going to be hybrid or totally online depending on how fall 2021 is but I would just be completely devastated if my parents all of a sudden made an exception for my brother.

Basically what the title say, 
a few days ago I sent my friend a card to wish a Merry Christmas and today I got her letter saying how she wishes that we exchange letter.

All of this make me feel really bad about rejecting her offer on top of the stress I already have and I don't even have a valid argument of why I don't want to, it's just that I don't and it make me feel really shitty about myself to think like that of a friend's offer.

I am now a 20 something year old woman. 

When I was little little, my grandfather who was born and raised in the Middle East his whole entire life would often visit his son (my dad) And our family and stay with us at our house for a few months at a time whenever he’d come for vacation. 

I struggle with identifying if what I went through was molestation and hopefully someone can maybe put me in the right direction. 

I’ve only told about 4 different people this in my whole life. 

As I get older - I sometimes think about just blurting it out to my mom or my brother who both have absolutely no idea that this happened. 

But I always back out of it last minute and I just always fear that neither would believe me and I’ve been through enough traumatic shit in my life and I don’t wanna have what happened to me as a four-year-old affect my life today. 

I was four years old. 
My grandfather was staying at our house during his vacation.
He was taking a nap in my bedroom because he supposedly wasn’t feeling well. 
My mom, being the amazing daughter-in-law that she was and the caring person that she was, told me to go give my grandfather a glass of water since he wasn’t feeling good. 
I went and my grandfather wasn’t napping. he was up and when I gave him the glass of water, he basically pulled me in closer and kissed me on the lips. 
It just felt really horribly wrong and I knew it wasn’t right in the moment of and it was just the worst most violating feeling for me to have felt so young. 
He said to me don’t tell your mom. 
And I never told her. 
And he passed away a years back. 
So often I think what is the fucking point to even say anything about it? 
Like why am I even here posting on Reddit to millions of people telling you guys a really personal story about me. 

I really have no fucking clue. 
Maybe you guys can offer me some insight. 

I am generally a very private person but I’m hoping that maybe this can help me feel free in a way.

836,"Hello,

It's always been rather hard for me (19F) to learn specific subjects, and its like that for lots of people. It's very hard for me to understand the concept of math at all. Since 8th grade, I've failed almost every math class I've been enrolled in. My aunt, who substituted a lot pre-pandemic, always tried her best to help me with my math homework and to help me grasp just the basic concepts. Sometimes it stuck and sometimes it didn't.

Around sophomore year of high-school, I got involved with someone who quite honestly ruined my life. It isn't relevant to this other then the fact that I started to spiral mentally after i was done associating with this person. I've never gotten the opportunity to tell my parents about my declining mental state because we don't have the closest relationship. My father(52M) isn't a good man, he's cheated on my mom(50F) countless times and I still hold resentment towards him for this. My mom isn't around much either due to her work schedule, as she runs two different photography studios that are about an hour apart from each other, even during the pandemic.

My in-ability to learn math and my declining mental state are part of the reasons I messed up my first year of college. My father had to begin working at home while my brother(22M) and I took virtual classes at home. This was a complete and utter recipe for disaster and only resulted in our relationship being even more worse off. I can't sit in a room with my dad without the both of us arguing.

Like most people, I was isolated from my friends and other parts of my family. I haven't hugged or talked to my grandmother in 5 months, as well as my aunt. During these online classes, I would zone out for almost the entirety of the class. If i wasn't in these classes, I was curled up in my bed while I stared at a wall for hours. I never bothered telling my parents or anyone really about what was going on. I never told them about me failing every single math test, or the fact that I was failing two classes at once. 

I've received two warnings from my college; a financial aid warning as well as academic warning. A hold has been put on my registration, but i can't communicate with anyone in my college until after winter break (January 4th).

I'm at a complete loss for what to do. I take full responsibility for failing these classes and messing up my first year, but I dont know how to talk to my parents about what is going on with college and about what is going on in my head. I feel like a disappointment to my parents over this and its causing my mental health to spiral even more. I've never seen a therapist about any of my issues, because this would mean talking to my parents and frankly, Im terrified to talk to them about any of this.

The quarantine gave me time to think, all of my thoughts leading up to now, when I realized how I blocked my emotions, therefore killing all of the possibilities to connect with people, make friends and more. Like Baldr in God of War, I am now invulnerable, but insensitive. I started an internal quest to retrieve these lost emotions, and am kind of advancing slowly, but I need help in the process, the help of someone who understands it, in the internal domain but also in the art of relationships.

840,"I'm 16 years old as of now. I go to a school in a fairly rural area and we have a small school year. I have a group of friends of around 8, me included. I have been friends with most of them for years. Our group collectively is considered the most popular male group in the year, that being said, everyone sort of mingles together anyway since are school year is small, its only out of school that we separate in to these groups.

You will all know that in high school, your friend group, social acceptance and general popularity is mostly dictated by how you look. I am painfully average looking, not ugly, but not attractive. everyone else in the group is more or less more attractive than me, with the exceptions of some late bloomers who have decent facial structures and who will be way better looking than me when they hit puberty properly. It must be a teenage thing. attractive people are instantly accepted, whereas ugly people can't do anything. 

Of course, every waking moment within my group is difficult. Most of the time, I get along fine but I am in constant fear of being excluded, which is now becoming a reality. Inexplicably, a boy in my group of whom I have known for quite a while, has taken a considerable disliking towards me within the past few weeks. There is absolutely no reason for this as I have not even interacted with him in person at all since his grudge started. Whenever I'm around him, by means of gaming party chat, he is incredibly rude, degrading and toxic around me. He's always been one to playfully make fun of people, but he recently has begun to really start properly insulting me. I can't say anything without him telling me to shut up, whether I'm speaking to him or not. I am extremely passive when he does this, simply pretending I don't care or just continuing what I'm saying if I'm taking to someone else. Its not just within game chats, but also on group chats, where he will just randomly start spamming it making fun of my looks amongst other things.

The thing is, I wouldn't care about this at all, I have plenty of other close friends within my group. But it is becoming an issue. His inexplicable hate is beginning to rub off on to other people in my friend group. None of them ever defend me, and now they are all willingly not inviting me to xbox parties, him likely being the catalyst of this. This has never happened before.

When I say its gradual, this hate has been present for a while, not with the boy specifically but with the group in general. Its been nothing major, but I have simply become more and more excluded from the group when it comes to telling petty secrets, inviting people round to places and other things like that. Its just now that it has really become terrible. Right now at this very moment, I am sitting alone with my headset round my neck, waiting for an invite to the party, as I have been for the past half hour. (the boy is in the party by the way)

&amp;#x200B;

I need to stress this. If I get excluded from this group entirely, I will be broken. I am terrible at being alone, and without xbox there is virtually no way to speak to them during the pandemic.  The hate this boy has for me is scarily real, but what makes it worse is that it really is starting to affect other relationships I have, and I have absolutely no idea why he hates me. I have not done anything to him, said anything controversial about him behind his back, done anything to directly or indirectly annoy him, nor have I said anything that is remotely mean to his face. I have no idea what to do, I feel as everything is just falling apart and I have absolutely no ability to fix it. I really need advice on what to do to be included again. If you need any more details I'm happy to tell you any if it helps.

Thanks everyone",30Dec2020,1

We met in college and at first I really liked him, but now he finds me having a lot of problems and constantly told me to not have emotions basically cuz he hates it when I get mad. So every time I find myself more and more hiding my emotions and tries to cover myself. He is that kind of person who is very patient and literally never gets mad but I find it really weird for him to expect others to do the same, and I would be the first person that needs to fit into his narrative. 

I find it super hard to breakup with him because we both live together and the lease is not ending soon, and we met each other’s parents and I’m kinda close to his in particular, so I find it hard to leave. 

I am more emotional than he is (might because I’m a girl) and I am trying my best to think in his position so I don’t get mad, but I am literally feeling suffocated and I want to avoid him as much as possible so there would be no conflict to start in the first place. Last night I talked to him about me avoiding him cuz I wanna see if we can communicate and work something out, and the conversation ended up with me promising again not to cry, get mad, or be paranoid (which is what he used to describe me to his friends) 

I really don’t know what to do now and I’m more confused than ever whether I should continue being with him. I imagined my life without him and it’s going to be very empty because I loved him with my whole heart, so half of me wants to stick with him and half of me doesn’t.

852,"

To begin, I’m a 5’2 17 year old girl I’m only a little over 100 pounds and I’m very quiet and timid. Last year I was harassed by this kid named Tay in my school building who would lay his head in my lap and sit really close next to me when I was visibly uncomfortable and even began pulling me by the arm and followed me through the hallway and grabbed my arm and took me a different way to the class I told him I was heading to and pushed me hard into the classroom before saying bye. it was resolved by the head of a separated part of the school where a majority of my classes were but he still spoke to me after that when he clearly shouldn’t have been but it was easier for me to avoid him. The following summer I got stalked by my ex boyfriend who I was dating throughout the school year to the point where I had to change my number and live in fear for a few months that he would show up to my house and he just tried to follow my friend Callie on Instagram recently that he knows is my friend. Now since a little bit into the school year this kid Nick has started to make me extremely uncomfortable and act in very creepy ways such as exhibiting really angry behavior (I have photos in my phone of dents he made in the bus seat next to me with his knees while listening to loud music). He also breaths extremely heavy while sitting near me which is very creepy and he constantly stares me down. He is my ex from two years ago’s friend (not the kid who stalked me over the summer) and I know things about him that make it all worse for me such as that he has a porn addiction. The last time I was in school at the end of the day I was walking to our bus and he was far up in front of me and kept turning around to stare at me while walking. He even gestured for me to go on the bus before him and I understand trying to be polite or if he has a crush but he makes me extremely uncomfortable and the fact that it’s escalating to him interacting with me gives me the inkling it’ll only get worse from here. It’s especially awful when we have to wait outside of the school building in the morning every single day and I have to stand there by myself with him because we get off the same bus. I have hid in the bathroom once already in the main building of my school to avoid having to stand there with him in the morning. I’m afraid I’m going to have to deal with another harassment or stalkerish situation because I am exhausted at this point and traumatized. I don’t know what else to do besides suck it up for the rest of the year while expecting it to only get worse as it has since the first month of school. I’m afraid to go to the lady who helped me last time because I feel like she will downplay it as some crush and unfortunately she can’t feel how I feel every single day having to deal with a situation like this for a third time within a year and a 1/2. I don’t know what to do if anyone could give me advice please write something back.",30Dec2020,1
853,"I have a lot to unpack here. This is a long post, and I've rewritten this thing twice now

I'm in my 20s, and I currently live with my parents and my brother. The plan was to move out this year, but a break up and a layoff during the pandemic later, I ended up staying home. I got a new job and I now pay rent at home, at least until the pandemic ends.

I have never gone abroad, have never been invited abroad when my parents go, and at this point, I expect I'll be paying to send myself abroad... on a safer year. This is important for later.

One of the things I was looking forward to by moving out, was never attending a family gathering again; I am the youngest among all my cousins, to the point that I'm very much closer in age to my nephews and nieces than to any of their parents. And believe me, I've tried to integrate myself and to form some sort of connection with my cousins for my entire life, and it's been impossible both because they don't actually care to interact with anyone outside their social circle, and because they like to speak in a language I'm not fluent in. You see, half of my extended family is immigrant; I am 2nd generation myself, but my parents never went very indepth with teaching us.
And in any case 80% of the family lives here, and the family gatherings are here, not in our homeland. 

Only a few of them live abroad and some years they fly in for the family gathering.

About the homeland; Most, if not all my cousins have visited the place, most have taken their kids with them to visit at least once. Do they actually talk about the place? Yeah sure. Among themselves. in a language I'm not fluent in. At said family gatherings.
They'll talk to my brother though. And my parents have paid for his ticket so, what the hell.

So great, they want me to go for the free babysitting.
So I can tell my own nephew that no, I've never visited Grandpa's old town.
And the way things are going, I'm probably never going to.

I asked my parents when they went on vacation, they said we don't have the money. Maybe we would if their spending wasn't so terrible, but if they've been able to take various trips abroad...
But that's neither here nor there, the point is it just makes me feel deeply uncomfortable to attend family reunions where 90% of the people don't care about, or talk to me. Even less so I can hear about how they went to x or Y place, and pretend I'm so happy for them.

I was so happy when my last job assigned me for Christmas shift, and I spent Christmas doing inventory, before celebrating a call with all my friends.
I did the same this year and went to bed at 3 in the morning, only for my family to wake me up so I could wish my extended family a merry christmas at 5 in the effing morning, because that was the only time in which all the timezones/abroad were available.

I was hungover and looked awful, having to give good wishes to a bunch of practical strangers on a screen, who speak to eachother in a language I don't understand. From a country I'm probably never going to visit. And my immediate family thinks it's so cute.

I particularly dread doing it tomorrow morning.

So I became very reserved with my salary, especially after I began paying rent. ESPECIALLY after the breakup. If I have to pay everything myself, might as well get it done.

I painstakingly save up nearly all my salary, and only spend the rent my parents expect from me, and got myself a small gift that was on sale. 

Of course, the other day my parents told me to be less stingy with my money, and I exploded and told them every single thing in this post. In the end I told them they don't have to pay for any trip for me abroad, I no longer expect them to, but it's stupid that they want me to attend a call with my extended family, that don't care about me and never will.
my parents currently insist that since it's only a few minutes, it shouldn't have such a strong effect on me.

At the rate this is going I just want to tell my extended family how I feel, resulting in such an akward moment that I'm banned from future gatherings/calls
And I don't know how to feel, half the time I'm shaking with anger thinking about tomorrow, and half the time I feel I'm acting like a brat.

          I’m being a little needy and looking for some support. I’m quitting my secondary job tomorrow. But I’m feeling guilty. 
Context: 
-I just started in October. 
-When I started I was told minimum wage then open to negotiation (I have 16 years of customer service and hoped for more but eh open mind) 
*was told the other day the “best [they]could do would be .25 above minimum though the average for the area is about $2.50 more*
-was told I would be on the sales floor; and specifically asked not to be on a cashiering role. And was told that I wouldn’t be;Though VERY RARELY (that point was stressed)we cover a 15 minute break
*throughout my time there I have been on the cash register no less than 4 hours a day every.single.time I have worked aside from 3 times I was scheduled there less than 4 hours*
*was scheduled until 9 on Christmas Eve.. ended up cashiering the entire time with just one break.. didn’t ring my last customer until 945 and was told it wasn’t fair for me to get to go home so I had to stay until 11PM to help*
*was called to the front 2 hours into my shift to be told I had to get all my breaks in on the next hour and a half because they didn’t schedule a closing cashier so I was going to be upfront cashiering from 6-10 even though I was only scheduled until 930 and when I pointed it out was hit with “well it’s just an extra half hour” (but like.. it’s not because we close at 10 but people are still there and then we clean and have to cash out) and when I stood my ground I STILL had to wait because the other person was “on break”*

this place just isn’t good for me but I feel like I’m letting them all down",30Dec2020,1
856,"And the funny thing is, my problems are because of my parents.

So here's some context: My parents are abusive, they physically, verbally and emotionally abused me my entire life and (still do occasionally). They've created an environment where I don't trust them enough to tell them my problems and honestly anything about my life. I don't really share any part of my life with them because I don't trust them. Everything always ends up in a lecture or an argument.

With COVID restrictions and lockdowns, my mother has been staying at home which completely dampens the mood because she has to constantly know what I'm doing all the time even though I'm just in the kitchen getting a snack or baking. I don't have a lot of personal space.

My sister (20) doesn't live at home anymore so it's just me and my parents. I've been really miserable lately because of lockdown, school drained so much energy out of me and also the fact that I'm not really talking to anyone is making me so miserable and sad.  (I don't want to say depressed because it's a heavy term but I feel like I have no escape from my current situation) I'm not really getting my emotional needs met i.e my parents don't really care about me or talk to me, I'm not reaching out to my friends because I don't want to burden them with my problems and I try not to burden my sister with my troubles because she's already dealing with a lot by herself so I feel like I have no outlet or person to tell. 

What I've realized during quarantine is that if you're stuck at home with your abusive parents 24/7, you're not able to go outside and talk to anybody and you bottle up all of your problems, you're going to be in a really bad mood all the time. 

I've wanted a therapist or counselor for a while now just to help me figure things out because trying to analyze and therapize yourself becomes extremely exhausting after years of journaling and not really getting solid help. (I'm just kind of rationalizing everything in my head but I'm not getting advice) . Out of my parents, I'm slightly more comfortable talking to him but not to the point where I can ask him for a therapist. (We're Chinese) so mental health is a bit of a taboo subject to him and I seriously doubt that he'll understand that they'll help me with what I'm dealing with. Also, they're just really fucking expensive.

Anyway, I just wanted to get this off my chest. Thank you for reading this.

857,"So I'm pregnant and ever since my sister found out, my life has been miserable. My sister had fertility issues when she was married and now she's single and doesn't have a stable enough situation to have kids. (Living with roommates and has a job that won't support a child). 

&amp;#x200B;

When my sister found out that I'm pregnant she started a huge fight. I wasn't even trying to tell her, I was at my grandmas house sharing my news with her and my sister just happened to be there too at that time.

&amp;#x200B;

Well my sister went to the whole family and told them that I was rubbing my pregnancy/fertility in her face and that I got pregnant just to spite her. I said some horrible things back. I have a couple other posts on my account about the situation if you want more information on it. The point is that my sister is the golden child and they all believed her because she would never lie to them.

&amp;#x200B;

My sister recently started telling my family that I called her up and told her that I realized I'm too young to have a baby and that I agreed to let her adopt my child. My family has been sending my sister money for a new place and baby stuff for they child they think she's about to have.

&amp;#x200B;

When I found out about this (I had gone no contact with most of my family and only heard about this from my grandma) I made a facebook post about the whole thing to inform my family that I was not going to adopt out my child and was never going to. The conversation with my sister never happened, and to please leave me alone.

&amp;#x200B;

I got bombarded with calls and texts from my sister about how could I do this to her, how could I go back on my word, she deserves my child because she's older and more mature and now has the money to get a place and provide for my baby. I was really confused because she was acting like I actually agreed to this and not like she had made the whole thing up. 

&amp;#x200B;

On top of that I have family calling and texting not just me but my fiancés family too, they've been trash talking me and saying some really terrible stuff. On top of all that they are saying they're going to sue me for going back on my word and do everything in their power to make sure my baby is removed from my custody and given to my sister.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not as worried about their threats to sue me as I never even had a conversation about adopting out my baby until all of this happened and my stance on it has been the same the whole time, so they don't have anything to go off of. Most of my family doesn't know where I live except for my grandma so they'd have a hard time calling CPS on me and even if they did find a way to, I have proof of them saying they're going to do it just to get my child taken away.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know how I'm going to get them to leave me and my fiancés family alone. They've even gone as far as to leave bad reviews on my father in laws business page. I just want them to leave me and my child alone. I have a tendency to miscarry and I'm worried that this stress is going to cause me to miscarry again.  

So here's where I need advice?

What should I do about this? 

How can I protect myself when my child is born from the false calls I'm likely to get from CPS? 

Is there a way I can get out of my lease so we can move before the baby is born 

\-Our lease ends in July and I don't want to move when I'm more than five months pregnant because my family has a history of difficult pregnancies so I'm fully expecting to be bedridden at least two months of this pregnancy and having a difficult time lifting things and moving by month six-

Should I be more worried than I am about legal recourse from my family? Do they have any grounds to stand on when I haven't agreed to anything?

858,"I've (25/M) been at the same company for 3 years, starting from the bottom as an intern and working my way up. The company is small and I've seen many people come and go, resulting in the ability to pick up new responsibilities, titles, and growth.

As of the past 6-12 months, that growth has stagnated. I've become quite complacent in my position and truthfully, bored. The same love and passion I once had is no longer existent. I hate to see myself continue to go to the same job everyday and not feel invested.

I built a great relationship with the owner, who I admire greatly. However, I no longer am interested in the position and found myself applying to other jobs. I currently have two job offers on the table and need to make a decision in the next few days or the companies will move on.

**My greatest dilemma: Quitting**. I'm not sure how to quit; the best way to bring it up - especially during such a transitional time like the holidays. This will be the first time I've quit a full-time position but I feel it's something I have to do to continue to grow professionally and personally.

The idea of leaving this company forever makes my stomach twist and turn. I try to think of it as a positive transition and this doesn't have to be the end of our working relationship but I know once I leave, there's a 98% chance I'll never go back.

Another fear of mine: Mentioning that I want to talk, sitting down to have the conversation, and then regretting it half way through - wishing I could turn back time and not say a damn thing.

Also, another very scary thought is: What if I quit, start my new job, and hate it? That would make me feel even worse and regret everything.

Obviously, there are uncertainties related to switching jobs but I never wanted to be in a position where I'm scared to take chances, try new things, and gain new experiences. However, I hate feeling like I'm in too comfortable of a position and becoming lazy/unmotivated.

The only person in my life that I would talk to regarding an issue like this is my current employer. I don't have anyone else to bring it up to, so I find myself here asking my next best option.

Anyone have specific examples of something similar or maybe some words of advice/wisdom? How would you go about this situation?

859,"So I signed up for a postgrad certificate and the first two weeks were pretty alright, so I didn't back out (you only get a refund if you back out in the first two weeks). But then the difficulty curve really went up and I've been struggling ever since. It's been really hard staying positive with failure being thrown in my face at every turn and my negative self-talk has re-emerged with a vengeance. I try to do extra study and catch up work out of class, but every time I look at it, my negative emotions get the better of me and I just shut down. Sometimes my mind blanks, sometimes I have an emotional break down. Usually there is negative self talk.

The coursework isn't impossibly difficult or anything - it's just a lot of work in a short amount of time and, while I understand the theory of what I'm supposed to do, I'm having trouble connecting and applying it to my actual homework and assignments.

The teachers are overworked and behind in their marking (by two weeks? a month?), so I don't really feel like talking to them about my struggling in class. I'm going to book an appointment with a counselor after the holiday break.

861,"I'm an employee at a fast food restaurant that works rather quickly and today I came across a bit of a holdup in the form of a Guest. The Guest had asked for sauce and while they were waiting started eating, but realized their burger didn't have any condiments. They brought it to our attention and we asked the kitchen for another burger. By now, the Guest had been at the window for about 4 minutes (they should be there for less than a minute) The kitchen gave us a container with the condiments meant to go on the burger, but the Guest vehemently refused to take the burger because they came to get food already made. 

Here comes the part in which I believe was wrong, although my mom seems to think I was in the right: I told the Guest ""My apologies, but we're rather backed up right now"", and they still refused to hold the burger (which we aren't allowed to take back, but we don't have a trash can nearby). Another employee took the sandwich and after another couple of minutes the Guest got their burger. As the Guest was leaving, they told me stop acting like a manager and continued to insult me as they left. I told them ""My apologies, Happy Holidays"", but it didn't seem to make it any better. I'm not sure what I should have done or not done, but I don't want it to happen again, so I'm trying to figure out if I was in the right or not.

TLDR: A Guest held up the line because they had problems with their order, we tried to fix it, they weren't pleased, so I tried to explain that we were very busy, but the food was taken back anyway. the Guest proceeded to tell me I should act less like a manager.

After we moved out, I wanted to forget everything. Her ex was a horrible person, she was manipulative, constantly accusing my mother of cheating on her. I was never hit, but my mental state was significantly impacted. Sometimes, when I’m under pressure, or feeling particularly stressed, I’ll start crying. Then there are other times when I should be crying and/or upset, though I’m not. 

But this post isn’t really about me, its about my mom. Lately, she’s been doing things that aren’t normal for her, not that I really know what *normal* is. A few that come to mind is spending money more frequently, and less carefully. I left to visit my dad, and when I came back, she told me she’d taken an unexpected road trip where she spent a lot of cash that wasn’t budgeted. My mom was never the type of person to be careless with money, particularly because we never had any. 

Something else that’s started lately are her mood swings, or her easily influenced demeanor. Sit doesn’t take much to make her tear up, or get her angry. For example, I’ll start talking about what happened with her ex (it’s not uncommon for us to discuss these events), and I can tell she wants to cry. But the worst of it is when she comes home from work upset. Her job is an office job, and from what I’ve heard, is very low-stress. One night, she came home angry because of something that happened at work, and started yelling at me. I don’t remember much, but over dinner, I told her that it wasn’t “...normal or healthy for you to be yelling at your daughter like this.” 

My mother and I have been in yelling matches before, mostly over things that happened when we lived with her ex, or chores I didn’t do, and I didn’t think any differently of this fight. I only truly realized that her mental state was in danger when she told me (just before Christmas) that she wanted me to draw her a picture of herself, shoulders up—but the lower half was a pyramid of cards, saying, “Because that’s how I feel.” 

Shortly after this, I found out she was in a relationship with one of her coworkers. She seemed very happy and upbeat, and that was when I realized there was something wrong with her. I started asking her (because she seems to hate men) why, if she hates being in a relationship with men, is she eager to start relationships with them? These are not her exact words, but she roughly told me that she didn’t feel joy without a relationship. This was when I began to wonder if she was codependent. 

I don’t really know why I’m posting this. I guess I just needed to tell someone. I didn’t want to tell my friends because I don’t want to give this burden to them. They have unbroken families, where their parents fight over who puts their car in the garage, not about which of them needed emotional therapy. 

If anyone has any advice on how I can help my mom, I would really appreciate it. Anything at all, things I can say when she’s in a bad mood, or something I can do to make her feel better. I want to help her, but she won’t go to therapy. I understand I probably need therapy as well, but I’m afraid to go. I don’t want to leave my mom behind, I don’t want to get better without her. 

TL;DR — My mother was in a toxic relationship that was taxing on her mental and emotional health, does anyone have any advice as to how I can help her when she’s feeling extra down, upset, or angry?",30Dec2020,1
863,"Hi I’m a 22F and as shocking as this may seem I’ve never had my first real kiss w someone and have never been in a romantic situation with someone. 
I recently went on my first date with this sweet guy (he’s friends with one of my friends) and we talked for 3h and I really liked it but I was so f nervous and we didn’t kiss and I felt like he was trying to but I was too shy cuz it was my first time meeting him. We’re going on a second date soon and I really want to kiss him but can’t figure out how or when to do it like I just think I’m gonna froze from anxiety in the moment and I’m so nervous ab it.

865,"i hope this is where im supposed to post but please let me know if not. i need like, life advice. also im on my phone so apologies if the formatting is weird. also this might be long because i cant shorten things for the life of me but id really appreciate any advice right now - big or small &lt;3

context/backstory whatever: im 16f, live in the uk, and go to a secondary school. im in year 12 and so my a-level exams will happen next year. im currently taking physics, chemistry, maths, and computer science. but i think im going to drop computer science because i only enjoy the coding part of it so all the non-coding related things will really drive me up the wall at some point (if i were to carry on). i dont take these subjects because i like them or am good at them or am doing well. i take them because i dislike them the least, and i do believe im not doing well, but i havent failed yet. just falling very far behind. 

because i dont LIKE these subjects, i dont want to pursue them and get a career relating to them because i feel like i wont enjoy them and i wont find happiness in them. and i know its possible to get a career unrelated but i honestly dont know what i enjoy doing apart from playing league of legends (video game). but everyone (friends and family (although i dont really talk to family so its mainly just friends)) is telling me that its wrong and that i should look to go into something ‘helpful’. 

in addition to that, theres also the problem of uni. i dont think i could manage taking one of my current subjects and studying it in uni but i also dont have anything else i could do (i think). i havent thought about what uni i want to go to because right now, i dont want to go. but again, my friends are telling me that its best to go to uni for the degree to help in future because i might need it. for me, i struggle with revision and studying. during gcses, i only studied (kind of) for the subjects i was going to take for a-level. i didnt want to do exceptionally well because i knew trying to do so would put a lot of stress on me. i just wanted to pass all my subjects and do a bit better than ‘pass’ for my a-level subjects. but if i take a subject in uni knowing that i dont want a job in that area, im not going to study, knowing me. 

everything about school just absolutely stresses me out and i hate thinking about it. i have considered multiple times dropping out of school entirely but i feel like if i do that, i really wont have a future at all. i dont really know what advice i need exactly but anything related to this post is welcomed. apologies again for the long post",30Dec2020,1

869,"I (M26) have been wondering about it for a while. How does soap actually work? I am asking because whenever I cleaned something, let's say something on my knee, I would end up clean knee to foot, because my assumption was if the soapy water gets on my foot it too will become dirty. I recently started to question that logic, because that means I will always have to clean my bathtub after I take a shower or clean something. My question is if I clean a part of the body and the soap runs through my body, do I need to clean those parts as well or I shouldn't bother? Or it only depends on situations such as if it's like poo stuck on it or something disgusting?",30Dec2020,1
870,"Hello from England,

I've been with my boyfriend for 3 years and he is a great guy. We share the passion for travel, want kids in our 30s &amp; to buy our own home. 

He went on a night out with his friends and he was messaging me about how his night was going. A couple of minutes later he private messaged me an post of his ex girlfriends, he removed it pretty much seconds later. Unfortunate for him as I saw it before he deleted it. 

Once he came home from the party I decided to not ask him about it until the next day when he was sober. 

I went on his phone to make sure his alarms were set for the next day because I was leaving before him and when I opened his phone I found 2 dating apps with messages from people. 

I went into shock. The next morning when I confronted him to ask what was going on he first denied it but later broke down and talked to me about it. He only talked to people online and never met with anyone. He said he was feeling unattractive and wanted to feel wanted.

After several panic attacks, sleepless nights and not eating for days i decided after talking to him not to make a quick decision as it was too much for me to handle. I stayed and after a week we decided to stay together but only if we spend more time together, and i will make the right decision by me when I feel less anxious. 

I'm a very anxious person who struggles with confidence and finding this out has completely destroyed me. I think about it every day, wondering if he's online right now or going to in the future. 

The thing that bothers me the most is that when I was younger I always kept a promise to myself that i would never be with someone who cheated on me. Not for me but for my future children. 

This year has been tough, I have been off work for 8 months due to my work being closed - retail and he has worked throughout working from home. 

Has anyone any advice on what to do/ what way to look at this?",30Dec2020,1
871," Throwaway for obvious reasons. I go to a good university (one of the top 20 in US), where I major in a relatively difficult STEM subject. Cheating took place obviously when classes were in person.

I'd say I am one of the hardest working students I know, and I feel quite confident about the fact that I am a hard working student. (I should be more humble, but I really pride myself on the fact that I study very hard). I spend more hours than anyone I know preparing for the exam - I take notes diligently during class, I re-write and re-read those notes, I go to office hours, I review with friends, I find extra questions online or in libraries to make sure I get them, etc. And the thing is, I know I am quite capable because I also happen to be one of the go-to people when it comes to explaining difficult concepts. And most of the time, I am able to explain a concept or teach another student about the course material with relative ease.

But when I sit in the class room to take a test (and of course I'm friends with high-achieving friends), I always realize that I am either approaching the question in the wrong way (using a wrong formula) or I have made a mistake (math or otherwise) and etc because my eyes always somehow land on other peoples' exams. I then use the information and the knowledge I have and make sure I get those questions right. I wasn’t always like this, not in high school at least. 

I'd say without cheating, I would get around 80-90 percent on an exam quite easily. But with cheating, I get a grade in the A-/A range. 

I always work hard on projects and essays, and I always do great on them. I never cheat on those because I can just devote more time, read more, think more, go to professors and ask for help, etc… But for some reason, I simply cannot stop myself from cheating when I have the chance to do so. If I’m even a slightly doubtful about a question, I immediately catch myself looking at other people’s answers to make sure I am on the right track.

I am writing this because I kept telling my friends/parents that I feel nervous because I feel like I don’t deserve the grade. I feel like the As that I get aren’t me. My friends tell me I have imposter syndrome, but I’m not so sure that it is imposter syndrome because I am kind of an imposter. But also, I work insanely hard, and I also to an extent deserve a good grade.

873,"Hello I am a 23 year old living at home, i have 12 siblings, which 7 are adopted. For the past year or two I am trying to rent my own place and move on with my life, but my parent mother  keeps making me stay by staying, “oh you don’t like living here  or are you just tried of me” making mean and unnecessary stuff trying to make me stay. It’s not like I want to hurt her feelings but I am 23 and trying to start my life. She is controlling. She has to know everyone’s busy and gets worked up if it’s about her or whatever. Don’t get me wrong she is nice but somedays it gets tiring. Like I mean I don’t mind living at home, it’s just the point in life that it’s time to move on.  Another day story is that her with my dad. So with these siblings, we have them for like 6 years now, and all of a sudden the oldest siblings of them (13yr female) came up to me a few weeks ago and ask about a book and she started to open up about her past life and her feelings. I gain my trust with her for a few days then my mother steps and thinks that we’re doing bad stuff because she’s in my room. Bad stuff like touching her and idk what she thinks. Which is I am not doing that, it’s just nice that she can trust me with the past and feelings and open up about stuff. Later that day, or a day later, I sat down with my mother and explain what was going on and stuff, and said okay good.mother said that is good that she has trust in me to tell things about life. Then my sister and I started to share more stuff and it started to get better till again today she said she was getting mad at me or her. I am not sure if it was direct towards us but Like it’s not my fault that she is ready to open up about her feeling and such to me, and to have trust in me. My sister says she has trust in her but she lets out some of the stuff that she tells my mom. I’m just an older brother giving her advice and helping her. I mean we do Make jokes throughout the day by giving each other L on our fingers and call each other losers. But it’s a joke. Before we got these adopted siblings, my siblings would tease each other with that so I don’t see a point why I can’t without getting accused of stuff.

875,"Main question at the bottom, backstory below.

First relationship I've ever been in, and I don't know what the fuck to do. We're 3 weeks in. Lots of little things are making me mad and even though I'm not sure if it's normal or not, I don't like it. It was supposed to be just a hookup from tinder, but a week later she asked me to be her boyfriend. Like an idiot I agreed so soon. The first night she came over to my place, she went through all of my stuff. I don't mean a casual look through the medicine cabinet, she went through every box, drawer, cabinet, and bag I had, looked under the bed, couch, and everything. I asked her to stop it and she said ""oh sorry, it's just something I have to do."" and kept snooping then got mad at me for asking her to stop. If I take too long to reply or open a message at work and forget to reply she'll send things like ""I asked you to not leave me on read, it gives me anxiety and here you are still doing it."" ""Okaaaayyyy I guess you don't want to talk to me"" or ""I guess you're doing something and not gonna call me, huh?"" I had to cancel plans one night because my dad got hospitalized and she went on and on about how she already arranged for childcare (aka her mom was babysitting.) and how mad she was at me for not keeping plans with her.

 She works a barely above minimum wage job, lives with a friend of her family, pays no rent, makes no car payment, pays no insurance, and so on because her mom, dad, and stepmom pay for it all for her. Then she turns around and grills me about why I'm in my mid-20s and just now moved to a place of my own without a roommate, why I didn't sell my house in another state (that I have rented out) to buy one here, and so on.

 She gets mad and pouts for days if I can't meet on whatever day she wants to because of work or prior plans, she wants me to move plans with friends or family and since I own my business she thinks I can just show up whenever and do whatever. I deleted one form of social media because I was tired of the bs on there, and within an hour of doing that she called me a few times leaving hateful voice-mails about it and even went as far as had her little brother call me about it because ""we all know what deleting someone you're seeing from snapchat means."" She started talking about how I need to consider her and her feelings when making decisions to delete social media instead of thinking of myself, and so on.

When she's over at my place all she talks about it sucking my dick, how she wants me to take her out to fancy places, that she's not high maintenance, and how much she hates her family and her baby daddy. (Single mom with 1 kid born back at the first of the year.) In person those are all our conversations are about. Nothing else. It's like shit. How was your day? What are your goals? What's your favorite color? 

Anyhow, am I overreacting in wanting to break up with her and how do I go about getting her out my life for good? I've never done this before and have no clue what I'm doing.",30Dec2020,1

879,"Im a university instructor and all my courses have been online.

But I’ve been off crack and cocaine for almost for 2 months now. The withdrawal has been fairly minimal. I dont feel *good* but i’m not puking in buckets and it’s not like I felt great before I was using. But on December 6th, my mom had a stroke. Now her heart is at less than 10% of functioning strength and she’s 49. This isn’t her first attack but it may be the first she won’t bounce back from. 

She’s in the hospital waiting for a heart transplant. It could take months and each night is so expensive. I’m looking into a nursing home or other options b/c she needs constant access to health professionals. But it took so much to just get everything thing approved for the transplant anyway. Now we are waiting. The list is long and the only thing we can really do is hope that her heart can last until a new one is donated. This waiting is miserable and seems so hopeless at times. Her birthday was on then 18th. 

And I kind of just flat lined with work. It was finals seasons and I got most grades in on time. But the new covid policies are dictating that we be lenient with students. To do that, I have to cater to students one by one and on an individual basis. Its a lot of forms and a lot of emails. 

But I just couldn’t...*do it.* This is no excuse and it is difficult to explain but most days, words just didnt feel real. I couldnt make out what any of the emails and video meeting were saying. And if I did understand, I couldn’t respond because it felt like i was so distant. You could ask me “what’s my favorite color” and it would feel as if you spoke with a mouth full of jello. When it came to text, i’d forget and lose track of words faster than i could read them. I dont know if you can tell but thats how writing this post feels. So I even bought screen reader tech just to make things make more sense and to try and force accountability. I’ve genuinely tried working every single day. I never got much work done but I spent multiple hours in front of a laptop just *trying.*

But still, I haven’t genuinely responded to my email since before the stroke. I haven’t told my job either because I doubt they will care. But today I’m trying to be extra brave and check my inbox. And it’s not looking good. Everyone is really really upset. And so many students need that individual attention. I’ve been at my desk since 8am and I’ve only gotten through 6 emails.  I have sent zero through. So again, hours have passed and ive done nothing. 

Part of me knows that this would be so much easier if I could use just one more time, just to get through the day. But I couldn’t even if I wanted too. When I decided to quit, I moved away from any and all contacts and dealers. To find new ones or reconnect with the old is too much energy that I don’t have. 

I’m trying so hard and I don’t have any excuse for what is quite literally ghosting my place of employment. I feel horrible and I want to apologize. But I can’t find the words. And why would they care after ive been so horrible.

883,"I'm currently studying something, which I very quickly realised was the wrong choice for me. After making a couple of observations and considerations I realised that I have an interest in philosophy and think that it would be a good choice for me. 
I'd personally say that I could do well in philosophy. My problem is that my parents do not think so. It's important to mention that they are rather controlling but meanwhile want me to prove my independence or complain that I haven't yet, not realising they never really gave me an opportunity. 
Also they do not believe that philosophy allows for any kind of stable career. Although I am aware, that philosophy doesn't have a clear path ahead (like the educational sector has, for example), I've read a  lot about how studying philosophy allows for a broad field of possibilities because of the skills you gain from it. 

I would be more than grateful for any arguments I could use to convince my parents to let me study philosophy.
I have no idea how I can make them trust my skills a little more. I at least claim to know myself really well as far as work ethic goes and can say with confidence that if I want something, I'll work hard to get it. 
I know that ultimately it is my choice, if it weren't for my financial dependence on them.

19F for some background, i have a rough relationship with my family; borderline toxic. my mom and i have never gotten along. she’s been picking fights with me since around 5th ish grade but she hasnt hit me since 8th grade. my dad says that i should just ignore it because she just uses me as an outlet to let out her anger and i should just do my best to not let it get to me. right. a couple months ago, i had the biggest fight with my mom. she swung at my face as if she was about to punch me(she didnt) and she spit on me and tossed shit around my room. as well as threw her phone at me. at no point in that fight did i raise my voice. she said a lot of questionable things to me that i just laughed off. i was speaking calmly since it was regarding my college future and i think it’s pathetic that she cant have a normal convo w me. i want to be a dental assistant but she wants me to get a bachelors/masters degree. i refused. school just isn’t my forte. but she just went fucking ballistic and my dad just stood there telling her to “calm down” and he had to get in between us so she doesn’t pummel me. at one point she even put her hands out as if she wanted to choke me. i started laughing because what the fuck yknow. my laughing at her made her anger even worse. she ended up throwing her phone down the stairs while yelling. her voice was echoing and im pretty sure our neighborhood heard everything. ANYWAYS, i want to move out, obviously. shes always been very childish and i am tired of it. my dad just stands there and watches me take it. he doesnt really yell at me because he says my mom does that enough, but he just doesn’t say anything to her. she refuses to accept she’s ever wrong. anyway that was in october. i havent talked to her since. i hardly ever talk to my dad. my job temporarily closed due to covid so i just go out and drive all day by myself and as soon as i get home my dad is angry because he doesnt like me being out too much (again wtf). so, AITA for not speaking to them even if i live in a house with them. i pay for all my own shit, including food. and i never leave my room unless i need to. my dad says im overreacting and i cant not talk to my mom forever. i dont even bother defending myself anymore. i know they’re my family and i should treat them better but i really want to leave. my siblings don’t like our parents either but i just feel like such an outlier because im the only one ever getting yelled at over my decisions/opinions. i am middle easter so my parents are very religious and hard on me. (im not religious but they dont know that obv). i am also the eldest daughter, and the middle child. i understand that they act like that because it’s just how they grew up, therefore i cant blame them. amita for hating them so much and wanting to move state? sorry this was very long lol",30Dec2020,1

890,"So there’s this girl in my friend group, which is not my friend, but we get along pretty well. 

For the New Year, she proposed us to sleepover at her house because she was alone, thing that we couldn’t do bc of COVID

So when we declined her offer (our parents were too worried about COVID) she got sad and mad, and she started being kinda aggressive (we were texting in our groupchat). 

So me and my friends told her that if she REALLY wanted to do something, maybe she could go on Tinder and plan a date that day.   
We knew that is risky and we told her that if the guy was safe, I would be good. I told my friends that I already did something similar and it was cool. 

She told us to “fuck ourselves”, and told me I was a liar even though she doesn’t know shit about me. 

I absolutely hate when people accuse me of lying when I’M NOT, and also, in front of the whole friend group. I really don’t like that. I asked her why she said that in private and she didn’t respond, but I know she saw the message. 

So idk why she attacked me, and I’m so mad at her for doing this in front of everyone for something that is false. 

Keep in my she’s a really introverted and shy person, so idk. 

What do you guys think ?",30Dec2020,1
891,"Backstory: I was 6 years old when my dad left us (me, my mom and my sibling). Initially my mom never said we were abandoned, and that we only lost contact with him (this was a time when cellphones weren't a thing). We went through a lot, even before that since my mom and dad had a tough relationship. Later on we found out that he already has another family, and his eldest kid is just several months younger than me (which proves cheating, although my mom and dad never married - I don't know anymore how to explain this as its more complicated than how I am writing it now).  I grew up in an impoverish state - not as worse as my classmates but also not that good as my mom tried to juggle raising me and my sibling while working in real estate. It was that way until I got into highschool, I was about 15  when my mom and dad started talking again, soon he started helping by sending some money to us. He helped a bit with expenses in school as my sibling went to uni - but it was only enough for him so I went through the route of becoming a scholar student when I went to uni.   


Our relationship with my dad was very shaky, he never really acknowledges that we exists on his family's end. I've never been to his country, or have met my gradparents on his side and his siblings, I also have never met my half siblings.. all of whom do not know that me and my brother exists. I feel like when my dad talks to us he denies what he did.. and when my dad talks to his family he denies us. 

&amp;#x200B;

I got to give him some credit tho that he paid for my tuition fees for my masters in Europe - 8000 GBP per year. I would have not afford it otherwise my alternative route would once again to take scholarships which was also possible, but I took the opportunity to study in the expensive school. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the issue: The university is releasing a story about me, a short one, and in that story I mentioned my mom as a single parent, I shared my struggles with regards to my studies. Afraid that I will offend my dad, I asked him about 2 weeks ago if he is alright with what was made so far. He went on his speech that he is proud of me etc, but tonight he called me drunk saying that no one remembers his sacrifices and that my mom was not a single parent, that he was with us in spirit always, that he paid for my tuition fees that me and my brother would probably not make it in Europe without his help...  


I am emotionally and mentally scarred as a kid, I do have abandonment issues, I do feel that I made a mistake by not mentioning my dad in the video for helping me out but I don't think that my mom was not a single parent... how the fuck do I fix this? I don't even know how to process it. I feel pressured that my Dad is putting all of this shit on my head, venting to me that none of his kids - even the ones that he has on the other side remembers him. The story written about me doesn't help of course. I feel bad but I do not know if I'm supposed to. I expected him to react this way, but it gave me peace of mind when he said he's ok with it, I really do not know how to process it. I'm going through a lot of mental shit right now and I'm worried that this will push me over the edge.  


I'll end it there since I will just keep on writing if I don't. I'm confused as fuck. Was I wrong? Should I get the story pulled out?? I'm considering backing out now. I also don't know which subreddit i can post this on, sorry if this is not the right place.  


TL;DR: I grew up without a dad, was raised by mom until before I started college. Dad later helped out with tuition fees for my masters degree but I did not acknowledge him in a story/article that is coming out about me. Need some advice",30Dec2020,1
892,"About 2 weeks ago I was in the E.R because i was having symptoms of covid19 i was sent home and told to stay home and quarantine until I got my test results back. A couple days later the apartment complex I live in randomly knocked on my door or an annual inspection, instead of opening the door I spoke behind the door and told management I was in quarantine because I suspected that I might have covid they told okay not to worry about it. So today i get a note on my door from front office saying i violated my lease because i refused to allow them inside to inspect my unit. I went up to the front office to speak with managment and explain the situation and why I didn't open the door, i even took my discharge papers from the hospital to prove that i needed to quarantine for a possible case of covid19 and the lady in the office was just being rude to me and said ""well at this point there isn't anything you can do about it"" I feel like this Is unfair, my lease is up in a few months I am planning on moving and don't want this lease violation showing up on my record, this is my first apartment I've ever rented never have I had a lease violation until now.

894,"I know this sounds so arrogant. But I have felt a few people were jealous of my skills and abilities. I am not exceptional or gifted by any means but I can do a lot of workload to a high standard very quickly. I heard a senior person talking to someone recently whom said “they are jealous of him”. And this confirmed my suspicions.

I don’t and didn’t think they were feeling this way until they started to ignore me and act like I was invisible. When I joined they were never friendly, did not help me and became very competitive. One gave me constant digs and limited my workload. I notice now they don’t work when I am in, other people have commented on that.

It is very lonely and isolating. I have brought in headphones to listen to music to keep me company, as sad as that is. 

I don’t actually savour this environment and want to know how I could rectify this. I don’t intentionally go out trying to stir up feelings of jealously. I just work hard and enjoy working hard.

I worked so hard this year, and I got an incredible result, but I feel like nothing will ever be able to truly satisfy me. I don't know what to do.

899,"Title pretty much says it all. I’ve been seeing my therapist for a few months. We’re both the same age and have very similar backgrounds. We’ve connected a lot on our similar past experiences, our individual, personal goals for the future, and she certainly shares more with me about her personal story than any other therapist/counselor in the past ever has. 

She’ll say things like “you are my favorite client, I hope you know that”, and give me words of affirmation for the things she thinks are “great” about me. We’ll text sometimes about things like music and she’s even sent me playlists she’s made specifically for me which make her “think of [me]”. I know this probably sounds crazy, and I’m probably reading way too much into all of this, but I’m starting to cop some feelings for her and I can’t shake this feeling of a sincere connection between us.

Where I need advice is in what to do next? Should I tell her how I’m feeling or should I wait it out to see if my feelings wane over time? If I don’t tell her, would it be detrimental in any way to keep this from her? I’m at a loss here and truly in uncharted territory.",30Dec2020,1
900,"Hello, 

Several years ago (7-8), I started a pretty severe gambling addiction. Over the course of college and early in my career, I lost several thousand dollars and ran up a significant amount of credit card debt (which I am now *almost* done paying off). The addiction lasted about 2 years where I was gambling regularly. Over the next 2-3 years, it came back intermittently (every \~6 months), never as bad as it was originally, but still I'd go to the casino 2-3 times in a week and then wouldn't go back. I've now only been to the casino once in the last 18 months or so (I went once during the pandemic, quickly lost, and left). 

&amp;#x200B;

One of the only things that keeps me from going more often is that gambling is illegal in my state. I'd have to cross state lines (about 30-40 minutes drive) to go to the casino. However, in the November election, my state legalized gambling (I'm actually not against this, politically, but it obviously causes a personal issue). The first casino in my state was just announced and is literally less than 5 minutes from my house.

&amp;#x200B;

Moving isn't an option. How can I keep from relapsing and going to this new (or any other) casino?",30Dec2020,1
901,"Long story short, a close friend of mine “dumped” me a few months ago. I won’t go into all the details other than it was very sudden - she didn’t any warnings to make things better, a chance to respond, and I still am not super clear on what I “did” wrong.

I didn’t try to respond, and she didnt try to initiate any communication since then - tho she still lives close and is in a few mutual circles. I wanted to move on. Maybe even take the high road. But the proximity has made it a little hard to move on.

I have a pattern of not reacting immediately when people hurt me deeply. Maybe I’m afraid of doing or saying something I’ll regret. Or maybe that expressing my anger will make me get lost in it. Or even upsetting people in our mutual circle. But over time I’ve found i regret not expressing my hurt or anger.

I think I’ll finally send that email I never sent.

I kind of just accept this is the way I handle things.

Anxiety with regards to overcoming relationship

So recently I’ve been experiencing a ton of anixety. It includes worrying about my life after college, but recently something that happened over the summer. I became friends with a guy last year we became super super close and over the summer we slipped into being friends with benefits ( nothing actually physical but sexting that kind of thing). But this was my first time in such a situation and I think I’ve become emotionally attached to him. The only thing is we are never going to be together as we both stated but I dont know how to get over the situation. We dont do anything anymore but we don’t really talk as much either. Sometimes we hit each other up and see how the other person is or share things we thought was funny. Kicking the person out of my life is out of the question as he is a family friend. I sometimes feel insecure thinking about all my insecurities, i start to compare myself to other girls especially his ex who i think he still likes. On top of that i start getting anxious on how this will affect my future relationships. I need to get over this person and its contributing to my lack of sleep at night. I hate myself for slippin on a slippery slope. Sometimes I feel like i became a friend who eventually became a rebound for him. But i was dumb enough to fall for the kid. I’m definitely confused and want to tend to this so I dont carry any baggage into the new year. Any advice?

Tl; DR
- My guyfriend and I had turned into friends with benefits. But I’ve caught feelings, we dont do anything anymore and we are more distant friends now. I miss our friendship and his company as a friend. I’ve developed some anxieties about its affect on my future relationships.

908,"I’m going to try and make this short. Boyfriend has depression. Seems to be getting worse. He stopped taking his medication in July. His grandparents think he takes it as he still collects it. So basically he’s just stock piling it. They even took him to a doctors appointment last week where he got new medication. I think he took it once then gave up because it made him tired. 

I don’t know what’s going on lately but he’s just so off. Seems distant, angry (never at me just at life), doesn’t seem to want to communicate with me. He’s just not the guy he used to be and it hurts seeing him that way. I don’t know what to do anymore, I’ve tried getting him to talk to me, to take the medication but he won’t. He’s suicidal and I’m worried what he might do. He says awful things about self harm and suicide as “jokes” but deep down he’s probably serious.

He’s 23, works so pays his own way but lives with his grandparents. They care a lot about him, but I don’t know if it’s worth talking to them about this?

Wars, inequality, etc. It's even worse when it's something very common and society just acts like it's no problem. I can't not care about it because there are major issues and nobody is talking about them. And when I try to speak up about it nobody cares. I understand this is out of my control and the most I could do is probably just going to volunteer and help in that way. But it's frustrating me to the core knowing that we all live in such a shitty place that I even got to the point of being against having children.

910,"Hello reddit

I am a 21 year old hobbyist farmer. I have the chance to start an agricultural business (poultry, produce, and dairy). I have 8 months of farmer’s market booth space for next year, providing almost all the produce for my small town’s market. I have a website, and I have a full business plan. My small town sucks, I’ve lived here my whole life, and I want to see other parts of my state. My hometown is toxic and a big contributor to my PTSD.

Or 

I could move two hours away to go to my dream school. I want to study forestry and it’s one of the best schools in the country for it. But I’d have to sell all my current animals at the end of next year (i would start fall of 2021). By then I’d have double the animals and customers. It’s a beautiful mountain town like where I live currently. My boyfriend has a good job offer with my grandfather that would pay for his school (and hour East from where I want to go to school). So, he won’t be going with me should I choose this option.

But

I also got offered an apprenticeship to train dogs. Which is a lifelong passion and recently I’ve been given some amazing opportunities. Even potential job placement. But the apprenticeship is over an hour in the opposite direction of school. In a massive city (my state’s capital), in the desert, where I’m not a fan of living. It’s two hours to my boyfriend’s school and three to mine. 

I could potentially see how this summer goes, but regardless, I don’t want to run or operate an animal based business without furthering my education. And most degrees require in person labs I can’t take online. 

I also have 3 cats and soon-to-be 3 dogs, one retired service dog, one service dog in training, and a rescue I am giving a home from the dog trainer I would potentially work for. The dog itself is a great opportunity to show him what I’m capable of. He’s world renowned, and very good at what he does. He’s made a career doing what I would want to do.

I could potentially save money from my business, and buy land closer to where I want to go to school or closer to where I could have the dog training job. There are other Unis in the state capital, but they’re not my first pick and dream school. 

I’m really stressed, I’m not neurotypical. I have bad executive dysfunction and I hate change, even if it’s good. But I know I need it. I don’t know what to do. Any ideas? Advice? I’m just lost and have been since I was 18 and it makes me tired not just knowing where to go or what’s best, because I have 3 great options and I want them all and idk if that’s even possible.",30Dec2020,1
