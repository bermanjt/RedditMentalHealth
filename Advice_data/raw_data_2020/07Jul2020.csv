0,"I would love some advice.

I live with 2 others and one recently moved in. The other two gang up on me all the time so was hoping to make friends with the new one.

When the new one moved in I made a nice dinner and one of the other ones (who hates me less) came home from work and we all started drinking a bit more, few drinking games.. ya know.

The thing is, I don't remember what happened after the one who absolutely hates me came home. We were sitting in the garden, they made a few comments and I'm blank after that. 

 One who hates me less went to bed, the new one (after apologising for anything I may have done) has ignored any texts with me apologising. 

For reference, I've lived with 37 people since 2013 and never had this problem. The one who hates me less was my best friend for a few months but since lockdown kinda horrid. 

TL;DR  
I opened my big gay mouth when I was drunk when I was being bullied by a non-binary person.",07Jul2020,1

2,"I've been pretty down and not going out much. I just got off of work and I figured starbucks would be a nice pick me up, but I just can't stand spending money on myself.

3,"I'm a fat black girl with no hair. I've spent most of my time cutting my hair short but now I'm finally letting it grow longer in hopes that it'll help me look more feminine in appearance. I'm built like a fridge, even if I lose weight I feel like my body still won't be appealing because of my bone structure. I look like a butch lesbian,I've been asked if I was a lesbian a million times. I separated myself from girls because of the bullying I experienced. I had mostly male friends because of this but this did not help. Guys saw me as one of them I never got a boyfriend out of it. I'm also 6'1 and a lot of guys seem to be intimidated by my height. Why be with a tall fat black lady when you can be with a cute small Asian girl? That's what everyone goes for. I live in a majority white and asian area. It sucks because I got hopeful that maybe I'd be able to date a black guy because my dad would really like that. They hate me though. Sometimes I'm just standing there and I hear them laugh at me and crack jokes. I don't know what's gonna happen next..I'm going to college next. I'm scared that people will hate me there to or that I'll have no friends. I only have 1 irl friend and we haven't hung out in years. Most of my friends are from discord. I'm shy too so I suck at making friends. Any advice? I'll take anything. My last resort is plastic surgery.",07Jul2020,1
4,Ever since I was a child I prefer my own company isolated from others and I’m happy. And I hate being around others idk but other people annoys me. I’m very competitive and ambitious I’d rather work hard and focus myself towards advancing my career and studying politics and reading books.

5,"I was hoping to get into one but I'm just gaining and gaining weight and I feel awful, I dont have scales and cant really afford any, no one ik has any either but I can tell I'm not healthy. 

So far I've set alarms so I can hopefully get into a slightly healthier routine (morning, breakfast, lunch, dinner) but I'm just not sure how to be healthy.

I was told to find my tdee but idk weight or height 

Exercising right now is difficult, just because I have bad ankles, they get so painful and I cant see physio yet.

I have depression and anxiety so I wont go to the gym, but hopefully the pool. I can usually only stick to routines for a max of a week. Help.",07Jul2020,1
6,"I'm having weird sensitivity whenever I touch things with my fingertips. When I touch any type of fabric, cardboard boxes, paper towels, my teeth hurt like I just bit into ice cream, like a shivery sensation that's now causing pain in my teeth. 

It's been happening for nearly a week now. My jaw is uneven so I tend to clench my teeth pretty hard and I grind my teeth in my sleep, so maybe that's a possible reason why this is happening. When it started happening, one day my teeth felt bigger and much more sensitive but only for one day. The morning after, I woke up and everything was back to normal except now when I touched things my teeth would hurt. 

It's coming to a point where I might not be able to touch my own hair or pet my cat. No one in my family knows what's going on and they said they don't see anything about it when they search it up. It's becoming unbearable and I cry because I'm so uncomfortable. Does anyone have a clue what might this be?",07Jul2020,1

9,"My dad has a lot of mental/emotional problems and gets triggered easily. He is going away to another state for a week to meet up with a girl. They will be in the woods and I think there may be guns. He hasn’t killed anyone before or done serious injury to anyone in a while, but I don’t think that he should be around guns (and one of his therapists agreed with me). When triggered, he can get “mad enough to kill” as he says. Is it weird to alert the girl ahead of time to keep weapons out of the place where they are staying? I doubt that he would hurt her, so should I not bring it up? I just don’t want anything bad to happen.",07Jul2020,1
10,"I found out a month or so ago that basically she met a guy on tinder and their dates were bad and he was a bit creepy so she just stopped seeing him and told him it wouldn’t work out.

He since made fake accounts, messaging her. The usual stalker stuff. It got to the point where he made fake calls to her. She got in contact with an ex of his and she said he did the same her and they bonded over that lol but yeah it never went passed some calls and texts. 

Tonight tho, she was a bit worried (I was with her when she got this text) and she got a text from a girl claiming the stalker had died. She didn’t believe it and asked his ex gf to check and 10 minutes later she got back to her and said he’s still alive and to ignore the text. She did that. 

He then texted her from other fake accounts (she didn’t tell me what was said because I’m her younger brother and she doesn’t want me to worry) and it freaked her out a lot. I didn’t notice but she started texted her current boyfriend and told him. He then told my sister he texted the stalker (she didn’t want this) and basically he told him to fuck off and to leave my sister alone. 

Her boyfriend for a reply saying “Oh dw ill leave her alone, I was planning on paying you a visit this weekend.” My sister freaked out at this and told her ex bf (now friend) and he told her to come to his house to calm down. She got up and left without a word. I was worried obviously and called her and she explained an hour later what happened. 

Her boyfriend basically threatened the stalker. Said if he doesn’t stop that he’d .... attack him. The stalker then sent the text above. My sister isn’t worried anymore because she knows the stalker doesn’t know where her bf lives. I mean he’s been stalking my sister for months now and still hasn’t found her address. 

Apparently his ex gf got in contact with police but they said they couldn’t do much (idk why she must not have said how bad it was) but some of her friends who are police agreed to talk to him. They went to his home off duty but in uniform and told him to back off. 

Just needed to get this off my chest lol. I’m a bit worried because if this guy figures out my sisters address he could hurt anyone in the house to get to her. He’s already loving it that her bf is angry at him (he’s making trouble in the relationship which is what he wants). My sisters told everyone she knows to jsut ignore him because she thinks that the attention is what he wants. He wants to scare my sister and hurt her but not physically. Idk if that’s true but she believes it is and she knows him better than me so I’ll trust her. 

I’m just thinking if anything more happens it would be best to tell the police. Idk tho.",07Jul2020,1
11,Okay so I (17f) feel like I’m literally going crazy. I can’t find any explanation for what keeps happening to me. So I take multiple medications daily. So I take about four or five pills a day for various mental illnesses. They have been helping me greatly. I keep my pills very organized in a pill box on my dresser. Every Sunday I fill it up for the week and put it back on my dresser. I keep them very organized and always in the same spot and I take them at the exact same time every day. Recently I’ve been noticing that a few of my pills will be missing. So for example on Monday only three out of my five pills were there. But then on Wednesday there weren’t any pills at all. And I KNOW I fill them up exactly how they should be. I feel like I’m losing my mind. No one in my house touches my pills and I have no idea what could have happened to them. I start to worry that I took them twice  then I have fears of an overdose even though I keep them organized and scheduled. I feel like I’m going insane. Does anyone have any logical explanation for what the hell is happening with my pills?,07Jul2020,1
12,Today me and a boy that i loved decided to split. Me and him dated for 6 months and it was amazing. We broke up because i have problmes with trust and i over think. I am debating if i should end myself. Me and him vowed to get married in the future and we both are teens. i get that its stupid because we are teens but he showed me so much. he was far from perfect but i lied about a lot of shit and i hurt him. This prolly not the right place but i needed to vent because i feel so fucking bad. He made me feel like i had a purpose and i hurt him so fucking bad without even thinking about how he felt.

14,"I never thought the day my best friend a person I love  and trust, and I would fall apart.
Little history on us, were cousins and have been friends since little kids.

We’re both female and about the same age.

Around 2019, my best friend meet this new friend. And ever since that day they were Instepable. They were going out every day, just do things together. I live one hours away from her so when we see each other we would have to travel one hour to do so.

It’s not what I care that she made a new best friend. It’s just that ever since she did, she didn’t call me or text me or even want to meet up. 

And throughout this whole virus thing, not once has she called or text me. I would see her on social media, her and her new best friend would be going out. What annoys me the most is that, this new friend lives what 30 minutes from her, she went to see her while the virus thing was happening and even when she couldn’t she would post them talking on house party for houses. 

She didn’t even call me to join them, she has the time to call her new friend, and spend time with her. She even went to the protest with her new friend, and she didn’t even invite me. I see all the posts together. She looks so happy, she doesn’t need me in her life bring her down.

I feel like I’m being replaced. And I hate it. Maybe I did to my self I seem to bring all bad things with me. And no one wants me as their friend, a lover, a family. 

It’s even worst is that. We moved houses a month ago, she didn’t even come to help. Instead she went and meet up with her new best friend. Every single house they move from I was there with my mom helping them move.

And another time, something bad happen to one of my family, they ended up in the hospital. She never called or even texted. 

I can’t be overthinking this, I really do believe we’re drifting apart.",07Jul2020,1

So why does this bother me? whenever stuff like this happens he will treat them with respect but treat me like a second class citizen if i happen to be the best at the moment then thats when he treats me with respect and remembers I exist.

18,"If there’s a better subreddit to post this in, please let me know. 

TLDR: I was hired the day of my interview, worked a 6 and a half hour shift, worked a 7 and a half hour shift the next day by myself, and was just scheduled to work 39 hours this upcoming week. I’m getting paid minimum wage.

Last week I decided I would start applying for jobs again, being that I’ve recently graduated and have plenty of time on my hands. I applied to a few places before a certain restaurant 30 minutes away from me to be a prep cook. This restaurant got back to me almost immediately via indeed messages and had me come in for an interview on Friday at 11am. I applied on Tuesday and had my interview scheduled by Wednesday.

Friday rolls around, I went in for my interview and it went pretty well. The woman interviewing me (my now-boss) is pretty disappointed that I don’t have any experience in a restaurant kitchen (though I’m a seasoned home cook) and says other positions are available. As I’m leaving, she asks if i’m available “this weekend, like tomorrow.” I said yes, taking that as a good sign, and went on my merry way. Fast forward to 2pm, she messages me saying she’d like to offer me a job as cold side line cook and asked if I could come in at 5 for a training shift. I agreed, and went in. I ended up being there until 10:30 and wasn’t necessarily being trained, I was shown how to make one certain dish and was responsible for that one dish all night. A decent first shift, but not very productive.

Saturday, the 4th of July, she asks me to come in at 2. Again, I agree, I go in, but this time.. the chefs are gone. My boss was on the hot line, and I was on the cold line. With zero training other than fuckin nachos and a menu in front of my face. On my second day of work. For an 8 hour shift. It was *beyond* taxing, and to add insult to injury, I was having to train other new people on the very few things I was able to pick up on my first day, like where certain items are and how to make the nachos and things like that.

I had off Sunday (yesterday) and today, and my boss sent me my schedule for the week. I’m working 39 hours, alone on cold line, for minimum wage. I just graduated high school. I kinda feel like my ability to pick up on things quickly is being taken advantage of, as the cooks that I met on my first day aren’t even on the schedule that was sent out. I think I replaced the cold line cook, and my boss is replacing the hot line cook for the time being.

With all of this being said, I feel like I should be paid more for the work I’m doing. I took over an entire *crucial* position in the kitchen with minimal notice, minimal experience, and minimal training, and still dealt with a 4th of July dinner rush with no complaints about any of the food that was sent out from my station.",07Jul2020,0
19,"I’m going to try and keep this short and sweet. Ask me anything later. My dad got married to a controlling, mean, know it all blonde flight attendant who lives with her mother. She comes to our home which is now legally hers and is turning it into what SHE wants. She’s redoing the whole thing using my fathers money (as well as her own too to be fair). It’s a mess. She’s rude to me and my siblings. I’m 22.. my brother is 18 and my older 23 year old sister is about to get married and leave. This woman has made no effort to gain respect or trust. She threatened to leave my father if he didn’t force us young adults to cut someone out of our lives because she was jealous of this other person. My father threatened to take everything I had... my car, furniture, house to live in. I was forced to do this. This was 2 years ago. She stopped showing up for a year despite being married to my dad. She showed up again a few weeks ago after leaving our home half finished for a year and a half to start working on it again. She calls us disgusting and many other profane things to my father sometimes in front of us. He does nothing. She threatened my brother today saying he is only allowed to live in HER HOUSE because they are letting him. He just graduated high school. He doesn’t have a career or money. Where else could he go? I’m in the same boat. I’m a hairdresser and haven’t started a solid clientele yet as the coronavirus has slowed me down a lot. I can’t afford to leave now. She’s taking our home from us and talking to us like we’re freeloading trash. I don’t feel welcome here and I have no where to go. I don’t know what to do. I didn’t even know he married her.

20,"I hate myself for a few reasons. I'm 20 years old, still live with my mom, and never had a job. (Never had a job because when I tried to get one in high school, I couldn't get anywhere locally to hire me because I'm autistic and I jump and flap my hands and don't know when I am doing it. In college, I'm an idiot who spends all day of every day doing homework (when I was not working on it is very rare during the semester.) My mom says that this is fine because I'm still in college while I'm still living with her. I do not think that this is valid because I see plenty of other people my age who live on their own, have a job, and are in college. This makes me feel like a failure at best. Even when I'm out of college, I have no idea how I'm going to get out of this house. As far as talking to a friend about this goes, it's extremely hard for me to talk to anyone, especially about negative shit. (I've been wanting to make this post for several months, but it has been hard to.) Also, with the only friend I have, I haven't heard from him in a very long time. (except for a meme that I sent him on march 3. He thought it was funny. No conversation came out of that.) I don't even know if he remembers that I exist now lol. Also feel like a piece of shit because I don't say things that I think I should, for example, the other day my grandmother was angry because my cousin blocked her on facebook. The reason she blocked her was because my grandmother was trying to force her into her political views by sending her blatant propaganda through facebook, and it was far from the first time. When my grandmother was complaining about this to me, I think I should have told her that she was in the wrong by a pretty wide margin, but it's extremely hard for me to say things like that and I hate it. There were many other situations like this where I should have said something and didn't. Also, it is extremely hard for me to get motivated and stay motivated to do stuff (This is really hard to describe. I want to do it, then I can't get or stay motivated to. That's the best way I can describe it, but it's obviously not the best / most detailed description.). This results in several situations where I intend to do something, don't do it, then hate myself for being a lazy piece of shit afterwards. I want to be a better person, but it is extremely difficult for me. Can someone give some advice here?",07Jul2020,1
21,"Before the pandemic started, I invested a lot of money in my apartment to have two free rooms and rent them. At that time the idea made sense because I traveled a lot and was little at home.

So my mom is my last parent. She has been an alcoholic for as long as I can remember  - not a mean drunk or anything, but she sips herself to sleep every night. She is sick without it and definitely dependant. 
She started falling here and there a few years back, and after a particularly bad fall started using a walker. Last fall she ended up in the hospital due to a bladder infection and after that she couldn't walk anymore. Her muscles had atrophied to the point where she gave up. So now she is fully immobile. She lives in a hospital style bed and the health authority come to her house three times a day to clean her up and see if she needs anything. 
She has tenants in the house that bring her food and chat with her, so she isnt alone. But the care she is receiving is not enough. A few weeks ago her health escalated to the point where she needed to be ambulanced to the hospital. She stabilized but now needs daily medication. 

My mom is very stubborn. She hates doctors,  can be prickly to deal with, and is really really set in her ways. She just wants to lay in her chair and be left to watch her TV shows, smoke cigarettes, and drink. But shes not being taken care of the way she needs to. Her mind is starting to slip and she forgets things, doesnt eat, and needs reminders. Dementia is definitely settling in because of her alcoholism. 

We have an executor of her Will who is a close family friend, but even she cant be around all the time. Once moms mind is too muddled to make reasonable decisions for herself, mom agreed that it's best for someone to step in and that's the executors power. It's in the will. But how do we know or decide that shes at that point? 

And then what do we do when it gets to that point? We cant put her in a home, she refuses. She wont stop drinking or smoking. Her choices have led her into an early grave but we at least want her to be comfortable...  the line between respecting her autonomy and  wielding power for her care is unclear and I dont know how to manage it. Perspective or stories would be appriciated. 

Tldr; Tis a hard this loving an alcoholic who has neglected themselves into an early grave. Is there anything I can have set up for her to live out her final years in relative comfort? When does her executor claim authority due to decline in mental capacity? 

Edit** This is in BC, Canada. She is 63, on a pension with reasonable savings. I'm an adult  it I live on the other side of the country and have zero of my shit together enough to care for her.",07Jul2020,1

And every weekend or every second weekend I’m going back to the city I’m from. The thing is I don’t really like the city I moved to I don’t really know why. It just feels like that I don’t belong there. And because I’m always going back and forth on the weekends I can’t really do sports because you need to be there on the weekends to do that. In my old city I’m staring to lose friends because I’m not really there anymore and I can’t really meet new people because like I said I don’t spend a lot of time there anymore but I don’t want sit at home at my hometown anymore alone. I met new people in the city I’m currently studying in, but you know there are not really friends. I only see them while studying I’m not meeting them outside of like studying and stuff. 
So my question ist should I move back to my old city and find new friends there , which is not going to be that easy because i don’t really now where to find good friends. Or should I commit to new city and try to find good friends there and stay there. I’m kinda starting to be depressed because I don’t really have any friends anymore and I’m not happy where I’m at right now in life.

He wouldn’t let it go and kept pressing me for it so I just told him. Afterwards he was like “Oh, and she denied it several times, I hate when people do that.” (I don’t understand why he said that, it was just really out of the ordinary especially because he knows what it’s like to be in the closet, anyway...)

The one who had a crush on me recently came out and it reminded me of this. I want to tell her. My main fear is that she will find out on her own and feel double betrayed. She’s my best friend and very understanding. I know that I could have still not said anything and told the guy to fuck off.

One problem though, is that she recently told me that she still has a crush on me and I feel like that adds more conflict. Like it’ll make it even worse.

30,"Sorry if I messed up some things, not really used to this sub.

&amp;#x200B;

If you look in my last posts, you'll know the issues involving me and my sisters (J27, A25). Watered down version is that J has poor money management and it got to a point where we were threatened being evicted AND we had to pay a ""cleaning fee because our apartment wasn't clean."" A and I (19F) think that she either didn't pay rent (the cleaning fee was the same as our rent. funny huh?), or was trying to break the lease without telling us because she wanted to move in with her girlfriend. Anyway I called bs on her which resulted in us (J and I) arguing and so A moved in with one of her friends, while I moved in with my dad. It's not the best living arrangements because I have to share a room with him but I got a roof over my head until I start school in 6 months so I'm not complaining.

&amp;#x200B;

So it's been about 2/3 weeks since I moved out and I haven't talked to J at all since the argument. The only way I've been getting updates is through A, but because A has been so busy with work, she haven't been in much contact with J. But here's some (fun!) things I've found out.

&amp;#x200B;

1. She and her girlfriend broke up the exact day A and I moved out

&amp;#x200B;

2. Because her and her girlfriend broke up, she obviously had no place to stay so she had to scramble up as much money as she could so she could keep the apartment and pay whatever ""fees"" they asked us too.

&amp;#x200B;

3. Because all the furniture in the house was handed down from my mom to A, A took all dining/living/some kitchen room furniture so now the apartment is bare save for a couch and J's room so she haven't had anyone over because she's embarrassed about the lack of furniture

&amp;#x200B;

4. When she was on vacation with her (ex) gf, the day after they broke up, her ex pulled a gun out on her for.. something idk

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'll be honest, 4 isn't really that fun to know and is actually the reason I'm feeling so conflicted. Now by my last posts, you can clearly see that I was actually planning to cut J off and it's only been 2-3 weeks since I last talked to her. But after hearing about number 4, I've been concerned about her and her well-being.

&amp;#x200B;

On one hand, I miss J and is actually concerned about her. On the other hand she's selfish, greedy and manipulative, and cause the worst headaches for me and A known to man. She's money hungry and was literally about to have me and A out on the streets without us knowing just so she could live with her gf.

&amp;#x200B;

She's called me a couple of times since the argument but right when I actually thought to talk to her, she just ended up starting ANOTHER argument about money, which just made me not want to talk to her. She even called A and me today, which A answered and she was just talking about how she's upset that we haven't talked to her and she wanted to check up on us. Basically I'm just confused on what to do, repair our relationship or continue to keep my distance?",07Jul2020,1
31,"So I \[21F\] went on [psychologytoday.com](https://psychologytoday.com)'s directory of therapists, and emailed a couple. A month later, no response. So I email three more. A few days later, I got a response from one of them, just to apologize for the delayed response and tell me his schedule's full. I'm not used to this kind of non-response from therapists. Could I have gotten on some secret list of people for therapists to avoid? I mean, my last therapist tried to check on me and I kinda ghosted him (which I'm not proud of) although it was because of my long-standing fear of texting. Or could it be because I'm not an ""urgent case?"" I always got responses back when I was suicidal. Or is it just because therapists are so slammed with requests for new therapy patients due to, well...2020?

I mean it's not like I'm not a physical danger to myself, but dang. I'm really struggling here. My fear of people and texting them has only increased and I feel awful for the amount of ghosting I've done to the people I love. I just don't feel like socializing in any capacity anymore. I've got a lot of sexuality-related issues too, the biggest one being that I'm a closeted lesbian in a homophobic family that will cut off my college tuition if they find out. There's my struggle with nihilism and general hatred of myself. Not to mention losing the faith I cherished for so long until last year...It feels like the death of a friend and the invalidation of my entire framework for life. There's my internet addiction, which is no joke. My leg getting crushed by a bus this February, which could've killed me and left me with some nasty scars. My ex-boyfriend who lied and cheated on me before breaking up with me last Christmas, even though he seemed like the nicest guy in the world.

tl;dr: I'm a mess. Please understand, I'm not posting for attention/sympathy points. I just feel kind of abandoned by the mental health system at a point in my life when I don't want to live or die. I just want to know what's going on, and what I can do to fix this.

35,"Herro! I am hoping this post gets somewhere because I couldn’t find my exact situation anywhere. and am hoping I can find at least one other human out there that has been in my shoes. (I hate that I need to say this but please don’t leave negative comments, I don’t need judgement at this time in my life)

I share a daughter with my ex who is still very much romantically and emotionally in my life, and while we love each other very much, I can’t seem to get over the fact that while he is currently in a relationship with someone who states they are okay with him being in an open relationship, both he (my child’s father) and I can’t help but feel as if he may be trapped because she is uncomfortable with the idea of him having me as a partner as she is of course afraid that he will leave her for me. I honestly do not want this at all. I know he is happy with both her and with me. But at this point, I only have one night a week with him away from our daughter and everyone else, as everything else with work and his personal life keeps him busy.

I suppose my issue here is how I can move out of feeling left out in this relationship where I’m not getting the attention I crave. I’m not 100% interested in leaving him, as he is my best friend and we go to each other for anything and everything. I just need advice on how to occupy my mind and not be so dependent on the physical aspect (I am very much a physically dependent person who deals with negative things in life with hugs and physical contact)

37,"About 5 years ago (I’m 23 now), I was in the best shape of my life, extremely outgoing, and was great at socializing.

After going through some tough experiences, I now feel like a shell of my older self. I’m anxious, depressed, a bit out of shape, and suffer from social anxiety.

I’ve started to go to therapy and got prescribed Lamictal, but I still feel the same. I’ve lost friends and feel like I’m not good enough for anything. I have an extremely toxic relationship with my mother, and do not have enough money to move out. She goes through my personal belongings and is very mentally abusive.

My sister just came to visit from LA, and we were having a family dinner. She started to trash on me for vaping (I mean everyone chooses their vices, but whatever), and tried to talk down to me. Before I knew it, my whole family was just trashing on me even though I’ve been trying to better myself. My dad made a comment about me getting married in the future, and my sister said “OP getting married? Ha yeah right”. My dating life hasn’t been that great lately either so that kind of hit hard. After sitting there for a bit after the subject changed, I just left and went up to my room since I’d rather be by myself than with them.

I miss being able to have fun and smile wide, have a feeling of easiness and that everything will be alright, and look forward to the future. It crushes me. I feel so old but I know that I’m young. Sometimes I just want to end it all if I’m being completely honest.",07Jul2020,1
39,"I'm (F) sick of how I manage my relationships. Even now, I'm using the word relationships but they're casual and not what I'd describe as relationships. If someone were to mention the word relationship or girlfriend, I panic and drop out before anything can get serious. I have no idea what's wrong with me. 

Logically I know I need to change. I occasionally feel jealous of my friend's relationships, I love romcoms and even write romance stories. Yet, I've never been on a date. I don't sleep around either, I just maintain FWB relationships and if they're ever developing into more, I end them before they can move forward. It was fine until I met someone (M) who I fell for hard. It was an instanteous connection that I could never write and he's perfect. 

I knew I was developing feelings for him, and I talked to him about how I didn't believe I was ready for a relationship and I liked him too much for a casual relationship. He'd told me that he'd no intention of being casual and wanted commitment from the start. Of course, I freaked and tried to shove him off. Being perfect, he said we'd take it easy and I'd be in love with him before long. It was funny when he said it, though he was right. I can't say it's that serious as I've never been in love, though I recognised how strongly I felt for him over the last five weeks.

I freaked out again and I ended it. I didn't tell him why, just said I wasn't ready yet and I needed to fix my life first. He said he understood and to look after myself first but he was heartbroken. 

 Ive spent the last two days in a state of devastation, crying and what I think is my first heartbreak of which I caused. I'm unsure if it's even because he's gone or because I've hurt him. I don't know why I'm like this or how to stop being this way.",07Jul2020,1

43,"So I'm in a tough position right now and I really really need some advice.

I'm turning 18 at the end of next month and because of personal stuff with my parents, it is top priority that I move out as soon as I'm an adult. They won't be helping me, but thankfully I have someone who is 21 who is going to instead and I'll be moving in with them. The problem is that we live 17 hours apart. My friend is planning on flying to me, staying the night, renting a car, then taking me, my cat, and my things where I'm moving.

All of this is important to get across that:

1) I need to make it as cheap as possible, but it is more important that I move out exactly when I need to, and I have the funds to pay for a rental but I also need things when I move.

2) Neither of us have rented a car before, and we have no idea what we're doing. I don't have the option to talk to my parents.

3) We are going to drive the 17 hours straight, switching off, so that we don't have to pay for a place to stay and so my friend doesn't have to take as much time off from work.

So it would be really helpful to know how to rent a car, where to start, and what places should we rent from, do we do it online, do we call, is it in person? How can I do this cheaply? When should we schedule to pick up the car and when should we drop it off? My best guess is to get it first thing in the morning and drop it off before 24 hours are over the next morning, I guess? It's possible and cheaper but is it smart?

46,"At work we were talking about restaurants that could open up and mentioned Chick-fil-A - this convo proceeded:

*Manager: But their food is good*

*Me: they’re homophobic”* 

*M: So?*

*Me: I don’t want to support business that hates my existence*

*M: Well I share the same beliefs as them so!* 

*Me: about homophobia?!*

She didn’t answer me after that and my break ended, so I had to leave to return to the front of the store. After that I was super uncomfortable and kinda depressed at work, as it’s not fun around someone who thinks your existence is “Bad”. 

Now, if she just said she enjoyed their food and wasn’t going to stop eating it I wouldn’t be upset - or is clarified she was a Christian and it was not the homophobic issue I would be fine. 

None or my other coworkers or managers are like this (One manager is actually a gay man himself) I’m out to my work and have been for awhile I haven’t had a issue until now. But now I’m feeling uncomfortable being around her. 

I guess what I’m asking is there something I can do? Like talk to my higher up manager to at least not be on the same shift as her? Was it too vague for anything to be done? Or would I be ignored and asked to deal with it...or even fired if I can’t work with her? Im not looking to get her fired or in trouble, I know I can’t anyway.

47,"Sorry for formatting, I’m on mobile (also a throwaway because duh). 

So a couple months ago I (23F) got a new seasonal job in another state. They provide the housing for as long as I’m working there - including the wifi, just because they have a lot of employees filtering in and out. 

I spent a while getting used to things, and after a few weeks of living there I started watching porn again. And not vanilla porn either. I am a woman as well, which makes it that much more embarrassing since people judge women much harsher for watching porn in general, let alone the more intense stuff. 

I made sure I was on incognito, and I didn’t even think of the fact that people have apps to track internet usage in different places. I realized that my employer can go in the wifi app and most likely see what IP addresses and things have been seen and clicked on (and searched oh god). I am completely mortified knowing that today at work I was asked if everything in the place was working okay, the stove, AC, etc.  (including the wifi). 

I feel so embarrassed knowing that my employer - and potentially other people at my work know what, when, and how much porn I’ve watched since being here. I don’t know what to do and I honestly want to bury my head and not go into work tomorrow. 

TL;DR watched porn on a (private) shared wifi and feel like my boss can see my IP address/history on his app, now I feel too embarrassed to go to work again

I also never had my BP that high when I was pregnant with my first child)  I mentioned it to my OB once’s she came in and she said that for me to be showing signs of pre-eclampsia my BP would have to be also higher like in the 160/100 range and that I’m probably just dehydrated.

I (27M) work in an another country away from home, i live alone with a non social person. Life has been hard ever since i moved in here due to multi cultural environment and maybe luck ? I met a girl online last year anonymously and we were friends for a long time until we developed a connection, the connection got stronger and stronger every day and we eventually got into a relationship. Since then things changed because men are from mars and women are from venus ? Good days were really good and bad were worst. Soon i discovered that her religious beliefs were different than mine and we could never get along unless i convert to hers or she converted to mine. We both had strong beleifs and faiths in our religion and neither would convert, but we didnt give up we are still the same lovey dovey and probably on a path to destruction?

We recently got into a fight and she like always disappeared, she'll probably reappear after a week hopefully, but i told my work colleague that my relationship was doomed because of different religion and her behavior has changed since. Shes also from the same country as me and we are good friends though there are personality clashes sometimes specially when we are working together but when we are not we are good friends. She started calling me multiple times a day and calls would go on for hours talking about useless stuff and gossips. She told me this twice today that 'a work colleague asked me that do you two have a thing to which I said hes like a brother to me' I also have this impression but some of her actions are really confusing.

Let me begin so I’m not ugly I’m a seven tops light skin, blond/brown braids, brown eyes..I kinda didn’t listen to the advice about highschool and dated upper class men. Anyway I’m top of class like part of the top ten out of the 200 people in my grade.During my 9th year I dated this guy who was two years older than me and he took my virginity. He also exposed a nude video of me that’s as 30 seconds long max. Unfortunately I was young and dumb, and he convinced me to send him a video of me masturbating. Anyway he’s a grade A asshole and sent it out after 6 months of being together. The whole school saw it and I felt ashamed not just bc of that but he was also cheating on me the whole time we were together and I was played like a fool. He told everyone I cheated on him which was a lie and it added fuel to the flames making more people want to share it. It went from our school to the schools all over the place.

from a young age he told us we weren’t allowed to complain- he hates people who complain and he “never” complains. (in reality he complains about everything, how difficult his job is, how the food is cold etc) so our house is pretty much falling apart because he doesn’t want us to complain (roof leaking, bathroom leaking, etc) and because he’d rather invest in a farm than in this house. i’ve had dental issues my whole life, due to bad genetics. i always get cavities that he tells me to ignore because he’s currently going through a rough patch at work. then the cavity gets really bad a couple of months later, i need a root canal, he gets angry because it’s so expensive and i should’ve ignored the pain and not complain. 
sometimes i need a ride back from school if my mom can’t drive me back. so i call him and he yells at me for not telling him in the morning (i usually find out i don’t have a ride home a couple of minutes before i call him). i go out with my friends 2-3 times a year and never have enough money because he refuses to give me money because restaurants are too expensive. i get 1/4 of the average allowance my friends get because he’s always going through a rough patch at work (but still eats in restaurants every day). i’m always broke it’s embarrassing. i went to a major i didn’t want because the one i wanted was too expensive (less than $300 difference) i can’t talk to him because we’re not allowed to complain or he’ll get mad and remind us of how difficult his work is and how much harder he works without complaining. of course, he has some good qualities, he occasionally makes us dinner,sends me credit occasionally, drives me to school in the morning if he’s in the country, pays for electricity, gas, our tuition (all parents pay for their kids tuition in my country). but i’ve always felt really guilty when i want something. on my birthday my friends got me a lot of presents and i was really happy and i showed my dad and he said “that’s really bad because now you have to get them presents which means i have to pay for these presents” he said it in a joking way although i’ve never asked him for money to get a present for one of my friends, i always save up for a really long time or ask my mom. if he hates us this much why is he still in our lives? most of the time he isn’t, i barely see him, but when he is it’s always like this",07Jul2020,1

I know it would be inappropriate to pursue flirtations so soon after a break up, I just hope someday we can try something together.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? How did it go? Thank you for reading.",07Jul2020,1

Im playing all the time and I dont have any self control so instead of doing work or improving myself, i play games.

I want a life and to meet new people and actually do something instead of it being simulated. Im hooked in my room and because i have nothing else to do i fall right back onto the screen until late at night.

71,"I was the cheater. When I did it, I didn't understand how severe the psychological repercussions were for the victim (feelings of disrespect, breach of trust, how it's a form of abuse, it's about power, etc.). I loved my ex very much and never wanted to hurt him, and I feel so disgusting that I did that to someone and that I caused someone so much pain and heartbreak and anger. I can't even imagine what the aftermath of being cheated on feels like, and I'm so ashamed and repulsed that I hurt him in so many deep ways.

73,"Here's some background: I am a highschooler, and I don't have much of anything going on. The only things I consistently do are watch anime and play videogames. 

Alright so here's the thing I need help with. I feel like I go through these phases all the time where I'm obsessed with some new hobby. 6 months ago I started to draw but lost interest. 4 months ago I started to learn volleyball but I lost interest. These are a few examples but it happens with other things too. Now, my sister and her friends are talking about starting a band and they want me to be their bassist. So, I started investing time into researching bass playing, and going to music stores to look at buying one. I'm really excited and I'm getting the money together. But now I'm starting to wonder if this is just going to be a phase like everything else, and if I'll quickly lose interest.

Now I have real friends, and my social life has gotten a bit better but I still struggle with what's accepted socially.

In a week and a half, we're going to go to watch a film together; it's going to be a small outdoor screening. My question is: should I follow through on my promise and bring them brownies?

76,"So, for context, we are both M19. We have known each other for three years, and have become great friends in that time. We started off doing theatre together, and around 6 months ago, we started working very closely together at the same place. I always thought of him just as a friend, but something clicked in me last August and I have wanted to be with him ever since.

The entire time while we have known each other, he has been dating the same guy. It’s the only guy he has ever been with, and he plans on marrying him. His boyfriend is awesome, he’s super nice and they definitely deserve each other, but I can’t help feeling bitter about their relationship. They have gotten to the point where the relationship isn’t fresh, he gets annoyed with him, but he still loves him. 

In the past, he has had guys try to go after him and intrude on his relationship, and I’ve always been here to support him through those tough times. Two in particular were extremely bad, being super clingy and manipulative, and even going to the extent of telling him that “if you hadn’t talked to me last night, I would’ve killed myself”. I know how upset it makes him, and I feel so guilty putting that kind of burden on him. 

I feel like he has been sending me mixed signals off and on in the past year. He told one of our close friend that he would be interested in dating me, and he will flirt with me for a period of time, but then back off for a while after that. He made a comment to me about how he “wanted to be responsible” after I laid down between him and our other friend to sleep. I had no intention of making him uncomfortable, and it made me rethink my approach to our friendship entirely. 

That was a few months ago, and I had stopped any even vague flirtation with him, but over the past weekend, he started sending me the mixed signals again. He would cuddle with me, and slept next to me. When we went to the lake for the fourth, he volunteered to spray me with sunscreen, which is generally very out of character for him, especially considering I was fully shirtless. There are also other examples, but generally, something just felt different. 

I don’t know if it’s all in my head, or if he’s just conflicted, or what. I’m just scared to approach him about the situation considering his track history. I’m open to and would appreciate any advice y’all would like to give.",07Jul2020,1

Anyways. She has lowered my shifts to 3 hrs a week. She obviously is pushing me out of my job and wants me to quit. The same thing happened to my partner. 

The obvious thing to do would be to quit right? Well ive never quit a job before so thats intimidating and Im going away on holidays in August. Im only making $40 a shift.. so im really trying to save money for my holiday.

If I quit now I wont have time to get a job but it is also far away enough that my parents would be upset that I dont have a job. Also im looking into youth allowance so id be jobless and on welfare.. dad would really not like that.

After  quarantine i stopped thinking about her and she became my ex crush . I didn’t talk to her until last month “June” and she replied. I told her I had a crush on her and asked a few questions and she replied telling me she she knew, answered my questions and gave me her snap. and we chatted once on snap but that’s so she could know who I am  since I  could be anyone.

83,"Due to the pandemic going on, me and my mother have been struggling with money. Pretty normal situation really, but in the end I didn't want to be a burden for more than is invited and have come here to request some advice on how to conquer or help diminishing my fears.

A little backstory here: 

I'm a 20yo boyo that has worked from the point where education was no longer obligatory (till my 12° year of school, Portugal). Since that point, I turned myself to help my mom (50's) with rent, food, necessities and etc around our place. She, singlehandedly, took care of me without making me fear for anything. So I took upon me to take a few years, before going to university, to help her ease off with her 16 hour job routine to keep the house running as usual. 
From 2017 to 2019 I kept my work up and money flowing into the house, making my mom lower her 16 hour job routine, into a 8 hour job routine.

Come forth this blast of a year, 2020.
I have since January, been laid off. My mom has been taking care of the house alone again and for 5/6 months, I have been doing nothing but stay at the home and send curriculums to any place still operation. 

Due to having not much of any luck finding a new job I have then accepted a proposition from my uncle to come to the rural part of the country and just help on the farm companies around the area where he lives. Hence leaving my mom for the first time alone but with the promises that I would get working and make as much money as possible before getting work back in the city and that I would use this time to take my drivers license (me and my mom are scared beyond comprehension of cars but have noticed the need to).

The reason why I have come here:
Since I lived my whole life in the safety of my home in the middle of the city, I have never faced many bugs. I fenced off with the ocasional mosquito or small spider of course, but since I got at my uncle's place I have realised a few things.

1 - I have never seen a spider bigger than a coin
2 - This place is filled with spiders and cobwebs
3 - All of them are bigger than coins

This is not the main problem really but a big part of it. Some other problems are that this is the south of my country, and even during the night I'm dealing with temperatures nearing the 40°C where normally In where I used to live, even during the day the max we would get was 25°C. My uncle isn't the most hygienic person in the world really but ain't that bad, I'm focusing on what I'm used to of course, I'm kinda of a clean freak. Being eaten alive by various types of bugs, not only spiders.
To be fair, these other issues (heat and hygiene), aren't that bad. I found an old dusty fan that I cleaned and boom, no more heat and on the hygiene I simply clean what I see and my uncle is actually happy and helping out with cleaning now.

To end this sorry excuse for a such a long post:
Can anybody provide some advise on what could help put my mind at ease with this very expecific problem? Any advice is welcome.


TL;DR:
""Pre-teen leaves home in the city to go to rural area where there is monetary compensation for work in a hurry and now has to fend off with his newly found fear of bugs""

I'm on my first week here and will be reading any advice posted for the next upcoming week!

Kind regards,",07Jul2020,2
84,"What are som ways to get over that you just got friendzoned and still friends with the guy ? 
Its a really hard situation cus he and i are really good friends. 

We are that kind of friends that are talking about everything , day as night and everything on earth. Its not worth loosing him as a friend only cus he dont feel the same. 

But my question is, how do u get over the crush/like feelings? 

Cus sometimes its really eating me up that he knows that i like him and also that sometimes when we talk he is sending me thousands of mixed signals. 

Sometimes it gets flirtatious but it can just be me reading the situations wrong and that he is just trying to be friendly/joke/be nice..

Lately ive been feeling shit over the situations and seeing him with other girls have made my mind go poop. 

I feel very confused over this situation, cus i wanna get over this crush feeling and same time have him still as a good friend. Its just very hard to accept. 

But any thoughts / solutions to get overthose crush feelings would be nice and to keep him as friend as option would be nice to hear your tip and experiences.

85,"Feels like a crossroads moment in my life. I need to decide if I’m dedicating myself more to this relationship. I don’t think this is relationship advice but more personal advice.

\---

I’ve dated my gf for almost 9 years now. She’s my high school sweetheart. I’m 25 She’s 24. We went to college together. We lived together since my senior year of college. We now live on our own. We were each other’s firsts.

She’s great in a lot of areas. We have a ton in common given that we grew up together. We've been through thick and thin. I’ve never had money she stuck with me. I only have two big resentments towards her, 1st: she had vaginismus and I stayed with her for the first 4 yrs even though she took very little initiative to solve her problem. (asides from token behavior) I eventually broke up with her out of frustration. A month later she was able to have sex when we hooked up, it happened. I've almost completely let go this within me. 2nd: last Xmas she had a huge crush on a coworker and said a ton of nasty shit to me about how I’m not attractive and no fun etc. I don’t think she cheated. She since then has come a lot around, being a lot more supportive, but I never trusted her a lot since that emotional affair. I should mention that I was planning to propose to her before this, I was starting to look up rings and by this time we would’ve been engaged, most likely. I was feeling like shit because my job fucking sucked, was feeling generally very off, very anxious/down for months before.

We always shared everything regarding money. Since last Xmas, I don’t feel okay sharing money with her. I don’t say I love you, haven't said it in like 7 months. I’ve begun improving myself. I never was too shabby but now I’m a lot better since that last incident, a great job that pays a ton, working out, better eye on style, improving my hobby life, basically I feel fucking great with myself. The best I’ve ever felt. Last year we had a pregnancy scare and while not wanting kids then I felt that I would be really happy seeing a person made from me and her. 2 months ago we had another really minor scare and it sunk on me ""I don’t want a kid with her"" at least for now. I want to be a father, however.

Sexually it's not what I want. The sex isn’t bad, it’s good. I feel shallow for feeling this in a way but I want to experience BDSM, ONSs, perhaps even ddlg, who knows, all kinds of shit, or even casual relationships aka serial monogamy. Sadly, she’s not into any of that “non-vanilla” stuff. I’ve tried mentioning, poked around the issue a few times. Like at all, she never masturbates for herself even if she’s alone for weeks. She’s just barely into sex. She knows what I want, but we don’t talk about it much. When I do talk about it the conservation is shut down as politely and quickly as possible. Mentioning sex casually is a very hard topic for her, she’s very uncomfortable. We never discuss sex. She enjoys it with me, cums every single time, as I do, when we get together. But she never wants to have “pillow talk”, you know what I mean? At most, I’d say I really liked X or Y and she’s like “thanks” and seems to change/drop the subject. It's always me initiating a conversation about sex, even about her likes/dislikes, I gotta pry it off of her. I’m a very sexual person, always have been, I feel like I can get sex elsewhere if I want to but never strayed from this relationship even though I felt frustrated for years. I want to fuck other girls bad and basically get freaky. I know it sounds shallow to trade a good LTR for hedonistic shit but I feel this every day. Her body is not my type at all, but I do find her very pretty. I do feel less attracted to her as time passes, and I am more attracted visually to basically every girl my age. She has nothing wrong with her, but I do feel these things, this lust for other stuff and can’t help but feel resentful in a weird way, at myself. Which isn’t even her fault, at all.

I am now at another crossroads moment in this relationship. Given the current logistics of living together/job, I need to choose firmly what I want. I do want kids someday, to live somewhere in a village as does she, we are somewhat similar in LTR/Marriage goals. I feel guilty as fuck for feeling all this shit inside me. In a way, I basically want to whore out and live for myself. But I also want true values in my LTR as well. I’m so conflicted. I feel bad if I leave her since I care a fuckton about her. I’ve grown into the role of protecting this person. She feels more like family than most of my family. Everything we’ve been through I’ve supported her and vice-versa. I don’t think I will ever find someone who's that close to me. I am a part of her family, we get along great, they consider me a part of the family in a way, her aunt even said that to me directly and they are all great. Should I mention this is not a Madonna-Whore complex? I thought it was for a while, but now I don’t. I don’t look at girls in that dichotomy, but of course, some only fall into one category but most fall into both.

But I don’t feel much passion for her, and she notices this. This last month things are going quite well, but the last three before this were total chaos. We had huge fights often and she threatened to leave. She even went back to her mom’s for a weekend. She kept attacking me, saying I’m X or Y and I kept brushing it off and not responding until I couldn’t take more and truly said that if attacked me once more I’d leave for good. She pretty much stopped after that. But, I feel she’s great though. I’m building trust again since that emotional affair of hers. But yeah, I don’t fully trust her completely, she currently doesn’t even know my finances now, whereas 6mo ago we’d share everything. I’ve never felt truly sexually complete with her, she kinda knows this and it hurts her. Now she’s not perfect, she starts a ton of stupid fights and is very petty. But she’s also a very sweet and caring person overall and doesn’t wish bad upon no one and I’ll always care for her.

Basically, I’m torn as hell.",07Jul2020,1

This shit SUCKS. I'm 14, supposed to be fucking energetic and able to learn, but nope, I'm tired and fucking stupid. Don't get it. I live a good ass life, used to be the smartest kid in my class, but now I have to reread something like 30 times before I get it. It's like I'm constantly on autopilot. I'm convinced I'm gonna die or something. Everything feels weird. Everything IS weird. I'm constantly thinking about so many things, but I'm too dumb to understand them. I once qualified for gifted, why am I suddenly so damn stupid? It's like my IQ dropped 50 points. Maybe it's just part of growing up? I wouldn't know, never done it before. Don't wanna tell my mom, because she'll try and take me to a doctor or put me on meds again. Big NOPE. I think it's a phase, honestly. Kids my age are literally known for dumb, edgy shit like this. ""bRaIN fEeL dUmB aNd wAnT tO sHoOt HeAd."" Like I said, this is most definitely a phase, but how do I get over it? I **REALLY** don't wanna be one of those awful, horrible little fucks who are constantly talking about how they're so sad and shit. I have no reason to be sad. Decent family who makes a good amount of money, good sources of entertainment and education, live in a nice area, have access to a somewhat okay school. I feel like I'm the problem. Too ungrateful and bratty to just be happy with what I have, so I get all sad for no reason. Oh, boo hoo, you're dumb. Oh no, your mom yelled at you. I have responsibilities like every other person, it's the end of the world. Fucking retarded. I'm a lazy fuck who needs to learn to suck it up and actually do shit. I'm pretty sure I'm getting stupid because I don't do school. My attention span, which was already total trash, has lessened because I don't actually use it. I feel like trash because I don't exercise and lay in bed all day. I have just the right traits to make an awful person. Lazy, dumb, ugly, ungrateful, bratty. All that shit. Can't fix it either, don't know how. Each day I tell myself, ""I'll be nicer tomorrow. I'll get out of the house and do something."" But, surprise, I never carry any of it out. So, will I grow out of this, or will I become more of an asshole if I don't suck it up and do something about it? It's gotten to the point when I legitimately get pissed at people who are happy and just doing their thing. I'm an asshole and I hate it. Everything I say is either a failed attempt at a joke or some rude comment. Oh, and don't get me started on how fucking irresponsible and lazy I am. I have 24 days to finish school, started in March. I should've been done in, like, May. But, nope, my monkey brain decided to put everything off until the last minute. Now I'm most likely not going to be able to register for school next year because I didn't fucking finish this year. A week of summer if I do, perfect. Fucking sucks.

97,"I’m lost

This is gonna just be about everything I’ve been through for the past couple of months.

So I met this girl and I instantly fell in love. She was my first love and I was 17. We have been through so much and we have gotten so close. She was the first person I have ever done anything with. She was the first person I felt comfort from. I felt like I could be myself with her. Recently on may 31st we broke up. It absolutely killed me. My mental health has gone rock bottom and I don’t know what to do. I love this girl so much and I care about her so much and it ended up to us getting hurt and we did so many things wrong. I just don’t know what to do cause I still love her and I want to be with her and I want to work through out problems. I’d do anything to go back and redo everything I did wrong just to be with her again. She genuinely loved me for me. She didn’t care about money or my flaws. She is so kind hearted and caring. Her personality is to die for. It just hurts so much cause I think she is better off without me. She will find someone better than me. Yeah these are typical break of thoughts, but I really do still love her and I’ve never stopped loving her. Even after we broke up she took her time to make sure I was okay and let me know she still loves me and cares about me even after I hurt her. I was loyal to her and I did everything In my power to make sure she was happy. While quarantined my mother would not let me go out at all. My grandpa a cancer survivor and grandma a diabetic lives with us so it was impossible to get out. I even wanted to plan to sneak out one night so I could see her. I cried every single night cause I missed her so much and I know she did too. I am just so in love with this girl and I don’t know how else to put it. I can’t move on from her. I distract myself and I am working on bettering myself for college. Religion is a huge part of my life now and it comforts me. It’s always when I am alone and I just start to think about her. Every memory we made. Ever night I try to sleep but I can’t cause I feel like I’m missing something. I feel like I’m forgetting something. It’s tell her I love her and I hope she sleeps well and I’m excited to see her the next time we hangout. I hug my pillow to sleep cause it reminds me of her and it brings me comfort. All I can do now is pray and trust Gods words and let him do what’s best for me. I just can let go of her she saved my life. She changed me into someone so much better than I used to be and I just want to show her I love her and I start a life with her.",07Jul2020,1

” yo (this is mostly for the girls) but would anyone be maybe interested in starting a club at *school name* to help support other girls and inform about period stuff etc”
Now I am no way against females talking about these ideas, but  I feel like a club for it would just seem weird and she would be mocked. I also feel like the club won't work, so she might get upset and she would be the type of person to call my school ”misogynist” wouldn't work.

103,"Some background: I have only worked jobs where every half year or lateral position change I got a raise. That being said, I have gotten quite a few.

My question would be, what is the best time to ask for a raise *now*? (I emphasize the *now* because of COVID.) I have worked at a small family business for almost a year now - a year in August - and its been great. Starting pay was fine, my benefits kicked in, and all was going well. I thought about asking about a raise around a half year in, but I came across some advice to wait a year. Now that the time is coming around, I’m wondering if it’s even a good idea. I’m worried that I may get shut down because of the situation at hand. But I also am not sure as my girlfriend which is in a similar situation has gotten 3 witching her first year.

104,"Firstly, if anyone knows a better, or any other subreddits to post this in, PLEASE TELL ME LOL. 

Anyways, we are beyond pissed off. My girl and her friend are both feeling guilty, ashamed and on edge. At the moment, they are attempting to file a police report. I will update this post as needed. 

We will refer to my girl's friend as Kayla.

I also was at this party 2 nights ago. I was tired so I left at around 1 A.M. My girl stayed the night there because she was pretty drunk and just wanted to sleep, plus she hadn't seen Kayla in a while. Also, this party was at this friend's house. My girl went to sleep in Kayla's bed and that was the last I heard from her that night. There were maybe 10 people there total, all around our age, mostly males. Probably 3 or 4 girls including the ones mentioned in the title, and 6 or 7 guys.

I learned yesterday from my girl that sometime in the early morning after this party, she woke up to one of the males who stayed the night. He was in my girl's friend's bed right next to her, trying to put his hand down her pants. My girl was still half asleep and half drunk from the night before when this happened. He gave up after a failed attempt at God knows what, and then went outside to the front porch where Kayla was hanging out smoking. 

He then tried similar shit on Kayla, rubbing her feet, caressing her thigh, and eventually tried the same hand down the pants move on her. All the while, she kept telling him no but he didn't want to hear it. He eventually did give up. My girl and Kayla both woke up with bruises. 

We don't know a whole lot about him (23?m), but we know what car he drives, the town he lives in, where he works (local smoke shop) and that he smokes and sells weed. Do with that info as you will. 

Any advice dealing with revenge, pettiness, or anything helpful is so gratefully appreciated. We are so fed up and just crave justice. Thank you for reading. 

TL/DR: My girl, her friend and I need justice for the guy who sexually assaulted both of them at a party a couple nights ago. What we know about him is 2 ""paragraphs"" above ^^ it's not much but it's all we have.",07Jul2020,2
105,"I, (16) have two lovely little cousins aged 9 (almost 10) and 8. Since I was born I have always overreacted to little things, especially if it has to do with a family member I care about. I consider myself partially responsible for the raising of my cousins because my family has given them loads of money and helped their mother (my aunt) while she was struggling. I’m reaching out to Reddit today for advice because although my aunt has always been a questionable parent (letting her kids stay up til midnight and watching movies too old for them), I have recently become worried for their safety. 

There are many words to describe my aunt such as caring, lovely, and homely. However she was an alcoholic and drug user in her 20s and is not always self aware. She is no longer using or drinking but it’s something to think about. 

Some things that have happened to my cousins in the past year and a half: they have been bitten by wild dogs in the woods, had a bus crash into their treehouse that would’ve killed them if they were in it, have developed a cough for a brief period of time because of a mold problem, and have gotten cosmetic  surgery (the 9 year old).

Legal action by law enforcement took place when the treehouse incident happened as it was not built
properly and was too close to the road.

Also, my grandparents have no money. My grandfathers pension was robbed in his 50s and he received no compensation. My aunts husband became unemployed for three years and my grandparents gave the family thousands of dollars to help keep them on their feet.

My uncle is now employed with a good job and of course my grandparents have not asked for some money, but instead of paying back a fraction of what they gave her during that time of need my aunt took the kids to Disney, got two dogs, and a pool.

I feel the need to add that the dog is overweight. Not groomed. And is not expected to live to the age of five because of malnourishment.

My own parents struggled with anxiety their whole lives and I once went out of my way to pick up a pamphlet on legal action for children and child protection laws at a government office one day. I know that may seem drastic, but I did it right after my cousin was bitten by a wild dog for the third time and went to the ER. Probably nothing would’ve come out of me reading that pamphlet anyway. However my mother found it and got scared I would “rip apart the family” and denied everything we have ever talked about when it came to them and called me delusional. I know she was lying as she doesn’t want her sister to spiral back to drugs if someone were to talk to or take the kids. I genuinely did feel awful about the incident and dropped it for a while.

I don’t know what has recently happened to provoke this but I had a dream about the time that my cousin almost drowned when she was three. I got mad and now I’m here. I don’t know what to do. Maybe I’m overreacting about the whole thing because I myself have been very blessed and I’m not adjusting to their rustic lifestyle... however if I were to do something extreme it would destroy the family as well as my own relationship with my mother. I’m looking for advice please I’m out of options.

Ps. I know this was long but I’ve been holding it in for awhile.",07Jul2020,1
106,My job only allows so much paid time off to roll over every year. I had two long trips planned this year that have been canceled.

107,"Went to the car shop a month ago for an oil change the morning I was to hit the road on a long cross-country trip. I asked the service rep to let me know if there was anything I should fix before traveling so much, and he reported my brakes were ""in the red"" and would take several hours to fix. Hope to stick to my driving plans, I worriedly asked if it would be safe enough to travel to my destination and then have the brakes repaired while I was away. He went off and returned saying they would be fine for now, but to have them repaired the next time I came in, which I vowed I would.

I took my 3000-mile trip and am now about to hit the road again for even longer, so I went back about a week ago to have them top off the oil and to get the brakes taken care of. By chance I was served by the same service rep and reminded him of his advice to me from weeks before. I might be reading into it but he seemed nervous about realizing I was there specifically to have work done on my brakes on his own advice. Instead of nodding his head and putting ""new brakes"" on the work order when I asked for them, he said ""Yeah, we can look at the brakes again, if we need to change the brakes I'll let you know."" And guess what? ""You're all good,"" he said! ""You sure???"" ""Yep. I'll ring you up."" All I got was that oil change.

I felt weird about it but left the premises before I could think through the issues it brings up. Now I'm confused. I'm guessing I've been lied to at some point, but I'm not sure what the lie is. Is it:

1. I never needed new brakes and for some reason he couldn't repeat the lie the second time? Or,
2. I do need new brakes and this guy won't give them to me?

What should I do? Call the shop and explain to a supervisor? Get the brakes checked by someone else before I start my trip this Thurs? Please advise.",07Jul2020,1

110,"About a year ago I was finishing up a job at a major automotive company where I oversaw contractors making facility changes. It's a stressful environment and long story short: my mentor, whom I respected highly, got into an argument on the plant floor and I threw my badge at him because he was walking away instead of resolving the problem. Badge ended up hitting him in the face from 15 feet away. Contract terminated. I did a very good job with the high profile job at hand and was complimented many times. I thought I was on a solid track to be hired but we had this argument and it ended. It's been a year and the same job was posted online. My boss at the time has moved on to another assignment elsewhere and my mentor is still at the same location. The job wasn't my dream job but I was really good at it and it paid 30 percent more with some additional hours and weekends and holidays. I am not sure that they filed a report, I think they just ended the contract. It was about at the end of the job so my boss just said it was the end of the job.

114,"So I used to be super close with these two friends of mine. One I have basically known since birth and the other I became friends with in school and then all three of us would hang out when we could. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, the friend that I knew the longest started to drift away after high school when we both started college. And this really affected me because that was when I got diagnosed with a panic disorder at the time and had panic attacks every other day for a month. I had to come home from college and had to go through lots and lots of crappy days. And I didn’t want to talk to her at first, because I tried to a while ago but she kept getting distracted over the phone, so I thought: well, forget it. And didn’t hear from her until I had been home for a while. We talked a little bit I was still pissed about earlier and didn’t want to talk. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then all of a sudden we went for months without talking or texting. 

&amp;#x200B;

I got better and returned to college but never really moved on. And I didn’t know how because I thought, even though I was mad, that were like made to be friends. So it felt like I was loosing a part of myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

And one day, after not seeing her for a very long time, we ended up meeting up. This was kinda by arranged by my other friend I spoke of earlier.   And then when we met up, I pretended like nothing had changed and joked about things, and after about a 3 min conversation, she said she had to go with another friend to do “something”. And then as we parted way, I was walking with my other friend and I just broke down. I tried to collect myself but I couldn’t stop crying. We went up to her hotel room she was at and she talked with me about her issues with our friend, and I collected myself there. I ended up seeing her at the event with only that other friend. She never once came up to talk to me. I only talked with her again to say goodbye and that’s the last time I’ve seen her since. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, there was a time several months back when she reached out to me on the phone and asked how I was doing and I wanted to discuss how I felt earlier, but we got cut off (even though she said she had a long drive ahead of her so-it felt like she just wanted to not talk about it). And the last I heard from her was recently actually. When my other friend tagged me in something and my ex-best friend commented on it. Looking back, I wonder if she just didn’t realize it was forwarded to me. But I tried to start a conversation with her and it died rather quickly. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then on my actual birthday, I was kinda hoped to get a “happy birthday” since the thing she commented on was actually RELATED to my birthday. But I heard nothing. So, I decided to creep on her profile to see if she was even online that day posting stuff and-she was. She posted like 7 things. And to top it off, she decided to share with my other close friend (the one who helped me at the hotel) that they have been friends for ten years. And THAT. Was the cherry on top of everything. It just felt like a smack in the face. 

&amp;#x200B;

And this isn’t the first time she hasn’t told me happy birthday, but I thought, well, maybe since you reached out twice? But no. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I don’t know, I feel like I’m stuck in the middle of this weird friendship. It’s like I’m this parasite between them. Because when I’ll talk to my ex-close friend and ask her if she’s talked to my ex-best friend, she’ll go: “Oh yeah! Just messaged her 5 mins ago!” And it’s the same the other way around. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know this is really long, so I appreciate if you’re still reading this, but it’s just hard.

119,"I am really frustrated and at this point I honestly don’t know what to do. This is long, and I’m on mobile. Please bare with me. 

I moved to an historic apartment building in a fun part of town a year go and have had so many issues since since day one. I was currently in a 15th month lease with it ending in September. 

Issues I’ve run into are half the neighborhood’s fault and half the building/ people who live here. Examples, my loft leaks and floods every time it rains, and maintenance does nothing. My A/C went out and it took them 2 weeks to finally fix it. In May, in Texas. Tenants let their dogs pee and poop in the building or just leave their doors open for the animals to wander. 

Current problem. In May, I was trying to use the gym in my building and the blinds were broken open.  homeless people were openly staring/ trying to get in etc when I called the community manager to try to get this fixed ASAP. On this call, she told me there was another gym that was by their office in a separate building that she could show me. I drove over to check it out, and told her some of my frustrations with living here and how I was going to move the second my lease is up. This was on 28 May. 

I received an email two weeks later from my office that a bigger, better loft would be opening up in late July for less than I was paying now and asked if I was interested. I jumped on it and was signing papers less than 2 days later. 

Here’s the fun. In the original email, I was quoted $1202 per month. When signing papers, I noticed it was a base rent of $1215 plus $20 for pet rent (silly me I forgot), $25 for valet trash (I don’t pay this in my current building) and $35 for carport parking (again I don’t pay this at my currently building and I park in the same type of carport parking as the new building). That hiked up this awesome deal a bit. Spoke to the leasing agent, asked why I went from $1202 to $1215 and why the other fees weren’t mentioned and she said “prices change daily” and that was it. I thought this was kinda crappy so I went down to the office and they honored the original base price in the original email. Okay? Now here we go. 

I found out that in this new historic building in which I am to move to the top and 3rd floor, and there is only a freight elevator. I have a German/ rottie who’s back legs and hips are bad and absolutely can’t do stairs. Never once was I told I would not have the use of a elevator nor did I even think to ask. There is a sign that states that no one is to use it under any circumstances. I passed this accidentally when walking out of the gym the wrong way. 

Called the office and was told I could maybe use the elevator to move but absolutely not on a daily basis. I was also told that the community manager told me about the elevator during the gym visit.... this didn’t happen. Why would I have been told about an elevator in a building that I didn’t need to use as I don’t live there. Anyway. My move in date was 23 July, and my last day in my current is 25 July. The leasing agent is offering to put me in another building but I’ll still be dealing with the bs I deal with here. 

I’m trying not to freak out but any and all advice is welcome. I know these are first world problems. I just feel the office should have been forthcoming in all the communication prior.",07Jul2020,1

to give you a bit of context, I started looking for a job around 2 weeks ago. I applied at different stores, among them, home goods. I went on a interview with them, at first the manager said he would contact me via email either on Sunday or Monday (my interview was on a Saturday) 

Those days passed and I didn’t receive any email, I was kind of bummed but moved on to other interviews nonetheless. On wednesday I received an email saying that he had not forgotten about me and planned on contacting me on Friday.

He called, and although I wasn’t able to return the call that same day, I called first thing the next day and he told me that it was ok and that he was going to send me some emails regarding paperwork I needed to do and my background check. Two days passed and I didn’t receive anything, I called today and he was somewhat... surprised that I didn’t receive the email (Which I haven’t, it only added to my anxiety) he said he was busy at the moment with orientation, but it would take like an hour. He apologized and the call ended.

I haven’t received anything and I’m starting to get even more frustrated.

125,"So after dinner I went to lay down in the living room and my middle brother had asked me to help him wipe a pot down for him. I went over to grab the pan and wiped it down. Whilst wiping the pot down I mumbled how I felt that it was unnecessary for my middle brother to call me over to wipe a pot down since he could've done it himself. My oldest brother heard me mumble and he felt that it was very rude of me to mumble my displeasure (which I do admit, is rude), and said ""what did you say?"" ""why are you mumbling?"", while raising his voice, he continues to become more and more aggressive since my response was simply, ""It's nothing, don't worry about it, I'm already doing it"". Then I called him out for having a superiority complex. But instead of retaliating he brushed it off.

A few minutes after I finished helping out, I was on my phone in an area where it would be seen as me ""hiding"", but it was just my ADHD brain getting lost in my phone after looking something up on google. While lost in my phone, my older brother calls out to me, ""Why are you **hiding** using your phone? You don't have to hide using it"".  I felt quite annoyed since I wasn't intentionally hiding my phone, rather he just called me out for his own assumption. I say to him ""Why are you assuming I was hiding using my phone?"" and I question his reasoning for getting so angry at this situation since he started raising his voice and gave himself a false sense of power as he began to approach me with a puffed chest. He justifies his anger because I ""talked back"" and starts to show more aggression. He then goes to explain to my mom that he's not the one being unreasonable, rather it is me. Making me look like an idiot.

Without purposely being disrespectful (as I didn't realize that I was being disrespectful), I had overly expressive facial expressions while I was given little chance to speak since he would use his loud and aggressive voice to suppress what I had to say. This, and my older brother explaining to my mother how I was being unreasonable was his only means of handling this situation. He pushes me violently due to him not knowing how to control himself, causing my mother to become involved in stopping him from trying to release his aggression towards me. I had trouble taking all of this seriously as I found the reasoning of his anger very unnecessary since he would resort to hitting me and raising his voice.

132,"So i bought a 3 bedroom small condo and i rented a room to my buddy (john) and his cousin (suzi) who grew up in the same area as me and were my best friends my whole life. We have been living together over a year now and over the course of a year john my best friend has changed, he is no longer fun to be around he complains, nothing is ever his fault. He throws his food on top of mine, or shove mine in the back, hes just a careless piece of shit now with no one else on his mind but himself and its just becoming too much. Suzi always complains about stuff that is johns fault to me and expects me to do something about it every time and its becoming too much. She constantly has her boyfriend over and all they do is yell and scream. Now i will admit i am guilty of letting them walk on me, i am pretty chill for a roomate and a landlord at that i am also not very good at saying no or speaking up a out things i care about or want done. I have a very bad habit of just letting things slide to avoid confrontation. I dont ask for much as long as rent is paid. I just feel like my house has been taken over and i have no say in anything or they make me out to be the asshole every time. They do help me out with cost of living a lot and i save lots of money but im just not happy coming home anymore. I feel like this isn’t my home and they have no respect for me or my possessions. I dont know how i feel about kicking them out, their lease is up now and they are paying month by month, i haven’t requested them to sign a new lease yet because i am debating if i should kick them out and live alone for awhile or if i should just keep having them here because of the income. I would be able to afford the place on my own but i would not have much money left over if i booted them.

As far as seeing people I love be beat on, having to buy a gun at 16 to protect my family, being in shootouts, etc. Every time I leave the house to hang out with friends I feel like something bad is gonna happen, I’m always looking over my shoulder and I often cancel plans if there’s going to be people there whom I don’t know. I also have a hard time dating because every girl I meet happens to be friends or in some way associate with people I’ve previously had altercations with. The city I’m from isn’t very big. I got kind of popular and not in a good way being a kid who went from school to school because I was either homeless or evicted from where I lived every 3-4 years. I associated with a lot of people and also made a lot of enemies. I finally got out of the city I lived in but I often go back to hang out with my lifelong friends. I also managed to ghost the gang I was a part of. I completely flipped my life. I plan to go into either EMS or Law enforcement. Because I was lucky enough to not have a record. I felt that was the universes way of telling me to straighten up. I was given many chances to succeed and I finally picked up on it. The only issue is my past still haunts me. I can’t afford therapy right now. So I’m stuck dealing with it on my own. I just want to know what I can do to not be so paranoid and looking over my shoulder all the time.

135,"So I (23M) am gay. I just graduated college a year ago. 

I hooked up with quite a few guys in college. It never got to penetration. The only thing I would do is make out with them and give BJ's. These were usually mutual. 

One time I matched with this guy on Tinder and he came over to my room. He was kind of shy and awkward, but really nice and I found him cute. I don't remember what happened fully. I know we made out and started taking clothes off, and we both got off. I gave him a BJ, I can't remember if he gave me one or not.

After we both finished he seemed really excited and said ""I didn't expect that!"" meaning my BJ. I didn't think much of it, and we went to get food after. He wasn't really my type personality wise, and I think he wanted something more, so after that I told him I just wanted to hook up mostly and didn't want anything serous. From what I remember, he was disappointed but we left on good terms. he still follows me and likes my pictures to this day. 

Another time, this guy messaged me on Grindr and asked if I wanted to make out. I went to his room and we did just that. When it got to below the belt stuff, he wasn't getting hard. He then said that he wasn't really over his ex and didn't want to do any more of that, but that I could get off. So we continued making out, I got off, he didn't, and I left.

Recently I've been seeing posts on social media about unwanted kissing and doing nothing without explicit consent. I don't know about anyone else, but all of my sexual experiences have not included explicit consent, and it is assumed that what I described will happen. Makeout, BJ. That's how I operated until I got comfortable with more. 

I resonated with stories about groping or unwanted kissing, etc. because I've been in that position and felt kinda icky afterwards. I've never been assaulted to be clear, and I never said no any of these times, but I was also never asked if I wanted to.

Which brings me to my question: Should I feel guilty about giving the guy a BJ without asking? He didn't object and seemed quite happy afterwards (I think it was the first time he had ever gotten one) but I still feel terrible and the guilt has been eating me up. He seemed surprised it had happened, which confused me because that had always been my experience and I had never been asked either. And should I feel bad about not leaving the other time, with the guy who probably just wanted to be alone and deal with the feelings about his ex? Obviously I could have had better communication with them both, which I'm realizing now. But did I do something morally wrong? Should I apologize to them? Is it a crime? I absolutely want to hold myself accountable for what I did, but I am unsure if it is just bad communication during sexy time, if this type of thing has happened to other people, or something more serious.",07Jul2020,1

Asked if there was anyone who could pickup the yarn, but says they are all located in the same location being 3 hours away. She gave me an address to send the yarn and I was able to confirm that the address is the same on the church site.

I like all genders and I appreciate a good looking person when I see it, but that is not what I seek. I like vibrations of connection yet gravitate towards men more due to the fear of my family's judgment. I am female. I also like the idea of two partners but keeping it exclusive between us. However with the idea of a ""thruple"" I have no interest of a man at this point, but I suppose it can be.- driven by fear of pregnancy I giess.

I tried to come out to my dad and stepmom few years back and they laughed and mocked me. (Told them I was bi) they told me that it was another way to say slut and didnt believe me. I never did introduce them to my girlfriend at the time and caused issues in our relationship. Being bi or pan doesn't feel fitting enough I guess. But I honestly do have a hard time with lables. 

Side note: I also have a hard time with the term coming out as it should not be a thing. Casually saying your in a relationship with the same sex should not be this hard either. 

My family and I have 100% different mindsets that clash harshly. Yet they are fantastic grandparents to my son. Just because we have complete different beliefs on everything I dont judge and accept them.

Sometimes my mind was clouded and I wasn’t giving her the emotional support she needed even if I didn’t realize it.

Some person **who I have never spoken to before** randomly sent me a message on Discord saying they have mental health issues and they were contemplating suicide. I regret ever responding because what ensued was essentially me talking them down and pleading with them to not kill themselves.

I of course reported them to Discord and would have reported to police if I knew a single identifiable piece of information about them but again, I know nothing about this person beyond a screen name.

The conversation ended with them not responding to me, leaving me left to hope that nothing serious happened and shook me for the rest of the night. This person messaged me the next day as if nothing happened and has casually mentioned their depressive state in conversation since then but I can't help but just be an ear for them.

I'm conflicted because what I want to do is just block the person because I am not equipped to deal with any of this and I feel that it's unfair of them to put this onto me (a random person). However it's very clear that this person is lonely and they don't have enough people to talk to so I would feel guilty if I essentially told them to fuck off.

I’m not saying I can read someone off the bat But I’m pretty confident on how some one is by the way they act, so this woman she greets me just like every polite person would right ? Ok. She works front desk for a Doctor and sadly I’m a patient haha. So the whole time I’m seeing the doctor and just normally talking to her every visit, There’s this one situation out of many.

Situation 1. She called me at work and was calling to schedule my appointment that apparently wasn’t scheduled from my last visit which is always 
scheduled from prior visit.

(Just To mention this was all ready during corona March or April)
(She mentioned one time that the boss was closing early because all patients weren’t showing up due to COVID 19. and from what I was told was when I wouldn’t show up they would leave early and I would only show up 3 times a week) 

So when she called me about scheduling my next appointment I tried to be nice by saying schedule me when it’s best for you, it really doesn’t matter for me. 
Me saying that thinking if she still wants to get her full hours in than she would still schedule me an hour before they close. Like normal and get payed full, Instead of me showing up early and she doesn’t get her full hours or pay. She ends up getting an attitude with me getting mad after I say when ever is best for you if you want me to go late or show up early.

 She said that’s why I’m calling to see when it’s fine for you to show up.
(Already been known that I’m ALWAYS an hour before closing EVERY appointment)

Just from me hearing her like that I said ok I guess I’ll show up today just to get it over with. So I end up going the same day to the doctor just to get it out the way fuck it right. So when I show up she greets me Head down not confident in her greeting, definitely out of character and I just say in my head wtf and greet back hey like normal. I signed my name she goes to the back. 

When she comes back she’s completely different than before, the first thing she says is hey kid with a smile. (Clearly we’re not kids we’re in middle 20s) She greets me again but like she normally does and pretends she didn’t just greet me like she did in the beginning head down looking like you were still mad from earlier. I guess my reaction walking in and greeting her after she greeted me first like another day hey and not phased by her getting mad earlier she changed her attitude like he’s not mad at me?

Not to drag on with this, but I’ll give you a few examples of the people that surround us in our daily lives. My girlfriends father is an alcoholic, homeless and mentally ill. He’s constantly calling and creates problems for both us. My own father is an alcoholic who isn’t around much, but when he is it’s usually issues. My girlfriends sister is constantly causing issues that affect my girlfriend, her boyfriend has repeatedly cheated on her but she refuses to leave him so he’s ever present in our lives. We both work at the same landscaping company (her in the office, me out in the field) but the company is run terrible. A majority of the employees are drug addicts and alcoholics. One of the guys I work with everyday has as many problems as one person can have ($30,000 in debt, no vehicle, toxic relationship, addicted to drugs, alcoholic, using drugs/alcohol at work, incredibly insecure etc.) and constantly causes issue for me. It’s been extremely hectic at work and we’ve been doing long hours. A few times a week I work 7am-7pm or 7am-8pm. I’ve been doing 120 hours every 2 weeks so my life has been submerged in the people around me. The owner has zero people management skills so none of the people are reprimanded for anything which just puts more stress and work load on myself because myself and my other co-worker have to pick up the slack. 

This weekend I was at my friends cottage having a birthday celebration for myself and two other friends and it was a great time, but my friends girlfriend brought 2 couples who proceeded to ruin the time for everybody by screaming and yelling at their significant other for hours and I ended up losing my mind and telling them to STFU which almost resulted in a fist fight. This is super out of character for me but something just came over me. 

I had an 8 o’clock day at work today because one of the employees got sent home for being drunk and I had to sub in.

162,"I have two stray/borderline feral cats that come to my house every day for a scoop of cat food. I have fed them for probably 6 months. I chose to start feeding them because I see them running around town all the time through winter snow and summer heat and I felt like if I could help make their lives a little easier with a meal a day I should do at least that. 

My problem is recently I’ve started to really worry about what will happen to them once I eventually have to move. I’m renting a house in a small town and there are a lot of strays here. I don’t plan to move any time soon, probably not until I buy a house in a couple years or more. My main concern is the next tenants being irritated if the cats come around looking for their meal, and either throw things at them or complain to my landlord about it. I realize it won’t really be my problem at that point since I’d be moved away, but the landlords are really nice people and I don’t want to cause trouble for them, or encourage the cats to loiter here if the next person who moves in isn’t a fan of cats/tries to hurt them. 

So for the last week I’ve only put food out one day, and moved it away from the house. I’m so torn between cutting it off completely so they learn not to come here looking for food anymore before I’m gone, and feeling like I should keep trying to give them a little help for the time being. 

I should also note what made me really consider stopping was that one of the cats started to hiss and meow/yowl really, really loudly upon seeing me come out of the door when she was waiting for food. That was when I realized I needed to make a decision, because if there is a chance they would potentially attack or even just scare whoever lives in the house next or even me now, I’d want to avoid that.

163,"Some context first: We work in a restaurant - I am an intern of a few months, him a part time worker of 2 years. We only met about 3-4 weeks ago though because the restaurant got rid of part time workers for a while due to the pandemic. 

We hit it off almost immediately after being put in the same team twice. We started being a lot closer within the next two weeks despite not directly working together again - always talking during work whenever we see each other. I felt like we started being really flirty and eventually things escalated to playful physical contact. And its obvious he’s being extra nice and caring about me and vice versa. I feel like its quite obvious that I have a crush on him and him on me, though no one is outright admitting anything.

So our friendship progresses, until yesterday. I felt like he seemed off the entire day so I asked him about it and he kept hesitating and being like “this is so hard to get out” and all that and I started being really worried as I didn’t know what it was about. He said he’ll tell me after work but it’s something really bad and he thinks its going to change how I view him. 

After work, he told me that he just got together with a girl the night before. I manage to get out: “Isn’t that a good thing?” And he said that it was not because he feels like he likes two people at once. From my understanding, it seems that he was close/flirty with the other girl for a while as well (and they’ve known each other slightly longer than I know him) and so she asked him where they stood in terms of relationships. The feeling was mutual so they decided to date, but I’m not sure how official they are. He did refer to her as his gf though. He said he was conflicted because he feels like his personality matches more with his not-gf crush but not in terms of background/lifestyle (parents are super strict about hanging out with people, etc. Like I sort of have a curfew and that sort of stuff).

I kind of tried to give some generic advice about how he should really reflect on what both people mean to him and all that. But the thing is he basically somehow confessed to me without saying it - it was obvious the other person was me due to his descriptions. He also kept staring at me and into my eyes during this conversation and was being kind of quiet. Also he was like I think you know who the girl is but in the end I decided to pretend I didn’t know as I thought saying it would make things awkward and more complicated. I tried to ask him who but he wouldn’t tell me (obviously) so yeah. 

So… I don’t know how to proceed. I felt like I was put in the a difficult position because I didn’t want to give bad advice for my own personal gain. I ended up telling my best friend and mom about this (separately) and they both said that what he did was really shitty because he put me in an unfair position and because he’s like trying to play us both or something. But the thing is neither of them have met him and I genuinely think he’s just really at loss of what to do and because I care a lot about him and was pushing him to tell me what was wrong, he told me. Like maybe it wasn’t the greatest idea but I feel like he wasn’t trying to manipulate me or anything. 

But yeah, I want to emphasise that from what I’ve seen during work and how he interacts with people, as well as what people say about him, he really is a nice person. But I can’t tell if I’m blinded because I have feelings for him. Like is he actually a bad person (was the conversation somehow borderline emotional cheating or something)? We haven’t had work since the conversation so I don’t know if he will continue to be flirty but that day I felt like he was a little bit. Though he definitely felt different/off than normal. At the end (of the conversation) he did say that he feels like he should work on his new relationship and forget about the other girl, but today when texting me he still seemed very unsure of his decision, despite claiming that he understands what he wants better. He also repeated that he thinks I know who the not-gf girl is but I kinda dodged it again, though I did say I sort of have a guess.

I’ve been extremely flirty with him before this and I feel like now that I know he’s dating someone I should back off as it feels wrong to try and sway him or something, but I also don’t want him to notice the behavioural change because… well I lied about not knowing who it was so if I change my behavior its obvious I knew/lied and also probably obvious that I actually do like him - I don’t think he necessarily knows this for sure right now, even if I think its obvious. I think it is obvious I know who he’s talking about and is just lying though, not sure how much he believes me there. 

So what should I do? How should I act around him now? I was thinking to maybe hint/state that I do like him too, is that a terrible idea? Should I just continue to act like I don’t know who we’re talking about if it comes up again? (as friends, its not that weird to talk about life stuff and give advice, so it might come up again especially if we are both acting like I don’t know who it is)

If he decides that things don’t work out with his new gf (he said he wanted to try and make it work but he didn’t know her super well as they’ve only met for a month as well), how long should I wait before trying anything? 

TLDR: coworker likes me and another girl at the same time. He got together with the other girl recently but seems unsure and unhappy of his decision. He didn’t tell me the not-gf girl was me but it was as obvious as could be. I don’t know how to act around him now.",07Jul2020,1
164,"This dude and I dated and I use that term loosely like 3 times.... as in 3 dates. 

He wound up attacking my socioeconomic status and the quality of sex I give.... and I remember him being passively rude. 

It’s been many many months since I’ve seen him or thought about him and suddenly he texts me claiming that he’s changed and it’s a bullshit apology. 

He says that he feels some kind of other worldly connection with me which is common. I am kinda psychic - and if you don’t believe in that it’s not a big deal. It’s not even hugely relevant but I have had people latch onto me in the past because of a spiritual or empathic connection or because we share thoughts or whatever. 

I don’t doubt that he feels some kind of sixth sense connection with me but I am done with going down that rabbit hole with people. It’s not enjoyable and I don’t really want to have anything to do with him. 

My gut is telling me to just be done with him but for some reason I’m posting this for advice so I can’t be completely sure.",07Jul2020,1

She is sometimes difficult on my siblings, but not nearly as much as me.

Also, even if I were to be able to leave, I have no idea how to even get a real job, or do many ‘adult’ things. Furthermore, the extreme over-criticalness has made me feel imperfect as a human being, as though I can never be ‘good enough.’ I’ve tried working on my lack of self-esteem and insecurities, but nothing seems to ever help. I’ve tried talking with my mother and even my father, but all she does is yell and scream at me, and my father is no help at all.

167,"22f, have been slowly working on removing my mother from my life since I moved across the country to go to college. I don't think it's too important to get into details, but for some context of the abuse and neglect here are the following: she has been an alcoholic for as long as I can remember, drugged me when I was a kid so I'd leave her alone and she could go pop pills, would bring abusive men into our lives/home (with drug and alcohol problems), and body and food shamed me into an eating disorder. 

I didn't try to go fully no contact until the start of my senior year (fall 2019), which is when I reached my wits end and asked her to leave me alone. I have been trying to get her to leave me alone for almost an entire year now,  as I simply cannot have her in my life and maintain my health. Instead of listening, she keeps calling and texting me (this was before I changed my number), sending me unsolicited packages/mail, making new accounts on instagram to send me bikini photos of her after I've blocked her (which I have specifically told her is a huge trigger for my eating disorder), and to make matters worse her newest husband won't stop drunk calling my boyfriend and leaving nasty messages (essentially telling my boyfriend that he needs to grow a pair of balls and call him back, while also being insulting towards him). 

I feel so terrible that my poor boyfriend is wrapped up in this and I just want my mom/her husband to leave us alone. We are sending a cease and desist, but is there any other advice for this situation? It is causing me so much stress, as I feel like my mother still has control over my life.",07Jul2020,1

169,"I'm using a throwaway so my friends and family don't see this. I apologize in advance for the length.

So anyways, I am a senior in college graduating in December. Because of the pandemic going on, the job hunt has been bad. It also doesn't help that I am an average student. My grades aren't horrible or anything, but they are nothing to write home about. I have had a hard time finding an internship because of this. 

One of my relative's friends runs an accounting firm in my hometown and they offered me a full time job for the rest of the summer. They hired me with the intention of me going part time during the semester, and then going back to full time right after graduation. I graciously took the offer because I know how bad the job market is. My college is over an hour away, so I have to drive there and back everyday. I leave my house at 6:30 and don't make it back until 6:30 in the evening. The commute is killing me.

I hate the job. Everyone there is nice, but I am the youngest person there by far, by at least 30-40 years. It's difficult not having someone close to my age to talk to, so I mainly sit in my cubicle by myself for hours. I think what I hate most about the job is that everything can be done remotely, but they still make everyone show up to the office and work 8-5. There is literally no reason to show up to the office everyday. 

Like I said, I hate it. my parents think the pay is good for the area, but I really do not want to move back to my hometown after graduation. I feel like if I do that, I'll just be stuck there for the rest of my life. It is a rural area, with not much around other than small towns. I would hate to be stuck there. My fear is that once I go back, it'll be really difficult to get out.  Getting a job in my current location is almost impossible, because it is a college town and most of the jobs here are retail or food service. 

I need some unbiased advice. Most of my friends/girlfriend are telling me to suck it up and keep the job because the market is horrible right now. My parents are telling me to keep it because they thinke the money is great for the area (it isn't) and they want me to move back home. I'm conflicted because I would feel guilty leaving this place because of how nice they have been to me. The work itself is not bad, it's just really boring. That's not why I hate the job, I hate the environment because no one there is anywhere near my age and it's unbearable. I feel like I should just stick with it because without it I would have no experience in my field after I graduate.

170,"Oh boy, I've reached a point of breaking. Let's see, I'm 23, I don't have a license or a permit, I don't have a job, I can't seem to find any ambition or motivation to get either of those things. I don't know, I just feel ... stuck? Numb about it? My dad's always on my ass about getting my permit, but every time he says something about it the more I don't want to? I don't know. I have social anxiety and am extremely introverted. I'm an awkward person and I know a job requires being social and that;s something that I am in no way good at it. I don't even know where I want to work or what I want to do with my life. 

I also can't hold a relationship because I'm either too oblivious to emotional abuse or too boring. I mean, I am literally the most boring person. I don't go out, my favorite things to do are surveys for paypal and watching and re-watching the same things over and over. But a relationship isn't my first problem. It's the fact that I can't stop thinking that I'm some pathetic failure who can't seem to get the hell out of my house to do something that my parents can be proud of. I mean, with the wonderful major thing going on in the world right now, I shouldn't really be thinking about leaving the house, especially since my mom's high risk, but still. 

I just wanna figure out how I can stop feeling like this. Therapy isn't an option cause I can't pay for it, I can't talk to my family about it because I literally cannot open up to them about stuff that's bothering me. I shutdown and lock up. I just can't get the words out of my mouth. I just need some advice on how to stop feeling this way. Advice on how to just do it? I would really appreciate anything.",07Jul2020,1
171,"For some info, I'm in college in a country that isn't USA. I study at the uni my dad works at (for convenience reasons I guess), which gives me a 80% off scholarship (if it weren't for that I wouldn't study here, it's not even that nice of an uni, it's overpriced but I have to study here). That leaves the tuition for like $800 the semester (which I guess is kinda a significant amount of money in my country). Anyway, my parents got divorced last year and each one has to pay for their half, aka 10%, in my country it's common for parents to pay for college, my brother just graduated and my parents paid for it (although he did work at my uni during the holidays but those were very easy jobs, I've done them the past holidays too, they were comfortable, but very low paying, they'd pay like idk $250 to $500)

 Anyway someone contacted my dad and long story short he was able to get me a well paying summer job, so I've been working my ass off, suffering every day, with risk of getting corona, away from him (so he isn't even paying rn for any of my expenses) and he wants me to pay for his half, his half is only like $400, which I can pay, yeah, but I just find it so unfair ! plus he also somehow got me another scholarship thingy for like $500, so to be fair his ""half"" is already covered, for this semester there's only like $300 left to pay. My dad just wants to pocket my money and also make my mom pay her $400. But something about paying for only his half (for him just to pocket that money!) and my mom paying for hers doesn't sit well with me. I could also ""pay"" the full amount but again, my dad is pocketing my money! Why should I pay $800 for what actually only costs $300? What should I do?? He's just using that as an excuse to pocket my money. 

I know people pay for their own tuition but I just find it kind of unfair, I've been working my ass off, my brothers never had to do anything (ffs, they'd even pay $700 monthly for when my brother studied his gap year abroad, while I never got anything), my dad's half is already covered! My mum is paying her half! But I think he feels entitled to my money because he got me the contact. I've been living somewhere else, I should be getting an internship or studying my ass off whilestaying home, but I'm here in a strange place interacting with a bunch of people and risking my health and not having much free time to actually do stuff related to my major. 

Also, to add, those past holidays jobs I've had, my dad also used the money earned from that to cover his half and my mom had to pay for her full amount /:   he'd ""give us"" some of the money by telling us just to ask him for some money when we needed it but I never really spend money so he got to keep most of it, and he fully knew it'd be like that. (I'm still very dependent, he kept the money on his credit card and I have one of those authorized)? Cards which I only used to make small online purchases, I don't even have real access to it so I can't see the transactions and how much I've spent, he doesn't really care though because he knows I don't spend much. ) One summer I actually showed my mom the already discounted tuition and she paid for the half of the discounted tuition and my dad got super angry and I of course didn't get a cent, even though he also got benefitted by the discount! 
he's just petty, he doesn't want my mom to be benefitted! . 



I ranted too much so I'll do a TLDR;

Non-US, Have scholarship and divorced parents, each has accorded to pay for what would be 10% or $400 of it. Dad got me another benefit which would give $500 off this semester. There's only $300 left to pay. Dad wants me to pay for his $400 through a job he helped me get, but I'm the one suffering and working my ass off, suffering daily, and having corona risk! He's even saving money because I'm not home and he doesn't have to pay for my expenses.",07Jul2020,1

175,"TL:dr- How can I resolve wildly different expectations of COVID-19 precautions between myself and my husband and roommates?

I am renting a basement from a friend, along with my husband and toddler.  They don't take the precautions I would like.  They let their daughter go over to friends' houses, get fast food, go to grocery stores instead of doing pick up, don't disinfect groceries or packages, and recently went to the mall.  I also heard my friend tell her daughter they could go to a restaurant as soon as it reopened.  

I am having a very hard time with this, and for a while was trying to ignore it and even got on SSRIs and emergency medications to control my anxiety and panic attacks around this.  But I still just don't think that what they are doing is safe.

I talked to my friend about my concerns a couple of times, and the last time she got angry and the conclusion of the conversation was that  she felt she needed to have these exposures to control certain issues going on with her daughter.

  I accepted that I couldn't control her actions, and later decided that I should find a solution on my own by social distancing from the other family and not using the shared kitchen, laundry room, and dishwasher more than is absolutely necessary, ideally when they aren't there and with showering afterwards.  

Now my friend seems mad and my husband is furious with me for ""making life a living hell for no reason"".  I still feel like since lives are at stake I need to take as many precautions as possible.

She's gone through alot of troubles and like a friend, I've always been there for her. I've stuck with her through every breakdown, breakup, domestic (not violent btw) drama etc. I've been the only person riding for her like this. And also, that's not because she's a bad person. As a matter of fact people really like her and she has lots of close friends.

I would expect her to do the same for me, if I'd ever opened up in the past. I have always supported her (which also means saying no when I need to) and I had no reason to believe I couldn't confide in her. She's my best friend..

So, anyways. I've been going through things recently with my mental health (depression, ed) which I have a history with. I've managed very well and I'm proud of myself. The thing is, I've dropped hints and I know she's noticed.

She mentioned causally while making a point in another convo (irrelevant to this) that she ""doesn't know what I'm (me, the user lol) going through"". I didn't really mention it, but she still continued on with her point and never actually asked. It just seems like she doesn't care and it hurts.

At the beginning things went great I found a girlfriend which surprisingly was from my country too and a job and it was pretty good for the most part.

about a year ago we broke up and ever since then im pretty much struggling socially to find friends and people I can relate to.

Its been a crazy roller coaster of meeting people then losing them then meeting again then nothing comes out of it so its been kind of a mess but for a while I really did try to put myself out there and make friends where I am but nothing really came out of anything.. I mean, ive always had some social problems but I have friends at home that I love and that get me.

&amp;#x200B;

Any way now with Covid, im pretty much alone all day every day for almost half a year now. 

I mean I do have roomates, but we didnt really get along especially since covid hit and we were all at the same space for too long and all of us are kind of friendless here.

A few days ago they gave their 30 days notice on the place and we are all moving out in the beginning of August and I have this dilemma.

The dilemma is whether or not I should use this as an excuse to just fly back home and start all over again im my country with my family and friends or try to find another roommates to live with.

I really have almost nobody here, and with those two roommates moving I will literally be on my own , completely. And with Covid, its going to continue to be hard to make friends or participate in any social interactions.

I do have a job here that it isnt like my dream job but its pretty good for what it is, although its kind of dead end (IT support) but it is a nice paying job that I might not have at least easily in Israel so I would be kind of sad to lose it but its literally all that I have here and I am pretty certain I can get another IT job over there. also, they wont allow me to work remotely from over there even though we are working from home right now.

So giving all of those things that I told you I would be happy to get some advice moving forward.. like I am just in a big dilemma and im not so sure what would be the best move, I know that life over there are not going to be perfect but at least I will some people that I love around me but also, I know itll be hard starting life all over again living back with my mom etc etc.

So I am a 21F who lives with her parents (60s) and two younger siblings (&lt;13), mostly because a recent pandemic shut everything down. I was in college during the beginning of the spread in the US/stay-at-home orders/when everything shut down. 

For context: My parents are older and looking for property as a summer/weekend getaway camp. I don't have an issue with this, it's their lives, their money, their choice, good for them. They have been looking for the last four years since I started college and haven't found anything they can agree on (there was almost one place but that ended up falling through). Child-friendly is also a requirement, not only because of my younger siblings but because of their grandchild (my nephew) who is a toddler.

They recently found a piece of property and brought my two siblings and I out to see it and give our opinions (my dad had already seen it and explored). 

There are several small issues I have with this entire situation. 

The area they are looking in has very few places to be sold and those places are typically snatched up quick. The areas that aren't selling fast are areas that the buyer would need to put a decent amount of work into to use to it's full potential, on top of the (imo) already astronomical prices. That being said, my parents can be cheap, they have the means to get what they want but they're decently stringent about spending. Those areas that aren't selling fast are also not ideal to build anything on. We once went to see a property that ended up on a 200ft cliff (did not know beforehand otherwise it would not have been considered at all). 

Anyways back to the recent visit, there were two pieces of land my parents found. One had a very steep climb down to the waterfront and it would have needed a few hundred steps installed to get down SAFELY. Honestly if someone fell just right they could die (sharp rocks and steep incline do not mix well). I ended up slipping once and landed on my wrist the wrong way but no actual lasting injury. It was quickly voted out by my mother, my siblings and I. Why it was considered in the first place I don't know. It would be an unpleasant experience if anyone were to fall all the way down.

So we went to the second property which was literally on the other side of the neighboring property of the first property. This property had a much easier climb that would only need a few steps put in to be comfortable climbing up and down. The owner and his brother were on the property to clean it up when we went to see it and my parents talked to them for a while towards the end of the visit about the price which the owner did not want to budge on. 

My issues with the entire situation are these:
- They keep looking at/finding potentially hazardous properties.
- They keep looking at properties in this area of the US when they keep saying they want to move out of state (I will admit they are waiting for my younger siblings to finish school in the district we are already in)
- But why invest in a property they are going to barely use and will only have for less than a decade?
- We got up at 7AM to go look at these properties when there was no rush that day, nothing else going on that day at all. 
- There's also the possibility of a property dispute happening with the neighbors.
- They dismissed all of my concerns (they're getting older not younger, aforementioned, blah, blah, blah) and both my siblings' opinions of not being fond of the second property either, though marginally more than the first property. 

How do I convey all of this to them when they don't care? How do I tell them none of their kids care either (much), and that we do not want to keep going with them to look at these properties?

Extra: I don't care about the money, possible inheritances, or financial issues (they are very responsible with their money 98% of the time), or anything of the sort. My living situation is not up for debate. Those are not the issue. I am concerned for health and safety of everyone. I'm not trying to control them, their money is theirs to spend.",07Jul2020,1
201,"I recognize that I could have asked this in r/relationships but I misspelled platonic as platonic and all I’ve been getting are funny volcano comments.

This is more general so there aren’t really any
other specific people.

So I’d say I’m pretty outgoing person, people laugh at what I have say and overall seem to enjoy my company. 

And it just so happens that I work with an attractive girl, about 2.5-3 years older than me. When I first starting working with her, I never really thought of her in that way, so I could be relaxed and just be myself, and she, just like my other co-workers, reciprocated the friendliness and I really started to enjoy the people I worked with.

These past couple of months I’ve been very lonely (with Covid and all) and I’ve been at home, thinking a lot, itching to get back to work. Then boom, I realize just how attractive I think this girl is. 

I sort of have a problem when talking to people I find attractive, I clam up, become less funny, and I just feel uncomfortable.

I’ve never been in any sort of romantic relationship, and I really don’t think she’s in to me (that be pretty weird/lucky), especially because she’s older than me. She’s never given any signals or anything either.

Anyways, how do I sort of push that idea out of my head and go back to normal. I want to have a nice, regular, platonic friendship with her without becoming clammy and uncomfortable.

This happens whenever I talk to someone I think is good-looking. This was just the most recent and largest impacting example. Because the last time I saw her I felt very uncomfortable and awkward. And it’s made me very frustrated with myself


TL;DR : How do I maintain a totally platonic friendship with an attractive female co-worker without seeing her as a “potential mate” and clamming up and all?",07Jul2020,1

203,"It all began in 2016 with the election when my mother began listening to conspiracy theories from Alex Jones. I have been on her political side for my entire life and still will vote republican in this election. Honestly, my outside of conspiracy theories, I can stand listening to Alex Jones and we thought that was as deep down the rabbit hole as me, my father, and my sister would have thought she would go. She soon got a Bluetooth speaker and the more extreme theories would begin. The first big ones were chemtrails, flat-earth, and vaccines (And I guess everyone in Hollywood is a lizard molester). Might I add, my mom is a doctor. These kept escalating with the typical 5G argument, masks kill, and face scanning. I've had a few passive-aggressive arguments that escalated between us as it seems like I'm the only one who wants her to return to normal. I'm currently living with my parents and I'm going to university 2 hours away. I'm at my apartment trying to figure out where I am living next semester and what the opening plan is like for next semester and after sending her the opening plan requiring masks and maybe even a vaccine (OH NO!!). She comes home physically mad that people wear masks, I personally don't think it's a bad adoption to our culture like China (wear a mask when you're sick). How do I change her, right now it seems impossible because I am the enemy sheeple. I really want to respect her which I can't seem to find within myself. I find myself rolling my eyes to her every retort with no magical ""NO MORE CONSPIRACIES"" cure. I think the mentality that she brings into work as a doctor is harmful to society. I just want my pre-2016 mom back.

Personally I believe that it is blown out of proportion but if everyone just did what they say to do, it would be over faster. I'm sure my small part isn't felt anywhere, but I guess that's how life is :/.",07Jul2020,1

206,"Me and this girl used to fight a lot about stupid things and just have unnecessary drama with each other but now we’re chill. Everything was fine for a few days until I just started to get demotivated with this friendship, I know I want to fix it and make things even better than what they were. But just the constant thought of things never being the same, not being the only guy she’s talk to ofc she has other guys now making her laugh, also the thought if i would even matter to her, after all we had together.

I used to be depressed but now I’m good, while I was depressed I constantly depended on her she was like my source of happiness and I guess I pushed it too far and eventually damaged the friendship. but it’s all good, until tonight, I told her why I felt demotivated and why I leave her on Delivered for most of the day, she said “uh okay?” And then I said “sorry never mind just forget it I ruined it anyways” and she replied with “ruined what?” Honestly just from her first response I don’t even feel like going back now, I used to think about the FaceTime calls I wanted to have with her but now I just feel demotivated in even trying at this point.",07Jul2020,1

211,"A couple months ago, a coworker of mine (We're good friends) casually mentioned being circumcised. Since she's a woman, I thought this was something very odd to reveal, and inquired about it. She said it was a good thing done to prevent potential infections, and that it'd been done when she was very young/born. It took a minute to sink in, and I didn't realize she meant *that* kind of circumcision. I researched FGM at the time, and felt completely uncomfortable. 

Every so often now, I'll think about her 'circumcision' and get absolutely sick to my stomach. It isn't something I would ever bring up with her, but given her nonchalant attitude towards, I'm not sure she's entirely aware of what was done to her. She's mentioned being potentially ace, and that she's never really been into sex and doesn't really have a sex drive, and I wonder if this is a result of the 'procedure'. I don't know a lot about the FGM correlation with sex drive in adulthood, but either way it's incredibly unfair to her. Again, this isn't something that I would ever bring up with her, because it isn't any of my business, but she's also a good friend and it makes me tremendously uncomfortable knowing this fact, but also knowing that she doesn't seem to know what's been done to her. 

I hope I don't sound like an asshole, but I just get sick to my stomach when I think about it. It's hard not to think about it, and it hurts knowing that a good friend of mine (who is absolutely lovely, really) has been put through something like this and may not even know it. I was wondering if anyone had any thoughts or advice? I'm thinking I should keep this to myself, but any idea of ways to get my mind off of it?",07Jul2020,1
212,"I recently started selling sunglasses as a side hustle and i was showing him some of the ones I had. He picked out a few pairs. I noticed that they were all very reflective on one side so his eyes could not be seen. I just assumed he liked not making eye contact or something like that so I addressed it that if these are the kinds he wants to see. 

He replied with, ""I just want some that are super reflective so people can't see my eyes."" I ask him why, and he tells me, ""I want to be able to look at girls without them knowing.""

I assumed maybe he was just shy and anxious when approaching women, but he then further clarified that he ""wants to be able to check out their tits and ass and they can't tell I'm looking at em""

I was appalled. I known this guy for 8+ years and I couldn't believe he just casually mentioned that like I'd be in agreeance with him. He got a pair and was on his way.

After that I started thinking about other things he's said and saw a pattern. When I was 20 I had a neighbor that was 15. She still lived with her parents obviously but sometimes we would chat when we both so happened to be outside and I could tell she had a little crush on me. One day the same friend came over and we were hanging out outside and the neighbor came over to greet us and my friend saw how she acted. When we went inside my place he told me

""Damn bro I didn't know you were fucking the neighbor"" I told him, ""what? No dude she's like 15."" He replied with, ""so? If you're not fucking her your dumb dude she totally wants the D"" we talked about it for a little more but I just brushed it off. Didn't really give it much thought until today. Me and him are the same age so he was 20 at the time as well. We are 24 now.

I honestly never really have his behavior much thought because he's a cool guy and I enjoy hanging out with him. What kind of company am I keeping if he thinks that kind of thing is ok? I'm 20 and she's 15 she's pretty much still a kid. 

I know him pretty well. I know he wouldn't ever drug a woman and assault her, but now I'm seriously questioning if he saw a woman that was already drugged/passed out would he leave her alone?

How can I bring this kinda thing up in conversation with him or address it at all really? I don't think I can just go out and blurt out ""Hey man don't be rapey"".",07Jul2020,1
213,"I am a black woman (23) and I’m dating my wonderful boyfriend (23) who happens to be a white man, however when it comes to all the racial issues that are going on I feel like I can’t talk to him about anything.

216,"I'm 24, the oldest of 5 and have always struggled with self esteem, fear of judgement, setting boundaries and trust/relationship issues in the past 10 years; I also suspect depression and anxiety in that same time frame but haven't gotten an official diagnosis due to finance and fear of finding out. Since I was 7, I grew being a ""little parent"" for my siblings and occasionally for relatives. At first, I did it because it felt nice being that ""mature kid"" but as time went on and my own emotional needs weren't being communicated or met, I think I just burned out.  At this point, I'm just a sad adult who doesn't have any serious drive for life other than to make money for a little house, tired of life and tired of feeling like I'm unworthy with every mistake. 

I used to have big dreams like traveling, opening up an online store or starting a family when I was younger but now all I honestly want to do is ""retire"" in a small home and mind my own business so that I can finally be myself—though I know staying away from others can wreck my mental health. 

I know there's a lot more to life and I know I should go and have fun and enjoy my 20s, but honestly, if life is all about trying to make others happy so you don't have any problems, I don't know if I could take any more of it.

Does anyone else feel this way? If so, how did you go about trying to find meaning or just be okay with yourself?",07Jul2020,1
217,"   So the pedophile part is probably the biggest hang-up of this question. When my daughter was 16 she got her first job at a local grocery store. There was/is a stock person who was 22 at the time. They became friends and turned out they went on a few dates without my knowledge because I would have been and was mad after I had found out that they were dating. She has dated a few boys before in her grade but I did not see any reason why a 22 year old should be snooping around a 16 year old. 
We talked about it before they started dating and we, wife and I, expressed our concerns and I was under the impression that she was going to move on. Come to find out later that Mom said it was okay, behind my back, and she allowed them to go on dates dinners/ movies. After finding out that my wife  did this, I was furious. I felt so betrayed. In the twenty-plus years we've been married that's the only time I've ever thought of a divorce.
   Okay so fast forward 3 years to today. My daughter had just broken up with her last boyfriend of 2 + years yesterday. Then tells me she's going to date that same guy from the grocery store. I tell my kids they can talk to me about anything. I thanked her for being honest but I couldn't contain it. I blew up and yelled. I was so mad that she'd want to be with this pedophile. My wife says I'm being childish and that he's not a pedophile anymore. I still can't believe my wife is okay with this. I had to leave the house so now I'm ""sleeping"" at an airport parking lot.
   So the advice question is am I overreacting? Is he not really a pedophile because now she's of age. My opinion is once a pedophile, always a pedophile. I'm so mad at my wife I'm ready to call it quits. I don't have any friends to talk this over with so I'm asking the internet. What could possibly go wrong that?",07Jul2020,1
218,"Recently, me and my fiance moved in with a mutual friend and their S/O. They had just bought a house and offered us two of the extra rooms for reduced rent. This was a really nice wind-fall, especially after Corona-Virus forced me to be on stand-by with my job, my fiance to lose hers and our previous landlord had been uncompromising with payments.

At first, things seemed like they were going to be great. All four of us had a discussion before-hand that we would keep a dialogue, understanding that there would be moving pains but we would each do our best to work with each other. We were given a guest bathroom for our use, under the agreement we would keep it clean for when guests come over, that our privacy would be respected, and that the living-room and Kitchen would be a shared space.

Well, three months later and something feels off. Our mutual friend has become clipped, ignoring my fiance and focusing on me in conversations, especially our French heritage. Our items are continually moved and compartmentalized without our consent, we bought a trashcan and a laundry hamper for the bathroom, as they were things we needed anyway, and were firmly told we wouldn't be doing any decorating. Our Kitchen supplies were put in a hard to reach area, so, with us working again and not having much time to prepare meals, I've been ordering a lot of food. My fiance has received snide remarks on the expense. I am financially secure and have been the one ordering the food.

I chalked this all up to nerves from moving and our mutual friend expecting their relatives. But today I found a note on Bipolar Disorder- With bullet points of symptoms that seem directed at my fiance, hanging on the refrigerator door. It looks like it was displayed for me or my fiance to read.

I want to give my roommate the benefit of the doubt, but I'm concerned these behaviors aren't going to get better. I don't like that my fiance is being targeted while our mutual friend acts nice and accommodating in front of me. I tried talking with our roommate before about this, and we seemingly reached an accord.... But the behavior has gotten WORSE, if anything, since then.

So...What do I do? Am I overreacting? Or do I need to find somewhere else and get out before things get ugly?

221,"I think when you’re in your own long term relationship with someone you get desensitized to things.

Today my therapist said it sounds like my boyfriend is gaslighting the hell out of me. I’ve thought this before but I felt like I might’ve just been being too emotional. Even now I feel like I might’ve somehow manipulated my therapist into thinking that, or just been not objective enough.

I just grabbed a recording of my boyfriend and I discussing an argument we had earlier. I was sick of feeling crazy and secretly recorded it. I tried to stay really calm so that I could see how he’d react even when I’m being the most calm possible. I hope that’s not manipulative. It’s not to make me seem like an angel. It’s just to try to understand if his behavior would continue to be bad even when I’m 100% as calm as I can muster.

I am going to let a very close friend listen and give me an objective opinion so that I can see if I’m just going nuts.

224,"My closest friend and I met in 2018 and we immediately clicked. Around last year was when we started hanging out one on one despite not going to the same school anymore.

I started dating this guy last Dec exclusively and who I’ve known for almost a year. He is extremely attractive, lives in the most expensive part of town, is well educated, and is very tall. I got really lucky as in our social circle is comprised of students. I did however meet him in one of my classes by luck and we clicked after realizing we had very similar upbringings and backgrounds. 

I’ve gushed about his good qualities and how well he’s been treating me to her many times, and I’ve also mentioned how girls often approach him. I can tell that she lowkey wants to meet him one day, as any good friend would want to eventually. One good clue was when she asked me about our plans together as a couple in the future. I didn’t feel comfortable revealing anything to her yet and now I don’t think I really want to but I’m afraid it might make me seem too stuck up because I’m really open with her in general about my private life. During our last phone call I barely brought him up first and her prying questions made me uncomfortable. 

She struggles a lot in her dating life and with talking to men, so I’m afraid if they were to meet she would act attractive around him subtly, then try to add him on social media networks. I don’t follow him on my instagram and I have my Facebook friend list set to private just so she can never know his full name and do her own research.  I feel like they would get along very well intellectually as I know them both well but I’m afraid that because they have one good conversation she’ll develop a secret crush on him.

Him and I love each other so so much, but we have always had issues. Most of those issues are because my parents like to control everything and basically never let me see him, and he,being very lonely all the time and not liking to be alone with his parents, gets upset about being away from me for too long. His parents don't care about him at all and let him do whatever he wants, whereas mine don't let me do anything without breathing down my neck, so he doesn't understand why I can never go see him. On top of all that, he constantly blames me for this situation and accuses me of not fighting for our relationship and not trying hard enough to see him. We get into terrible arguments and call each other names and be has threatened to break up with me a few times.

227,"Hi, I'll (M) cut to the chase. I've had a foot fetish ever since I could remember. Today, I went in for my therapy session, and since it's summer, my psychologist (F) was wearing open-toed shoes. When I noticed, I couldn't stop staring, and even during the session I couldn't focus; I was too distracted with her feet. And I felt bad for not saying anything, but at the same time I feel like it could be inappropriate for me to bring it up. I'm thinking about asking her not to wear open toed shoes, and if she accepts, I'd feel bad for ""limiting"" the kinds of shoes she could wear during the session, or even throughout the days when we meet. So, I'll ask my questions. 

Should I tell her about my fetish in the first place (she doesn't specialize in sex as far as I know?) 
And if I should tell her, what should I say?

228,"This is probably the biggest insecurity of mine in dating/early stages of relationships/the “talking” stage. I have an unhealthy habit of seeing what my crush/the guy I’ve been talking to likes in regards to women’s Instagram pictures or Facebook pictures. These aren’t models photos or celebrities, but various women he may or may not know. He also could have potentially met them on Hinge where him and I met. 

This particular man and I have been talking for almost 2 months and we met in person recently last week. Things went really well in regards to the date and us talking. We have not had sex (I feel like this is always a defining factor in relationships). We swam in his pool, talked all night, walked his dogs, got pizza, watched some movies and so I spent the night. The next day I spent pretty much the whole day there, he made me breakfast and we swam in his pool again. 

What freaks me out is he openly said that in the past once he has sex with a girl he doesn’t have feelings for them anymore and it’s like what am I supposed to do with that? We were making out in the pool and that’s as far as it went. Yet I’m afraid if I have sex with him too soon he’ll lose interest.

But also when we were hanging out for example we were in the pool and we were just sitting there holding each other he said, “I could get used to this.” Or another example I made a comment about myself in a bikini and he said, “you don’t need to worry about that stuff anymore.” He’s always making references to “us” in the future and continuing this dynamic. 

I don’t know how to read this situation and am looking for some advice on how to proceed.",07Jul2020,1

230,"Hey there, I’m about to tell a story which I’m extremely ashamed of and I’m not looking for judgement just advice. Thanks.

So I’m a 16 year old who a couple of months ago lost control of my mind and out of pure teenage horniness decided to go to an Asian massage parlour to lose my virginity. After it happened I almost instantly regretted my decision purely because of the psychological aspects.

I just lost my virginity to basically a prostitute at the age of 16 and felt like a total loser (Since then I’ve really changed and have been trying to cut porn from my life and generally be a person who doesn’t do things like that).

This is just the start of my problem so that’s for another story, but recently I’ve been talking to a girl a lot and we’ve been hitting it off pretty well and we’re going to meet up soon at some point.

My problem is that I’m scared that after losing my virginity, I somehow got an STD (herpes/cold sores) and I’m going to pass it on if we eventually kiss.

Now, when I lost my virginity I used protection, only had 1 singular kiss and the person seemed clean (I.e. no cold sores or anything), and I’ve also never had any symptoms of an STD whatsoever since that point, but I’m still worried that there’s that 1% chance that I got some asymptomatic STD and I’m going to make a girl very very sad and anxious.

I don’t want to admit something like that to her because, well... I’m 16 and also I don’t know if I even have anything, but it’s making me so anxious and stressed out that I don’t know what to do...

Can anyone offer me any advice? It would be greatly appreciated...",07Jul2020,1
231,"So, I ordered a commission from an artist back in September of 2019. I sent her a partial payment and was told that Id be receiving the piece within a month. She hasn't been responsive to any of the messages I've been sending.

I sent payment through PayPal and attempted to make a claim. Unfortunately, I was well past the 180 day limit, so PayPal denied my claim. I'm just not sure what I can do if anything. I've already been bitched out by her when I asked her about it on back-to-back days, but when I wait any longer, she doesn't solicit me with any replies. 

I understand there's a lot of shit going on in the world atm, so I kinda attributed all the delays to that, but the lack of communication plus her activity on her cosplay pages makes me feel ignored.

232,"I can’t tell if my relationship is abusive. How can I tell?

I think when you’re in your own long term relationship with someone you get desensitized to things.

Today my therapist said it sounds like my boyfriend is gaslighting the hell out of me. I’ve thought this before but I felt like I might’ve just been being too emotional. Even now I feel like I might’ve somehow manipulated my therapist into thinking that, or just been not objective enough.

I just grabbed a recording of my boyfriend and I discussing an argument we had earlier. I was sick of feeling crazy and secretly recorded it. I tried to stay really calm so that I could see how he’d react even when I’m being the most calm possible. I hope that’s not manipulative. It’s not to make me seem like an angel at all and I’m not going to parade around saying I’m always just calm or whatever. I’m certainly not always calm. This was also just a discussion about a fight that turned into a very minor tiff that I decided to record to get an opinion on. It’s just to try to understand if his behavior would continue to be bad even when I’m 100% as calm as I can muster.

I am going to let a very close friend listen and give me an objective opinion so that I can see if I’m just going nuts, if my behavior even when I think I’m being calm is not okay, and if his behavior is truly abusive and gaslighting. 

Anyways, aside from what I just did, how do you tell if a relationship is abusive? What are the signs? I just want personal anecdotes or stories because online articles just aren’t doing it for me.",07Jul2020,1

235,"The situation is, my boyfriend's parents got him a new car a few months ago and I ended up getting his old one to replace mine, since my old one was breaking down all the time and expensive to maintain. They are charging me $1800 for it, it's a 2001 Lexus RX 300 and had 230,000 miles when I bought it. 

The thing is, the whole plan of buying my boyfriend the car and me getting his was discussed, but they didn't ever mention me actually paying for his old car until the day my boyfriend had to sign the new car paperwork, so at that point, things were already in motion and I felt like it would have been crappy to go back on the deal. They had previously discussed possibly taking my old car as compensation (it still ran and they could have sold the parts or something) but decided not to do that, and then just sprung on me that they were charging me $1800 without really giving me a chance to think about it. At least, that's how it felt. 

I definitely would have thought more about it if I knew beforehand they were going to charge me. I'm paying it off at $100 a month right now, but the check engine light is perpetually on, the AC doesn't work, the gas mileage is terrible, and I really want to save up for a newer one. The issue is that I have to pay this off now first. To give some perspective, I just graduated and just started working full-time so it's not like I can pay it off right away. I know it's a really good deal for a car, I just kind of feel like I was almost forced into it without getting a chance to properly think it over. Because at the end of the day, I might have been able to keep my old one running for as long as I needed to without spending $1800. Am I justified in feeling this way?",07Jul2020,1

237,"I have a friend that's very close to me. We've been friends for years, and she comes to me with every issue or breakdown that she goes through. She and I both noticed about a year ago that some of her responses and behaviors weren't healthy, and I encouraged her to begin therapy to try to get to the root of what was causing these issues. After several therapy sessions, she discovered that she has borderline personality disorder.   
   

The Good--

  Over the past couple of years, we've had some good times. We've gone to concerts together, hung out at the bars, and had those ""wine nights"" that always end up too silly to keep from laughing all night. She's told me all about her fears, her past, and opened up to me in a number of ways. Often times, she'll tell me that she thinks of me as the sister she wished she had. The person that she can always come to for advice and solace. We've both had rough childhoods, so I can understand a lot of her struggles in that way.   
Sometimes, she has this way of making me feel extremely special. When she feels good, everything around her is good. She is truly the life of the party: extroverted, carefree, kind, and genuinely hilarious. I love each moment that I've seen that light inside of her. In those beautiful moments, she emits the energy of someone who could potentially take over the world.  


The Research--

During her struggles after finding out her diagnosis, I started research on the effects of BPD and what I could possibly do to help her. Through my research, I realized that having borderline personality disorder is something that I wouldn't wish on anyone. A BPD brain is constantly battling itself and self sabotaging. I learned that the BPD brain doesn't recognize ""neutral"" like other brains. In their mind, things are black and white. A simple ""okay"" said to someone with BPD could be interpreted as ""I hate you,"" ""you're annoying me,"" or ""I'm not interested.""  When someone with BPD experiences something that may be a relatively small incident to someone else, their whole brain and body can basically go into shock mode. They'll act out in anger, self sabotage, or in self pity and plead or act out in dangerous ways to get the attention that they need. Their brain is their own personal Hell in these moments, and they feel like they're experiencing a disaster but they can't run away. Their whole world can collapse at the drop of a hat. I kept researching specifically on how to respond and understand this disorder. By no means am I an expert, but from what I learned, I've tried to implement ways to help her through her struggle.  


The Efforts --

  I've made efforts to be there for her whenever she needs me. Currently, we're in the midst of a global pandemic so I haven't been able to do as much in person, but I'm there as much as possible over the phone and internet. Even so, we talk every day about her problems.  
  I've treated every issue, no matter how big or small it may seem to me, with empathy and kindness. She may call me crying because she misses her ex boyfriend, she may be crying because of a boy she met days ago on the internet, or she may be crying and not even know why. But I talk with her for hours, let her vent, and try to give advice as well as I can.  
  

  I've encouraged and celebrated when she takes positive steps. She has the tendency to take her meds in a very dangerous way. Sometimes she'll take her medication as prescribed for a few days, then go even longer without them, only to pick up again later. Every time that she tells me about filling her prescription, I praise her for making that effort. Additionally, I've tried to talk to her about the dangers of taking it incorrectly, as it can essentially send your brain into ""whiplash,"" but her patterns with medication still tends to be an issue. I also celebrate her victories when she goes to her therapy sessions, as she often avoids it. We celebrate big and small victories together. whether its the larger things like therapy and medication, or the smaller things like getting out of bed even though she really doesn't want to.   
I've been a voice of reason. There have been times when I can tell that her personality disorder is causing her to idolize someone she barely knows, or extremely misread an interaction. When she comes to me with these issues, I calmly explain to her what an outside perspective sees and how the situation may be different than she perceives it to be. She has expressed appreciation for this.  


I put my own issues aside. This is something that has happened too many times to count. Any time I have an issue, she immediately makes me feel guilty about it. She either changes the subject to talk about her issues or she tells me that she has it worse and that I have no right to feel the way that I do. I've learned from this that she doesn't have the emotional capability of being there for anyone else because she already has enough going on in her own mind. Consequently, I avoid putting that weight onto her, no matter what the severity of my situation is.   


   I give her the benefit of the doubt where I can. I know that having this disorder can be completely devastating and I always try to see her through a lens of empathy. There have been times that she's seriously hurt me emotionally, but I've stayed to support her her because I deeply care about her and I'm one of the only people she has.   


The Bad--

Throughout our friendship, I've noticed that from an outside perspective she can be seen as:

\- extremely manipulative

\- selfish

\- impulsive

\- dishonest

\- self destructive

\- emotional

        She's personally done harm to me countless times.  She's gone behind my back to try to sleep with an ex boyfriend that I still had strong feelings for. She often manipulates me into buying things for her or giving her my belongings. She's belittled issues that I've tried to open up to her about regarding my traumatic experiences from being abused, both sexually and emotionally. She guilts me if I'm unable to respond to texts immediately and interrogates me on what I'm doing. She emotionally abuses me by constantly telling me that I don't care about her if I don't do ""x,"" then completely shifts her perspective and tells me how much she loves me and doesn't deserve me. I've caught her trying to steal from me. And most recently, she's shown up at my workplace and almost got me fired over an emergency she was having. (The emergency was that a boy she had been talking to and had feelings for wrote her a song. She came into my job after showing up at my home and seeing I wasn't there. I told her I wasn't able to talk with her at the moment due to how fragile the state of my retail job is in this economy. She came in and demanded that I give her my soothing words and wisdom to prevent her from going into a manic episode. I will say, I do feel somewhat guilty for being frustrated about this, but it was a violation of privacy to me and she does have a past of stalking her old friends and ex-boyfriends.)  


I'm honestly feeling conflicted.

        I know that she can't completely control the way that she reacts. I've pleaded with her to get proper help, but typically she proceeds in a half-way manner, never truly committing 100%. I don't blame her for how she feels inside, and I know that her brain is constant warfare. At the same time, though, I don't know how long I can realistically keep myself in this situation. She often becomes abusive, and that's never okay.   
        Being close with someone with BPD is rough, but I've stayed in it this long because I know it's rougher for her to have this disorder than it'll ever be for someone else trying to cope with how she reacts. Is there a way to set healthy boundaries with someone incapable of understanding them? Is there a way to be there for her that will lead to positive change? Is there a way to alleviate some of the negative feelings she experiences? Will I always just be a source of venting to her, rather than a friend with mutual respect and understanding?",07Jul2020,1
238,"I want to say first that I am not suicidal. I am not considering it whatsoever, despite what google suggests when I look up the title. Also this might end up seeming kind of ironic that I'm worrying about this considering the whole Covid situation.

As the title says, I don't really have reason in life. I wake up at 8 every day, and go to bed without any goals for the next day. If I could describe it anyway my life is a shrug. I just finished grade 10, with 80s and 90s, with the latter being Math and Art, which I thoroughly enjoy. I talk to people from different groups, and have a friend group of 5 guys that I've stuck with through high-school so far, despite some days feeling like they aren't the best fit for me. With all this, I haven't felt accomplished academically or socially. My school has a stereotypical hierarchy, with a popular circle, band circle, queer circle (can I say that?), potheads and scrubs circle, student council/activist circle, outsiders, and floaters. I guess I would fall into the last category, and so would most of my friend group. I almost never have classes with anyone from my group, so I tend to stick to the outskirts of my classes, help people with work, join conversation when prompted, keep my head down and keep track of everything going on in the room. I'm not big in using social media, which is how most people interact with each other, but I always feel like it's tedious to keep track of. I haven't joined any clubs or sports teams except Ultimate Frisbee and Track and Field, as I am 5'11'' but 120 pounds and am not that athletic. Outside of school I watch movies, listen to podcasts, go biking and play video games like Dark Souls, Fallout, and occasionally some others like Halo and Age of Empires. But I don't like to talk about games much in public because I am conscious about what other people hear me say and am nervous people will judge me for it.

With all this, I don't really have reason. I think I play the games because they make me feel accomplished, and are an easy way of setting a goal for myself. School has never really felt like a challenge, I don't know what I want to do in life, and I don't really have any social events to look forward to. I've wanted to try making videos and working out for some time now, but I feel embarrassed, and I always wonder what others will think of me, and if I do make a video or do something outside of school, will other people think negatively about me because of it. In middle school I couldn't care less about what people thought of me, and was much happier. But now I just feel ashamed whenever I try doing something different, or even the thought of it. My parents have always supported me, but I always hear stories about my dad and all the different things he got involved with in high school, and this will sound cheesy, but I feel like I'm not up to his ""legacy"". I really want something to chase after in life and to derive meaning from, but I just feel like I'm always being looked down on, not living up to my full potential, and that I will be judged for who I am. I've just never really fit the cards that I've been given, which is ironic, as I am fairly unlucky.

248,"So the question isn't really all I'm asking but I'm not sure how to title it.
1. Am I just being a moody teen?
2. Is everyone I'm having a issue with understandable or I'm just upset about nothing 
3. Is this normal? (I know there is no such thing as 'normal' but to a amount is it?)
4. Am I insane?

Also I'm 15 and female 

Background: when I was younger about 6 or so years ago two people showed up to my home and my mom let them stay. She asked if I was okay with them staying in which I said no (I was and still am very socially anxious). She asked my brother's which they said no. They moved in anyways. I moved out of my room to give them my master bedroom and now they are still here. 

So now: the older roommate always likes messing with me and getting me mad. He noticed I was ticklish once when my brother poked my side so he started doing it too (he is like 40). So that's one thing that always made me uncomfortable even when I brought it up with my mom it didn't stop. She said she told him not to do that but I never saw a difference from that(am I just being upset about nothing? Everyone in the house sees him do this and anytime I make it clear I'm uncomfortable it seems like everyone else ignores it). Also he lies he is very sexist racist and homophobic. Yet if anyone is being like that it's bad to him. He drives me insane and anytime I vent about him to my mom she tells me to calm down and not to get worked up. So I started waiting until something big happens and I go off(am I being a moody teen? Is my mom trying to get me to be quiet or trying to make me feel better somehow?). Anytime i go off i feel everyone in the house turns on me and at those times i feel like anytime any of them are in the same room together they are talking about me. (That's where I'm asking am I insane? Do people feel like this? Anytime they leave the room and I've did something wrong they are talking about me at least thats what my mind tells me. Is that normal? I know there is a name for that but like I have it in my mind that that is how my mom punishes me for speaking out of turn? Does parents do that? Is it in my head?)

I'm sorry if I'm not making sense. I know its unfair to judge and give advice to something with this little of detail and information but I don't know where to start or end so I will give info where its needed but I have trouble talking about someone when they aren't here to defend themselves.

Ima gts” i didn’t expect the reply he gave me  because I know he would’ve came back at me. I said I’m pressed and ima come at him. (I’m joking) and he said “well I’m not gonna care😁” 
I said back pretty vulgarly “Elaborate bitch. What do you mean. Dry ass motherfucker” I was pretty mad at him. He said “Talk all that smack but I won’t give a shit😁😁” the smiles give me a different vibe. Like he’s mad, or doenst care or is being a ass to me. I think he’s still mad at me from what I said to him earlier about him not being able to see cuz he be squinting. But he came at me hard first so I came harder. His comebacks were becoming offensive. 

We’ve been messing around with eachother since we first met.  This was our thing. But he’s taking it too far.  
So the convo was coming to a close. So after he said the talk all that smack cuz I won’t give a shit. I said to him “I know you don’t. You don’t give a shit about me or his friends” he said back “um I do you just don’t know it” 

I thanked him saying that cuz it made my night. He then got serious with me. 
He said “But seriously can you stop saying I’m a bitch randomly” I was shocked. I wasn’t expecting this. I said back “Oh” he said back “I don’t really like it” ans I said I’m so sorry.
And he said “And other stuff” so he wants me to stop doing the play fighting. He said that I’m good. Which I don’t don’t believe.  
I told him these are the things I wnat him to tell me about. He then told me “U just the only one that does lol”
He has loads of friends and the fact I’m the only one. Is crazy. I wanted him to explain more because  I know I won’t be satisfied with the questions I asked. He said “Like you say I’m ass or other stuff. And you’re the only one who says this to me” I don’t get why he wants me to stop. I said he does the same tho and he said or when I start things. I think he means conversations. So basically he wants me to end the fun stuff. 
I asked him before he left if this hurts his feelings...he said “Barely” not yes or not no. Barely. So I do? 

I have more to say. We just had a argument today. 
I found out he unfriend me on all socials. He said it doenst matter but it hurts my feelings. He wouldn’t tell me why he did it. But he says we are friends. I asked him after the argument if we are friends and he said sure
 I even asked him if he likes talking to me and he said somewhat. He said somewhat. 
He told me 2 things he doenst like about me is my attitude. He knows I get cranky sometimes but I take eveything to the head. He’s absolutely right about that.  
He’s rude, unfriending me, never texting, and barely likes talking to me. I told him idk where I stand. And he told me to work on myself and rethink. I think he’s telling me, let go and work on myself. I’m so confused rn. I think he’s letting me down slowly",07Jul2020,1
252,"Ben, my friend (16M) whom I've known for over two years on discord recently told me that he was going to khs. I ended up talking him off of it and I think he's doing better now. When I was trying to reason with him, I asked our mutual friend, Tom, to give the friend some support because I was in a complete panic and did not know what to do.

Before this, none of us knew about his mental state nor his struggles with his abusive parents because Ben would never open up. As I learnt from the mutual friend, Ben's home life has been really bad because his father would repeatedly beat him up if he doesn't reach a desirable grade or just for fun. His mother would just watch. Apparently, his situation has been worsened as his father has been fired from work because of the pandemic.

Only Tom and I know about this and we are considering calling CPS. When Tom asked Ben to call the police he simply didn't reply. I'm really conflicted because Ben probably has a good reason for not wanting to call the police but at the same time, if his situation is this dangerous, shouldn't we probably step in? Will it be overstepping? What else should we do?

Tom said that it would probably be for the best if we overstep and call CPS and although Ben will probably lose his trust for anyone, its simply a price we need to take to ensure his safety. I would really like more opinions on this.

Notes:  
Ben lives in singapore  
A few days before this incident when asking about my friend's day, he replied that its been shitty because he got drunk in the morning to drink away his pain and completely skipped school.

I have a master’s degree and was an athletic person who had an amazing life. It’s all gone. 

Maybe this post is a huge vent. I’m an older’ish female.

I have the potential to more than succeed in the career path I have always wanted, however I am completely at a loss of what to do to finance school. At one point I could have qualified for scholarships but I had my son at a very young age and have been totally focused on him since. Now that I am finally ready for school I do not qualify for loans due to my credit being tanked from my previous marriage with said child's father. I have been abused and constantly threatened and I have lived in terror of this man who has let me believe I cannot be the mother I AM.

I created this account right now because I saw an unwanted image minutes ago and is completely haunting me, cannot delete it from my mind and it's making me feel really sick. I was looking for porn at the phone when a random porn website popped up on a different tab, I went to close it but before closing it I took a curious look on the categories previews. Then I saw a video preview of what I think was a woman completely dismembered and mutilated on the floor, pretty explicit. I saw it for less than a second and when I realized about what I think it was I ran to close it. I don't know if was some kind of sick fetish with make up, if it was my mind tricking me or if it really was a dead woman. I need to know... I wont be able to sleep until I know what was that sick image that is still on my mind. I'm not brave enough to go and see it because if it's real I know it will destroy me. My imagination and guilty is already destroying me, but I need to know. Could any of you do me a favor and check the link of this porn website and tell me what is that video?

257,"Okay. A lot to unravel.

So me and my boyfriend plan on moving from state to state to go to college. We would be renting out an apartment, and living together while working and going to school.

It would be hard, but not impossible. 

I was talking with my dad, and he mentioned just staying at home for a year, going to community college, knock some generals out of the way, and saving money for an apartment. This sounds great, but I really am leaning towards just moving as soon as college starts. 

The big problem is that my boyfriend really doesn’t have the money for his half of the rent, and I don’t know if he’s going to be able to hold up the way he says he is.

259,"I have a harder time getting into and liking underground bands I already have some knowledge of or I know have some kind of reputation. And this to an extant inhibits me from being able to enjoy get into more underground bands. 

Now they are some exceptions to this. If the band has well produced music or well made music videos it usually becomes easier for me to enjoy them. And this doesn't happen with every underground band I hear. A few times I've just really clicked with the band the first few times I heard them(which that might just be the answer to my problem, I haven't found exactly what I like yet).

Every time I find an underground band, I usually get this sort of vibe of skepticism. Like they won't be good, but I can't exactly put my finger on it. Another reason why I think it's harder for me is because I put pressure on myself to listen to new bands to expand my musical vocabulary, which that pressure leaches into my pleasure of the actual music and makes it less enjoyable to listen to.

Sorry if I went on a little tangent there, but those are some reasoning why I think I have this issue. I really do want to get into new bands especially underground ones, so if any of you at all could help me that would be the most extreme of awesome",07Jul2020,1

I’ve (24f) been married for a bit over a year to someone I’ll refer to as James (24m). We have a good sex life, good communication, your normal ups and downs but overall I think we have a really good relationship. 

It’s been less of an issue lately, but I found that when I started getting to know another friend of ours (I’ll call him Aiden), I felt like I was more excited to talk to him than James. I had good news, I wanted to text Aiden. I had bad news, I wanted to rant to aiden. I found myself directing a lot of energy into my friendship with aiden rather than my relationship with James. Nothing really even sexual at all, but I just feel a bit gross about it. Is this normal? Do most married people get crushes like this? It’s definitely a bit beyond my normal friendship relationships.

I once slept in the same bed as him (nothing happened at all, he lives in a town I was visiting and I literally was just exhausted and fell asleep, my husband knows about it and he didn’t care, etc.) and I didn’t feel any type of way about it sexually at all, but I can’t help but feel it’s almost an emotional affair or something? 

Any advice is greatly appreciated. I have been making an effort to tell my husband first whenever anything of note happens. I just feel weird and almost like I should tell him but it also almost seems ridiculous to bring up.",07Jul2020,1

265,"Ive been a graphic designer for 12 years. I started at a small ad agency and later moved to a family owned company. During those years I worked on many small projects with a majority all on my own. I don’t have a team to work with to bounce ideas or have much time to devote to each job. Because of this the creative juices don’t flow as fast as they used to so Ive had to rely on things I see other companies do or try to learn a newer technique to follow the trends. It’s exhausting. Feeling like I am years behind the industry watching new styles or skills, come about and not having a clue how it was done. I also happen to be the only one in my department. My coworkers don’t really know or understand what I do, they consider me the “tech guy” and toss me projects that really aren’t in the scope of my job. But since I am computer savvy I end up taking care of whatever it may be. Ive had to teach myself photography, videography, web design, after effects, premiere, XD, Blender, sketchup... and can honestly say was able to produce something decent in each but nothing that would be considered great. Jack of all trades, master of none.

Recently I was asked to work on a programming problem. A small application that takes info inserted online and stores them in a database. It took me a week but I am happy to say I got it working, not pretty, but it works. And I caught a bit of the programming bug. I got a bit of a rush once I solved the problem. Now I am wondering if its something I should pursue. 

I love graphic design, have my BFA in graphic design, so it seems like the obvious choice but I don’t think I am as good as I should be at this time in my career. Like I wasted 10 years “faking it til I made it” and now looking back never did anything that I am truly proud of. Nothing that stands out as great work that I would show in a portfolio. I don’t have any experience working with a team, being a project manager, creative director, or any type of leadership role. 

The question is:
Do I push forward in graphic design or start learning programming in hopes there is a career? I am not looking for the easy route, what I’m really looking for is some advice from people in both fields. I need to rid myself of all the what ifs, pick a direction and go for it.

Creatives of reddit, have you been in my place? What did you choose? How has it worked out? Should I stick with it with a goal of becoming a creative director, or explore learning UX UI, or is there something I haven’t even thought of?

Programmers, are there career paths for people without a degree? Who are self taught? Are there better languages to learn than others? Python vs JavaScript vs php. MySQL &amp; Ajax? Where would one even begin?

And finally, if all that wasn’t enough, what type of work environment are each? Do you feel like you make enough to be able to support a family? Do you bring work home with you a lot? Do you work from home? What do you like and dislike about your field?

I appreciate the help with this decision.",07Jul2020,1

(18M) I've had this for a couple of years, however I only realised that I have it. I can explain why I have it but he issue how I would change my habits.

Examples:

1.) If a girl comes near me or to close I start to hyperventilate and feel nauseous ( I... Just don't know why but it's a fight or flight response)

2.) The one time I was in a relationship, I kept asking to go to the restroom.... Kept throwing up, wanted to get out of it; however didn't know how to leave the relationship without hurting the other person (Seems impossible for me)

3.) When a female friend (that had a crush on me) was depressed, I got so scared so I told her to not commit suicide. I asked a friend to talk to her, soon after I blocked her (I get too scared in these situations, I don't want to be blamed for their deaths)

4.) My friends always keep pressuring to get a girl, sometimes hooking me up with random girls. I sometimes bail or make excuses, I.... I just can't.

273,"hi okay. so i (21F) met this guy(23M) literally the first day i moved to the area i'm currently living in. he works at a food shop about 5 minutes from my house. i had a feeling even during the two months leading up to us talking that he liked me because i would always see him looking at me and smiling from the corner of my eye. towards the end of april, i ran into him as he got off from work and he ended up asking if i wanted to hang out with him sometime, so we swapped numbers and immediately began talking. on our first ""date"", we walked around a park and just talked and he did that thing again where i saw him just looking at me out of the corner of my eye and smiling. we continued talking and hanging out and hooked up a couple times over the course of these last two months. about a week ago, we hung out and watched a movie in his van and were all cuddly, goofy, and cutesy and shit. afterwards, he dropped me off at my car, which i left at his house, and we were just goofing off and kissing. since things had been going well for a while, i decided to ask him ""so what are we? are we a thing or just hooking up..?"" and his response was ""i don't know, its only been 2 months so i haven't really thought about it"" and i was just like ""okay cool i was just curious and wanted to make sure we were on the same page"". we talked a little after he made sure i got home since it was late and i told him ""sorry i didn't mean to put you on the spot earlier or anything"" and he said ""im not worried, you're chill haha"". i thought things were cool between us but i definitely felt that i freaked him out with that question so i tried seeing him in person so i could apologize, but he kept blowing me off and just ignoring me unless blatantly asked. i apologized over text but he just ignored me. i finally ended up talking to him in person for a few minutes before he went home to go game. i apologized in person and asked if things were okay and if we were cool. he told me that everything was fine and things were cool between us and that i didn't fuck things up like i thought. two days after that, i was tired of all the silence so i ended up messaging him on snapchat (it ended up turning into a paragraph which he most likely didn't read all of it) and i basically explained to him that i've already apologized a bunch for what i had said and that i regretted it and how it messed things up. I told him that i understand he's busy with family, friends, and work and that i respect it but i just feel completely ignored and basically that im done trying to talk to him if all i get in response is silence and just told him i wanted him to actually tell me what's going on instead of just responding with silence again and leaving me confused. his response was ""you have a right to know what's up. basically, i had a think after our last time and i don't think we would work. sorry to tell ya this way i wanted to take a bit more time to think before i said it, but you kinda kept coming to see me"" (i saw him twice for a few minutes each time)""sorry for being an ass"" and then he removed me as a friend on snapchat (he has ig and fb but says he doesn't use them even tho he has active accounts so we were never friends on those accounts).

the more i think about it, the more i just don't understand??? HE was the one that constantly wanted to hang out and just chill listening to music or watch a show. HE was the one that told me he talked about me to his friends and his fucking brother ( i have proof). HE was the one that told me how it made him really happy that i was good with kids &amp; close to my nephew. HE was the one that wanted me to come over and meet his family. HE was the one that offered to go on a beach day trip when i said i hadn't been to the beach in this area yet. HE was the one making ""us"" and ""we"" statements like ""you gotta learn for the both of us"" (when we were talking about rolling joints/blunts). HE was the one that first said ""i miss you"" or ""i'm glad i saw you, i've missed you"". HE was the one constantly looking at me and just smiling at me when we would just be watching a show or just showing each other funny things on our phones. HE was the one that was goofing off while we would cuddle and literally stick his fingers in my nose to fix my septum piercing (which is not really a big deal, but even my sisters wouldn't do that). I really, really like him and i thought he really, really liked me because of all these things and things were going well. all in all, i'm just confused. defining what we were freaked him out, but when i was nauseous for almost a week straight and was scared i was pregnant and told him, it didn't freak him out at all???? i got the literal message that he wanted to end things because he thinks we wouldn't;t work, but i'm still just so confused. am i wrong for trying to dtr after all these signs??? did i misread these signs???? if he ends up coming back (which i doubt but we'll see. my friend is convinced he'll hum before september), do i take him back and we move on???

it's 5am and ive to stay out of bed because it's soaked by him and im feeling pretty much done with this shit.

ive no idea how to stop it, ive made the point pretty clear that he's supposed to go in the litterbox not my bed, the litterbox is perfectly clean and it doesnt matter to him whether or not it's dirty or not. he pisses on my bed EVERY night and it's not an exaggeration.

However, I am not a firm believer in not eating for 15 days. I am not 100% sure if it's a bluff, or if they're actually going to avoid food for 15 days. What I do know is that it's not the way to lose weight and it may in fact be dangerous: low blood sugar, weakness, etc. I have already expressed my concerns to her in many different ways but it doesn't seem to be effective. This is why I've turned to r/Advice to ask for some help.

So, what do you guys think is the best course of action in this case?",07Jul2020,1

289,"Hi everyone! 

I’ve been scratching my head about this subject for a couple days because at the point I am at I’m not sure what to do. 

Some background information: I’m 17, going into my senior year, and I live in Florida. 

My school district has given us the option to pick between attending going to traditional school or online school. The selection is due next week. I’m very very torn right now.


I asked my parents about it, and they have decided to give me the freedom of choice. But, I need someone who’s removed from the high school environment to give me their opinion or what they would do in my situation.

If I go to traditional school, I risk catching coronavirus, which could potentially infect my parents (mid 50s). I don’t want to do that. The school has said that if you don’t feel comfortable after a few weeks of traditional schooling, you can make the switch to virtual schooling. The catch is once you’re in virtual school, you’re stuck there till the end of the 1st semester (sometime in December). 

Virtual schooling would be a lot easier. It’s the same platform as before, and I only have two high school credits till I can graduate. I’m graduating a semester early anyways, so I could accelerate the process if I decided to do online.

This all comes with a price. I’ve heard a lot of people say that traditional schooling allows for a more lively social life. I have a job, so part of that is counteracted.

I guess I know that virtual schooling is the most logical choice, but what would you guys do in my situation?",07Jul2020,1
290,"I deal with general anxiety on a day to day basis, it’s been a significant thing for me ever since early high school. After many failed attempts at seeing a therapist you start to just live with it and find ways to cope on your own. Sometimes I forget it’s genuinely a problem and not something everyone experiences because I’ve become so accustomed to it. 

I’m currently living with my mother after a bad break up months ago and long story short her and I have had a rocky relationship the past few years. I also have two year old twin brothers who also live in the house and if the stress of my relationship with her didn’t drive me to the edge they certainly do. I’ve found several grey hairs recently. 

I’m not eating like I should. I weigh 109-113 pounds and my daily calorie intake has to be around 900-1000. I feel groggy, zoned out and irritable most of the time. I have almost no appetite and when I do I eat about one meal and feel completely full. No breakfast, no lunch, just dinner. 

Recently I’ve noticed my hair is starting to fall out more than usual and it’s truthfully really scared me and given me a wake up call to how I’ve been unintentionally treating my body. It’s not about looks, its purely just a neglect of myself. Wether it’s derived from anxiety, depression, or stress i just can’t seem to get out of the cycle. 

I went online to look for answers as to why I’m losing a shit ton of hair recently, (and yes I know the normal human loses up to 100 strands a day, let me tell you it’s definitely more than that) and stumbled upon crash dieting. 

I’m doing it. Fully unintentionally but I’ve been doing it. My way of eating just became one of those things I let slip under the radar and didn’t think much else of and now I’m realizing just how much damage I’m doing to my body by basically starving myself all day and having one small meal at night. It makes me feel extra frustrated because I have no appetite to remind me to eat during the day and I’m just feeling very defeated right now. 

Please, can anyone give me solid advice on how to approach this and start working on and fixing it",07Jul2020,1

292,"So typically I, (23f), have had no troubles falling asleep at night. I’ve always loved sleeping in complete darkness and feel that sleeping with a night light or tv causes me to get less restful sleep. Well, starting at the end of May, I was living in my old apartment and my roommate moved out. I spent the night there for about 5-6 nights by myself and felt extremely paranoid every single night. My cat never acted up or anything though so I assumed that it was just being alone that was getting to me. Well, now I live in a new apartment with a new roommate (that I’ve been friends with for a long time), and my paranoia has gotten worse. When I try to lay in the dark I just end up shining my flashlight into my room and looking around at least once every minute. Sometimes when I am on the edge of sleep, I feel like something/someone presses down on my bed by my legs but that’s probably just my paranoid imagination. I’ve been feeling slightly depressed lately as well as missing human interaction (haven’t even hung out w someone of the opposite sex in a year, let alone have do anything like have sex for example) so maybe that’s getting to me?? I can’t tell but I am not a person who does well with fear or not getting enough sleep. I tried to do a meditation but laying there in the dark listening to a whispering voice gave me even more anxiety. To top things off, Netflix took my ultimate comfort movie, Julie &amp; Julia, off.

293,"When I was a little kid I would always like school. l read all the time, and liked learning. It wasn’t until 4th grade that I began to care less about school and dislike it, I began to get distracted/ be distracting in class, I stopped doing assignments out of pure laziness, my grades kept getting worse, and I only got worse as time passed. I’m not dumb, and I tend to pick things up fairly quickly but I don’t put effort into my school work anymore.

294,"I’m not really sure what to do. I would love if you could help me. I live with my uncle still after my family died when I was pretty young. He’s a good person and I am glad he was nice enough to take me in at an early age. I have no other extended family so I would be in foster care otherwise. But despite him being a good person I think there may be something wrong with him. He doesn’t talk to me at all sometimes we share three words a day. He keeps to himself mostly sticking to his “work”. I don’t really know what he does but he’s always doing something. All of this is relatively normal for a middle aged man, but when he “gets home” (I’ve seen him come around the back and come in the front door and tell me he was at work) he is often very sweaty and covered in dirt. I figured he worked construction but he never really told me what he did he just says he works and gets pressed if I keep asking. Anyways, he will go in the backyard with a shovel and descend into what I assume to be at least a 20 foot hole at this point. He “digs” as he calls it. The hole is so deep now that he literally disappears into the hole and it’s really deep. He does this every night. I don’t see him much at all. I assume he does this through the night as well because sometimes I do not hear him return to the house. 

Another thing that sets me off is his “library” he has books such as “Truth of the Underground” and “Buried Secrets” “Lost Lineage: The Anatomy of Giants” 

All of these books talk about, I guess, giants who used to live underground? I’m not really sure as I haven’t read them only skipped through pages, but what I did read was pretty jarring. One of the books claims humans used to live underground and be 12 feet tall, due to the increased gravity. The books say being underground is where humans should reside, as sun gives us cancer and the earth used to be much closer to the core. It also says being underground advances your intellect.

I have not asked him about anything as I’m scared he might react in a crazy way. Am I overreacting or does this sound weird to anyone?",07Jul2020,1

298,"I am a 27M Canadian.

The last job I had I worked 14 hours a day for 21-24 days in a row. 4 days off in between.

On those days off I would come home to a sense of misery and emptiness. I was living in my miserable home town where I had no significant other. and no friends. In the year and a half I spent there I socialized IRL with people outside of my family a grand total of six times.  And the only ""hobby"" I could put my time into was gaming.

The job before that I worked in a car wash spraying off cars. 

I was paid $11 per hour and worked 30 hours per week at MAX even though I was supposed to be a full time employee. My biggest paycheque was $720. 

The conditions were cold, wet, and miserable. We weren't allowed to leave our area to help other people and the constant drying fans made any sort of conversation impossible. 

And outside of work I never had the money to go out and do things. And the schedule was only ever made the week of. so scheduling days off to do things was next to impossible. 

Eventually I had to take time off because I was getting trench foot. The leaky boots I had to bring from home and wear because the company wouldn't provide any that actually fit me were creating the perfect conditions for it. I was ""laid off"" that week. 

I'm sick and tired of that shit. I'm not going to live that kind of life any more. So in the last few years I decided to go back to school. At first I didn't know what I was going for but I knew I needed to be there. My school grades weren't great when I graduated. due to a special ed misdiagnosis forced on me from an early age. 

There are papers clearly stating I'm not, but I was constantly bullied and hated doing schoolwork (which the misdiagnosis made worse, all of my academic accomplishments were dismissed because ""I had help/Had easier work"") even though my test marks were consistently high. The school basically told my parents if I didn't have an official diagnosis I would be expelled.

Recently I realized that I would like to be a teacher. And I was going through the process of pointing my education down that path when the pandemic hit. Luckily my next term is slated to start in winter. 

I've been very lucky to receive funding to be a full time student through a number of means. 
And while I'm more than happy to work a part time job to help ends meet. I need to keep pursuing my education. That is my number one priority and I cannot lose sight of it. And jobs are not exactly easy to find at this time. and I don't really want to go out pounding the pavement and shaking hands if I don't have to.

But somehow. My open distrust of employers due to my previous experiences working and the hard time I had in school has somehow sent the message to some of my family that I'm just a lazy fuck who doesn't want to work. and wants to just sit back and live off of welfare. 

The constant assumption that I am is just making me feel like shit. 

Living that life put me into a deep depression that I've only recently been able to claw my way out of with the help of medication. I don't want to be pushed back there.

It's not that I don't want to work. 

I just don't want to work a dead end miserable job that treats me like shit and leaves me no time or resources to live a happy fulfilling life.

is there a good way to communicate this to my family?",07Jul2020,1

3. My mom forces me dress provocatively, especially with exposing bathing suits, and with extremely short shorts.

I told my sister but then she got mad at me, screaming it was her pet and kicking me out of her room. I told my parents, but the refuse to help as well. They explain it’s her responsibility and she knows the most about her animal.

She never takes Lex out, she forgets to feed him, she doesn’t clean his cage, and she hasn’t bathed him in weeks. His health as fallen and he spends most of his day with his head on his heated rock. He’s clearly depressed and she doesn’t even care. I have tried to take steps to save this poor animal, but my sister won’t let me touch him, so it’s been really hard.

I have wound up living in my parents house after graduating college and honestly I just think COVID-19 is a convenient excuse of a reason why. Each day I feel as though I'm spiraling, careening between waves of ignorant bliss, and rampant anxiety. I don't know if this is just the way the real world works and I've just been too sheltered my whole life -- this would make the answer a ""pull myself up from my bootstraps' sorta deal. Or if it is the result of psychological issues I have, and need to get figured out for my own good sooner rather than later. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ok here's my story. I'll make it as detailed as necessary, I'm so scared to say all this right now my hands are shaking so I want to keep my anonymity.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a fortunate person. I grew up in a safe part of the country with a wealthy extended family I was very close with. I am lucky, my parents set aside enough money for me to go to a private university debt-free. I am a straight white male and I understand all the privilege that comes with being just that (although I don't approve of it). 

I have always gotten good grades without having to try particularly hard and without ever cheating. Even in college I double majored across two colleges of my university (communications and history degrees) and achieved a cumulative GPA around 3.25. I achieved all of this while doing all the things professors told you not to (cramming before tests, starting projects a mere week in advance, working until seconds from the online deadline, drinking excessively). I do admit that I probably had too much fun in college, opting to work at the campus bar and spend my time in campus extra-curriculars instead of experience-building internships. The latter is what it seemed like most of my peers did, and internships were readily available to me. The issue was that whenever I even thought to apply for one anxiety always overcame me. I knew how much I **should** get one to have an advantage going into the work force but I never could bring myself to actually take the first step. I always thought, ""There's still time for me to fit it in before graduation."" That time never came.

A few months before graduation I was anxiety-ridden with need for a job that I was sure I wasn't prepared for. Because of this I went with a flashy sales job that hired me 1 week after interviewing me and promised great benefits and pay -- as long as you made the sales, instead of a job in Public Relations which is the field I actually am passionate about. In my naivety I took the job without even knowing what I was selling. In fact, I just told you about everything I knew regarding the company and job I took when I accepted it. Everything besides the figures of the payment &amp; exact benefits. I graduated from my well-renowned private university in 2019 and started my job a week after.

Turned out the company was a total flop. They threw me out into the field after 1 job shadow and 2 days of training. 1 JOBSHADOW AND 2 DAYS OF TRAINING. The job was selling a quite overpriced, moderately-useful business SEO (Search Engine Optimization) product as a third party provider. They taught me no data to back up my bold claims made in the 2:30 speech they had me memorize. I said the speech (word-for-word preferred) to each small locally-owned businessman and woman in my couple of zip codes -- zip codes that I quickly was convinced had already been picked over by similar salespeople. Leaving only the most calloused and rude potential clients. Like a picked-clean Water Buffalo on the Sahara with nothing left that anything larger than a beetle can eat.

After 2 weeks doing everything they taught me to do, reading and rereading the handbook they gave me and putting what I read into practice, I had no sales on the books. I was promptly and emotionlessly let go, having only met 3 of my co-workers in the company. I got the feeling this happens a lot. Additionally, the company had a policy where I wasn't allowed to have a letter of recommendation written for me from an employee of theirs. I was completely congenial, high-energy, and polite in all my dealings with my supervisor irl and online. I was even calm and composed during my firing when I wanted to shout back ""ARE YOU KIDDING ME?"" Even that was all for nothing. Now the obvious thing to point out here is that I must've been a lousy salesmen. No talent for the job. But that's not true! I've been a very charismatic, confident, and comfortable person to speak to my entire life. I was the kid in high school who MC'd the pep rallies and always aced my speeches in college. 

This really took the wind out of my sales but I promised to myself that I would get back in the saddle and start heavily applying to positions in my original preferred field, public relations. I applied to a few positions but that lack of confidence and experience due to lack of an internship came through and I never made it past a first interview. I realized I needed to get an internship now as a post-grad and the old anxiety came back. I felt like I was moving backwards while all my peers were skating along. I made half-assed applications to a couple openings.

In July after my May graduation, I took a bartending job and became fully committed to it as well as working out. I was able to pay the bills with occasional help from my parents who were always willing and understanding of my situation. My life before COVID was spent bartending and working out nearly every day and maybe sending a resume out every two weeks. A couple times I got really close to landing internships, too. And when I was so close I was super excited. I knew that that's what I truly wanted. I just never quite got the offer on my few attempts. And the excitement from nearly getting offers didn't come close to the anxiety of applying for them in the first place.

Now that COVID hit I feel more like an out of work bartender than a recent college grad looking for a job in his field which terrifies me because I know I want to try my hand in public relations. Feelings of disgrace, self-disappointment, and inability to change especially hit when the class of 2020 virtually threw their hats in the air. I have spent my days during COVID living back in my parents house earning no money and feeling terrible. I go to my apartment once a week to see my girlfriend (who is honestly the highlight of my life at this point) and just to get a change of scenery.

Another amplifier is the close-knit extended family I mentioned much earlier. I am the youngest of a large extended Irish-Catholic family (I stopped practicing Catholicism a long time ago - veeeeery atheist now). I have around 20 older cousins who all seemed to land right on their feet out of university (many going to the same university as me and majoring in more 'practical' fields). Growing up, I always looked up to them in near-adoration. Now I feel patronized, verbally abused (and I'm a bartender so that's saying something), and anxiety-ridden anytime I have to see them. I desperately want to love them again.

Now I have been a weed user since probably my sophomore year of college. Using marijuana has enabled me to have many of the introspective thoughts I've written about in this post. But could the marijuana have caused all the problems in the first place?

&amp;#x200B;

One funny thing is I am sure I am not the only one like this. I'm sure there are thousands of people just like me every year who are in my position, and many more that have made it through a similar situation in the past. Either ending up a failed degree-holder, or a successful one depending on how you eventually dealt with your circumstances. **That's why I'm very hopeful for this reddit post!**

&amp;#x200B;

What is my issue? What do I need to understand/How do I need to change my behavior to get over this biggest issue in my life so far?

&amp;#x200B;

What I'm looking for is not just a small piece of advice but major guidance and I therefore understand that I may not get what I really need just from one Reddit post. Because of this I would love recommendations of organizations, pieces of literature, mentorship programs, or anything else!

307,"I’ve been working at the job I’m currently working at for over a year now. It was my first job I ever had and I know I had a lot to learn. One coworker I have has been with the company since the branch opened two years prior. He was never my superior or my manager, simply a full timer to my part time. He took it upon himself to show me the ropes when I got started and I was grateful for his time and knowledge. He started slowly becoming less kind as my first week went on. Nothing I did was ever as perfect as he wanted me to be and he started becoming more and more controlling. After a miscommunication and misunderstanding he yelled at me till I was in tears and told the managers his side of the story. After I told the managers at the time how he had been treating me they simply told me that he was just trying to do his job and that I just needed to take what he was saying with a grain of salt.

As the months went on he started to get even more verbally abusive. I tried my best to be kind to him to the point of bringing him baked goods and complimenting him any chance I could. Regardless he still treated me like garbage. It was incredibly hard for me to understand because the managers had told me how great of a job I was doing and customers were leaving positive reviews online mentioning how kind or helpful I was. Everyone else I worked with thought I was doing a great job, except for him. So I swallowed my pride and told myself that if I worked harder I could prove to him I could do my job well. 

Recently due to the pandemic my store was shut down for 3 months, In this time I had stayed in contact with my managers who told me how adamantly they wanted me back. When rehiring started they first invited the people who worked full time then invited the part timers who had been there longest. This second set of workers was the set I was apart of. From the day I got back the abusive coworker would refuse to answer any of my questions and somehow managed to treat me even more like garbage. Some of the things he had done to me include

telling other coworkers not to speak to me because if I’m spoken to I “get distracted and won’t do my job” 

Tell me my parents raised me wrong because of my beliefs 

Refuse to give me tasks and then gives them to other less qualified employees 

Tell other staff members that the reason I left my previous job I had gotten around Christmas was because I was lazy 

Claim to be given reprimands from managers that told him to tell me 
Ex “ XXXX told me to tell you that you’re doing this wrong and that if you keep doing this you’ll get fired” 

Yell at me for taking my scheduled breaks 

Yell at me for drinking water 

Passed along tasks that he was assigned to me while he told the manager I wasn’t working 

Constant belittlement and overreaction for minor mistakes 
Ex: putting a hanger in the wrong hanger slot, folding a clothing item that is hung, moving an item of clothing out of the way of a drawer 

Harassment of my friends and family when or if they come into the store as paying customers 
Ex: yelling at them not to touch anything, following them around the store, saying they’re not allowed to speak to me while I’m on the clock 

Toke away tasks to give to other coworkers even if the task was assigned to me by a manager 

Claims my sexuality is invalid because of where I choose to eat 
Ex: “you are not LGBT because you ate at a restaurant that donated money to *charity that doesn’t support the lgbt community*”

Swore at me in front of customers 

Refuses to let me have a bathroom break 

Told customers not to ask me questions because “I had no clue what I was talking about” 

Told management I was a liar on multiple occasions even if there were witnesses to prove I wasn’t 

Told my significant other that he thought I was a moron before he knew we were together 

Told me that I will infect others because I’m unclean when I handed a coworker a wrapped piece of candy 

Told me my clothes were out of dress code even though I had asked every single manager I had at the time before I wore it to work 
Ex: white work shirts with the company logo that had been tie dyed 

And finally spread rumors to other coworkers that I was STEALING FROM THE BACK STOCK 

I talked to the new managers about this and they told me that they would talk to him about his behavior because I was joy the only employee to have problems with him. It’s hard because I know for a fact that he will not change his behavior and that the only way it will stop is if I quit. I love my job and want to work there but it’s so hard to get up and go to work when you know that no matter what you do you’ll never be good enough. I wouldn’t take this as personally if these were actually complaints from a manager but the fact of the matter is all of my managers praise me and constantly tell me how much they love having me work there. 

We have an anonymous hotline to call about these things but I’m so scared that they’ll just dismiss it because I’m young or tell me I’m just overreacting. What should I do? Any advice at all would be helpful",07Jul2020,1

Months ago he told me this before. He said it’s creepy that I like him still. 
The only “creepy things I done” was
I got the same instrument he plays because it motivated me and he’s a great player. But that’s it. I do say the words he says like “Ye, lmao, 🤣” those are the things he says a lot.  
And after each time I end the friendship I come back.


That’s it. 
I told him I don’t like him anymore. He said back “Sureee” I told him to shut up. And he said “There you go. Proven my point” I asked him what he meant. Because that’s just a word. He is thinking that. He doesn’t know for certain if I like him. 
He still thinks I like him. And I want him to think I don’t.

313,"I’ve been looking for apartments lately and found a listing that was great for my budget and included all utilities. My biggest complaint, upon seeing it in person, was that it was fairly filthy. There was dust and dirt in the corners, floor, and inside cabinet shelves. I even saw a few dead bugs on the floor near the kitchen area. There was a dirty towel flung on the bathroom floor and some dirt in the sink and tub. Apart from all of that, it had the basic necessities and everything else seemed pretty functional, though not sparkling.


I know I could just clean up if I were to try to get the apartment, but doesn’t this say a lot about the lady who would potentially be my landlord? Why didn’t she bother cleaning it up and making it look presentable? What might she do if I actually needed a repair on something?


I think it’s a good deal for an apartment—affordable for me, close to my work, and all utilities included—but I’m just so put off by the fact that she didn’t lift a finger to clean it in order to show it to prospective tenants. Am I overreacting or overthinking it? Would I be crazy to pass up this deal, or does she stand out as a neglectful potential landlord?


(Note: This wasn’t an apartment in a building; it was a separate guesthouse trying to get rented out. Also, there were no tenants in there and it was mainly unfurnished.)",07Jul2020,1

322,"I recently broke up with my boyfriend of \~3 years because being away from him during quarantine made me realize how toxic and manipulative he was. I should have broken up with him sooner and feel very dumb and disgusted with myself for staying so long.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, last year I was living with my then-boyfriend and I signed a lease to live with him and a mutual friend for next year. I have cried a lot about this and feel sick to my stomach every time I think about it.  Please does anyone have any advice for how I can handle this next year? I really don't want to make my friend/third roommate uncomfortable and like he has to mediate or choose between us because that's very unfair. I will go out of my way to avoid making my friend regret living with us. I really don't want to cook for my ex (we agreed last year to each cook one shared meal a week)  but I probably will just to keep the peace.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to set strong boundaries. If I don't have rules in place to follow I am very easy to manipulate into feeling like I'm in the wrong and doing things I later feel unhappy about. I just don't know what rules to have for myself so that I don't make our roommate uncomfortable and yet I can still feel independent and strong to not cater to my ex.

&amp;#x200B;

I hate my ex so much and really don't want to ever see him again. He doesn't even realize how poorly he treated me and thinks it was all ok which makes me really upset. I already signed the lease though and I need to live there to attend school. I just desperately need some advice about how to handle this. I would normally try to stay out of the house as much as possible but with the pandemic, it would be irresponsible to visit friends constantly and I also want to be able to come home and feel safe.

323,"I am (F28) in a relationship of 11 years with my boyfriend (M27). A few years ago my boyfriend asked if it was okay if I bought him things for his garden. I said yes. He asked if it was really okay, and I said yes. One time I asked him (I don't know why it's my money) if I could buy a Hazbin Hotel enamel pin. It was a little heart design with Angel Dust on it. He told me, ""You don't need it."" Years later I let him know I wanted to buy a different Hazbin Hotel enamel pin. It is a Niffty enamel pin. I was able to buy it.

For the past few weeks, I'm not sure how to describe the feeling. But I feel low when he talks about my cheque and looks forward to it and list all these things he wants to buy. I didn't mind before, I was happy to help him financially. But as time progressed I've been buying things for his cockatiels, his gecko, and recently bought him a frog. My best friend (his mom) couldn't afford to pay most of the things they wanted to buy at the pet store, so I was happy to help pay for it. It was a spur of the moment buy for them.

I've been buying Amazon cards and credit card gift cards for him to buy things online. I have been able to buy a few things on Amazon with his help, and I am grateful, but recently I've been wanting to buy things from other websites. Today he asked if I wanted to get anything. I said, ""Yeah, but not on Amazon."" He asked what I wanted. I showed him that I wanted to buy Therainsole insoles. I let him know that it's good for posture as I have a forward head posture. My upper back has been hurting for a few days. He told me, ""You don't need it."" I just stood there looking at the time on his desktop and said, ""...okay."" He asked twice what was wrong but I said, ""Nothing."" He said that I just need to sit up straight in my chair. He also said I need a new computer chair because I'm on my computer most of the day. I use a dining chair. I have a small desk that's a small table with a small drawer. I only have 6 bankers boxes of all of my things, including a guitar case, winter jacket and fall jacket that are under the house in storage. I don't want to call them hoarders, but they do have a lot of stuff.

I wrote down all of my thoughts in my notebook app on my phone, but I was too scared to read it to him. Eventually, I decided not to and forgot about it until today. I worry that he will get mad and say, ""I thought it was okay that you would buy things for me?"" His parents are middle class, and I know they wouldn't be able to afford to buy the things that he wants.

I never have enough money to buy groceries. I eat my best friend's food, and I always feel bad, even though my best friend and her husband see nothing wrong with it. I'm supposed to be buying my own groceries once a week. The only things I spend money on per month is the Happy Helper Plan on Pocket Camp, which is $3.99/month, and my phone bill, which is $22.40/month. Every now and then I am able to buy things from the grocery store. It wasn't fruit and vegetables that I would like to buy, as there isn't enough room in the fridges. But recently, I bought Budweiser non-alcoholic beer, Compliments caramel flavoured hot chocolate, Mentos gum, and a coffee crisp. What has been keeping me happy is when I get to buy a venti vanilla bean frappuccino from Starbucks. I buy fast food when my boyfriend is craving it.

I'm sorry if I'm rambling. I know I should be talking about this to a therapist, but due to the pandemic, I can't do that, and I'm not sure when the pandemic will be over. I really want therapy. I'm sad.

I feel like I'm being a pushover and a people pleaser. I want to say that I don't want to spend money on him anymore, but at the same time, I want to say that he can ask me if he wants me to buy something for him. I'm sorry if that doesn't make sense.

Later that day, I sent him a message thanking him for inviting me to the server. He said it was no problem, but didn’t continue the conversation. Today, I sent him a text, but he said he was about to eat lunch so I didn’t send him anything else. He never responded again.  


It’s only been a day and a half since I had real conversation with him, but with how early it is in our relationship I’m just a little worried. He hasn’t blocked me or removed me from the DND server, so he doesn’t hate me, but he did mention that most of his previous online relationships did fizzle out slowly, and I’m worried that will happen if I stop trying to make an effort here.

336,"This is going to be a huge wall of text full of rambling so I apologize in advance. But I need advice on what to do with myself.

I'm a 24 year old heterosexual male, living with my parents in the United States, currently suffering from diagnosed depression and anxiety disorders. I don't even know where to begin but I think establishing a timeline is important. My depression and anxiety symptoms started roughly in my third year in high school, however, at that point in time I was able to cope with my symptoms and managed to have a lot of good memories. During middle school and the first year in high school I was bullied, but got through it easily and developed a great network of friendships. Throughout high school these friendships flourished having it's ups and downs, but in the end, I had surrounded myself with amazing people who wanted to be around me and vice versa. 

When I graduated I kept in great contact with everyone and my depression was still present but the excitement of starting college and pursing my dream of being an artist was so persistent that I got through well. Things went great the first 2 semesters but then friends started moving away as they do after graduating, and I came to the realization that I haven't actually befriended someone new for years and I didn't know how to. I tried talking to people but I was never able to connect with anyone or form any kind of relationship like I had with the friends I developed early in high school. (Six years later and I still have not learned how to establish meaningful relations with anyone, and in fact most of my provided relationships like my family and few friends who I do still stay in contact with, have essentially deteriorated to a point where all I can give to them are completely fake and false responses or answers, at least it feels that way.) 

After community college for a year 1/2 I moved to Colorado and lived with a roommate, a friend from high school, to attend University and this is when my mental illness truly derailed me. I'm starting to realize this is going on very slowly so I will summarize what happened during my first year at university. However, in order to do this I need to mention that I developed an addiction to cigarettes and I started smoking marijuana in high school. Both of them were purely a social habit and I would never smoke by myself, it was purely a means to fit in. However, towards the end of high school when I started working full time, and the start of college, I developed a full blown addiction to cigs going through a pack a day at the age of 18. The same goes for my marijuana smoking, it became purely a means to cope with my depression and anxiety symptoms, and I would smoke all day just to have that temporary relief. Anyway, so back to my first year in Colorado: I worked full time while attended school full time. I started smoking concentrated THC, and eventually starting smoking so much I would be high for months at a time, every waking moment high off wax. I started failing in classes. I then stopped attended certain classes to the point where one day in an attempt to salvage my self I walked into a class and sat down to listen to the lecture and it was the mid term and I had only been to class once without even realizing how much time had past. I dropped classes and failed the others. I got enrolled into the student's mental health offices and was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder, this is rough 2015-16 I believe. I get prescribed medication and I start talking with a therapist. I get back on track but my roommate looses his job because he doesn't want to drive in the snow so he stays home. He is jobless for 3 months and does nothing to find employment. He tells me he is leaving to go back home 2 days before the flight and he leaves all his trash and furniture. I have to pay for everything, terminating the lease I leave and go back home to live with my parents who at this point also moved to Colorado. 

By this point, my depression had completely rooted itself inside me. It had taken control of everything I did and didn't do. My anxiety was worse than ever and I hardly ever got out of bed and when I did I played video games or went to classes. This is the point in the last six years of battling my mental illness that I start to have memory lapses which I believe are due to my extended marijuana use and my physical and mental health. It's hard to remember the order things happened but essentially I went to community college for a bit and changed medications a few times and started getting a grasp on things again. I decided to move to Denver to live on my own in a studio apartment, and this is when things got even worse. I lived in the studio apartment for a little over a year until I couldn't handle it anymore and had to live with my parents again for their support. But during that time the same things happened. I did good in school to start off with but eventually started to decline. I started smoking heavily again, had no friends and this time no family to be with, I was truly isolated. I felt detached from society and even from my self, often feeling depersonalized. I moved in with my father for 5 months, then moved to Texas to live with my mother and brother and to finish my degree which is where I am currently living.

Now that this rough timeline is established, I want to talk about what i'm currently dealing with. I've essentially stopped talking, I spend most of my time sitting in my room completely alone from my family playing video games for 12-15 hours a day. When I do leave my room I say as little words as possible to avoid any interaction with my family or roommate (different friend from high school, not the Colorado guy. I am again high all day, however, I do my best to avoid my family knowing i'm smoking so I spend time trying to avoid being seen leaving my room or exiting through the side door. I've stopped taking medication months ago but I know I really need to start taking them again but I feel like I can't do anything. I have episodes of depersonalization where I feel like i'm just witnessing time go by and i'm doing the exact same thing day after day. I have periods of time where I have uncontrollable anger and I lash out at my family only to immediately have a feeling of numbness like I am feeling absolutely no emotion. There have been times where my mother is crying, telling me she feels horrible for me and how she worries about me and wants to help yet I feel absolutely no emotion when she tells me, but months down the line I cry randomly thinking about this because I can't feel emotion some times and I can't imagine what that does to my mother to see me.  A few months ago I was more social with my family, but because of my illness I developed a horrible anger problem and would get upset with them so now I just don't talk at all. 

Over this past year my depression has taken almost all of my interests away, I don't find fulfillment in playing games anymore, I don't know what to play, I don't know what to watch on TV or Netflix anymore, I don't get pleasure in smoking weed anymore in fact I feel more anxious than ever when I smoke but I have a moment of relief for 30m-1hr after I smoke that I try to get to. Most of my days I have what I would call dense brain fog and I often loose my train of thought abruptly as in I will be thinking of something and then suddenly can't finish my sentence in my mind as if a flip was switched and I can't continue the sentence anymore. I attempted suicide in November of 2018 and I haven't told anyone except for my step brother and some streamer on Twitch. I got extremely drunk and starting taking tons of pills, tried to cut myself but couldn't bring myself to do it, took more pills and went to sleep completely okay to die. I woke up after 20 hours of sleeping and didn't tell anyone for months. I don't want to kill myself, and the one thing that keeps me from doing it is my family and what it would do to them. I can never do that to my family because they have always supported me and I can't imagine the devastation it would bring to my family, drinking took that reasoning away from me and so I don't drink anymore. I haven't been drunk once since then. 

I started taking LSD so that I can temporarily have a break from my bleak reality and experience something extreme to my senses, and I have had roughly twenty or so trips, but the last four or five have been nothing but anxiety filled and extremely uncomfortable and I no longer want to take it anymore. I constantly feel like i'm seeing things in the corner of my eye and I often have moments where I feel like I am tripping, where I will see text start to vibrate but I feel like these are placebo hallucinations. 

 I've started to see a therapist but I have such a hard time communicating outside of the internet, and he tells me all these things and they are hard to comprehend sometimes. He reads into my body language when in reality I have no idea what appropriate body language is and i'm just winging it. I'm going to meet with him again in three days but I can't help but feel like its a dead end because I have no idea how to answer any of his questions appropriately. I'm an artist and I haven't drawn anything outside of what was required for school for a year and he asked me what I think it is that is preventing me from working and I truthfully have no idea. I've spent so much time trying to find the answer but I don't know. My depression has over the past six years been episodic, meaning I would have times where I feel good and long time where I felt bad, but the past year 1/2+ has been all bad and I'm at a point where I truthfully have absolutely no idea what It felt like to be happy. 

I just read through everything and I realize that this is a mess, I'm not looking for someone to give me all the answers but if anyone has anything to say I would appreciate it.",07Jul2020,1
338,"Hi I (F19)  was at my friends house (m20) and I was drinking a lot and we were just talking and hanging out and then I full on blacked out like legit no memory for a huge portion of the night my next memory was when I woke up I was in the guest room and he comes in and said “we had sex last night just wanted you to know” so I freaked out and had like a panic attack I have no attraction to him what so ever  I would never be comfortable sleeping with him or want to.

Since then we have talked in depth about what happened. From his perspective I seemed fucked up (was slurring falling over a bit) but I was coherent and having a conversation with him then I asked him if he wanted to hook up, he started having sex with me and in the middle of us hooking up he asked me a question and realized I was incoherent and wasn’t making sense and didn’t know what was going on so he stopped. He then in the next morning thought I probably wouldn’t remember what happened so he told me when he woke me up.

He has apologized and said he should have not agreed to have sex with me seeing how much alcohol I consumed.

I have experienced sexual assault before so I felt pretty triggered by this, it also sucks how I only have his perspective on what happened because I have no memories of the entire night. 

does this sound like an honest mistake and I should work to mend the friendship or should I move on?",07Jul2020,1

How do I do that remotely? Whatsapp groups aren't enough because I don't really know who is the person behind the number. I'm much better with face to face interactions and I'm afraid that it will totally screw my semester.

343,"So I’ve been stuck inside in a small town due to covid still being a large concern and my friend decides to try to hook me up with a girl from a town 5 miles away. She is a year younger than me and is going to the same college I’m going to this fall so I figured I’m interested and told him to go for it. 

I’m not sure exactly what he did but she now knows of me and follows me on Instagram, but that’s the only platform I have her added on. I’m struggling to think of what to DM her because whenever I think of anything my anxiety kicks in and stops me from pressing send. I start worrying that sending unprovoked dms is considered creepy, I worry because I’ve never met her in person and don’t really have an opportunity to because of the quarantine, and I also have absolutely no clue as to what I’d even say because I’ve never met her. 

I feel like “hey” or “what’s up” are low effort and are likely to be ignored or lead to a dead conversation but I’m absolutely beating myself up for not having the guts or the brains to think of anything to say. I’m asking for advice to try to see if I perhaps am overthinking things, or if I’m thinking about it too much because odds are not meeting her in person is enough to just assume it’s not going to happen.

 I appreciate any responses and I’ll try to actively respond for a couple hours, but I do have work on tomorrow and a joint waiting on me so I’ll be going to bed after watching a bit of Netflix.",07Jul2020,1
344,"preface: I know my partner loves me, I just don't know how actually appreciated I am.  He has autism and a slightly lower than average IQ (he wants to retake the test, i think he's incredibly brilliant personally), which contribute to him forgetting things, as well as having had a TBI.

TL;DR:  I do a shit ton for my partner when it comes to getting things together for him, his daughter, and myself.  I help him with classwork and keeping up with due dates.  I just want some cuddles and quality time, but he doesn't see it as important as me.  I feel severely underappreciated but cannot tell him.

I do a lot for my partner, like...  more than the bare minimum when it comes to getting everything together.

I have to put together his daughter's diaper bag, whatever...  stick a few diapers in, wipes, a change of clothes, you're fine.  I sometimes stick her shoes on the wrong feet, but toddler shoes look incredibly similar when it comes to the right and left.

I have to regularly get his work things together.  work shirt, pants, name tag, cigs and lighter, speaker, medicine, phone, keys.  make sure it's all laid out.  whatever, takes like 15 minutes tops if I can't find it, usually just 5 to 10 minutes.  while I'm getting it together, I let him sleep since he works the night shift  (3pm-12am or 6pm-3am.)

I also, obviously, have to get my own stuff together.  not as much as him (or even his daughter), but when I have to run through a check list for not just me or his daughter, but also him, it gets to be *a lot*.

He sometimes gets upset if I forget something, ask if he grabbed something, or ask if he can grab something or do something while I'm trying to get everything together.  Not screaming upset, but he uses the same exhuasted tone you would use with a child who did something wrong (which is worse because I fear disappointing people i love)

I also have to help him keep up with all of his college assignments and I do my best to remind him throughout the week of what he needs to do.  sometimes I'll forget something, but I have a whole ass planner that's color coded to his classes.  If I forget to remind him of something, hell say something like ""I guess I'll just fail then."" in the same exhausted tone.

I tell him I'm doing my best, that I did the planner *for him* and that I do my best to make sure he has everything but I forget sometimes.

I don't ask for a lot to feel appreciated.  no big dinners, no big present, just physical non sexual touch and quality time.

I tell him that cuddles make me feel loved, but he's gotten upset in the past because ""wouldn't you rather be loved than just have the illusion of love""?  We have had an argument about this before that resulted in me crying because I just wanted some cuddles to feel loved but he didn't want cuddles at that time and started talking about (I can't remember the actual term but like depreciation in cars, the more you get of something the less it matters).  This does not apply to me when it comes to cuddles and physical affection, I am never happier than I am when we are cuddling.

He also considers it to be quality time for him to be on the laptop.  It's hard to cuddle him when he's on the laptop, because he'll move a lot and I have like 10% of his attention.

our sex life is great, but when I don't feel appreciated as a person I sometimes just feel like an object.",07Jul2020,1

348,"For context: I am a 17F, and my little sister is 12. We both live with our mom (34F) who is 5 years sober (after being a severe alcoholic and coke addict for most of our lives). We have different dads who are not currently present. My sister has been diagnosed with ADHD and Dyslexia, and has severe anger issues (to the point of physical aggression). I believe she has other mental illnesses because she has very bizarre behavior and mental illness (bipolar, schizophrenia, and BPD) run in the family. My mom doesn’t believe in mental illness so she won’t take her to get a diagnosis.

So the problem:

My sister does basically whatever she wants and is NEVER punished for any of it. Whenever we get in fights, no matter what she does, I am always accused of being in the wrong because “I’m older”. Even when she is physically aggressive, my mom tells me that I should just “lay down and wait it out.” For more context, my sister and I are almost the same size, she’s a few inches shorter and we weigh about the same.

She is a very aggressive person. During fights, she screams at the top of her lungs at me, has full on jumped on top of me, has pulled my hair, pushed me, punched me, threw a heavy glass at my chest, has threatened me with a knife, and has bit me. She has also torn apart my favorite books, has messed up my room by throwing everything in my drawers on my floor, threw my laptop, knocked over my desk, and lately has been spitting in my food or purposely messing it up when I’m making it. 

I’m not a very physical person, so I try not to fight because I don’t like to (result of trauma possibly). I have never started anything physically aggressive unless it’s been me fighting back against her.

She’s also very rude. She usually starts the fights (always the first one to start yelling). She tells me that she hates me everyday, calls me names (a whore, slut, a bitch, a “drug addict” etc), steals my things all the time (then claims they were hers in the first place then fights with me until I give up), can be physically aggressive with our cat, etc. She is very lazy, and constantly messes up the house (which I am expected to clean thoroughly everyday or I’m yelled at) and never helps even though it’s usually 90% her mess. Whenever I try to talk to her about any problems I have, she always mimics me or covers her ears and screams “BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH” until I stop. 

I’m not innocent either. When we fight, I will say things to push her buttons. I will say mean things to her and scream back when she provokes me enough. 

My mom never punishes her or even talks to her. I’ve tried to talk to my mom about it and she always just tells me that I’m not the parent, and that it “takes two to tango.” She tells me that I’m older and that the situation is fine. My mom is hardly there as a parent at all. 

I know that I’m not a victim of her- she’s 12 after all- but sometimes I feel like it. I feel like there’s nothing I can do. I don’t know how to stop the fighting. I don’t know how to de-escalate the situation when she comes into my room and screams at me and won’t leave until I give her what I want. How do I deal with this situation? I would really appreciate some advice, thanks for taking the time to read this!",07Jul2020,1

356,"I'm a Romanian that has a medical school offer in the UK. I've lived in the UK for a while. It was a rural area and I went to a boarding school (but I was a day girl). Due to covid19 by the time October hits I would've been back home, in Romania, for 6 months. I had fun in the UK, but it always felt a bit... off. I couldn't wait for half-term to come so that I could go home and see all my friends and family. Through the 6 years of medical school I'll go home less and less and this will become even less frequent when I become a junior doctor. I'm not sure I want to do that. My parents really really want me to go to the UK, and they sort of pay for my existence. I'll become less dependant on them through uni but I won't be able to be financially independent for a while. And I love them, I don't want to upset them over a minor preference. Maybe uni will be very different from school and I'll make friends and enjoy it. I made a list of pros and cons for each place  


Romania:  


Pros  


* I have friends here
* I'm used to this place and it feels familiar
* I don't see myself actually spending my future in the UK. I'd want to come back home anyways after a while (but that could change)

Cons

* I have been told really bad things about the quality of medical education here
* I haven't been to a school-based on the Romanian system with kids/teachers who are mostly Romanian since I was 10. 
* My parents would be angry beyond words if I stayed
* I'd have to take out a year to study for the entrance exam  


England:

Pros  


* I heard that the quality of education is very good there
* My parents like it and they'd probably be happier if they lived there with me
* I don't want to live in a privileged bubble, and I have all my life. Maybe moving to the UK for uni would give me a new and valuable perspective on a foreign world.

Cons  


* I don't know anybody there
* Based on my past experience living there, I don't feel like I fit in. I'll probably be very homesick for a while.
* I don't want to go. I feel like I'd really dislike going there, but I might be wrong. I just don't want to make a massive mistake.
* Lockdown rules seem to be miles stricter there

I had absolutely no control over the incident but my parents think that I’m hiding something, when I’m reality, it was probably a 10 year old on the other team DDosing so he can win the match.

My parents said that if it happens again, they will take away my Xbox indefinitely.

360,"A while ago, I got to stay over at my best bud's house for the night. At very late in the early morning my friend finally passed out and I was trying to sleep(we were sharing his bed) but the room was just too humid for me to feel comfortable. While he was turning around i saw that he had a massive bo*er showing. Now at around this time, i was just realizing to myself that i'm gay and so I was very curious how it would feel. So out of stupidity, I very lightly tapped on it twice with one finger. At first, for about half a second i got a slight thrill, but immediately it wore off and i realized what i just did. I've never felt so shameful and disgusted at myself. In general, im a very nice and responsible guy so the thought that I would ever do something like that just stabs at me everyday.

363,"I'm kind of stringing all this together in a rush but the backstory.

She is from Hawaii and a few years ago, got a job in Japan, moved, settled in and got to work. Fast forward to a few months ago, she was getting homesick and when back to Hawaii for awhile to visit family.

Cue Covid.

Right now she has been told that if she can't get back to Japan by the 5th of August, she will lose her job. But Japan has closed their borders to America due to their high Coronavirus cases, and while Hawaii has very few, it's still part of America and won't let her back in.

Her working visas wont let her in, her special Re-entry permission wont let her back in, Shes called the Embassy of Japan, she's asked her employer if they can do anything. All no help.

There just doesn't seem to be a way but maybe we've missed something? This is her dream job and i just want to help her but I don't know if I can. But I just want to make sure. Is there a chance, or will she lose her job.

I don't know much about it, but if you need anymore info I can ask her.",07Jul2020,1
364,"I just posted this on r/AITA posting again because I need advice. I’m sorry this is on mobile.
My 16 yr (newly emancipated, like a little sister to me) roommate wants to get a cat to be her ESA, but here’s the thing, My BF and I already have 2 big dogs in the 2 Br apartment, who unfortunately have to spend a lot of time in their houses while we’re at work. 
My BF and I have our names on the lease, it’s our apartment but she rents a room from us.

It wouldn’t be fair to them if she got the cat and they all couldn’t get along and they had to be in their crates more. 
Or on the other hand it definitely would not be fair to keep a kitty in her room, especially since in the summer when our rooms aren’t super insulated, and it gets hot like being in a car on a summer day. 

She wants to keep the kitty litter in her room which again our rooms get hot, and if she doesn’t clean it regularly, I can only be filled with anxiety at the thought of the smell. I’ve already lived with roommates that had two cats, one litter and they never cleaned it, the whole apartment smelled like ammonia. 

Another thing is I’m 36 weeks pregnant and my baby could come any day. I’m just really stressed at the fact that my dogs might not like the baby, I don’t want to have to worry about a cat not liking her too. I don’t want to have to deal with my dogs not liking the cat, or the other way around, I don’t want to have to worry about her cat getting out of the room and getting into a fight with them,  all the while dealing with recovery and tending to a newborn. 

She’s so adamant on getting a cat, and said that she’s getting a note from her doctor to make it a legal matter that she’s required to have an ESA. 

If this was under other circumstances I would be all for her having a cat. But it feels like she’s not taking into account all the ramifications of bringing another animal into the house, and the strife it’ll bring.",07Jul2020,1
365,"Long post warning. I am an 18 year old male who has a pretty complicated family history, and a pretty sensitive one at that, which I admit is largely my fault. This post will be a long one because I feel like I need to describe the bad terms I mentioned in the subject. 

In 2015 my parents split, and my mother retained majority custody of me and my father following the divorce, but I still visited my father with my brother regularly. The terms of their divorce is still unclear to me. I never bothered asking due to how sensitive the subject was to me, but it wasn't a terribly ugly and public falling out. They had been married for 14 years and had been drifting apart for some time. 

Both of my parents moved on and began dating, but my dad married his new wife relatively quickly (~3 months after the divorce was finalized and 6 months since my parents split). 

My new stepmother apparently was a childhood friend of my father and they had a lengthy history and reconnected around the time of my parents' split. My new stepmother was never explicitly mean to my face, but she was always cold and lacked manners. She effectively came off as rude to everybody except my father. I noticed a shift in my father as well. He suddenly became financially responsible towards everything except my new stepmother (always a really bad spender) but he could spend more than enough money on vacations with his new wife when our fridge and pantry were empty on our visits. My father also suddenly stopped our traditions, like having nightly conversations. I was offended by this, but like with other small things that changed since he got together with my stepmother, none of it was enough to make me act out or publicly dislike her. She just changed a lot of what made me comfortable in my own home. I still respected the new wife though, and did try to get along. And we did! I found her easy to converse with when my dad was working, but whenever my dad came home, she seemed to change her attitude towards me instantly. It's hard to describe through text, and maybe that's because she was doing nothing wrong (afterall, I'm coming to y'all for advice lol).

One thing that seriously deepened my dislike for this new addition into my life (note: I was only 14 and I was a brat.) occurred shortly before my new stepmother moved in.

My parents had 4 dogs from their marriage, and my mom's new apartment (dad kept the house) didn't allow for pets, meaning my father had to keep the dogs, which he clearly didn't care for as much as my mother did. Shortly before my stepmother moved all of her dogs into the house, three of the old dogs died within a month of each other (I had been staying with my mom while all of this happened) and my dad and stepmom gave the other one away. The dogs were relatively old, but never got sick and were still pretty lively. They claimed they all got sick suddenly and died quickly. I would have believed this if there wasn't a motive from my stepmother to clear our house of anything that wasn't her's (before she even moved in or married the man, our entire house was renovated to her pleasure.), or if they did not give the other one away who was only a few years old. I'm not accusing them of killing my dogs, but it sure was a coincidence that all 4 of the dogs from his previous marriage were gone while me and my brother stayed with my mom, only to have those dogs replaced within a week of their deaths with my stepmother's two dogs. 

The deaths of literally every dog I had known coupled with what seemed like everything changing at my dad's house, including his personality and sentiment towards my friends and interests led to a really bad argument and confrontation. I stayed with my mom for nearly a month after that, but I gave my relationship with my dad another chance as long as I had a phone to use to get a ride to leave if things got bad again. 

And they did. Another argument over something that meant a lot to 14 year old me, but in retrospect a selfish sentiment I held towards my dad and a conspiracy theory about how my dogs died. 

Once I was able to see my mom again after the second argument, I decided to stay permanently. I felt the situation and dynamic was ugly, and that after two major fights between us three, he took my stepmother's side both times without making any concessions or reaching out to even understand why I felt the way I did. 

4 years later. Have not visited his house again. No contact besides happy birthday and christmas messages. My brother still visits, but is younger than me and is generally treated better. My dad and stepmother had a daughter who took my room, and I've never seen her. 

I should have never taken this long to reach out, but now it feels like it's too late to rebuild bridges and reconnect. I am older and I like to think more mature than I was when I was a jealous little teen, but there's so much holding me back from reaching out. He has a new family and I do not want to interfere with that. 

I haven't received any signals from him that he would outwardly reject any reconciliation, but I don't want to visit only for the experience to be awkward due to how things ended in 2016, or more importantly: for a visit to end in another argument.

He never protested my staying with my mom, which made me think he didn't want me in his life, but my brother has let me know that's not true, and he has advised me to reach out.

So what do I do? I know I was the root cause of why everything fell apart, but I'm still family. Is it selfish to want a relationship with my father after it fell apart and he moved on to a new family? Have I permanently burned too many bridges? I literally have a half sister I've never met, a stepmother I ended things horribly with, and a father who's relationship with me is non-existent at best. I still occasionally message my paternal grandma, and she seems to hold no animosity towards me, despite not seeing me for years like my father has. 

TL;DR: I fell out with my father several years ago over petty conflicts with my stepmother and wondering if it's the right thing to do to reconnect.",07Jul2020,1

368,"So to start off, my friend has depression and bipolar disorder and I’ve been by her side for about 6 years. When I was really young she told me she would commit s*icide and proceeded to tell me her full plan when I was about 8 or 9, I told my mom through sobs and she told her mom. So that was a traumatic experience, she made me responsible for her mental health for about 4 years. And whenever I tried to talk about my feelings she would listen for a couple mins and then go off track/make the conversation about her. She has also been making my friend group (that she is in) feel like we can’t tell her about how we feel because she would either make the situation about her feelings again, or just leave the call. We got into a fight recently and one of my friends told me that she had misgendered me on purpose, saying she was doing it on purpose multiple times. Tonight she had ranted about feeling left out when our other friend had been left out so many times and basically told us she wanted us to delete discord  because she isn’t in the discord server, and isn’t allowed to have discord. It’s super hard knowing she has mental illnesses. I would feel like a horrible person if I let them go. But I need to look out for my own mental health.

375,"Honestly my first reddit post cuz I heard this was a decent spot to look for solutions to ongoing problems, and I figured since friends can only help so much, I need some outside voices here...

I went through a very traumatic breakup back in January on the 12th. I am a very upbeat guy, get compliments fairly often by how I just have that ‘vibe’ that is just great to be around. I’m a musician, metal head, mature but love to have moments to just go back and have some childish moments with partners, like moving furniture around to make forts and other things alike. My life is very centred around my passion for music and love for the guitar, as I have once even played in a band for a year. 

Ever since I had this breakup and found things out that I wish I’d just never heard, I’ve been slowly been moving past all the anger and twisted late-night emotions by just looking for ways to change myself to just forget and move on as a new person. In my ongoing efforts, I’ve found myself to be successful in doing so, but this meant leaving almost all of those characteristics about me behind. I started getting into a ton of rap (a genre I once just despised, being the metal head I am), stopped listening to rock, and I pretty much just completely lost all interest in touching the guitar, as every time I try to play a song, it just takes me back to a memory of her and I just can’t do it and put it right back down. This has been going on for almost half a year. 

In a moment of reflection last night after taking an honest attempt to pick it back up (because I finally feel over her) but only to find out I’ve lost almost everything on it and can’t play anything I used to, that shit just depressed me, and I’ve come to realize that I think I’m starting to abandon all the things that I loved most in my life just in my efforts to forget anything that reminds me of her, and I’m just starting to feel lost now. I feel like I’m losing myself and I’m just miserable thinking about that. I want to pick up the guitar, so bad, but my conflict is that I can’t tell if moving forward is to leave these things behind to find new passions in replacement to make me happy, or if TRULY moving forward is actually working to slowly comfortably pick up the guitar again, regain my lost skill for it and try to find my happiness in that again (as a friend recommended to me last night). What do I do? 

I’m stuck cuz I’ve worked SO hard to get over everything that happened, and the last thing I want to do is just take myself two steps back if I choose the wrong route to go on this. Opinions??",07Jul2020,1

379,"((M21))As of today I was told upon coming into work((im a temp literally days from hire after 5 months)) that I couldn't return due to events that happened  the previous  night.

What had happened  was my position was changed at work to one that I did not want but at the same time my knee/leg had been hurting for the duration of how long I'd been at work to the point where they were weak and I could not feel  them. Instead of going to do the other position  I said I'm going home because of my leg as honestly not feeling my legs is worrying as its happened  multiple times before and leads to a rough night. Well I had wanted to go to the doc the next day but due to covid I'd thought it'd be fine till I came into work today and was told I'm DNRed. They say I left because of not wanting to do the job they were switching me to(( which equates to me being lazy even though it was a much easier job then what I was doing)) and im just not sure what to do.

I can get the note from the doctors explaining  everything  but I was told that I can't do shit after they DNR me even if it was for a medical problem that would require the doc so at this point im at a loss because im almost positive you can't be fired over being sick/hurt/needing something medical especially when a doc would be involved. As an extra bit  of information  thus same supervisor  that said that has been very different  towards me negatively  ever since roughly 2 weeks ago because I ruined my stomach at work and due to not having a position  for that night told no one I was going to the bathroom.

I dated a screwed up sociopath and so did he, they both messed us up, but we were there for each other and helped each other through.

He suffer crippling anxiety but he has overcome this and taught himself to be Alpha and now has a decent girlfriend. I am really happy for him after what he went through with his ex and he has inspired me to overcome my anxiety.

Yet, since he has adopted this Alpha mindset, he will disagree with everything  I say, take every joke I say seriously, and be generally defensive and  dismissive of me. I have heard him.say how he got rid of his old friends because they were losers.

He told me that he has no friends and I said that he has me, but if a guy treats one of his only friends like this, I sort of see why.

I moved in to his house which he owns with my best friend and eventually he moved in with his girlfriend. I took his old room and I can't shake the feeling he is pissed off at me for this, even though his brother said it was fine and even he did!

I pay strata and bills, but he seems to have this air of passive agressivness towards me. I got so worked up over this a few months ago that I began hating the guy and he knew this.

His older brother assured me that he meant nothing by it and still liked me. I give this guy my friendship and he only contacts me when he needs advice or wants something, never just to have a laugh or send me something  funny.

So basically I've been really good friends with this girl Jen (Not her actual name) and in a friend group with 2 other people, we'll call them Gabe (18M) and Lisa (18F). This has been for about 2 years. When I first met Jen, she was in a relationship who soon became a good friend of mine but is out of the picture now. I grew my platonic relationship with her for 2 years and now we have gotten super close. I think about her all the time.. She runs my mind. I have wanted to advance my relationship with her sexually for a very long time but I've always thought she was too good for me and that it was something I never could achieve. Anyways, about 3-4 months ago she got into a Friends with benefits- type of relationship with Gabe, and this hurt a lot. I didn't tell anyone my feelings for Jen otherwise Gabe never would've went near her. However, they have recently cut all strings, and now i'm left with a girl (who by the way talks about sex a lot and i know she's a freak) and I don't know if I should make a move or not. Some crazy information- Lisa, told me last night, that Jen has talked about wanting to have sex with me. This is great, right!?

387,"My bf and I have been together almost a year and a half now and, aside from being in a rough patch lately, things have been generally good. The biggest problem we have seems to be that he is just terrible at providing emotional support. Background: he grew up in a really unusual home. His mom has some serious issues and his siblings are 10+ years younger than him, so he was ordered around and did basically everything. Cinderella style I guess. That’s really the tip of the iceberg...not really any physical abuse but emotionally bad situation to grow up in. 

Additionally, he’s just not really a person who thinks I’m words which I really can’t fathom, but that’s life. He’s physically affectionate mostly and I DO think in words (pretty damn well), so when he’s upset I just just hold him and things are so much better, plus I know what to say or I just say things until I figure it out. Pretty ideal. 

Anyway, when I’m upset (which honestly is more often), he seems to almost freeze. Since it’s so often like that, where I’m just sitting there sad about whatever and he’s just kinda staring at me, it’s gotten to where me being sad about whatever turns into me being sad about the situation with him. Almost every time. I ask him to just try something to show me that he’s putting effort into being there for me so that I can at least see that he cares, and he’s getting a little better (usually...), but still it’s so much silently sitting. I advise him to just say things until he finds something that helps, but he responds that he genuinely has no tiny idea what to even try to say...like I said, words are hard for him. Sometimes it’s like I have to feed him lines of how to help me, which kind of negates the purpose and isn’t very useful. I love him, but emotional support is really important to me. I want my person to be the one that I know will be there to help, not be someone who will sit and stare at me while I’m sad. 

I guess I need advice on both 1) how to handle this situation from my end and 2) if anyone has any advice for him that would help. I at one point suggested he make a notes section on his phone of generally helpful things to say to an upset person that he could look at when he needs, so add your best reassurance in the comments I guess, haha.

Since then we exchanged Instagrams, Skype IDs, phone numbers, photos, videocalled on Skype a couple of times and talked on text almost everyday. We've been doing this for 2-3 weeks now.

Now the problem is split in two parts -

1) I fell inlove with her. I don't know how it's even possible to fall inlove with someone you meet online but it happened. I have a history of being needy for my ex-girlfriends so maybe I'm prone to falling for someone. I told this woman that I love her. I don't know if I did the right thing but sometimes I feel that I can't hold my feelings back. I am trying to get my mind busy with other stuff, trying to ignore how I feel but I just can't. It's like when I am not talking to her for more than 2-3 hours it makes me feel awful, I don't have motivation to do anything else, I constantly check my phone to see if she has texted me. I just don't know what to do about this really. I don't want to feel like this because I would say it has affected her aswell I mean I've been selfish in some situations and I made her feel bad too. Have you ever had something like this guys? I don't have any previous experience with falling inlove with someone online which is so much harder because...

2) she lives in another country. So yes, this would be easier to bear if she was living in the same country because I would just jump in a train or a car and go and visit her. But she lives in Turkey, I live in Romania so the chances we could meet in real life are slim. Not impossible though. We talked about the possibility of visiting each other, she wants me to do it first for some reason but I don't feel really comfortable about it, I hate airports, I'd get lost in an airport, I hate planes aswell, actually I fear flying with a plane and if possible I would avoid them at all costs.

I thought that the best solution would be to stop talking to her, but I can't do it. I would tell her to stop talking to me and block me but she can't do it either. So I don't know what to do.",07Jul2020,1

Recovery has been rough, considering I can't meet face-to-face with a therapist, and the only thing they do is proscribe medicine that sucks. A lot of people tell me to take it easy, and that I should focus my attention on recovering. But my parents are both pushing me to either get a job, or to go to school. I'm not sure if I can do either right now.


 I was always taught that the only way to succeed in life is if you push yourself, and I still sort of believe it. But every time I attempt to get back on my feet, (applying for jobs, applying for colleges) I'm hit with an entire day of anxiety so bad that all I can do is just cry in an empty bathtub. My parents have hinted that they think I am lazy. I know I am, but what else am I supposed to do? And of course, it would be so much easier if I was dead and didn't have to worry about any of this, but that's not acceptable apparently. 


Am I actually lazy? Is there no hope for me beyond being stoned on antidepressants and anxiety meds? Should I try to go to school this year?",07Jul2020,1

393,"Hello, I recently got a new job (huge relief after losing my other job due to covid). My new boss is a little... odd. He’s got a strange sense of humor, I can’t quite tell if he is joking or being serious sometimes. My coworkers are all very lovely and great to work with, and I am enjoying the work that I do. But I’m just struggling to connect with my new boss. He can be quite sarcastic and at first I thought he was just being a dick. 

I’ve chatted with my co workers who have worked there for quite a few years, their advice is that he wants to see that you’ll stand up for yourself, make your own decisions and to give back the same sarcasm. My boyfriend says the same thing, that he’s testing me and is seeing how I respond. 

I tend to tense up around him and when he speaks to me I don’t really know how to respond. To by honest he intimidates me and so my brain “freezes” around him and I am finding it hard to joke with him. 

Any advice is appreciated it! Thanks!

TLDR: new boss is very sarcastic, hard to tell when he’s being serious or joking. I’m struggling to respond to him/give back same sarcasm.",07Jul2020,1
394,"So during this period of lockdown, a boy from my college (a senior) started texting me and we hit it off right away. We've never seen each other in real life before. This is the first time we're talking. And we've been texting a lottt. He started flirting a few weeks back. And I was having fun, so I flirted back. Not thinking anything of it. Then a few days back our conversation led to a round of sexting. Which was very hot. I enjoyed it. Last night again we sexted, but this time I didn't feel too great about it. I woke up feeling icky about the conversation last night. And I don't want to him to think that once this lockdown is over I'll just go and have sex with him.

395,"I am M(20).We have been quarantining in our apartment,Dad goes to work most of the day,mom and brother (25)stay at home.

My brother wakes up on time,does his work,and his chores on time,he has been studious always in engineering. I on the other hand don't indulge in studying that much though I am learning few interesting things online,play games sometimes... though I lift,read books..I have some good habits.I do tend to be lazy sometimes for which I get lectured regularly by all three of them.
There is always a comparison of how studious he has been and how I am not,and I accept it with a smile that I suck at somethings.
But the thing my brother since the past three months has been calling me names like 'idiot'.'stupid'etc every single day in every single interaction...I wake up to be called idiot and I walk past him calling me names..I really get anxious right after waking up sometimes waking up to be called a stupid..it ruins my mood,like he is amused by calling me names,I really never try to cross anyone first,I tried telling him to stop saying shit things so often but to no avail. He has a habit of calling me shit names since time unknown,I've observed him intentionally mocking me in front of others infinite ko of times...its not that I hate him though...we talk good but these things get under my skin often..Naturally as I am more free than him mom tells me to do all the duties like groceries,ironing,etc to me which I do mostly without question...
So yesterday mom told him to switch off the motor to which I said he is free and mostly I do this shit work tell him, he began lashing out at me.. calling me good for nothing,free as fuck and things like these, I calmly told I'm not interested in your shit emotional reactions,just shut up...he was about beat me..mom seperated us...
After some time he started again,I finally lost it and warned him if he calls me names again, there will be consequences,mom as usual started scolding me..I lashed out at her for ALWAYS FUCKING TAKING HIS SIDE..maybe it's a thing for moms...but I lost it yesterday and fought both of them and warned them if you both wanna fight Fuck everything..I am gonna fight you both Right now...I still pissed today morning,they have been acting wierd too...I tried analysing if it's my mistake...But think they are mistaken..what should I do?",07Jul2020,1
396,"About a month ago, my friend sent a video from last year of 2 drunk white girls from my school calling each other the n-word to @m3ssym0nday (an Instagram drama page) and my friend leaked the school they went to. Someone else found their address and leaked it on the now-deleted post. 

What the girls in the video did was awful but they were already punished by the school district when the video was released last year and did not deserve to have the rest their lives ruined. People change. 

I've been talking about her behind her back but I feel bad about doing that and want to talk to her about what she did, express my disapproval and see if we’re still friends after that. What should I say?

TLDR: my friend leaked an old video of 2 girls from my school who called each other the n-word and were punished when the video was originally discovered to an Instagram drama page and indirectly got them doxxed. I want to confront her about it and idk what to say.",07Jul2020,1

However we hung out with her a few times and she is an absolute nightmare of a person. She will randomly say rude things or complain and insult people with little to no reason to. She will say something awful under her breath but if you address it she will start freaking out and go into an anxious fit of apologizing or trying to play the victim. We’ve tried being patient but it’s run thin and I’m getting sick of seeing someone insult my friends and fear I might snap. Is there any way to tell my friend that I’m happy he’s in a relationship but don’t want to be around his girlfriend without sounding rude or hurting him in some way?",07Jul2020,1
398,"I got hired for a new job today! Admin assistant for a physical therapist who works out of his home. He has a lead admin assistant who has her own desk in his home office. There are two additional desks in the office, one of which doesn’t have a chair and the other desk is the therapist’s. 

The therapist told me that he would typically place the second admin at the extra table but he will have me sitting at his desk instead. While this isn’t a huge deal, a job is a job and I will do it to the best of my ability, I have been working in an office environment for a few years now and having my own work space definitely contributes to my productivity and motivation to get stuff done. I feel lost to come in every day and sit at someone else’s desk where I ultimately can’t make changes to or arrange/organize. 

I don’t want to step on any toes so early on, and who knows, I may not mind all that much once I actually start. But I was thinking of giving it a few weeks and then bringing up that I much prefer having my own workspace and would love to adopt the third desk as my own. 

Any suggestions or tips to feel more organized at another person’s workspace? I was thinking of maybe bringing a little organizer or book bag with items I want to use or things that help with my work flow.

402,"A couple years back my mum got into pseudoscience and from there everything snowballed. 

It went from harmless stuff such as buying rocks and incense to being antivax and completely convinced the world is out to get us.

At the moment she doesn’t think corona is real and is therefore not taking protective measures against it (which isn’t the main problem because we live in a small village just outside a city that isn’t really affected by it) 

She also believes the alt left elites drink children’s blood to stay alive, which is fucking insane but what can you do.

This whole transformation has made my mum, who was a labour supporting sane woman, into a complete nut who thinks vaccines are killing people and that Donald trump is the saviour of humanity and is culling all the paedophiles in America. 

The main issue is that she forces these opinions on to other people, mainly me and our guests (we run a guest house) which has spurred some negative reviews because of the aggressive debates she has with guests about this subject. 

It’s also effecting me in the fact that I am subconsciously becoming afraid of vaccines and 5g and whatnot.

Even though I know what she’s saying is utter bullshit having that opinion shoved down your throat 7days of the week is going to have a effect on you

What makes it worse is that my brother and step-dad have started to share her opinions slightly which means I have 3 people trying to convince of this dumb shit nearly everyday.

I’m never going to share her opinion but it’s still mind numbing and as I said it’s effecting the business, I have tried to convince her that she’s wrong or even just to look at the actual science proving all of her theories wrong but she won’t listen. 

Does anyone have any idea how I could convince her or at least get her to stop shoving it down peoples throats? 

TL:DR; My mum is a stereotypical Karen antivaxer and it’s driving me nuts how can I convince her to change her opinion or look at the evidence proving her wrong?

408," 

Alright so, I met this guy about a week ago, we quickly moved to text, and after two days of talking he invited me over. Both of us stated that we're open to anything, which includes friends, relationships, friends with benefits, etc.

I went to his place to hang out, we drank wine, talked for hours on end. He initiated a kiss and asked if I wanted to stay for longer. We made out a bit more, went to his room, made out more, talked, and watched Netflix. We then end up hooking up (not intercourse, because I said I didn't want to). Afterward, we continued our night watching Netflix and cuddling. Also note that while talking, he asked me about my love life, which I answered. He then answered that he hasn't been in anything serious lately, but only because he hasn't found the right person and that he's open to it.

Then, when I said I had to leave we made out a bit more, he offered walking me to the bus stop and I said there's no need, we made out at the door and said goodnight. He messaged to make sure I got home alright and we said that we had a great time.

Two days later, I'm obviously infatuated with this guy, and I'm kinda obsessing over his text. I'm generally the type of guy that's not overthinking every little thing and just obsessing, but I can't explain it. I felt potential for a strong connection.

Okay, moving on to the texting bit. Before the meeting, we texted for a few days. Now the same frequency we had before the meeting is very similar to how it is now (two days after... yikes I know, lol)

He replies with 3-2 hour delays throughout the day, which I try to match (yikes again, I know ahah). Then at night time, we have a good long conversation with barely any delays. I'm generally not a texting person, which I think is the same for him. But for me, because I'm interested I'm overthinking everything and trying to figure out whether there's a chance this can become a thing or not. I think I'm mostly looking for a way to know whether I should start preparing myself for disappointment or not if that makes sense.

I initiated yesterday and asked him on a second date. He said it he would love that, although he already has commitments for the next two days. He said that originally he was supposed to go to his family home for the weekend, but if that changes we can meet up again.

alright after condensing this mess, we have two questions:

1. Do you think there's a shot at something here, based on the information I've given?
2. Should I keep initiating the first message of the day? or should I try not messaging first today and see what happens, Although he's not a texting person? (I message in the middle of the day with a ""hey"", we talk with long delays until nighttime, which is when he have full-on conversations) 

I guess a part of me is worried if I don't keep the momentum with chatting every day he might lose interest (Which sounds pathetic). 

&amp;#x200B;

I hate how overly analytical I am with this, but I'm overthinking and I thought I'd force Reddit to overthink with me ahahahaha. I haven't felt like this toward someone in a while, so I'm getting a bit ahead of myself (I'm working on preparing myself for failure)",07Jul2020,1
409,"I'm entering high school this year and I feel like I should be deciding my career already. I know some might think this is too early but it has been on my mind a lot lately. I've also been feeling pressure from family members who already had everything figured out at my age. I'm not very passionate about anything, to begin with, which is sad in itself. I feel like everyone has something that drives them in life, I'm kind of just living at the moment. Nothing excites me. I don't understand how people grow up dreaming about working, it doesn't sound like much fun. But, I know that I'll eventually need to get a job and I don't want to float from one minimum wage job to another my whole life. Planning out my future is scary and it feels as if everything will be locked in place once I do. I imagine myself going down the wrong path and regretting it my whole life. One part of me knows that these thoughts are coming prematurely and I should focus on the present but another part is screaming at me that time is wasting away and I've accomplished nothing. And by that, I mean literally nothing. I'm not creative or athletic, I don't play instruments, I'm not very smart or anything of that sort. I feel as if I'm blank.

410,"(I apologize for any formatting errors, I’m posting from mobile and have never made a post like this before.)

I’m going to say upfront that I’m not living in a negative situation. I have a loving family and a great group of friends. I like how my life currently is. But here-in lies the problem. 

I have already enjoyed my life to the point that I would not be upset with dying at any moment. I have no goals or aspirations. I think about what I want to do with my life and I can’t find anything that truly matters to me. I can enjoy things like video games on the surface level but nothing seems like its worth any form of emotional or physical investment. Growing up and getting older seems like an endless sink of effort into living in a continually worse way when I feel like what I have is the best I can have. 

Things like getting a job or raising a family seem like wastes of time to me because I can’t bring myself to care about anything. I think about the people I love, and as much as I tell myself I love them, I feel no real attachment to them. About a year ago my grandpa died. I was at a memorial service seeing my family saddened and my older brother slightly crying while I was just concerned that I felt nothing. 

No matter what I do I can’t find a single thing that matters to me that I truly want to strive for. I don’t know if this is me just being some kind of edgy teenager or if I have an actual problem. I can imagine things like relationships but I can’t even think of what it’s like to care about someone to the point of wanting to be around them that much. I do not want to die, but the fact that people care about me and want me alive is all that give my life value to me. Past that, me living would just be some thing that happened until it didn’t. If my death ever helped more people than it hurt I wouldn’t hesitate to end it, but at the same time I can’t even devote myself to helping people while I’m alive and not be too lazy to even try. If anyone else has ever experienced something like this I would greatly appreciate hearing from them below. I’ve thought about this a lot and decided to post it here in case anybody could shed any insight on the topic. Thank you, and have a great day.",07Jul2020,1

412,"I'm posting this because my friends and I need a third party on this matter. Also, before I say anything we are minors and the friend that I will mention has these mental issues; bipolar depression and ADHD.  I will be mentioning them as ""the friend"" or ""this friend"" as to stay anonymous.  We've known this friend for quite a while and its been pretty peaceful until the last month.  This situation kicked off when we all had a disagreement over something (I don't need to get into it because it isn't related to this situation much).  Our friend group plays DnD (dungeons and dragons) on a semi-regular basis and we had almost reached the ending of the first part of the campaign (around 3-5 minutes from finishing a very important battle).  At that point, this friend had to leave the call (we were playing over call due to COVID-19) and we didn't want to just leave the session off that close to the end of the battle.  So we finished the fight (it was only two more turns) and stopped the session.  The next night, we played again with everyone and everything went fine until the friend almost had to leave again.  They told us that they had to leave in an hour and to not continue without them again.  That friend's best friend said that they shouldn't get as mad because our DM (dungeon master) had put a lot of work into this campaign and everyone had missed at least 1 session before.  The friend then left the call and we began talking about that situation. It then turned into us talking about the friend's dnd character and the characters large amount of angst.  The character's angst and backstory had begun overriding the campaign's story and it kept getting us sidetracked.  The friend then rejoined the call and stayed completely silent, we had also stopped ranting at that time.  The next day, everyone besides the friend talked together about what to do and how to resolve the situation.  The friend's best friend then texted on our group chat saying ""Also we didn't continue **** (the friend's name), I just wanted to tell you."".  The friend then left the group chat and we began talking about how we needed to tell them how we felt.  That night, after we re-added them to the group chat, we decided to group call them and tell them how we felt.  They gaslit the situation to make themselves the victim and then left the call.  The friend's best friend then privately called them to talk about how they felt. The best friend asked them if they had purposely deadnamed and misgendered them in the original fight I had mentioned.  The friend denied that they had done that, even though multiple people had witnessed and recalled her doing it.  The friend's mother then turned off their texting to help their mental health.  The texts stayed off for around 3 days.  We played two, very productive, sessions in that time and we thought everything was going to go back to normal after that.  We tried to play a session with the friend again, but they kept getting all of us off topic and sidetracked.  After that, our DM was having conflicting feelings about keeping the friend in the campaign. After two days of trying to make the right decision, our DM told the friend ""I don't think I want to continue the campaign with you."".  Our DM surrounded that sentence with multiple apologetic sentences.  The friend said they were fine, but we discovered that they weren't the next day.  Our DM then added them back to the campaign because they felt bad.  Two days later, we were all on call with the friend, all having a good day.  During the call, we were messing around with the music bot on discord which the friend isnt allowed to have (due to past experiences on it).  They said they had to go and left the call, but then texted our DM friend that they had felt excluded during the call.  During the call, we had all been talking and interacting with the friend.  But they seemed to be annoyed at the fact that we all had discord and wanted us to not use it as much.  We don't know what to do about this situation as it has been happening on a constant basis.  We have all became tried and done with all of their drama and we want to resolve it soon or we know it'll end up becoming worse.",07Jul2020,1

i just am terrified of cancel culture especially because i own a business and would like to succeed however with this screenshot it could ruin my life. it could prevent me from getting a job in the future or the takeoff of my business. it’s just upsetting because since then i have really changed and become a better, more educated person who would never even THINK about using that word.

418,"A friend and her bf (who was also my friend) sort of discarded my friendship after i made a mistake. 
She told me a piece of gossip about a colleague and told me not to tell anyone. The secret was that this colleague was dating in secret. I didn't care much about this anyway because i'm not interested in gossip.
After several months my best friend also told the same gossip and i told her that i already knew because that friend told me. At this point the secret was no longer a secret because everyone knew they were dating. 
When that first friend asked me whether i told anyone about the secret,  i was honest and said that i didn't reveal the secret but revealed the source (her). I could hv lied to her and pretended like i didnt reveal her name because she was just asking whether or not i told anyone. But i was honest.
So she was really angry and discarded our friendship. 
We have been friends for about 1 and half years. They don't talk to me anymore. I have never done something like this to them before. I have helped them both with relationship matters also. And i have kept their secrets. I have listened to them too. They say a lot of bad things about other people but i have not revealed anything to anyone.

(Mind you he doesn’t like texting and rarely uses his phone). I’ve contacted him multiple time and he only replies every 3-5 days. And we’ve hung out multiple times since then. But we haven’t talked about it. Every time I try to bringing up it’s either bad timing or he doesn’t respond/address it. What should I do? I’m sorry this is so long.,07Jul2020,1
423,"Hello, 

I'm (21M) nearing the age of having to decide what I want to learn in university, and what field I would like to work in, and I'm lost. I honestly have no idea what career path I would like to take, I have no idea what I want to do for a living, everyday I choose something else, and I never manage to stick to one decision for more than a week.  

My current dilemma is between two fields: 

1. Law: I have a natural way with words (especially in my mother tongue), I understand the logical concepts behind laws quite well, the field is quite interesting in itself, I think that judges are really impressive people, and I think that all in all I would be OK working in this field. I could also probably get into the best institution in my country for law, get the best grades, and therefore get the top internships. The problem is: there are way too many lawyers in my country, they don't pay that well, I will be limited to my local market (which really isn't that big). 
2. Engineering\\CS: I did Ok in math at school.  I mean I did the hardest test in math my country has to offer, I got 92% out of 100, but it came with a lot of hard work, and wasn't nearly as easy as some other subjects. It was enjoyable solving mathematical problems, but wasn't intuitive, it's not where my comfort zone is. For example in my country's GPA we have a big test that involves a test in my Mother tongue, in English and in Math. The mother tongue part is the easiest part by far, maths is the hardest, it's not that i'm bad at math it's that im just not as good as other subjects. Same with computer studies I did in High School. I did some programming on my own and it wasn't bad just not loving it. Anyway, the pay for CS or engineering degrees is double than law, there is a crazy demand for developers and engineers, it's an international job, I can be an engineer anywhere in the world, and I would like being at the front of the technological development. 

Everyday I lean towards a different career. Anyone got any good advice?",07Jul2020,1
424,"(Sorry for length) Throwaway for this question.  I’m a 17 year old male and recently I’ve thought about trying drinking alcohol.  I don’t feel pressured to do it.  I don’t know of many people at my school who have done it and none of my friends have done it (as far as I know), I just honestly maybe wanna try it once to see what being drunk feels like.  It’s not something I would plan on doing routinely, but I also know that it’s wrong and I’m young and at an age below drinking age (I’m in USA).  I don’t have really strict parents or anything, but their reaction might be bad if they ever found out.  If I did do it, I’d try to be safe and do research on alcohol poisoning and everything, and it wouldn’t be at a party or anything, just something I’d steal from my parent’s cabinet, but the question remains, should I consider this or would it be a bad decision?  I’m asking for your guys’ opinions as I’m really boderline right now.  Thanks.",07Jul2020,1
425,"I rent a flat with 2 other people, and one person moved out a couple of days ago. The landlord wants to re-let the room asap, completely understandable. However, covid cases are rising in my city, and I am alone, and know almost nobody in this city. If I get the virus, I have no help whatsoever. I can't move out, again because of the virus, and because my parents are elderly and I don't want to risk them getting it. I really don't want a new, possibly asymptomatic positive, person in the house at the moment.

I could pay the rent for the second room as well for a while, and my landlord is OK with that, but I can't pay that forever. And my worry is that if we get a new flatmate now, there's a medium risk of spreading the virus, but if we get a new flatmate after a couple of months, the situation may have worsened, and there may be a much higher risk of getting the virus from them. I'm terrified of getting the thing and suffering on my own. What do I do?",07Jul2020,1
426,"Two days later, we were all on call with the friend, all having a good day. During the call, we were messing around with the music bot on discord which the friend isn't allowed to have (due to past experiences on it).rse.ill be mentioning them as ""the friend"" or ""this friend"" as to stay anonymous.

TLDR: We've been having constant fights with one of our friends about us doing stuff without them, and we don't know what to do since we can't talk to them about how we feel.

We've known this friend for quite a while and its been pretty peaceful until the last month. This situation kicked off when we all had a disagreement over something (I don't need to get into it because it isn't related to this situation much). Our friend group plays DnD (dungeons and dragons) on a semi-regular basis and we had almost reached the ending of the first part of the campaign (around 3-5 minutes from finishing a very important battle). At that point, this friend had to leave the call (we were playing over call due to COVID-19) and we didn't want to just leave the session off that close to the end of the battle. So we finished the fight (it was only two more turns) and stopped the session.

The next night, we played again with everyone and everything went fine until the friend almost had to leave again. They told us that they had to leave in an hour and to not continue without them again. That friend's best friend said that they shouldn't get as mad because our DM (dungeon master) had put a lot of work into this campaign and everyone had missed at least 1 session before.

The friend then left the call and we began talking about that situation. It then turned into us talking about the friend's dnd character and the characters large amount of angst. The character's angst and backstory had begun overriding the campaign's story and it kept getting us sidetracked. The friend then rejoined the call and stayed completely silent, we had also stopped ranting at that time.

The next day, everyone besides the friend talked together about what to do and how to resolve the situation. The friend's best friend then texted on our group chat saying ""Also we didn't continue \*\*\*\* (the friend's name), I just wanted to tell you."". The friend then left the group chat and we began talking about how we needed to tell them how we felt.

That night, after we re-added them to the group chat, we decided to group call them and tell them how we felt. They gaslit the situation to make themselves the victim and then left the call. The friend's best friend then privately called them to talk about how they felt. The best friend asked them if they had purposely deadnamed and misgendered them in the original fight I had mentioned. The friend denied that they had done that, even though multiple people had witnessed and recalled her doing it. The friend's mother then turned off their texting to help their mental health. The texts stayed off for around 3 days.

We played two, very productive, sessions in that time and we thought everything was going to go back to normal after that. We tried to play a session with the friend again, but they kept getting all of us off topic and sidetracked. After that, our DM was having conflicting feelings about keeping the friend in the campaign. After two days of trying to make the right decision, our DM told the friend ""I don't think I want to continue the campaign with you."". Our DM surrounded that sentence with multiple apologetic sentences. The friend said they were fine, but we discovered that they weren't the next day. Our DM then added them back to the campaign because they felt bad.

Two days later, we were all on call with the friend, all having a good day. During the call, we were messing around with the music bot on discord which the friend isnt allowed to have (due to past experiences on it).

They said they had to go and left the call, but then texted our DM friend that they had felt excluded during the call. During the call, we had all been talking and interacting with the friend. But they seemed to be annoyed at the fact that we all had discord and wanted us to not use it as much.

We don't know what to do about this situation as it has been happening on a constant basis. We have all became tried and done with all of their drama and we want to resolve it soon or we know it'll end up becoming worse.",07Jul2020,1
427,"So to start off, I've never really had much trouble passing my classes but when it comes to writing a thesis I just have no motivation. As a result I had to do multiple attempts to successfully create a bachelor thesis. 

Because of this. I already completed all classes of my masters degree except the master thesis. Now, the last couple of years I've been struggling with depression and I think a big chunk of it comes from my parents. I have a textbook case of narcissistic parents and lately it became even worse due to the virus and my dad losing his brother. 

Because of my weird university trajectory I only had to work on my thesis this year. As a result, I decided to go work part-time so I could be financially independent from my parents.

Unfortunately due to procrastinating and having a rather difficult subject, (which is my fault) I wasn't able to get my thesis done and with the amount of work that still needs to be done, I don't think I'll be ready for the second chance (which is due in a bit more than one month). 

It's disappointing that I wasn't able to finish a thesis again but I also feel like if I'd just give it another shot, I would get similar results. That's why I'm considering working for a year so I can move out asap and use that year to work on myself to get into a better headspace. 

I'd like to know if someone has been in a similar situation and if this is a good or bad idea?",07Jul2020,1

429,"The context: Myself (F, Mid 20s) and my mother (Mid 50s) suffer from moderately bad mental health. Myself from severe depression + anxiety, and her severe bipolar. We don't get much help from the local services, as we don't live in a great area (Rural England). So the health services are often lacklustre at best. eg. getting pills thrown at us and not really followed up upon, judgemental comments from psychiatrists, therapists that aren't compassionate. Ect ect.

It was bad some years ago (2009-2013). She took a lot of drugs, abused drugs, threw fits. House was trashed constantly, lots of arguments and fights. That did a number on me but I did forgive it and we healed from that. Plus I was too young to really move out or make my way on my own then.

So now we're rather toughing it out on our own. Just us two in the house. Family is distant/non-existent. I look after her, she looks after me. Things are alright financially, and we've done well for a good while just like this. However-

The story: We recently moved home, and at first it was absolutely lovely. New place (Much better than our old place), new start. Things were looking up. COVID hit, and we've been rather stuck at home. Which wasn't really a problem to begin with. Yet in time, things got worse. The doctors made the ill advised decision to abruptly change her medication, back to testing and guinea-pigging.

Maybe she's taking something else, maybe it's the new medication. Yet either way; she has become insufferable. Sometimes at night she is up constantly. In a state near sleepwalking but not quite. She's definitely not 'in there' so to speak. The lights are off but nobody is in. I hope you understand, as I don't have any explanation or good description.

She's engaged in almost dangerous activities in the middle of the night like getting into her car at 2am. Or preparing to go out. Turning on the oven/cookers. Drinking energy drinks/taking things then forgetting she had them, so she goes back for more. Opening doors. Up and down my flight of stairs (While stumbling and falling over). All while babbling and speaking gibberish. Making a literally filthy mess of our new place, that was supposed to be the start of something great. This has happened three times in the past month.

As someone who is depressed and anxious, it rather has me hung up. I'm worried for her, I have to watch her all night. (Usually Midnight to morning, and sometimes more). I'm even getting bad thoughts from my previously hopeful state of being.

She doesn't listen when she's 'come around' from whatever it is. Blames anything but herself, and then forgets I even had a talk with her. (She doesn't listen to me in general but that's another story)

It's getting to the point where I just want to leave, because I was starting to feel better until this.

Yet I can't help but feel it's really selfish of me, and that I should stick with her. Because without me she'll be kinda alone. With this problem, and her mental health. I worry she'll do something regretful, or give up, or get hurt.

But I'm also in my mid twenties and have been doing this and handling this stuff for over a decade. My teenage years were lost to stuff like this. I'm exhausted, I don't want to be awake when she's around. My entire life has revolved around the maybe-maybe not of her state. And she's not really making any effort to fix this new problem.

I don't know what to do. How to help her. Help myself?",07Jul2020,1

I am the type of person to value friendships so much, so it kills me when people do not want to be friends with me, or be close with me. Would it be something about me trying too hard?

431,"Hi everyone ! :) 
It's my very first post on Reddit so I hope it won't be too boring. I'm a 21F and English isn't my first language. 

First of all I come from a middle class family who worked hard to send me and my brother to private schools so that we could climb the social ladder. And from when I was a child, I feel like I did everything right. Meaning I'm a really good student, always top of my class. However socially I'm kinda of a mess even though I improved a lot those last 4 years. We used to move around so I don't have any childhood friends or long lasting friends. 

I don't really know how much of my life I must explain before hand, but I'll go straight to the problem. I've always been love conditionally. My parents only love me when I'm the perfect daughter (good grades and pursuing what they chose for me...) however I'm a bit of a stubborn donkey myself so we had amazing fights when I decided what I was gonna study in college for example. And I have heard a fair amount of times things like ""what did i do to deserve a daughter like this"", ""i don't want to see you anymore"", ""why can't you just obey"", ""you're just selfish"", ""you disgust me"" and others. So I came to the conclusion really young that if i wasn't perfect, i wouldn't be loved right? It's a logical deduction. 

Now I'm 21yo and never loved anyone and never felt like i was deserving of love. I did let people into my life that became a huge part of me, they are so amazing that even I sometimes don't understand why they would be friends with me. But love is a whole different matter. I can't help but think I'm not worth it. I'm not pretty, fit, smart, funny, lovable enough. I'm just not !! I watch a lot of romantic comedies and wonder if I'm just gonna die alone. I did reject guys that tried to date me because what if they discover I'm an impostor? Like what if they wake up and realise that yes I'm ugly? What if i dont know how to kiss or how to have sex or how to date someone or how to be a decent girlfriend? 

I've always thought my only value was my grades (not even my brain as grades =/= intelligence). I just don't get why someone would love me and I don't feel capable neither of loving/trusting or of being loved/trusted.

I'm craving affection and love to be honest, and I'm wondering what should I do to improve ? What steps do I have to take ? I honestly don't know what I'm expecting from the answers, but I would also like it if you have a similar experience or view, and would love to read your stories !",07Jul2020,1

Not only am I slightly afraid to move away from my family and town, although I think that feeling is normal, I have recently started becoming very concerned about my friend that I will be sharing a room with (18F). She is mentally ill and suffers from a lot of mental health issues and because of this, I feel like she won’t be able to adequately take care of herself.

439,"**Note:** English is not my first language so please forgive me for any grammatical mistakes that I might make. 

**Background:** In my country, it is fairly common for people to live with their parents life long. In fact, living away from ones parents is sometimes considered unethical. I am an 18yo who just graduated high school. 

**Issue 1:** My entire family is extremely toxic. Both of my parents fight each other on almost daily basis. It would start off of some petty problems and then turn into chaos real quick. My mom tells me that these fights are just an excuse for my father to leave the house and drink alcohol (which is true most of the times). I've tried interjecting these fights, but to no avail. From what I've inferred, most of the fights wouldn't take place if we had more money (my father is currently unemployed).  Divorce is not an option since it is  still considered a taboo in our country. 

**Issue 2:** In the past 2-3 years, my relationship with my mother has weakened; since I've been in a lot of stress from studies and no emotional support from anyone in the family; Instead, she would scream at me and brush me off when I would tell her that I'm under stress. Her only solution to my stress was to *""study more""*. I even considered committing suicide many times (ik i was stupid).

&amp;#x200B;

**What I need an Advice on:**

I have plans of completing college and moving out of my country; mainly because I've become sick and tired of all the things I've had to endure since childhood. However, my mother suggests that I live with her in my country once I graduate college and start working. I don't want to live with her. Don't get me wrong, I love her. I honestly do. But I just can't handle the problems I have to deal with when I live with her.

443,"Let me preface this by trying to sum up my complicated emotions on this matter: I love my friend very much. He’s always somehow made me feel seen and included. He has a sunshiny personality that attracts many, many people to him. But I feel like he takes those closest to him for granted. He doesn’t take care of himself at all. He’s suffering from major, severe depression. This can make it hard for him to be a good friend to my fiancé and I, and hard for us to be good friends to him. Here are some incidents that, cumulatively, make me worry:
Back when he was my fiancé’s roommate, he has always been very lax about cleaning up. My fiancé would be pissed that he would do nothing around the apartment, and he would act like a hurt puppy about it. Meanwhile, in his room, you could see the floor for all the clutter and literal dog and rabbit shit. So he has never been apt to take care of himself. 
Things got worse when my fiancé moved in with me. My friend had to find a different place to live, so he moved in with some other friends. He quit his job with no backup plan, and didn’t pay rent for months. He was kicked out, because his friends just couldn’t sustain him. He has never expressed regret for the series of events that led him to be unable to pay rent, but only intense anger that he was kicked out. He doesn’t take accountability for his role in his own suffering. 
After that, he started renting an apartment on his own. He got a different job where his mother works. He started as full time, but got moved to PRN because his managers were not satisfied with his performance. He’s expressed frustration with the fact that communication is extremely inefficient there, and I understand, but he has done nothing to remedy that situation or express his concerns calmly. He’s been showing up to work late or not at all in the last few weeks. He impulsively got a kitten in addition to his dog, and has paid the pet deposit for neither of them. The dog eats the cat’s food, and he doesn’t take the time to make sure that the kitten eats enough. He had some rats as well, and they both died due to unknown causes, but I wouldn’t rule out starvation or unclean conditions, as he never cleaned their cage. He still has the unclean cage in his room. There is dog shit on his carpet that has been accumulating for days. 
My fiancé and I moved again recently, and asked for his help. We gave him a bed of ours that my fiancé had barely used for a year before we started sharing one, a really nice bed. My dad helped me to deliver it, and my friend made absolutely no effort to help us move it. I didn’t even think anything of it, as I’m extremely used to that kind of thing, from my friend or from anyone. But when we left, my dad went on a rant about how that is unacceptable, and I get it. My friend then told us that he would help us move if he was off of work, but he was off of work that day and didn’t bother coming over as he said he would. He did end up “helping” us with the last of the stuff the next day, but that’s when I really saw the severity of the situation. He maybe moved two boxes, and then he sat in our front yard and did nothing the rest of the time. We gave him a lamp during this time. He kept apologizing, and I kept telling him “it’s okay, just GET YOUR LAMP.” He finally did that, at least. 

I don’t want to sound like a raging bitch. The truth is that I am severely frustrated. My fiancé and I are losing sleep. We go from wanting to do his meal prep and housekeeping so that he can eat something other than chips and live in a clean, healthy environment to being so angry at him for refusing to take care of his shit. My fiancé and I have talked about an intervention. I want to come to him with full honesty and love and encourage him to take control of his life. I just also want to shake him. My fiancé and I know that we can’t take care of him, and we can’t abandon him and let him whither away into nothing or do something drastic. Something has to change so that my fiancé and can know that we’ve done our best.",07Jul2020,1
447,"First of all sorry for my English, it's not my first language and I have dyslexia.

So now to the story. I went to a boarding school for 3 years when I was 16. It was a really small school, were you learned cooking and more. In my year were only 4 other girls,
E who I later got friends with
J the youngest 
P the one that never talked
And v the main person of this story.


One of our chaperones told v she should be ""leader "" of our group, because she is the oldest. Even our teachers tried to bring this dynamic there
But that didn't happen, because j became it and v really didn't like it.  We had double rooms and p and v were in one and e and j stayed in one. I was alone. Exactly like this the groups formed, with me in the middle to get them to cooperate.
But then j dropped out and v thought now it was the time to get her ""rightful place "". Didn't happen. E became the ""leader "". 
Because we both were alone, we spent more time together and I somehow became her ""guard ""(I have to tell that E always was a bit insecure behind her strong front and always way to kind and forgiving for her own good. While I tend to be more cold and logical about things. So I looked out for everyone that could hurt her, while she helped me to open up)
You can imagine v didn't like it at all.

V was also not as good as E and me in the school, she had problems with both practical and theory, what leaded to her getting more angry with us.
E is also really pretty, while v is not that much. I have the luck to have a good metabolism and can wear almost everything,  while she always said she needs to lose weight and her fashion sense is really really old fashioned. 
Then there was this situation at her birthday, were her crush only talked to me. She did ask me beforehand to find out if he also liked her, so I talked with him, but made I clear that I wasn't interested in him, but he didn't take the hint and wanted to stay the whole day near me. At one point I hit at the bathroom, because I didn't want to talk to him more. 
I really didn't give him any signs of interest, but I think  she misunderstood the situation, because after this she didn't really talk to me and after I tried to talk to her about it, she said she believes me. But she was still weird after it.
This is important, because after some month, we had a intern at the time, who stayed with me, she run crying to this 15 year old intern and told her she just tried to kill herself with her headphones. And it was because of E and me. We weren't there at the time, but when I came back and found the shocked intern in my room, I got mad. We had enough chaperones that were all trained for such situations, why did she go to a 15 year old girl, that she knew for not even a week?
I tried to talk to v about it, but she just said that everything was our fault. Sadly E heard it and the person she is, she believed it. I decided that this was enough and told everything our main chaperone.
They decided we needed to talk about it with sb and made us do a group chat.
V told only lies at this group chats. She said we would exclude her, while she was the one that always said no when we asked( for her and p) and even left e, p, and me alone in the city one time. 
She also said that we always make her feel bad about herself, with our good grades. In my life I never cared for grades, because I know that some things you are good at and some just not( dyslexia shows that very good). And E was way to kind to say anything about grades to her. Maybe our classmates in the public school said something about this to her, but I'm not sure.

Because there was no solution for this whole situation, we just decided to keep our distance and wait till we graduated.

But then v dropped out, after her grades were to bad to get through the midterm exams.
I wasn't there when she she had her goodbye party, because I was send to help in a different home of our school, but nobody said anything grand happened. So I thought this was over.

But like a month later we got an angry and quite mean message that we destroyed her life and she would hate us!
We were shocked. E was really hurt and searched for the fault by herself. She was depressed for at least a month and as soon as somebody said v name she got really quiet.
It didn't helped that in our last year we got an girl that looked exactly like v. It took e really long to even let her near her.

Then out of nowhere she wrote us a letter, were she said God showed her she should write us. Like wth.
I burned the letter, maybe not the best way to handle it, but I was so angry. Not even for myself,  I'm not really hurt by such things,  but for e.
Since then we didn't really had contact, I saw her at some official events of our school, but I always stayed away. I know e talked small talk with her at one of this, but I knew it wouldn't end good if I talked to her.

So now E told me that v wrote her, over one of the girls and that she wants us at her wedding ceremony. 
I'm not so sure what to think honestly. Why did she even invite us? 
E wants to go, because of the old times and I don't want her to go alone.
And if I go what is appropriate to wear? I don't really know how she looks now and if I go I really don't want to outshine her in any way,  because it's her wedding day.",07Jul2020,1

First off, I know this is really stupid but I need some advice. Okay, so I made a PayPal account that I signed under a fake name, because I don’t like giving my real name away.

452,"I am feeling down because my parents want me to attend the same university as my sister. She had a stroke last year, and they are worried it might happen again. Funny thing is, they frame it as if they’re worried about me getting sick and nobody there to be with me.

I would receive a $18,500 scholarship grant if I were to attend the program. But instead, I may have to attend a smaller, private, and less prestigious university (where I may or may not have a scholarship grant). Unfortunately, I have to lock in my place by July 15th, and we haven’t heard back from other universities just yet.

453,"Need advice on whether or how to broach the subject. 

I’ve spotted a bald spot on someone very close to me. Both women. She bleaches her hair and I think she goes really rough on detangling. I don’t actually know what causes the bald spot(s) which may or may not be relevant. 

I don’t know if she knows they’re there and I don’t know if I should tell her or how to tell her. I noticed one a few days ago, size of a dime, had never seen it before; kept quiet and actually forgot. Yesterday I saw a second dime-size one right below the first one, I don’t know if it’s new but it seems unlikely I missed it the first time. They look smooth and don’t have stubble on them. Small but look big because of her dark roots coming in. 

Very concerned. I know it will be a devastating topic to bring up if she doesn’t know, but what if bringing it up now means she can maybe get ahead of it? She has very erratic mood swings and while I would personally want to know, don’t know if maybe she’ll prefer not to have a depressing thing to worry about, especially if hair does start to grow back. 

Any advice would be infinitely appreciated, thank you.

454,"I have had this friend for around 10 months - note that, this was my second longest friend I have had. 

I shall call them Q.

Q took a certain test, where it would explain how the person acts (Sounds like bullshit after I typed it). They got the results back, and one of them was Rigger. Which, is best to look it up for the best explaination.
It is sad to say, they are like that. I don't like people like that but, they are my friend. 
Q has done a few things in the past: They have stolen my past boyfriend(?), as in, she would talk to him non-stop, rather it be in calls, or via DMs. It got to the point where he sent them an NSFW picture. They have also kept secrets from me about him. Which to me, made me question my trust for Q and him. Another thing, is that whilst my BF ghosted me, I said that we were over (my bf and I were over), but she said we weren't, whilst stating that isnt an official breakup. She only agreed with me when I got mad about, because she knew that she couldn't persuade me otherwise.
Overall, I changed for the worst, sadly I am not trying to say it was all their fault, but I became something I never wanted due to her actions and phrases.

I became really toxic, and rude to others. I wanted to sin another way, or in other words just wanted to be nice to people. Whilst Q also acts this way, and they are very egotistical too. I know, you have to take the small victories, and yes I can be a bit egotistical too, but in their case its a bit more worse. 

They also like to compare others and me, stating that their better, sometimes she states I'm better than them, but it is rare.

Overall, I just wish I had a different friend where we can think of something greater/nice. I'm clueless as to what to do, so I need peoples advice on: if I should leave her, stay, or if I am being to overdramatic. Sort of like an opinion, but also need help on what to do specifically.

455,"Me and two other dancers are in a group trying to choreograph an extremely long piece in a few days. Another dancer who is also my instructor (one who is not directing the piece) showed up an hour late to rehearsal and immediately started screaming at the choreographer when asked what she was going to do for her solo (we didn’t want repeated moves) 

I threw out a suggestion like “I think X move would be really cool with your character” and they BLEW UP. They started getting in the choreographers face because “WE don’t know what she’s going through” and “why would she suggest that move”, so I chimed in and corrected her by saying that I was the person who suggested that, and I was sorry. I was honestly just trying to diffuse the situation...but it didn’t go well. She left screaming called me and the choreographer C words and quit. Then she sent messages to someone else saying she was about to punch me in the face and I’m lucky.

The problem is, she was one of my *favorite* instructors before this insane outburst. I can just stop taking her classes, but I also might have to leave my dance studio to avoid drama...maybe I’m being a bit too reactive? I’ve been up all night playing it out. Any advice on how to handle this, hopefully without switching studios? Everyone is really cool, but at the end of the day it’s still dancer politics.

456,"So not that interesting, but I've run into a bit of  a dilemma here. 

Currently I'm taking an involuntary ""gap year"" (long story) and want to go to university this fall. I've worked for a bit this winter but quit because of personal reasons. Covid has made it hard to find a job since. 
Recently though I found one that I really like. However, they will only hire me if I were to stay for at least a year. This would mean that I would have to work during the beginning of the semester. 
My plan originally was to not work during the first semester (I would survive on the money I made already)so I could get used to Uni life and living in a new town. Taking this job would mean I'd not get this luxury and have to commute back to my hometown (about an hour) for this job every Saturday and work the whole day. 
It's a good job tho and I'd like to work it. Theres also a chance that the semester will be online in which case I would stay in my hometown anyway, this job would be perfect then. 
My parents have said to just lie and say that I'll stay for longer and then quit before Uni starts (legally I can do that) but I think its a bit of a dick move.

459,"I [F20] met this guy [M23] on tinder and we hit it off really well. We have a lot of things in common but obviously some differences as well. Now here's the main problem, I'm from Canada and he is from the States. But we're only an hour away from each other. We talked about this and he said it would take more than the border to break the bond ***(I know travelling across the border and meeting up isn't an option right now so as of now there's no way to physically meet up).***

Through this time we started enjoying talking to each other and he told me how he really likes me. He also added that I had ran into a keeper aka him. And I believed it all cause he's genuinely a sweet guy. Around the same time, he opened up to me and told me about this particular situation he was stressed out about which was a health issue (turns out the results for normal) anyway the point is that he kept telling me I was there for him through a tough time and how he appreciated that (this will come handy later). 

We continued to talk over tinder for around 3 weeks until he said he would give me his number. ***I should add, I didn't approach him for his number or give mine right away because I've dealt with a stalker in the past and it just didn't feel right until I made sure it was ok to do so.*** 

The first couple days were fine, we had good conversations. He then proceeded to ask me what I wanted and I was honest with him about everything. I even told him the stalker story and how I wanted everything to go slow. He agreed and told me that he wanted to do the same and has been taking his time. He also said that I was the only one he was enjoying his conversation with on tinder and how I was the only one he was talking to. He then suggested we do a phone call and I agreed to, however he ended up being busy that day and told me a few hours later while I waited. I mean I understood but it only takes a few seconds to text that, however I let it go. 

Ever since last Thursday, I've noticed he doesn't message in the morning. He doesn't respond to the last message from the night before. Which again I'd fine but at least start a conversation? 

I'm just confused because he was the one who kept asking if I was ready for his number which to me meant that he would be willing to talk over text then.
I should also add I went on tinder again and saw he wasn't in my matches anymore so I don't know what's up with that? I guess he unmatched or deleted his account? 

Now remember how I mentioned I was there for him?  This past week I was upset about something and through our conversation it came up and I told him what was up and he said ""I wish I could help"" but that's about it. He didn't message at all until the next day at 10P.M and asked if everything is fine. I understand people get busy but it's not that hard to try and send one text. What's sad is that he was the one who mentioned how important communication is to him...

I don't know what to do now. We talked a bit after that before he went to sleep and then it was the same thing again. No message or anything, so in the evening I asked how work was and he responded about 3 hours later and said he was off. Then he sent a couple texts and went to sleep. And before that he said ""you and I need to talk on the phone one of these days."" So there we go again, another mixed signal. I'm so confused, what should I do?

Hi Reddit.

I am a 26-year-old Australian male, dealing with a number of issues, namely Asperger’s, anxiety, depression, existential issues, and minor PTSD. For the sake of length, I’ll try not to go into too much detail (unless I’m asked), but I’ll give you the basic rundown. Over two years ago, I started taking anti-depressants, after a few of my work colleagues became concerned with my mental state. I have since used at least 8 different meds (with all but my current one giving me intermittent twitches and tremors), and have had a couple psychologists &amp; psychiatrists. Major concerns from work recently regarding my mental state has resulted in me being off work for the past few weeks, involving a trip to the hospital and an IME (independent medical examination) at work’s expense. The plan is for me to return next week.

To list everything that weighs on my mind would take too long, but the main factors are my fear of others (caused by a stranger mugging me in 2013, and my mental &amp; physical abuse at the hands of a roommate I considered a best friend in high school); my existential nihilism (the belief that life &amp; existence has no grand meaning or intrinsic value); my inability to relate to others, due to my narrow interests, thought processes and mannerisms; and my belief that my mere presence/existence is a problem or hindrance to others. Then, of course, COVID hasn’t made things any easier, as it has deprived me of one of my primary motivators for wanting to keep living – cinemas – which have been closed for a few months and everything I wanted to see has been delayed. I understand that cinemas being essential to my will to exist is weird, but it is how it is.

In the 2 years that I have been on-and-off meds and through different psychologists/psychiatrists, I feel that they have not been particularly helpful for me (the twitching alone has caused me to be sent home from work on numerous occasions, and work keeps me busy); even the meds I’m on now seem to increase my depressive tendencies despite my best efforts. I’m eternally grateful for my grandmother, my work, and one of my colleagues who is similar to me in terms of interests &amp; weird mannerisms; but with medication &amp; psychologists not really helping, and not really knowing any other actions to take, I can’t help but feel like I’m at the end of my rope.

I hope I’ve made some semblance of sense in my little essay here, but any thoughts, advice, or shared experience would be very welcome. Any questions, just ask.

465,"this might be a long post sorry! 

i have been friends with “Ash” for i would say nearly 10 years. basically we were best friends. we are in the same college together. we’re pretty similar, have very similar interests and we just got along really well. we both never had boyfriends before either which i think bonds people together to be honest. despite that i would say our friendship lacked communication. whenever one of us would get annoyed, it would be quite passive aggressive. she used to go on twitter and passive aggressively tweet stuff that i know was about me, lol. i’ve deleted my Twitter since. 

anyway, in college she introduced me to one of her guy friends. him and i eventually got together (we’ve been together for around 2 years now). i have always noticed “jealous” or whatever you call it, tendencies, with my friend but this was really when i think was so obvious. she started to leave all our group chats with my boyfriend, lol. she would stop hanging out with us.. i never felt like it was because my boyfriend and i were PDA. the most we did in public was hug and hold hands. i even got to the point where i asked my boyfriend if we could stop holding hands and stuff just so Ash wouldnt feel left out or anything. i soon came to realise that i shouldn’t have needed to do that. 

a few months later, she would tell us that she will only meet up with us but if we start to “make me (her) feel bad, I will leave”. when we asked her why she said that, she just ignored it. that really made me so furious! 

on top of that, i noticed her talk to me less and less. she went to another country for college and was feeling alone. that’s when i noticed her talking to me more and more, lol. at this point, I was already tired of giving so much energy to someone who didn’t reciprocate. i replied to her and felt that i was there but i know i wasn’t being genuine. i was there for her because i wanted to help, not because i really cared? why would I be there for her when she stopped being there for me when I was at my happiest? that took me a while to realise. 

fast forward to now, she came back here from her year abroad and is not lonely anymore, stopped talking to me. i don’t talk to her either because as i said above, nothing was reciprocated and i felt used. we only talk in group chats with our other friends. 

of course i do have my bad traits as a friend too but i feel like i was a good friend to her. 

Am i right in feeling this way?",07Jul2020,1
466,"I would appreciate any advice from any individual who seek something similar but also motivate people to hit the right note at the right time.

I unfortunately had to break up with my (ex)girlfriend who I have been together for one and a half year now. She was a confident, caring and strong women. This was very essential for any women to have and use it appropriately in their life. On the other hand, I am loyal, strategic and conventional type of guy who enjoys time and care. I am fully aware she enjoyed and appreciated me for who I was all along. Never having a second thought for my behavior or ethics.

She with many morals was also good at her job and was academically excellent. I comparatively work at a less earning faculty and am academically average. Most of the time this used to be a big insecurity I kept within myself as I wanted to do well and live well. I always had an urge to earn well so that I can keep her and rest of my family safe and secure. 

As time went by, I saw her progress in her life and do well. We both started at more or less at the same stage. Seeing how good she can manage her work life friends and family I felt attracted to her and also got slightly depressed and frustrated on myself. But my love for her took over my interest in doing better and we got together. I must acknowledge having her in my life was amazing and she was really a keeper. Sometimes, you realize certain things the hard way. 

I knew her overwhelming interest in films, books and art as a whole was quite fascinating and connected well with her. But just how insecurities hit very hard, I saw her more interested in talking and generalizing about her interested topics with our mutual friend who initially introduced us. To be frank, I hated it. I could not see her doing so good with our friend and hang around with him so much. Even though she is very honest and trustworthy my mind never felt happy seeing her going out with my friend for parties or bookstores when I used to sit back and do house chores or stay at my office working. Our friend is more open minded, better salary than me and ofc is more interested in art and books than I ever was.

She never had anything with him she says. But sometimes certain things never seem right. She after certain time started talking to him a lot and it pissed me. Won’t lie, I was at panic but concealed myself and started to get depressed. I went on to one day tell her that I hate how happy she seems with our friend and she agreed to help me out and avoid talking too much with our friend.

Then this COVID-19 hit us like a storm, we all had to isolate ourselves. I unfortunately was kicked out from my work while she and my friend were still working and doing healthy. For few weeks she did console me, and lended me a $1000 to get on my feet from depression. But while this happened she got one of her book published and did receive good remarks and as I was without a job, she went with our friend to parties and had a great time for her publisher book. I can’t say enough but I got turned up with jealousy and hatred seeing them succeed while I falter.

One night l, was very depressed and miserably shouted to her for being a cruel b**** and making me look miserable. I at first hesitated, but blocked her from all contacts and started living alone. Then gradually I felt great for few days. I realized, she was a part of my life. I kind of messed up and tried to call her up and talk to her. But to my dismay, she blocked me as well. I called my friends to get a chance to talk to her, but they said she is very very upset with what I said to her that night. 

I really felt like a clumsy guy at that moment. Because I cherished her and our relationship but I couldn’t take her friendship and success with a smile. Her success made me miserable. Made me look like a unworthy boyfriend who is being carried by his girlfriend. When I wanted it to be equal and get a chance to carry her too.

I deeply feel she don’t want to talk or see me anymore. I heard she cried a lot and lived with her friends for a couple of weeks. I at least want to apologize but I can never ever do that again. This will be an emotional scar on me. 

I wish I could do better and be better next time. Oh, I want to tell people out there sometimes it’s okay if your partner does better than you. That is what life is. Cherish them as they last....sometimes you might be fortunate to know YOU were the reason they were trying so hard. They felt like proving to you just the way you felt like proving to them. Never let your failure take over you and be depressed. Sometimes you can be unfortunate to not achieve what you get. But if you don’t love and respect what people who love you tries for your betterment. Your really cruel. Try to take it easy and maybe say “I love you”.....from heart to those few people you cherish and have been shown affection from.

Thank you.

467,"My gf and I are in a long distance relationship at the mo, we love each other to bits and spend a lot of time on call etc. She tends to hang out with dudes a lot, which is obviously chill but there is one guy that puts me off a little. She had feelings for him for a while before we got in a relationship and he hates the fuck outta me for no reason (he's never even spoken to me) - I don't think it's jealousy because he was always pretty open about the fact that he didn't have feelings for my gf. She hangs out with him a bunch and ik there's nothing going on but man it makes me feel low-key frustrated on the inside and i know that I shouldn't, but I do, and idk how to stop that. 

If they're on call she'll ignore all my messages until they're done whereas when we're on call she'll message him at the same time if he texts her (im on call with her for longer tho). Or sometimes she'll pick up the phone and he's literally the first thing she talks about. It bugs the fuck outta me at times but I don't say anything cause I don't want her to feel like she can't talk to me about him. im not sure where to go from here. Since lockdown, they've been meeting more and more and she talks about him increasingly often and I just don't wanna feel bitter about it.

472,"My little nephew loves to dress up, have his nails painted and dance. He’s an energetic little 4 year old and he’s just having fun. My sister’s partner (his dad) and I have never seen eye to eye for a number of reasons.

Recently, he’s been getting angry at my sister for allowing my nephew to wear dresses and heels and paint his nails. He says he’s afraid he will turn out to be gay.

I’m really not sure how approach this because I’m often told by my family that I don’t understand because I’m not a parent, and I’m too young (23) and shouldn’t be interfering. Of course, that’s wrong and a deflection tactic, but I want to respond to this carefully so they’ll actually listen to me.

Obviously, my first instinct is to tell him he shouldn’t be a father if he can’t accept that his child might be gay, and this is normal behaviour for a 4 year old anyway. I know that will be met with a defensive response.  

I am fearful that his children are growing up in a household where they are being taught that being gay is wrong and unacceptable which will inevitably hurt them when they’re older. 

I want to talk to them about this but I’m not sure how to do it without causing a huge argument. He and I have had many arguments in the past and I really want to approach this amicably because I want him to listen to me.

481,"I don’t fully support my sister’s engagement. Some advice/perspective on this situation would be helpful.

I just needed to get this off my chest and am looking for some perspective on this situation. I am sorry if my writing is sloppy. 

Five days ago, my sister met a guy at a restaurant in what was a “love at first sight” kind of ordeal. They talked a lot, and hung out every night since, and seemed to be hitting it off quite well... 

At first, she had said that they were just friends. And I understood it. At the time that she had met the guy at the restaurant, she was still in a relationship with her boyfriend of two years, although they were on a break. Well, the break ended in a breakup, and she announced just this morning that she had broken up with her boyfriend of two years. 

...

Yesterday, we had all gone out to dinner because my sister had invited him over the house and my mom had suggested we go to dinner. It was me, my mom, my sister, and the guy she had just met. It was clear to me that they were more than just friends, so I asked about their relationship and the guy said that they are dating, just that my sister hasn’t agreed to it yet. Well, my sister later on told me that “I guess we are dating now” and so that was that. 

Well, this evening, hours after she had announced her breakup, she went out with the guy again, and after coming back home, announced that she is engaged and that they will get married next month. 

Of course, I am completely in shock by this announcement and I tell her that I can’t support her decision to get married because I think it is ridiculous that he had proposed when they had just met a few days prior. My sister tells me that she knows that he is the one and that he is genuine and kind... but I am just not convinced. 

I just can’t shake the bad vibes that I got from him when I met him at dinner. And I could not trust the guy since I had just met him... My sister tells me that I don’t understand... that he is being genuine and their feelings for each other is real. 

At this point, I just don’t know what else to say about it. They are completely lovestruck and anytime I try to reason with my sister, she just tells me that I don’t understand, and that he is a kind and everything she every wanted in a man... and that she is happy and feels like this is right, and that he is the one. 

My sister is 20 and the guy is 23. It’s their lives and their decision, but my sister says that she won’t marry him without my approval. I don’t want to stand in the way of their decision, and all I want is for my sister to be happy. So, I told her that I will support her decision to get married as long as she is happy and that she is sure of this decision. But, really, I don’t fully support it... I’m even considering not being involved in the wedding, nor attending... I don’t want to ruin the relationship that I have with my sister but I just can’t wrap my head around this situation.  

When my sister told my parents, they just thought she was being ridiculous and laughed it off but the guy is coming over tomorrow to ask my parents for their blessing. 

I don’t want to step in the way of her decision or relationship, but I think it is too soon... I really don’t know how else to get through to her... 

And it seems like nothing I say, or anyone says  will change her mind so I know I should probably just step out of the way and let her live her life since this is just stressing me out, but I just can’t step away.",07Jul2020,1

The problem is I have so much trouble falling asleep if I don’t have my phone on me. Usually I just scroll through social media or read ebooks until I feel tired enough to pass out mid task, like what’s happening right now.

I hate the silence of trying to go to sleep on my own, even with a fan on for white noise. I can’t play any background noise because I share a room with my sister.

I just don’t feel tired if I try to fall asleep  voluntarily. There would be times when I would notice how tired I am, put my phone down and close my eyes, and suddenly be feeling energized. It’s impossible for me to go to bed without it.

This means staying up until 3 or 4 on most nights (2:54 AM right now). I’m exhausted, I’ve tried shutting my phone off, taking meds, going to bed earlier, or just outright laying there for half an hour or more.

483,"So, I've started a new job at the beginning of July. It's more in line with my education and I thought it would be more in line with what I want as well. They would also teach me plenty new skills. But if everything was so neat, I wouldn't be writing this post.

I see many red flags that they forgot to mention during the interview. Like that in involves working on most bank holidays in my country, or that as soon as I'm done with my probationary period they are doing some kind of transition and the annual holidays will be freezed for several months - which would mean that my next day off would be sometime in March, Christmas and whatsnot included. Which is a huge misery triggger for me, for family and personal reasons (that I won't get to deep into - but I'm working on it during therapy and whatsnot). They also lied about having to handle incoming calls (in a different language) - if I wanted/were mentally able to do that, I would have stuck to my first customer support job. Overall, I feel threatened and as if my life will be taken from me completely in the nearby future. It is an exaggeration from a logical point of view, but it's how I feel.

I want to quit. My previous job might take me back, since I was good and they don't have a suitable replacement, but I can't be sure. It would also be a pretty embarrassing thing to do, I think. It paid a bit less, but I didn't feel a constant dread. I also worry that if I do, I might regret it.

They cut ties with us, they barely talk to us on the phone anymore, and, of course, we don't see them anymore. 

I've known some of them for 15+ years, and I can tell that they don't seem happy. In the rare occasions in which I get to talk to them, I try to talk to them more intimately, like fuck, I've known you guys for so long, I guess I am allowed to ask you questions that are more personal.

I already signed a lease for an apartment to move into in August but ever since the pandemic I don’t know if I should. 

I want to because it’s very hard to concentrate in this house and stay productive. Along with the fact that my family doesn’t always get along so at times I’ll be up at 2 am just to hear doors slamming and arguing.

The upcoming fall semester at my university is online so my parents want me to stay home instead of move out. They are even talking to me about moving me into a bigger room within the house with door knobs that lock (my childhood room has no lock on it) to get me to stay. 

Staying home makes sense because I’ll be able to save money, have free food, and access to a car to see my significant other who lives a little bit away. But I hate the arguing and even my therapist told me it would be better to distance myself if possible. And my boyfriend would rather me move out because he hears how stress and anxious I get within my household.

I am a 24 y/o man and still living with my parents in the semi-urban area of the Philippines. I finished my degree last 2016 and currently working full time as home-based Website Designer and Developer.

I've been working since I was a student. My first job was actually a disaster (and great).

**Here's my timeline:**

|2013 - 2015|2015 - 2016|A month of 2016|2016 - 2017|Q4 2017|2018 - Present|

7 years of working yet I have nothing much. Still poor as rat.

I am not 100% sure but I think my net worth is less than $8,000 USD. My current salary is enough to survive but I don't want this life of surviving forever. Not just for myself but also for the people around me.

490,"I'm 21 years old, and I'm going into my final year of university. Going into college, I wasn't 100% sure of what career path I wanted to pursue. At first, I was thinking of going pre-med and my original major was in Bioengineering. However, after taking some of the introductory courses, I lost interest and knew it wasn't something I wanted to pursue. I switched to a double major in Economics and Statistics, and I like what I'm learning in my classes. I find it practical, intriguing, and intellectually challenging especially once you get to the higher-level mathematical topics. 

Unfortunately, after countless applications, interviews, and hours spent into trying to land a summer internship, I failed. I worked my ass off trying to secure one. I went to career fairs, networked with recruiters, made it to the final-round interviews. But all of it was in vain. That crushed me because it seems like everyone around me is doing well in life. Several of my friends are going off to med school, earning their professional credentials, or working for big and successful companies. Meanwhile, I'm two semesters away from graduating with essentially zero experience. I feel lost, defeated, and behind everyone else. I know it's not a race, but I can't help but feel like I'm stuck in this bubble, where everyone is moving forward and all I can do is watch.

Add on my long-term shitty mental health issues, pressure from my family, and low confidence, and you get the picture.

Don’t know where to ask. I have visions. Advice?

I’m Mayan and I honestly believe I’m being called to shamanism in Mesoamerican practice. I see things though without asking for it and when I want it, it doesn’t come. I was praying once and had an image of a woman juggling on my mind. A voice told me to find this image. I walked around a building and got lost. I turned around and found a mural of that woman juggling! The voice then said that to pray and worship is to come together, since the mural was actually painted by various members in the community. I also had a vision of a woman getting hit as I was praying for her. I asked if she was being abused by a partner and she said yes. I told her she needed to leave him. I also once prayed for a friend and smelled bubble gum. Very distinctive. I asked my friend if the scent meant anything and he cried saying his uncle abused him and he would have pink gum beside his bed. I don’t believe in claiming spiritual labels or like I’m a bruja (witch) or curendera (healer), but am feeling called seeing that these mediums are used for profit and I prioritize healing and clarity over making money. I was just sitting and that voice said to look into getting a black obsidian mirror (used for divination by the Mexica). I also had a vision of a blue eagle, red serpent, white child bearer, and yellow warrior. Literally was in a room with the lights off and saw them with my eyes open (no drugs, no stress, and no mental health issue). I googled and found it’s images from a dude named Jose Aguilleres? I contacted someone who wrote a blog post on these images, but she’s a white lady and wanted me to buy a reading from her. I said no thanks, so then she said if I’m Mayan, it’s probably the spirits trying to connect to me?

498," What's up everyone! About one month ago my (24M) relationship with a woman (32F) ended after 2 months of dating and 4 months of casually talking. When things ended she strongly insisted that we be friends, however I did not want to be friends because I still like her. The month of June passes by and now less than a week ago we began talking again. She addmited that things got too close between us, which encouraged her to break things off. What she defines as too close is that I met her friends on more than one occasions and we spent too much time together. However, when we were dating I never forced or even asked to hang out with her friends or even with her as frequently as we did. She always invited me to come over and encouraged me to stay and hang with her friends. I was always following her lead as I understand that she just left a 7 year relationship.

She admitted to me that she crossed the line after I pointed this out and said ""You know me, sometimes I go too much with the flow.""

499,"Hi everybody. I’m 31 years old. I’m working in a warehouse in Netherlands. In my home country (Lithuania) I’ve studied economy and managment but because I ran out of money I had to stop my studies and go to work. And then life happened and Now I’m stuck here in Netherlands in a warehouse as a simple employee, I have a mortgage (I need to have income every month), I have a girlfriend that doesn’t care about finances so that means every month I need to pay from my own pocket. 
Let’s come back to the main point. I don’t like my job and I hate my collegues. They are so dumb when it comes to desicion making and they never want to listen to my ideas and since last month they don’t even ask me for my ideas. The manager says that we have to solve everything by ourself. I’m learning the language (B1 level). But I’m stuck in my constant daily circle of going to work for 9h per day, go home to take the dog out, take care of the house and at the end of the day I have no power or idea what should I do with my life and career. 
I love counting, doing simple math, working with my laptop and I loved the studies that I started in my home country but I could not study anything here because of the language barrier and finances. 
Maybe someone has any advices how to handle my life and career situation? I don’t want to be stuck as a hamster in this endless circle.",07Jul2020,1

502,"So, I have known these people for 3-10 years at this point, they are overall nice supportive and don't mind my problems with mental illnesses and overall weirdness. The problem is that these people have belitteled my problems with panic disorder and anxiety, one of them was openly  dissapoointed in me because of self harm, they use the n- word and believe in reverce racism (wich I do not agree with) 

I remember the first time I went to a psych ward some of them visited and they were in regural contact trough messages, but the second time they ignored me completely.

 I never really hang out with them because they only go to a big mall or to the city and I can't handle that type of social interaction. They never ask me to come personally, they always talk about going out in our groupchat and ask certain people to come but never mention me anymore. 

I just feel so alone with them and I never know whats going on in their lives, we have drifted appart. With most of them I'll go to the same high school, and as I have zero social skills and can't make friends on my own, I would be all alone in a new school and that would make going to school almost impossible. 

Also I have been stimming in public for the first time after opening up to my dad about my problems (I am going to meet my doctor soon to talk about my problems) and I'm afraid if I stim and get diagnosed with autism, I'll make them ashamed of me and they'll leave me

507," Hello everyone thank you for taking the time to read this.

I  am college student and last week my best friend forced me to go to his  girlfriend's birthday party and I accepted. As a side note, I usually  don't like gathering with people I barely know, I feel awkward and  rarely have fun at those, in general I have very few friends and fully  commit to my relationships with them.

During  the party I had fun, I met this girl she talked to me for a bit, asked  me about myself, we exchanged few opinions, overall, very interesting  discussion, it felt great and really enjoyed myself (precision: no  romantic intent from any of the parties, I feel the need to set this  straight from the get go). I knew she had a boyfriend and I told her  about my girlfriend (3 year long, happy relationship) very early into  the discussion; and I feel like the fact that we both knew that we were  not looking for more than just a cool discussion and some laughs made it  pretty smooth.

The day after  that, my best friend gets invited again by almost the same group of  people to film a clip for a stupid rap song and asks if I wanted to go, I  said yes. This time me and the girl from the other day take care of the  filming and get to spend some time together, which was nice. The day  after she adds me on instagram . All this was very weird to me at first,  I enjoyed myself much more than I ever expected, even with the group of  friends I did not know.                                                                                During the week I felt a little bit down  without really knowing why and after hours of discussion with my best  friend I figured out that there was something missing in my life. In  high school (and even before) I had loads of female friends that I all  lost for different reasons, many of them were because they wanted  something more (one time, my best friend (f) at the time tried to cheat  on her bf with me, I knew the guy, did not want to hurt anyone, told her  that we could not be friends anymore). It was easy for me to make new  friends at the time, I was in very small school and everyone knew each  other from childhood, for my part friends came and went, I've never  really been part of a group of people, I was really close to a really  limited number of persons at once, I never really thought about it  before now since I didn't make any effort to make friends at the time.  Now that I have been abroad for four years ,I've lost most of my  acquaintances from high school, but I've also met few people, my  girlfriend and I have 3 male friends.

I  think I want to make a female friend and I don't know how to go about  it. In general, I'm pretty solitary, only two of the four people that  matter to me live in the same city as I do and each one of them have  their own life and things to deal with. I like being this way, never  felt sad about it before today. This experience I had with the  discussion with this girl made me realize how much I miss having a  female friend. I know that the way I am does not help, I don't do social  gatherings, don't go to events, don't talk to strangers on campus, I  dress kinda dark-ish (far from emo and goth but lets say I don't need to  separate clothes by color for the most part) and once you talk to me, I  try to be friendly, but I have strong opinions and love to debate so I  would not say that I am the most likeable human out there, but I know  that once you get to know me, I am a great friend and I'd do anything to  help you out if I can.

I did not  DM her on instagram even though I wanted to, for various reasons. First,  I don't usually do these kinds of things, secondly, even if I did do  it, I would not know what to tell her without her thinking that I want  something more than just getting to know her, thirdly, the more I waited  the more I felt like it was too late to do anything about it. Being  socially distant is sometimes very hard for me, In a perfect world I  would start a message like this:"" Hi, I really enjoyed our discussion  last week, I know that you have a boyfriend, I also have a girlfriend  and I only want to make friends with you nothing more, how about  grabbing coffee sometime and finish the discussion from last time.""  If  this was acceptable and not socially weird, I would have done it for  sure, I told both my friends about it and they had a good laugh. Also, I  am assuming that I want a female friend, but  what if the connection to  this particular person was what I needed,  this would be my only shot  to make friends with her and I would not want to jinx it.

I  talked about this to my girlfriend and she is supportive of it, she  always tried to make me meet new people in the past, but it never worked  out, she says that I am really picky. My friends want to integrate me  into more of their social events,  I have mixed feelings about this  because the fact that I enjoyed this one doesn't delete all previous  experiences that I had before with these  gatherings, I would not say it  was awful, but in general three things happened: Did not talk, made  enemies because of debating, got bored and wanted to go home. The  situation with the girl  from the story is kind of complicated, she is  the best friend of my  best friend's girlfriend and I only got to meet  her on three occasions and I  don't want to pressure my friend into  taking me with him every time just to try to slowly bond with her, in  addition to that,  I discovered that my best friend's gf moved into a  student apartment and her new roommate is my ex, and I'd feel  uncomfortable seeing my ex each time I go there.

So  how do I make a female friend, without her thinking I want to flirt  with her and also with me being this mysterious, socially distant  sarcastic dude. I know the story was long and not easy  to read, I am  sorry, thank you if you took the time to finish it.

tl;dr  I met a girl at a party, felt like I wanted to befriend her, we both   have our respective romantic relationships, I feel like I am lacking   feminine friendship in my life, want to meet a new friend, but  I don't  go to events or gatherings because for the most part I don't  like it, I  am socially distant and reserved as a person and also don't  want them  to get the wrong idea since I am very happy with my girlfriend.",07Jul2020,1

510,"This is going to start with a lot of whining, just so you know the reasons behind me feeling sorry for myself:

Yesterday, I found out that my ex-fiance has just gotten married. I was with him for 12,5 years and we broke up three years ago. Our relationship was okay, but he had no drive whatsoever. Everything that had to be done, I did. I looked for jobs for him, I helped him through his education, I cooked, cleaned, bought his clothes, heck, I even bought the rings so he could propose. I did everything.

I pushed and pushed to get him to do something with his life. I realize now that I was wrong, I shouldn't have pushed him and that is part of the reason why we broke up. But finding out now that he is married and looking for a house kills me. He has everything I want and I feel like I've wasted my life with him. 

I've found a new boyfriend since we broke up (and I do not want my ex back, don't get me wrong), who I love and we've just bought a wonderful house, which we are moving into next week. However, my boyfriend was laid off from work last week and is now unemployed. It came out of nowhere and we're both shocked. I just feel like I can never catch a break and I'm starting to wonder if I'm the problem? My bf has been laid off twice within the past year and my ex-fiance was also going from job to job, when we were together. 

On top of that everyone around me are getting engaged, married and having children (I can't have children at the moment but am trying to change that situation). I'm 32, I have a great job that I love but I still feel like I've accomplished nothing in life. I just feel so sorry for myself and I don't know what to do anymore. 

**So my question is: How can I move past feeling sorry for myself and make my life better?** 

I feel stuck and I don't know what to do anymore. Sometimes, I don't want to be here anymore, I feel like I've no reason to live.",07Jul2020,1

512,"I think it must be a week and a half or two weeks ago a thought popped into my head, ""it would suck if you started thinking about your ex at every waking moment of every day."" Not in a way that would be about missing them or reminiscing or even thinking about them as a person, but in such a way where I simply do not want to think about it but I do. It has become a thing where the concept of what I am thinking of has become simply thinking of ""it"" and trying to stop thinking of ""it"", I suddenly catch myself thinking of it and try desperately to stop to no avail. When I wake up in the morning it is the first thought that pops into my mind, not even the concept of them but ""I do not want to think of it, please return to normal"". I cannot overstate how often it is that I think of it, it feels like it is every other thought that it is there. Many times I have tried playing a video game that I greatly enjoy called Hades which is set in Greek mythology and had the thought that it would be awful if I associated the game with this thought that I am trying to stop thinking about. Since then I think of it while I am trying to enjoy this game that I greatly love and has since evolved in such a way that also looking at anything or anyone from ancient Rome or Greece makes me think of it and try to stop, which is a hindrance because I am very interested in ancient and classical history. It has also evolved in such a way that when I think of it I also think of people I have not seen in years that I don't like and thus very much do not want to think about, such as someone from my middle school who was deeply racist, homophobic and took pride in the thought of american war crimes. I tried to look up ways to help and believe that it is something called the ""white bear problem"" where attempting to suppress a thought makes you think of it more but I cannot find anything on it persisting for weeks on end.

I also left because I had become reliant on them for entertainment and I just didn’t have fun doing my own things anymore and was constantly plagued with the fear of missing out on whatever they were doing.

519,"TLDR: social isolation and  crappy friends have left me somewhat depressed and unmotivated, no one invites me to hangout anywhere and it has been harmful to my mental health. how do i get over this?



apologies for the rather dramatic title.  i never thought i would write one of these asking for social advice.



background:



my family moved from spain to the USA for two years when i started middle school, then back to the USA for 8th grade, and moved back to spain for 9th grade, which i have now completed.

9th grade was difficult for me social wise cause i had  an expectation that i would really connct with a few old friends and it didnt happen. we hungout, but after november they became really distant. in short, other kids had joined out grade the year i was gone, old friends came back mid this year, and a new kid became friends with him.


from November on, we didnt hangout alot and he would say digging comments like "" that joke isnt funny anymore"" or just second guess me when he asked me something. mostly he was nice, but he didnt go out of his way to seek me out, and i was on the outside of the social group. he would leave me  out to dry if he made plans with someone else,  he wouldnt follow up if we made plans, stuff like that. I would always see them going to movies or hanging out, and i was never invited. no one from that group sought me out during school either, i was generally starting conversations, even though i had asked to hangout with a few of them several times, they were usually busy or (once) called sick.



apologies for the detail,  i just wanted to set the background for my turmoil.



this lack of social  contact has hurt my self esteem and confidence, as well as my mental health. im in kinda a crappy place rn, i feel unmotivated to do rly anything other then  play video games with my cousin.  i often wish that i was back in the states with good friends.  i have friends i talk to and message online, but those are just  ppl i see at school, not really friends.



i tend to second guess myself more in social situations, despite not being socially awkward, and i have developed a tendency to stutter.


I have friends in the usa that i talk to as well. 



how do i get out of this state and put myself out there?? gain meaningful friends instead of people who cant be bothered to invite me anywhere?",07Jul2020,1

524,"I dont know where to start but I’ll start at the beginning. Im sorry but this is going to be long

I have been out of school for about a year and I left school because I was not in the right state of mind. I was dating someone i met there but the relationship was toxic and my depression was at an all time high I couldn’t handle it so I broke it off. For a good six months I had no interest in anyone or to try and do anything. No sex, no texting, nothing. I just wanted to be by myself. I got a second job at an amusement park and thats when I met this chick( I’ll call her N from here on out).

When I first met her at orientation I thought she was cute, and worked up the courage to talk to her. Found out we were going to be working in foods so I was going to see her for training until they send us to our locations. N was a bit shy in person but talked to me and sat next to me in trainings and I thought it was cool. It was all brief because they were trainings so I eventually got her snap and thats when I started falling for her. I commented on her story and from the beginning there was this vibe. A chemistry I have never felt. It was like I understood her and she understood me. She’s incredibly witty, charming, and sarcastic. With each message I felt like I could be more and more myself.

We didn’t talk everyday. She had school and I didn’t want to bug her. But whenever we did it was almost as if we never stopped. We got to hangout during a break and it was quite fun. I honestly didn’t plan on any of this. Like i said earlier, I wasnt looking for someone to be with. It was like it found me. Or at least it felt like. Anyways for a good while I wanted to ask her out. Officially, but I got weird vibes. As in I shouldn’t do because I am still trying to get better so I can go back to school and finish my degree, as well I dont want to drag her down with my problems. Also, a girl like M was to good to be true to be single. But in the end I asked her out, twice. And she rejected me.

The first time she said she had been hurt and isnt looking for something; The second time i asked her i was drunk not gonna lie and thats when she told me there was someone else. My heart melted. But I had to respect what she said. I couldn’t bring myself to block her from snapchat so i ended up deleting it entirely. About a month goes by and i download snapchat again and see she had messaged me a couple days ago. Saying she didn’t feel good about how things left off and I had suddenly disappeared and she was worried. I message her telling her im fine. I just deleted snapchat because I needed to stop seeing her posts or else I wouldn’t be able to move on. I ended up telling her everything, about why i had left school, my toxic relationship, how I wasn’t even thinking about a relationship and then boom she appeared. She understood, and honestly I was glad that I was talking to her again. I really did enjoy our conversations. She’s the type of person I fee like needs to be in my life. If its just being friends then so be it. 

I ended up giving her my number in case she ever wanted to talk/text. And we started talking once again. But this time I was keeping myself in check and really just focusing on a friendship with her. Thats what she wanted and maybe it was for the best. Covid happens and well shes back at home taking school online and so she kinda has more time to talk so we’ve been talking a bit more. Then one day, about a month ago she confesses something that I just shook me.

She tells me that (in her own way) she has feelings for me, that it feels wrong but right at the same time. However she is still with the other guy and its gotten more serious between them. But she cant help feel the way she felt. Now at this point I didn’t really know what to say. Because I truly like this girl, but i didn’t take the opportunity to try and win her over. Instead I told her she should be with him, cause I’ve been talking with someone else too (which is true, I started to talk with someone over tinder and we’ve had the chance to see each other a couple of times). But I felt like that was a mistake. I should have fought for her. Ever since that day I haven’t been able to keep my feelings in check. Each day we talk it just stokes the flame. I feel bad for the tinder girl, in semi moments of intimacy I can’t stop thinking of M. 

Now im here at a crossroad. I’ve been talking to M more often because we decided to binge watch a tv show on Netflix together and do it through the Netflix party extension. I still believe she had those same feelings for me, but im worried each day they diminish and she’ll end up seeing me as just a friend. The people I’ve told about what she confessed to me have told me she likes me more than the other guy, he’s probably just the safer option and she doesn’t want to end things with him because he probably is a genuine good guy and there isn’t a reason to end things so he’ll get hurt.

Im just super conflicted, I want to tell her how I feel. But I dont want to risk the relationship we have now. What if she stops talking to me, blocks me and I never see/hear from her again?

It’s a shit show man. Being so close yet so far is the story of my life and its just adding on to the list of things not going my way and im just tired of it.

I am in a weird place with work right now. Im looking for some advice on what job I should take.

I currently work as an emergency service specialist basically I work in a fire department driving apparatus and being a firefighter / EMT. The company is a union and I get great benefits. However, I only make $13.75 an hour.

Now a buddy of mine wants me to work with his company doing energy consulting which is salary+ commission. It has all the same benefits as where I work now but, I have the opportunity to make 6 figures.

529,"Sorry if this gets long..

I (18M), used to be in an LDR relationship with K(19F) for 1.5 years. She was essentially my first everything and the relationship was beautiful, in the first few months at least.

Unfortunately the distance, despite meeting up relatively often, put a strain on our relationship, creating problems and externalities in our relationship that would not other wise be present. This led up to the relationship getting unbelievably toxic and unhealthy in the past couple of months.

It should be noted that it was mostly my fault, considering that in the past few months she was putting a lot of effort into bettering herself and repairing th relationship, while I, being considerably busy with studies and having given up deep down, was not reciprocating.

At one point, I reflected upon the state of the relationship, and knowing that due to our age and distance this was not going to go anywhere, I decided to break up with her instead of deciding to put in equal effort. I still feel extreme guilt over dragging her along and letting her repeatedly attempt to repair something irrepairable.

The break up was not the cleanest unfortunately, and due to being done over videocall (LDR), there was never really a feeling of true closure.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to now, 5 months later, and I am still not over her. I still compulsively check up on her instagram stories, and when i notice her liking a post about relationships or getting over an ex, i always feel like they are targetted at me. I'm tired of not noticing progress in regards of getting over her and i do not know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

Having her birthday slowly approaching I was thinking of writing a long ass message to her reflecting upon our relationship and apologising, and finally blocking her on instagram and moving on. My friend however told me this was a terrible idea and that I should not hurt her anymore than i already have. 

I do not understand how providing some much needed closure will hurt her though. 

I really want to move on, but i do not want to hurt her either.

530,"This is what I have so far


Hey ______, I wanted to have a serious conversation with you. I’ve noticed we haven’t been close lately and I genuinely want to fix our relationship as cousins. Ive made stupid and immature mistakes in my past, I haven’t always acted my age, and I’m sorry that I’ve done anything to hurt you, if you want to talk let me know.

So basically long story short, me and my cousin used to be super close, apparently he’s disliked me for the past few years, (Ive had no idea just how much he actually disliked me until recently, like for the past year I knew he didn’t really like me but now I think he borderline hates me). The reason behind that is because me and my other cousin (his younger brother) used to make jokes, honestly I can’t remember them but I will say this, I never thought they would bother him, they seemed harmless, they were dumb jokes, stuff like him never expressing emotions, or like him being super generic, there were clear lines I didn’t cross but obviously the fact that I talked behind his back is what made him hate me.

He apparently talks bad about me, I don’t wanna say frequently but enough, I don’t know exactly what it is but from what I heard it’s along the terms of “dad [younger cousin] will never change just like Dan, (my names not dan but you get the point) 

Also, I can’t really mention anything specific, unless he brings up specific instances, because if I name anything specific he’ll know his younger brother told me. He honestly probably won’t give a fuck, and respond with a half ass response like “ok no problem” usually when I try to hit him up he will respond days later on purpose showing zero interest.",07Jul2020,1

533," I think it must be a week and a half or two weeks ago a thought popped into my head, ""it would suck if you started thinking about your ex at every waking moment of every day."" Not in a way that would be about missing them or reminiscing or even thinking about them as a person, but in such a way where I simply do not want to think about it but I do. 

   It has become a thing where the concept of what I am thinking of has become simply thinking of ""it"" and trying to stop thinking of ""it"", I suddenly catch myself thinking of it and try desperately to stop to no avail. When I wake up in the morning it is the first thought that pops into my mind, not even the concept of them but ""I do not want to think of it, please return to normal"". I cannot overstate how often it is that I think of it, it feels like it is every other thought that it is there. 

   Many times I have tried playing a video game that I greatly enjoy called Hades which is set in Greek mythology and had the thought that it would be awful if I associated the game with this thought that I am trying to stop thinking about. Since then I think of it while I am trying to enjoy this game that I greatly love and has since evolved in such a way that also looking at anything or anyone from ancient Rome or Greece makes me think of it and try to stop, which is a hindrance because I am very interested in ancient and classical history. 

   It has also evolved in such a way that when I think of it I also think of people I have not seen in years that I don't like and thus very much do not want to think about, such as someone from my middle school who was deeply racist, homophobic and took pride in the thought of american war crimes. 

   I tried to look up ways to help and believe that it is something called the ""white bear problem"" where attempting to suppress a thought makes you think of it more but I cannot find anything on it persisting for weeks on end. How can I stop thinking of it and return my mind to normal and also erase this association with these things that i love?",07Jul2020,1

535,"so i just turned 18 and i currently live in an extremely conservative muslim country but for 2 years now i've been an  atheist and haven't told anybody because of a fear of being ostracised from my community and family,and every time i even get close to any question about this i get confronted with just ""god said it"" so now fo long time i only had myself to talk to about my thoughts and keeping many of my convictions secret and even pretending to do religious activities.

about a year and half ago i before sleeped i had a massive panic attack where a started feeling an intense sense of dread and impending doom and a feeling like someone is standing on my chest and that i can't do anything about it,since then a lighter version of this happened 2 times a week (lasts about 30 min) i mostly just lived through it but this time i have an extremely important exam in 2 months and am being reminded daily about it by literally everyone i talk to so this triggered the panic attacks and increased their intensity so now every night for 2 months now i start panicking,my heart rate increases and i feel so hot that i want to rip my clothes off,i can't control my breathing rate i start sweating and feel like am going to die and most importantly i start reminding myself about all the stuff i can't talk about and all the things i fake to get by everyday and how i can talk about with anyone,this gets worse every night by my mind digging through more stuff that i can't do or talk about and how i am never going to change that so everyday i try to ignore it in daytime  but its always happens at night when everything is quite and am alone,this adds up with things like social perception that expressing emotions is not ""masculine"" or not responding to older people even if they say something that hurts me.

I've\[22M\] been with my girlfriend\[20F\] for about a year now, and knew her for about a year prior to becoming partners, but how do I know that the search is over? With my relationship before her, I was with her for 3 years on and off, and I feel like I wasted a lot of time, hoping she'd change but she never did, so I got tired and left. For my current girlfriend, I made sure she did not have any traits I did not like, then when I felt I knew her well enough, I asked her to be my girlfriend.   


The thing is, I eventually got to know her family and her a bit better, and I don't like her family much, but I don't hate them. With that being said, I know that families are a big part of the future of the relationship, but not all of it. To add to this, she has certain traits that, upon discovering them once in the relationship, I'm not particularly very fond of.   


I feel like she has, just to estimate a number for this example, 7-8 good traits and 2-3 bad, but I'm not sure if I should not settle, and can find someone right for me, or am right where I should, and that small amount of bad traits and 50% quality/50%non-quality family is no big deal.  


I don't want to end up investing my time wrongly again, however, I do like her personality way more than my previous relationship; despite this, I feel like I can find someone with a bit more character,  and a good family.

542,"My landlords recently bought a house and redid the whole thing. They are an old couple - in their 60s.

They said I could move over some of my things yesterday evening and gave me a key to the house. By the time I got everything in my car, it was around 10 PM. I drove over to the house with my boyfriend and we saw 3 women who were very obviously prostitutes approaching the car. They saw that it was a couple and sort of looked surprised, then walked to the other side of the road. A man came by and one got in with him, and the other two kept on walking and stood at the corner of the road for a while.

A few minutes later, 3 extremely drunk men come walking out of the house next door (which almost appears to be an abandoned house). A few minutes after that, a few more women, and then a woman came out and locked the door. 

The landlords had told me that before that they ""did not know what was going on next door and the property was a disaster inside"".

I called them right away to tell them this and they seemed to not believe me. They were saying that never happens there, if it did they'd be shut down, it's just a place that sells food and serves alcohol, there isn't any prostitution.

550,"I (18m) thought about this a lot. Sorry for eventual grammar errors, I’m Italian and now I’m pretty tired. Since I was in elementary school I always had a really particular point of view on sentimental relations. I take them really really seriously, which is ok for an adult, but for a little dude like me it’s more unusual and there’s nothing bad about it for me, unusual things aren’t bad. To summarise what does “seriously” mean for me, in a relation there must be 100% trust, transparency, responsibility and sincerity, explicitly asking for it, from both parts ( obviously I developed this idea of love growing up, when I was like 10 I started having the first drafts of this idea, experience and life actually shaped it hahah ). Not everyone is prepared for a relation like this at my age and I’m ok with it. There’s a girl (16f) that I have a crush on ( the story behind the relation between the two of us is pretty long and not important to this post, but you can imagine for a serious relation a more serious kind of crush, it took months to fully develop and really know each other ) and obviously I would like to tell her about my feelings and, for what a friend of hers told me, she probably feels the same way, so everything is perfect, right? Nope, here’s the problem. From traumas I got in past I have serious trust issues ( I can’t basically trust anyone except for me, I really hate it, it’s terrible and limiting ), heavy anxiety and paranoia, which is related to the trust issues. If I want a relationship based on trust and I can’t trust her, I can’t actually start the relationship. Next week I’ll go for the first time in years to talk to a therapist, I should’ve begun years ago, but I’m happy that I’ll start the therapy, with patience I think my problem will mitigate and perhaps disappear and that’s great, I love my life and knowing that I could be more happy, but having these problems stopping me from reaching that happiness irritates me. Anyway, thinking about the present, I don’t know if I can do anything to help myself with this problem other than wait for the therapist to start helping me help myself. I know that she’ll help me with my trust issues ( if she actually shares the same feelings I have for her ), but now I’m in a condition where I really can’t show minimum sign of trust that isn’t guided by rationality ( for example, I know that my food isn’t poisoned, just ‘cause nobody in my house wants me dead, but I fear the chance that someone could actually kill me this way just ‘cause I wasn’t enough smart to prevent it, but that’s just paranoia, in some moments it affects me, but usually it doesn’t ), I’m never really relaxed and I never let my guard down, so a relation in this moment could be really complicated, for me and her. I will actually start thinking about a relation in a more concrete way when I will begin to see some improvements with these trust issues. So what I’m asking you is, what can I do to help myself with this problem? Overcome a mental health problem ain’t easy I know, but what could help me to begin the climb that will lead to little improvements? To make a metaphor I know the therapist is the medic that will, slowly, cure my problem, now I’m asking you for first aid, something to start with hahahah.

So the baseline is: I'm a virgin and I want to have sex and lose it. There's a friend of mine and I'm pretty sure she'd be down to have sex.

There are just a few things that make me doubt if I should:
- I don't love her. I'm pretty sure I'd be down for just sex though.
- objectively speaking, she's not THE best looking. She's just not quite my type. I'm worrying about wether or not I'm going to like kissing her (I view kissing as something lovers do?)
She's also pretty awkward and not the best in social situations. Just overal a bit weird? But she's very smart and really tries her best to get along with most people.
- why am I thinking about this so much now? I'm gonna have the house to myself for a few days and that would seem like a good time to invite her (if she agrees to being fwb).
My only concern is: I'm not gonna be home alone for quite a while after that and don't want to deal with explaining our relationship to my parents so I can invite her over(it's just not gonna be easy to explain and have them be okay with it...), Her house is probably also not an option.

This situation is weird because I can trust them in terms of being ""friends"", I can confide in them and become vulnerable around my friends that I do trust but the moment women and romanticism/topic of liking someone comes up, I'm really on edge.

The reason for this is because with my past few relationships, I didn't have good experiences and I realized I behaved in a ""simpy"" manner, I had no respect for myself to turn away and dump the girl. I was emotionally manipulated and abused by my last ex-girlfriend and my mind snapped after that.

I stopped talking to girls and became sexually repressive. I watch(ed) porn and use(d) it as my main sexual outlet because I just genuinely had enough. I closed myself off from the rest of the world, started giving a fuck about myself and my family and focused on myself. Got myself into therapy and have been going for 2 years.

Recently, my girlfriend \[21F\] and I  \[21M\] applied to two PhD positions in a Nordic country. We are both doing Master's in science at the same university (in the EU, we are non-EU/EEA citizens), but in different fields, however, we applied as they do not require a finished Master's program, but just a certain amount of ECTS. So we would have to start a PhD without finishing our Master's degrees, which is not a big deal as we would have PhD in the end.

Among 100 applicants, I got the position, but my girlfriend did not so now I am hesitant to go to this university. It is a great opportunity, with a lot of money, and the advisors are incredible. I find myself doubting my skills as in will I be able to finish the PhD, and if I cannot finish it, then I won't have a finished Master's so I would be taking a few steps back. Also, we don't know if my girlfriend will be able to get a position there because of the field she is in. This place is far away from central EU, so wherever she would go, we would not be able to be together, unless she comes to this university. The other thing is that even if we finish our PhDs, we may not be able to find positions in the same university anyway, so our plan was to go to this one together and remain there. We have been together since we were 15, so please don't say we should just break up because it is not an option. My girlfriend thinks I should take it because it is a very special opportunity and maybe next year I wouldn't find a topic as good as this one, with these great advisors and the funding.

My mother cannot support me and I don’t want to put her at risk for living at home which is another reason why I want to get let go in good graces. I have never been late to work, always work 40 hours, I’m also a civil engineer which I did not study and didn’t have an interest in and no one ever helps me when I ask for help so it makes me feel like just a money pusher. I want to get let go by the end of the summer and I just don’t know how to go about that. I already had a warning meeting about being faster and that I could get let go in 30 days which made me prompt to even think about leaving this state and job and move back home. Anyone else been through this? Any tips on getting let go instead of getting fired on misconduct?",07Jul2020,2
559,"I'm currently taking care of my friends' dog for a few weeks.. He has this weird thing of needing attention 100% of the time. 

I have a dog myself.. He is pretty independent and spends his time sleeping or wandering around sunbathing and such.. He likes to play fetch and sleep with us, but he has his own routine while I have mine.. It's a Yorkie.

My friends' dog on the other hand refuses to be ignored or left to mind his own business. If I'm doing anything else other than sitting on the sofa where he can sit close to me, he has to find someone to pet or hold him or give him any kind of attention. It's a Pug.

This morning I was busy organising a few things on shelfs, Yorkie sleeping on his bed, husband working and Pug couldn't stop asking for attention. Scratched mine and my husband's legs, cried for Yorkie sleeping, sat by his bed and kept staring at him sleeping. He stood there for ONE HOUR staring at Yorkie sleeping. He didn't sit or lay down: he STOOD there for ONE FULL HOUR staring at Yorkie.
I noticed that Yorkie was ignoring him, so I did the same.. But it is weird.. It seems he can't accept not being the centre of attention.. 

It's not a behaviour that affects our life, but it is certainly disturbing. 

Another thing is that he has to eat every single thing he finds on the floor. If I scold him for something, he goes to a teddy bear and uses it as a dummy and keeps on sucking (literally sucking) that for several minutes.. I feel he needs something on his mouth all the time..

Is it normal for a pug to behave like this? Should I try to stop it or do I tell the owners about it?",07Jul2020,1

563,"Hey. I like this guy he’s a kind guy and a good company but has been something that bugs me about him that I encounter a lot with some people too but never know how to deal with it. He’s so sure of himself and his points of views. He always talks in the 3rd person when talking about himself as if he’s generalizing his experience on the whole world. He’s always trying to “explain” stuff and simplify them in quite a condescending way and always assumes I don’t know about stuff, it always feels like being talked at instead of with. You might say I must try to express myself more but even if I do he won’t listen and doesn’t seem to entertain my point view and that’s apparent by how much he explains his idea in other words without looking at mine, he even goes further to say that I must not reject truth when I see it refereeing to his beliefs. These might be 2 separate issues, aka, being mr. condescending enlightenment guru and not really listening and discussing but they’re somewhat related. I’d really appreciate your advice on how to deal with this be it a partner or a friend. I can’t seem to articulate it because I once tried it to hint but he got defensive right away.

TL;DR! How I do generally deal with people who act in a condescending way and won’t listen to you and instill they're always right? P.s I really want it to work.",07Jul2020,1

Feels like a crossroads moment in my life. I need to decide if I’m dedicating myself more to this relationship. I don’t think this is relationship advice but more personal advice.

\---

I’ve dated my gf for almost 9 years now. She’s my high school sweetheart. I’m 25 She’s 24. We went to college together. We lived together since my senior year of college. We now live on our own. We were each other’s firsts.

She’s great in a lot of areas. We have a ton in common given that we grew up together. We've been through thick and thin. I’ve never had money she stuck with me. I only have two big resentments towards her, 1st: she had vaginismus and I stayed with her for the first 4 yrs even though she took very little initiative to solve her problem. (asides from token behavior) I eventually broke up with her out of frustration. A month later she was able to have sex when we hooked up, it happened. I've almost completely let go this within me. 2nd: last Xmas she had a huge crush on a coworker and said a ton of nasty shit to me about how I’m not attractive and no fun etc. I don’t think she cheated. She since then has come a lot around, being a lot more supportive, but I never trusted her a lot since that emotional affair. I should mention that I was planning to propose to her before this, I was starting to look up rings and by this time we would’ve been engaged, most likely. I was feeling like shit because my job fucking sucked, was feeling generally very off, very anxious/down for months before.

We always shared everything regarding money. Since last Xmas, I don’t feel okay sharing money with her. I don’t say I love you, haven't said it in like 7 months. I’ve begun improving myself. I never was too shabby but now I’m a lot better since that last incident, a great job that pays a ton, working out, better eye on style, improving my hobby life, basically I feel fucking great with myself. The best I’ve ever felt. Last year we had a pregnancy scare and while not wanting kids then I felt that I would be really happy seeing a person made from me and her. 2 months ago we had another really minor scare and it sunk on me ""I don’t want a kid with her"" at least for now. I want to be a father, however.

Sexually it's not what I want. The sex isn’t bad, it’s good. I feel shallow for feeling this in a way but I want to experience BDSM, ONSs, perhaps even ddlg, who knows, all kinds of shit, or even casual relationships aka serial monogamy. Sadly, she’s not into any of that “non-vanilla” stuff. I’ve tried mentioning, poked around the issue a few times. Like at all, she never masturbates for herself even if she’s alone for weeks. She’s just barely into sex. She knows what I want, but we don’t talk about it much. When I do talk about it the conservation is shut down as politely and quickly as possible. Mentioning sex casually is a very hard topic for her, she’s very uncomfortable. We never discuss sex. She enjoys it with me, cums every single time, as I do, when we get together. But she never wants to have “pillow talk”, you know what I mean? At most, I’d say I really liked X or Y and she’s like “thanks” and seems to change/drop the subject. It's always me initiating a conversation about sex, even about her likes/dislikes, I gotta pry it off of her. I’m a very sexual person, always have been, I feel like I can get sex elsewhere if I want to but never strayed from this relationship even though I felt frustrated for years. I want to fuck other girls bad and basically get freaky. I know it sounds shallow to trade a good LTR for hedonistic shit but I feel this every day. Her body is not my type at all, but I do find her very pretty. I do feel less attracted to her as time passes, and I am more attracted visually to basically every girl my age. She has nothing wrong with her, but I do feel these things, this lust for other stuff and can’t help but feel resentful in a weird way, at myself. Which isn’t even her fault, at all.

I am now at another crossroads moment in this relationship. Given the current logistics of living together/job, I need to choose firmly what I want. I do want kids someday, to live somewhere in a village as does she, we are somewhat similar in LTR/Marriage goals. I feel guilty as fuck for feeling all this shit inside me. In a way, I basically want to whore out and live for myself. But I also want true values in my LTR as well. I’m so conflicted. I feel bad if I leave her since I care a fuckton about her. I’ve grown into the role of protecting this person. She feels more like family than most of my family. Everything we’ve been through I’ve supported her and vice-versa. I don’t think I will ever find someone who's that close to me. I am a part of her family, we get along great, they consider me a part of the family in a way, her aunt even said that to me directly and they are all great. Should I mention this is not a Madonna-Whore complex? I thought it was for a while, but now I don’t. I don’t look at girls in that dichotomy, but of course, some only fall into one category but most fall into both.

But I don’t feel much passion for her, and she notices this. This last month things are going quite well, but the last three before this were total chaos. We had huge fights often and she threatened to leave. She even went back to her mom’s for a weekend. She kept attacking me, saying I’m X or Y and I kept brushing it off and not responding until I couldn’t take more and truly said that if attacked me once more I’d leave for good. She pretty much stopped after that. But, I feel she’s great though. I’m building trust again since that emotional affair of hers. But yeah, I don’t fully trust her completely, she currently doesn’t even know my finances now, whereas 6mo ago we’d share everything. I’ve never felt truly sexually complete with her, she kinda knows this and it hurts her. I can't keep going forward with this current LTR dynamic, something needs to change or just break up. Now she’s not perfect, she starts a ton of stupid fights and is very petty. But she’s also a very sweet and caring person overall and doesn’t wish bad upon no one and I’ll always care for her. I feel like if I broke up with her, I'd be filled with remorse forever.

Basically, I’m torn as hell.",07Jul2020,1
566,"Hello, this is a rather uh. Odd thing to ask? I'm not sure-- bare with me. 

I'm 19 (F) currently stuck in a really abusive marriage. 

He refused to allow me to get a job, and if I did even manage to get one-- id have no means of transportation. 


He has me solely relying on him. Which I hate. I'm a very independent woman. 

One thing I am happy with is the fact he doesn't go through or on my phone. We never were like that and I assume he feels his position isn't threatened considering he controls every other aspect of my life. 

Family is in no position to offer help

A friend told me he can secure me an apartment in his state as long as I can get down there and pay rent. I'd have to have at most 1,600 (pet fee, apartment rent, food, gas, the basics) 

My plan was to plan an escape as soon as I had the funds. 

Friend said he'd take the 7 hour drive to grab me and take me to the complex. 

But of course. I am not a woman who likes to resort to these things but hey, I think i'd enjoy doing it. I don't have cosplays yet but when I do i'd do photoshoots. I'd offer lewds and such but nothing naked. I just like the idea of interacting and being around people who like the shit I do. 

I'd save up the revenue and skedaddle. 

I just need an out. I'm desperate at this point.

I'm not sure what to do. Maybe i'm just. Being dumb. Idk.

568,"this is not a post i ever wanted to make but i’m so desperate and don’t know what to do. 

last night i found out my stepdad had been sexually assaulting my sister since he moved in when she was 11, and she’s 16 now. 

she told me about multiple occasions where he molested her over the years. she now no longer feels comfortable wearing anything other than sweatpants and long sleeves around him and other men. she’s afraid to be in the room alone with other men and is absolutely terrified of ever being in the house with him without my mom there. she has his schedule memorized so she’s never in the same room as him and even hides in the bathroom if he ever comes downstairs at night when she’s down there.

she doesn’t want to tell my mom because my mom is semi-recently divorced and very happy with my stepdad. she doesn’t want to ruin my mom’s life / house / happiness by taking away what she thinks is her only joy in life.

obviously, as her older sister, i want to kick this man’s teeth in and cut his brakes. but i can’t do that and she begged me not to tell my mom. i want to confront him about it and tell him if he ever even looks at my sister again i’ll tell my mom. but i’m worried he’ll hurt me or try to scare me into silence. i’m 5’2 and disabled, and he’s 6’2 and does mma and has had navy training. he could kill me if he knows i know. please help",07Jul2020,1
569,"Hello all, after a recent arm workout, my arms have been kinda locked up, I can’t fully straighten them at all. It was alright the first time, then I (probably stupidly) did the same workout the next day. 

Now I’m by no means a gym rat, or trained athlete or anything, I rarely work out. So this may well be just like terrible muscle soreness. 

I’ve read however about some conditions you could get from intense workouts if you’re not used to it. My arms are a bit swollen, and I can bend them fully up, but can only get about 100 degree angle when I try to straighten them. Any thoughts?",07Jul2020,1
570,"Hello Reddit I'll start of with a non triggering question and give some context for my question after a trigger warning.

So my question is how to be kind and loving and forgiving to yourself after something that makes you feel really guilty even though you know you weren't really at fault? How do you internalise the good self talk and get rid of the bad?
 Because I *understand * I shouldn't blame myself. I am sure I would emphasise and be understanding if someone else told me that had happened to them but I seem to be unable to believe myself. 
There is this strong disconnection between what I tell myself, what I would tell everyone else (that it was not my fault and that I should be emphasised with and blamed), and how I actually feel and act talk towards in my not spoken out words (my subconscious?)

TW: sexual assault / unwanted touching

.
.
For context: My boss would book hotel rooms with sometimes double beds for business trips. I wouldn't mind too much. It was a small business and the lines between being buddies and he being my boss were kind of blurred sometimes. Also i didn't want to be a burden because I believed money was tight 
After a long time me working for him I woke up several times with him hugging/ touching me during my sleep. Not necessarily in a sexual way, but in a way that felt very inappropriate and terrified me. I froze. I did nothing. I pretended it didn't  happen and there was never any touching during the day. I was very young and naive and I blame myself for ""letting it happen"".  I've never confronted him. I never told anyone because I feel like if I opened up to someone and they'd blame me the way I blame myself for it, it would break me. I also can't let go of these events. They feel like a shameful secret. I know I could have avoided it but so could most things have been avoided if they hadn't left their house, or hadn't spoken to that person, or hadnt visited that club. I suppose that's what you call victim blaming.",07Jul2020,1

572,"My long time best mate recommended that I come on here and see if anyone could give me insight into my situation. 
Basically said best mate and my mother the person I am closer too of my parents have recently told me that i have changed fundamentally, due to a bad relationship I was in for a little over 2 years. For context my ex partner was a diagnosed schizophrenic and I knew this from the day I met her, also for context I had been incredibly single for 4years prior to this relationship having no contact with women at all to the point where my parents were asking if I was gay (I'm not).
I'm not entirely sure where I'm going with this but the relationship was going well at the start she was medicated of course, and her schizophrenia was pretty much under control, we got along great, she was a fantastic person to be around, we moved in together after about a year and this is where it all goes down hill. She moved town to move in with me, i moved out of my parents house and we got a rental together. All very normal, until we found out that she couldn't get her medication where we were living, the doctors said they would send it via the post, this took 2 weeks and this is when I really start to experience the severity of her illness. It went okay for the first week with no medication small limited bouts of hearing voices and subtle visual hallucinations. We then managed to source her medication where we were but because of the time she had been off she had to be titrated up in dosage. This is pretty much where hell begins, i get home from work one afternoon and she just wasn't herself, accusing me of things I hadn't done and saying I was in cahoots with people i had never met, i tried to calm her to no avail she became increasingly frustrated and furious and would not take her medication, this built up to here laying on the couch screaming kicking the walls and swearing like the most seasoned sailor, at this point i was shaking and crying and begging her to calm down obviously to no avail, you might say ""why not call an ambulance?"" Well because i didn't want her to end up in the mental health unit and yes I probably should have just done it but if you had experienced the mental health unit she would have been sent to which I did later on, i think you would agree with my decision no one is getting better in that place. Anyway I digress, the kicking and screaming goes on continuously for about half an hour while I am kneeling on the ground next to her crying, when all of a sudden she sat bolt upright and looked me straight in the eye as she said ""it's not me"" in the most calm and usual voice, before instantly resuming her kicking and screaming for another half hour before i finally managed to get her to take her medication which put her to sleep.
There are many times like this in that relationship and if i were to go into detail about all of them I would be typing for days, so I'll write about a few of the worst ones and the experiences in between.
As the weeks went on her condition did not improve we were going to the doctors every week telling them it's not working, trying different medications and getting no improvements. She was put back on her original medication and the doctors seemed to think that it worked before it should work again now, this was far from the case. Her condition worsened every day, more frequent episodes as we called them, more intense episodes, until another afternoon after I had come home from work she was her usual self when I arrived, we sat down to watch TV together as we would. When she got up and left the room, not unusual, but when she returned a few minutes later it was to the best of my descriptive ability, like another person entirely had taken over her body this was the first episode like this and the last like this while I was with her, but she walked in with a facial expression I did not recognise, with body language I did not recognise and with a voice I did not recognise, as you can imagine this alone was incredibly disturbing. In the interest of keeping this as short as possible, she started attacking me with everything she could, it was like my worst enemy walked into the room in my girlfriends body and that enemy knew everything about me. This was incredibly hard to deal with, but it ended as it usual did with me working for hours through the deepest insults possible to get her to take her medication and go to bed, which she did.
Fast forward a few months still no improvement in her symptoms, still no help from the doctors, as you would expect her episodes became more frequent and somewhat more intense, until one night, i came home and she had taken all of her medication and this is roughly several grams of what I was told is the strongest antisychotic you can get, in an attempt to commit suicide. As you would expect i freaked out she was barely conscious i called an ambulance, she was taken to hospital, I'm not sure what they did but she survived and was discharged a couple of days later.
Fast forward a few more weeks and many more episodes and we arrive at the afternoon where I had come home from work, my mate had met me at my place we were sitting down watching TV and chatting, my girlfriend was there she seemed okay a little distant, but not exactly unusual. She left the room for about half an hour i didn't think anything of it i thought she may have gone to the bathroom. She returned looking a little off, pale and sickly, i asked if she was okay, so did my mate she told us she was fine. We continued chatting but i kept an eye on her and it became clear very quickly that something was wrong. I asked again if she was okay she said she felt sick, i asked her why she told me she had drank a small amount of hydrogen peroxide, i again freaked out but i knew if she went to hospital again they wouldn't discharge her so easily, i called my parents they lived up the road and came to see if they could help by this time I had found the peroxide bottle and realised she had drank the whole 300ml. I immediately called an ambulance they took her away, this pretty much broke me i was a mess.
Her mother went to the hospital i didn't go apparently she ended up in a pretty bad way, she got transferred to the city hospital overnight  and i went to see her the next day, still in a bad way, the doctors said she would have to be there for a week i had to work so I went home. I went back to see here a week later when she was going to be discharged, the doctors wanted her to go to the mental health unit or ward whatever, so we went in to see if she wanted to stay there and i can tell whomever is reading this that, this particular mental health unit also the only one I have been in was the worst place I have been in my nearly 25 years, i do not understand how anyone could get better in a place like that, i remember thinking to myself, if I was ever locked up in here I would go insane.
We convinced the doctors to let her go home rather than stay there so she did. Her parents left our place not long after we had made the drive back from the city and it was just me and here again, when all of a sudden she starts telling me she doesn't feel safe with me and she wanted to call an ambulance, I said look if you don't want to be here get in the car and I'll take you to the hospital. She proceeds to try and call an ambulance i told her to not be so selfish and get in the car because someone could actually be dieing and need that ambulance (I realise this was kinda harsh but I was about to loose my mind) I convinced her to get in the car, we head to the hospital which is half an hour drive from where we lived. On the drive she starts telling me how I should have done this and should have done that and now she doesn't feel safe and this is where I lost it i was absolutely screaming at her with every bit of pain I had screaming to the point i could feel my vocal cords slapping together, screaming with every muscle in my body, I don't remember exactly what I said but it wasn't good, she sat there with a straight face, no expression no reaction at all the whole time. I eventually couldn't keep screaming but I wouldn't let her say anything else to hurt me so when she tried to speak I just screamed at her with all my might, she eventually got the picture and we arrived at the hospital, i told her to get out, she did then she had the audacity to ask if i was coming in, i obviously said no, in many more words than that but you get the idea, i called her mother told her i couldn't be with said girl anymore, she said she understood. I sat in my car in the car park crying for half an hour solid because i couldn't drive i was crying so hard. I eventually drove home, she never came back, there is a little more to this story but I feel it's pretty long already and you could get a pretty good overall idea of the situation.
I'm not sure what I'm looking for here, I don't want sympathy, maybe some useful advice on how to move past this, i don't like the idea of going backwards so I don't want to go back to who I was before this relationship but I don't know how to go forward either and I feel like I'm not myself but I don't know who I am anymore.",07Jul2020,1

Warning: longwinded post ahead but I appreciate your time any advice. Thank you in advance. 


Fellow men, I was wondering if any of you have ever been in a similar situation to this.... in the last two years after college graduation I’ve really lost touch with one of my best friends, who I really cared for and spent a significant amount of time with. 

I didn’t go to a regular college, it was of a more military style which brought a lot of the students very close together. We almost became small families over the four years. 

I met in her in our freshman year as our friend groups were being established. During our schools “summer outing” is where our group really solidified and where we became very close.

Within the group I was the closest with her and we did a lot of things together. She would schedule her classes to match mine, she would make sure I was awake for class, we would have meals together, go out to stores, study for seemingly endless hours, talk all day... the list goes on but needless to say I truly cared about this girl and I always thought she cared about me... but we never did anything about it or even spoke about it. My feelings for her were so obvious and apparent but I didn’t care. I liked that people thought we had “a thing”. I would even hear people ask her if I was her bf and she would smile and say “oh no we’re just friends”. Words that would usually hurt made me feel good because of the look on her face when she said it. 

I would often talk to her girlfriends about it and they would tell me that if they brought it up to her she would shut the conversation down immediately, and not talk about it.. I was never really sure what to make of that. 

I’m my sophomore year I started dating someone outside of the school and we just clicked, now almost 5 years later we live together and I’m finding myself occasionally painfully missing my friend from school. I’ll try to reach out from time to time but she’s dreadfully awful about answering. It’s rare if a texting conversation goes longer than a 5 message exchange, and I can never call her bc my gf knows how close we were and was always jealous of our friendship. If she knew the thoughts that I had or that I had contact with her somewhat regularly it would be a huge issue.

I feel like this should be said also, over the years she also had a few boyfriends, but it never really bothered me. I knew how close we were and I also liked that most of the time that closeness bothered them... 

Recently she told me that she wanted to visit, and some of my other friends who live somewhat close to her have also invited me up. But my girlfriend would freak if I ever went. I just don’t know what to do. Sometimes my friend will pop up in my dreams (more frequently in the last month or so) and regardless of if the dream will be good or bad, I wake up painfully missing her. 

How can I free myself from this pain without disrupting my relationship? Is it possible to move on? Sometimes I feel like I’m grasping at something that really wasn’t there, as in, she never had feelings for me and that I’m wasting my time thinking about her so often.",07Jul2020,1

Hi, I could just be a complete idiot but I have thrown up because I'm so scared.

TLDR: I think my balls could have been fucked but I could just be shitting myself for no reason.

I tied a rubberband around my testicles for i reckon only 2 mins could have been 10 I dont know now it is a couple of hours later and I can't move them up and down when i clench, my balls are all 'droopy' but this could be just because I am extremely hot right now from fear I am boiling.

579,"I'm a 21F and I have a tough time trying to keep friends. I won't go into too much detail since that would take to long (unless you want to know). But, growing up I had very few genuine friends. In elementary school, I had a friend who was jealous of me, she would talk about me behind my back and even gaslighted my best friend about me and another one who would put me down constantly. I will never forget my best friend telling me I was the ""annoying girl"" in our class and started ignoring me one day because my friend who gaslighted her told her not to talk to me because I was ""a bad look"" and ""not good for her."" No joke when I say it followed me for years. I think it's why I'm so shy now. 

 Middle school, I had a falling out with a close friend every year because of bs or because they betrayed my trust or me as a person. The worst year was 7th grade. Before I moved, I was friends with a group of boys and I started dating one of them and one of the guys started bullying me relentlessly until I moved. Then that summer when I made friends at my new school, one of my friends let my other friend who I had a falling out with go off on me via text. I fell iut with the other friend because I had allegedly told a classmate about her crush. Despite that she was right next to me and was okay with me until later after lunch. 9th grade, two of my friends became closer with each other and ultimately pushed me out of the group (I believe it was unintentionally though because I don't have ill feelings about them) and another friend started ignoring me out of nowhere. The rest of high school was me having school friends except for maybe three. I'm still friends with them, but casually. 


I'm 21 now, and I'm scared to make new friends and get close to people because I'm afraid they're gonna either a) get sick of me eventually b) abandon me or c) tell people personal things about me like my old friends. I know it's silly, but it's a legit fear I have. My childhood friends broke my heart and I don't want to go through that again. But I so desperately want a best friend again. And honestly, its even affected me trying to date. I do want a boyfriend, but intimacy freaks me out. My mom always talks about me not having any friends or not dating and it hurts me because I want friends, but I'm afraid to make friends.It's just frustrating because I'm 22 in two months and I don't want to keep holding on to my childhood issues but it's like I can't help it.",07Jul2020,1

582,"Not sure what to buy/make for my dad as a gift. I want to get him something extra special and meaningful since he's turning 50. My budget is around 100USD. 

He's a biochem university professor, currently his only hobby is buying and selling stocks, and he thinks tech-y stuff is cool but only if it's practical too (like a wireless charger is cool but charges too slowly so he's not gonna like that). 

He's not into any sports whatsoever (playing or watching), he's not a fan of alcohol, and he's not into stuff like barbequeing, beard care, hunting, woodworking etc (or any sort of ""usual"" gift set for dads themed things). 

No clothes as we just did his once in a decade clothes haul. I've considered buying him a wallet but he needs his wallet to have multiple key holders, cash, coin, and card compartments, as well as space for a smart card. I have yet to find a wallet that meets all the requirements. 

I thought about buying him a telescope which he would definitely like and would be cool to build together and to use to see the stars and the moon which is sort of science-y and tech-y but the ones that look good are way out of my budget and the ones I've found within my budget on a website like aliexpress are just way too sketchy... 

My dad has expressed interest in gardening, but not potted plants on a windowsill. He wants to have a whole garden but living in an apartment makes that a bit difficult. He is also not a particularly sentimental or emotional guy so I feel like making him something would just get me a quick ""wow thank you"" then end up in the back of a closet.

583,"I've (23F) recently felt strong gut feelings to stop a friendship with someone (23F) but I have no idea how to go about it?

We've been friends for a couple of years but 75% of the time we spend together, I feel the urge to leave due to her behaviour. She is self obsessed, extremely over dramatic (constantly crying and causing large dramas over tiny issues with others), bosses me around, insults my other friends to me (which I believe is a tactic to try and get me to herself). My boyfriend and close friends are all in agreement that she is awful and I should end the friendship.


She recently called me fat to my face, which she has apologised for, but I can't seem to get over it. She also keeps telling me 'I'm queer' when I'm straight? She also has no other close friends except me, which makes it even harder to drift. I've been trying to slowly communicate less and make excuses not to meet up, but that's only making her more clingy. She calls and messages me multiple times a day. If I'm honest with her about how I feel, she will create a huge drama/argument which I'll never hear the end of.

I keep asking him to wash his hands because he’s touching all my surfaces or my face and it grosses and stresses me out. 

He did start doing it but now he’s back to not doing it again and I actually can’t take it because he’ll expect me to go down on him but I don’t want to because he has excess urine on him still. 

No matter how many times I ask he just thinks it’s funny but it’s making me uncomfortable and I can’t get him to see that it’s not hygienic.

Once in a while i work with this girl, and we often talk at lengths and have great conversations; in person she seems really interested in talking with me. When I chat with her though, the conversation quickly ends, and she responds with few, or one, word sentences. 

This could be because she prefers to talk face to face, or that she is just being polite, and talks, when we meet at work. We have never hung out outside of work before - we've actually only worked together 5 times - so would it be weird if I sent her a message asking her if she want to hang out someday?

589,"My sister (34F) supports me, my mother (mid 50s) and my two younger siblings (ages 8 and 15). we live with her significant other (early 40s) of about four or five years, in about three or four months it'll be five years we've been living here. we were evicted from the last two places we lived, the last one being a trailer park and the trailer had no heating in the winter and very shitty cooling in the summer. 

my father hasn't been in the picture since i was a toddler, and i'm thankful for that because he was very abusive to my mother and eldest sister (who i'm talking about) and there was an issue with sexual abuse to my other older sister (mid 20s) who is now Very Low Contact with my mother and myself. the two older sisters have a different father which neither of them talk to as far as i'm aware. up until early 2019, I had no contact with any extended family. aunts, uncles, grandparents, cousins. my mother had a falling out with them because, as she says, they didn't agree with her having more than three children or with her getting married for a third time, while my eldest sister thinks it was because of her drug abuse and relying on them to support her kids and pay her bills. my mom was an alcoholic for 15 years and as soon as she quit drinking she started abusing sleep, anxiety and pain medications. she got pregnant with my eldest sister at 16 and married a man who was almost 30. had my other sister, divorced him and got with my father. left him after a decade and got with her third husband. she didn't have a job, ever, until she left my father and she was almost 40 at that point. she left her job after about four or five years, in like 2014-2015. 

in 2013 we moved in with her new man. i knew his kids because we lived in the same neighborhood growing up, i was nine years old. almost immediately, the sexual abuse began. one of my older step-siblings, there were two. they both bullied me while our parents were dating, about three years before they moved in together. the younger one mostly, who was the one who abused me later on. my sister was in her early 20s at this point and the other sister had just ran away from home. i had friends in this neighborhood, i was familiar with everyone there. I didn't want to move in with him and his kids. neither did my sister. my mom and sister were constantly fighting, and my sister would always react physically. I wouldn't go as far as saying violent, but maybe some people would? usually throwing shit and banging her head on walls and punching things. when people who didn't grow up with my family hear this, they say that it sounds violent but it doesn't to me, maybe because i'm desensitized to it? my father was EXTREMELY abusive, to the point my mother jumped out of a moving vehicle because he was beating her and wound up in the hospital several times, he almost killed her on multiple occasions. 

keep in mind my mother was abusing pills, this made her extremely hostile, especially during the comedown. so while she was with my father, my sister says she woke up several times to my mother standing over her bed just watching her sleep and then as soon as she woke up, started screaming at her and accusing her of sleeping with my father. she was thirteen when this started and it continued almost a decade until my mother left him, and it came out when she was fifteen or sixteen that my father tried to sexually assault my other sister, about twelve or thirteen at the time. and my mother treated her like a victim instead of getting pissed and accusing her of purposely trying to fuck him like she did my other sister, and that pissed her off. so, my mom gets with her new guy and we all move in together, aside from the other sister because she ran away, and it happens again. i was there and remember it this time, because i didn't remember the first time when it was my father and can't trust either of them to tell me the truth on the matter because they both tell drastically different stories or my mom says she doesn't remember whatever my sister said happened, which i'm iffy on because while the cocktail of pills she was taking does cause mild memory loss, that just seems a bit too coincidental, yanno? but my mom finds a pair of underwear in her room, either under her bed or in her dirty laundry, i don't remember which, and accuses my sister of sleeping with him. kicks her out over it several times, says that the only way she's allowed back in the house is if she can find her more pills and it's a continuing theme of their arguments for the next few years. even after my sister comes out as LGBT+ and says shes dating a woman. my sister, while living with my mom and her new man, was living in the storage room attatched to the back of the house. there were problems with my mothers relationship, and we left. we were homeless for a while until we all moved into the spare bedroom in the trailer of two of my sisters co-workers. five people in one bed. before that it was in and out of motel rooms and falling asleep in the car waiting for a check to hit so we could get a bed in a gross motel room. homeless with a six month old baby. i think my mom was sober during this, but I can't confirm. after about six months we moved back in with her man because they decided to get back together. as i said, he had two kids. there was me, one younger sibling, one older sibling and my mother was pregnant when we moved in. there were three bedrooms, two kids to each bedroom, the parents and baby had the master bedroom and older sister slept in the attatched storage area which was smaller than the closet of the parents bedroom, and had no heat or AC. 

my sister decided to not move back in. she stayed living with the co-workers and my mother, my younger siblings and myself moved back into the house with her man and his kids. but this time, each of his kids each got a bedroom and it was me and the younger sibling sleeping in the closet-sized storage room in the same bed. there was room for one small dresser and a twin bed. and then a couple of months later, the baby started sleeping in my bed. I had to watch him during the mornings until we went to be babysat and he slept in my bed with me and our other sibling who was like seven during the night. 

The rules set for me and my brother were completely different from the rules that were set for step-siblings. our weekday bedtime was 8 PM and 10 PM on weekends whereas step siblings got to stay up as late as they wanted even on school nights. it didn't matter for me because i'm homeschooled (more on that in a sec) but i still had to sleep before the sun even went down at 10 years old. No caffeine after 5 PM for us, yet step siblings had whole litres of soda kept in their bedrooms that we weren't allowed to touch. there was ice cream and sweets and soda and lots of things in the kitchen that was free access to step siblings, yet I wasn't allowed to even look at any of it. I was living off of sandwiches, all three meals a day if I was lucky. i started stealing food from the woman who was babysitting us during the day, a woman who lived in the old neighborhood that i grew up around. I was friends with her son, and my older siblings had been friends with her brother since they were 13 and 10. my oldest sister ended up moving in with her and her brother for about a year or so. during the year my sister was living there, she was helping my mom pay bills as well as buying her pills and feeding herself and the woman who babysat's brother, who i'll be referring to as a family friend from this point on. the sexual abuse stopped about a month before my 11th birthday. a few months after that, which was december of 2014, the guy my mom was seeing moved out and my sister and the family friend moved in. 

I got a bigger bedroom that i still had to share with my brother, my sister got the other bedroom and the family friend stayed in the storage room. it only lasted a few months before he moved back out, and my mother was hospitilized in mid 2015. she had bronchitis and was convinced my sister was trying to poison her using a peach pit and kill her. my mother was rushed to the ER because she was crawling on the floor, unable to breathe. I was 11 at this point and was spamming my sisters phone, who'd left the house half an hour before to go to the store, and she would pick up, say she was on her way and then hang up. it took 45 minutes, I called her over 70 times because I was a kid and seeing my mother on the floor looking like she was dying and I was terrified. she was in the hospital for less than a week, and this added tension to her relationship with my sister because she'd just come out less than a month beforehand and they went days without talking around that and then my mom was convinced that my sister was trying to kill her. I don't remember whether this was before or after the hospital, but my sister broke my mother's foot and my mom lost her job shortly after that. she said her boss kicked her in the foot for not moving fast enough and screamed at her so she quit, but my sister thinks it was because she was showing up high every day, to the point she was nodding off and could barely keep her eyes open. 

we moved out the next month. we moved into the same trailer park that we lived in with my sister's co-workers and my sister went into her ""rebel"" phase, staying out drinking all night every night and really only ever coming by to change her clothes for work, drop off groceries or shower. she slept there occasionally, but it was very rare. this was probably one of the worst years of my life. 

we moved in and out of the trailer on the exact same day, a year apart. moving in, my mom and sister fought the entire time. the first day was rough because my mother refused to move in for one reason or another, and after all of our shit had been moved into it we just drove around until 3 AM until she finally just pulled up and let us go inside, but she stayed in the car until my sister went out and convinced her to come in. my sister put her bed up in the living room, my mom had her own room and I shared a bedroom with both younger siblings. the first morning there, the baby who was around two at that time, and he managed to get out of the front door while she fell asleep and he ran into the street. the neighbor came into the house and told her that he got out and she ran out and got him, but somebody called DHS or CPS or something like that, I don't remember which honestly. I got woke up with a DHS/CPS/whatever worker in my face and they took both me and my sibling out on the porch for questioning. they asked us if we felt safe with her, like if there was a fire, would I feel safe with my mom. they asked if she ever hit me and if we had enough food to eat and if my dad was in the picture, and I lied. I told them what I thought they wanted to hear to leave us alone because I honestly didn't want to be in foster care. as soon as I got back inside and as soon as they left, my phone was taken from me and I was being screamed at for letting the baby get outside even though SHE was the one watching him. 

over the course of the next year, I started cutting myself and restricting my food intake. the music I was listening to got darker and heavier and this is the time where I started to realize that I was depressed. I turned 12 halfway through the year, and I hadn't seen any of my friends since late 2014 and it was now 2016. this is the beginning of the isolation, or when I started to realize it I guess. I was ""home-schooled"" too, so I wasn't around ANY kids my own age. i stopped learning in like the third or fourth grade because my sister was working and couldn't teach me and my mom was too high to do it, she didn't understand any of the work and would slur her words to the point I couldn't understand what she was saying. i'm pretty sure I have a learning disability.

around the elections of 2016, sad to say, she got into YouTube conspiracies and shit and they started seriously affecting her mental health. she was convinced that Hillary was eating aborted fetus corpses and that they were putting them into our vaccines, which prompted her to refuse to allow me the last two vaccines I needed which is complicating things for me further now. she refused to let me study science because she thought it was all bullshit. She claims to want to get me a dentist appointment, but I've literally never been to a dentist in my life and my teeth are extremely fucked up now, from bad genes and an eating disorder. every time I bring it up she either acts like its a burden or is dismissive and says we'll talk about it later or shuts me down. I was never given proper education on sex or menstruation and alternative menstrual products to sanitary pads (tampons, DivaCup, ect) aren't allowed. 

so, after being evicted from the trailer, this is where we're at now. my sister and her S/O are toxic together imo because they encourage each other to drink constantly and they fight almost always when they're both drunk. they drink probably 5-7 days a week and when one wants to quit, the other doesn't so they buy alcohol and both drink and keep drinking. they fight and throw shit and it almost always gets physical, and when she's pissed at her S/O she can flip and be pissed at anybody else for no reason within half a second. my mom is sober, but she doesn't have a job. she had a mental episode last year where she went weeks not sleeping and being anxious and paranoid and accused me of having contact with my father (which,, no. just no) and acted batshit crazy. my sister thinks she was just being manipulative. she was pacing back and forth for days on end to the point where a week and a half after she stopped, she was still sore. she kept me awake for weeks. i got no more than three hours of sleep per night for weeks on end, I couldn't shower because I couldn't leave her alone that long or she would freak out. she always wanted to leave the house, like she wanted to drive around and sit in parking lots and not be at the house. she was also convinced that my sister, her S/O and her S/O's mother was into Voodoo and shit. 

i just turned 17, and I have no social life. I have no friends in person because I'm not allowed to interact with anybody outside. I can't even go out in the yard by myself. I talk to people and have friendships online, but I can't call them or video chat, we're stuck with DMs for now. I've given up trying to get my sister to stop drinking, I just try and defuse the situation as best I can. my mom gets anxious and wants to get in her car and leave everytime they fight, but she has no job, nowhere to go, only source of income is a child support check every two weeks and she doesn't seem to understand that it's a bad idea to do things that way. she says ""im so ready to leave here"" every single day, but doesn't want to work towards making that a possibility. we'll leave, sleep in the car for a few nights and end up back with my sister with no money left because we spent it all on Gas to drive around aimlessly because we have nowhere else to go. 

I want to join Job Corps, but I need my Immunization records and i'm pretty sure I'll need all of my vaccines to go, and she won't let me get them. I need a copy of my birth certificate and a photo ID, neither of which I have and she says she'll help me get them but it always gets pushed off and forgot about. 

I think my mom has BPD, and I think I do too, just not as severe as she does. I'm probably going to go into debt with dentist/medical bills and shit now. I just don't know if I can make it another year like this. how do I survive this situation and improve my quality of life when I get out?",07Jul2020,1

595,"hello reddit, (throwaway acc)
my (19f) best friend (19f) and i were talking about family situations earlier tonight - i mentioned a situation that happened last year at a party where i was drunk, i saw her take a hit off our friends vape, and drunk me became very agitated; for reference, my dad is a huge chain smoker, and also been a below average parent for 50-60% of my life, and how i accepted the fact he would most likely die from smoking at around 11 years old (divorced parents, custody with mum but they maintain a good relationship), i brought this up when we were discussing my father, and i explained i got sensitive because of this, but i apologised. 

she said that she gets it, but i need to let her live her life and she’s her own person that can make her own decisions even if i don’t agree. i apologised, because i knew it was hypocritical and rude of me to say it, especially since she has issues with drinking like i do smoking (even though she claimed she didn’t care, and this smoking situation has just come to light).

the only situations i can think of this occurring is when she would sneak out of the house in the morning (after midnight), during covid to see a boy who was a friend of a friend, whom she’d never met in person before. she lied to her parents, involved my mum in the lie when i knew the truth (inadvertently lied to my mum), and genuinely created an unsafe situation. my personal feelings also made it difficult for me to rationalise. i realised some of the things i said may have been out of line, so i apologised and rationally discussed it the next day with her, and we moved on. these are the only situations i’m aware of that i’ve been out of line.

my best friend and i are joined at the hip, like we see each other every single day, play in the same teams and work together. we’re inseparable. i, am also unfortunately bisexual, and came to the realisation that i was in love with her last year or so. this has been incredibly trying on my mental health.

i don’t know what to do anymore, and i’m at my wits end. i have her best interests at heart, and i understand i’ve made mistakes, which i’ve tried to correct. but i think my feelings are getting in the way. telling her would throw my whole life away, as i’m also closeted. i am a pretty easy person to read, so i’ve worked on breaking down a situation first and then reacting to it, using empathy to try and take into account other’s feelings and their own values to make decisions. i’d say my feelings are probably my biggest downfall.

any advice would be appreciated.",07Jul2020,1

597,"I (f16) live at home with my mom, sister (37), and brother in law (40). Recently we decided to move to a bigger house, and honestly the stress got to me, especially  when my mom decided she would tell my school (that I tested into so I could graduate two years early) that I was moving 45 minutes away,even though we could just use our old address. I was very upset because I only have 2 months of school left and kinda flipped out saying that if I didn’t go to that school I wouldn’t go. (I have major anxiety and depression and when I go to public schools with a lot of kids my depression gets really bad) I decided to even say that I wouldn’t drop out and would just do online school instead. I text my sister who was in the other room what happened to rant. What she decided to do was come in and yell at me that I was ungrateful and that she was moving for us and to better our lives (although she did say she would do everything to keep me at my school and we could use our old houses address for the time being). She proceeded to talk over me every time I talked which really frustrated me. I got to the point where I said “I’ve told you 5 f-Ing times I would do online school if I couldn’t go to mine.” This set her into a rage where she got into my face and hit me with her finger while she yelled at me. I told her I didn’t wanna be in the house and I tried to leave to go to my friends house. I was very upset because yelling is a trigger for me and it is especially a trigger when someone gets in my face and does it. I honestly thought she was going to hit me hit me. No one would let me leave the house even though the only place I felt safe was at my friends. After a lot of screaming and crying I settled down and broke down. I ended up texting my friend what happened.
This morning when I got in the shower I left my phone on the table. My sister decided it was ok to go through my phone and read all my messages with my friend. When I came out of the shower she and my mom were mad. She said she never hit me (which I said in the text) but she literally got in my face and hit me with her finger (making me feel like she would hit me harder).  She decided that I was the problem and my mom even said “this is why no one ever believes her when she says things”. That statement is a big issue for me because I have an investigation going on towards someone for something really bad and half of my family doesn’t believe me because the perpetrator is very manipulative and says I’m lying. (I would never lie about something so serious now or then.)I feel heartbroken like no one believes me with anything and it honestly really hurts. I feel as though my privacy is violated because I really did spill all my feelings in my text messages. I don’t know what to do, I feel trapped. So tell me reddit am I in the wrong for telling my friend about the situation and making my family mad?",07Jul2020,1
598,"To make a long story short in late January I turned 19 years old. I took a break from the school I was attending to pursue joining the military national guard. My already enlisted sister said this would be a good idea, and I’d also get free tuition after and wouldn’t be reliant on FASFA, so I thought why not. Now this was a huge mistake, I got right up until MEPS, scored an 81 on the ASVAB, just to be faced with the same issues my sister had that set her back 2 years. Instead of waiting I just decided that the military is not for me. So not only did this endeavor set me back a few months, but I also lost time that could’ve been spent working, and also finishing another semester. Now that the back story is out, here’s where I need some advice. 
In my opinion I now only have two options regarding moving towards the future..

Option one being to go back to school in the fall, finish getting my degree, and do work study during to help pay off any loans if I’d need them rather than just sitting in unwanted debt. 

Or option two to just work, join the police academy, then when I turn 21 and a few months, join my city’s department and ultimately finish school later in the future.

I’m honestly leaning more towards the later since being a police officer was always my dream and I feel that now more than ever would be the best time to just go for it, but then the thought of getting my bachelors and finishing my education rather than doing so in the future is so prominent. I’ve never felt so stuck in my thoughts like this. Any advice will be strongly appreciated.",07Jul2020,1
599,"My SO and I watched his mom’s house a month ago. 
Half way into the week, we notice one of her cats is very sick.We have ZERO idea to this day what he ingested.The vet had to put him down. He was such a sweetheart. 

We ransacked his parents house looking for toxic things. Didn’t find anything. His parents returned from vacation and their other cat became ill! This cat also ate something which the vet couldn’t identify, and is still very ill.

SO’s parents just asked us to watch their house AGAIN for a week in August even though the toxic thing was never discovered.

 I’m really uncomfortable about this. I no longer feel that I can protect the rest of their animals. I am being put in a situation that feels beyond my control.
Will the cat find the toxic thing again? Will the dogs get to it? 

Why should I do?

603,"I live in a town out west and share a space with my aunt. The housing costs in the area has skyrocketed over the years and homes have become so expensive and scarce its outrageous. Then all the jobs seem to pay between $12-$14/hr. There are not middle class jobs. Only highly educated jobs and low wage jobs. Everything costs like double. Food, clothing, dental care, healthcare, activities. It’s unaffordable. There are no other people my age living here anymore. Town used to be bustling with young people now it’s not.

So a situation came up where our landlord decided he wants to sell the house without any notice and sent over an appraiser and buyer within 12 hours of calling and giving us a heads up. We cannot find another house in the area with reasonable accommodations. The one we are staying in now costs $1800 rent + utilities and the cheapest house we found to rent in the area is $3000 plus utilities and some weird guy already lives upstairs. With my income I cannot afford this if we split the costs.

609,"Due to some moving around we had been doing at our house, I had been using my husbands computer for a little while to look up furniture for a basement we are remodeling since I hadn’t set up my computer yet. I had been using it for a couple of days and when I looked up history results to look up the websites I had been on to double check on some furniture, I came across a lot of Facebook photo links of girls my husband use to like on his history, with porn sites that are just a couple minutes apart from that. 

Not really sure what to do or how to feel exactly. I don’t ever check his history and try to respect and trust him with what little privacy we have. I knew he looked at porn and that never really bothered me. I mean, hell, I look at porn and we both joke about it regularly and have even tried to watch it together. This situation, however, feels a little....different, to me. 

I told him immediately what I found and he apologized as soon as he got my texts and told me he felt really guilty and deleted his Facebook and said he only ever loved me and wanted me. That he was just remembering old crushes he had and thought he could get off to them but couldn’t and looked up porn right after.

I wasn’t sure how to respond to that. I just felt insecure, heartbroken and like he could be lying. Maybe I’m just overreacting though.

We’ve been together for ten years altogether and married for four. One of those women he looked up was a girl he had been best friends with and had caused us a lot of grief at the beginning of our relationship. He had liked her before we dated but she rejected him until me and him got together and then she was suddenly interested. It was a lot of drama back then, and some of it had lasting effects on my insecurity issues, but we eventually settled it and moved on with our lives with him choosing to be with me instead of her. 

Is it normal for guys to do this? Am I overreacting in how I’m feeling? We’ve kinda talked it out but I still feel like I can’t 100% trust him. Idk how to feel I guess and just want to know if anyone else would feel the same and what to do or where to go from here.",07Jul2020,1

611,"Hi, throwaway account here because my parents follow my other Reddit account.

My parents are helicopter parents. Very intense, overbearing helicopter parents, who want to be involved in every single thing I do. They watch me make food, try to follow every one of my social media accounts, don't let me even go on walks alone, coddle me excessively, etc.

I know that their intensity comes from a place of love, but it's making me uncomfortable, especially as I get older. I recently turned sixteen, and I don't have any of the same freedoms as my friends. I want to be trusted to feed myself, and to make at least some decisions on my own. 

I don't know how to ask, and I have to be extra careful because my parents seem to think that every attempt of mine to look after myself is a trait of some mental illness. I try and feed myself? I must have an eating disorder. I distance myself a little? I'm depressed.

616,"A little context to this story.. I work as a designer and I hired this woman a year ago. She only lasted a few months. She made many mistakes and eventually just didn't show up. She seemed to be very forgetful and a little disoriented at times. During her short time here I was very nice to her and I was encouraging her to do better. I even gave her an iphone because her story touched me. She is in her early 60's, a stunning woman for her age. She told me she lives on her own and she can barely afford rent in the basement she's living in. I took pity on her and I did my best to help but there wasn't much I could do when she didn't show up for work. 

  

Fast forward 8-9 months later she calls me randomly one night after I got done packing all my stuff to move to storage. My son is staying with his father for the summer while I move and find a house I want to buy, In the meantime I planned on staying with my friend for a week then an AirBnB for the rest of the summer UNTIL (let's call her S) S called me the night before my move. She told me she is struggling with bills and asked if she could come back to work. I told her unfortunately we have a new receptionist and she's an amazing girl who does a fantastic job. She then went to ask how I am doing. I told her my situation and she proposed that I come stay with her for the summer. Sounded great to me! I told S that I would swing by in the morning, have a cup of coffee with her, and check out the spare room. 

  

Next morning I show up to her house and everything is in boxes. She was literally about to move out. We had coffee and chatted for a bit and everything seemed fine. The room was furnished and the dresser/closet was empty. Perfect. I'll stay with S for the summer and save money while I find my house. After unloading everything in storage I go back to S's house and give her money for the first month. S proposes that we go grab a bottle of vodka to celebrate. Personally I'm not a drinker but I thought why not... big mistake... We go buy a bottle of vodka and when we get back to the house she immediately stashes the bottle away in her bedroom. I didn't even get a drink. Didn't take long for S to get COMPLETELY wasted. She was begging me to cuddle her while she was in tears crying. She was expressing how bad her life is and how much she wants to die. At this point I'm absolutely taken back. I had NO idea this was going to happen. I tried my best to comfort her, I even made vegan tacos to help sober her up(she's vegan). She took a bite and spat it out ( PS they were delicious, she's buggin' ) and threw it across the room. I didn't know how to react so I just cleaned it up for her.     
 Fast forward to the next day I go into the office early and take a long motorcycle ride and get home around 7pm. I start walking upstairs to my guest room and S comes out of her room COMPLETELY NAKED. WHOA! S! What are you doing??? Are you okay??? She says whatttt I gotta pee!! She was out of her mind at that point. I just hid in my room after experiencing that. There was a repeat event the next day. I got home from work and she was laying naked on her bed with the door open screaming ""I DONT WANT TO DIEEEEEEEE!!!"". I'm really kicking myself in the ass at this point. I've just entered a whole world of crazy and I had no idea.   
    
I will spare all the details because this could be a long winded topic but I stayed with S for a month. A lot shorter than planned but you understand right? Now during this month she would be in her bed for days on end. She didn't eat literally anything for weeks at a time. I even tried bringing her food at some points but she wouldn't take it or be too out of her mind to eat. At times she would see me and go OHHHH I remember you! It felt horrible to see her so lost. Now during this time there was this older man ( We can call him D ) who would visit her 4-5 times a week. He is WEIRD. Total weirdo who is apparently married but still comes to see S quite often. He is the one who actually pays all her bills and brings her groceries. I gave him my number because he was my only point of contact for S and I was worried something may happen and I needed someone who could help. D called me CONSTANTLY. It got to the point where I would get very irritated and ignore his calls. I literally have a voicemail from D where he meows like a cat for 17 seconds. I shit you not. I showed my friends and they said they wouldn't have believed me if I didn't have the proof. I entered the circus and had no idea. So many more stories but I want to get to the point here...  
    
I'm worried about S. She has no family or friends to take care of her. Only D. And D puts in a lot of effort for S but for what? S told me that she isnt interested and they are only friends but when she gets drunk she would tell me they tried having sex but he couldn't get it up. Her feelings towards D were very off and on. It seems like she relies on D to live. S is seriously mentally ill and needs real help. I feel like D is taking advantage of S and her illness and now she relies on him. I don't know what he does to her or what has happened between them but something seems really off. S is not a bad person. She's just sick. Very sick. I wanted to know if anyone had advice on what I could do to help her. I've been gone from S's home for a month now but it still lays heavy on my mind. Can I report an anonymous tip? Are there programs that can help us? I know it was a lot to take in but thank you guys so much for listening to my whirlwind of a summer stories.

617,"This incident happened about a year ago.

Our company hired a new employee (let's call him Mr. A), who I personally knew from a long time ago. In my opinion, I always saw him as quite weird, and I felt something was off about him. We were ""Facebook friends"" from before, but I never wanted to work with him.

Then one day, Mr. A started working as one of our company's clients, and a few of my co-workers became acquainted with him. He didn't do an amazing job, but enough to get noticed at our company.

After a few months of him working as our client, he ends up looking for a job for some reason, and he decides to apply to our company for a job interview. Our company is small (around 7 ppl), and my boss knew that I was acquainted with Mr. A.

During the interview process, my boss asked me my opinion of Mr. A. I told my boss that Mr. A had something off about him, and I personally felt there were a few red flags about the way he interacts with people. My boss waved off my concerns as insignificant, and he ended up hiring Mr. A.

Mr. A joined our company, and he started a rank below me. Despite my initial dissatisfaction with his hire, I decided to give him a chance, since I thought I shouldn't judge someone before I get to know them well.

In the 2nd month of working at our company, Mr. A went on a vacation to go overseas and attend his friend's wedding. I had no issues with him taking a vacation (it isn't any of my business). Mr. A then brought back some souvenirs from his trip, and shared them with the company.

Upon seeing the souvenirs, I commented to Mr. A ""These are some nice souvenirs you brought."", upon which Mr. A made the joke: ""Next time I'll bring some poisoned souvenirs for you.""

The joke (?) was so out of nowhere, I didn't really comprehend it, and just continued doing my work. However, a few days later, Mr. A, a few co-workers and I went out to lunch, and Mr. A made the same joke again, to me, out of nowhere. It was in the middle of a conversation that had nothing to do with souvenirs or his friend's wedding.

I confronted Mr. A immediately, and told him that his comment is inappropriate. Mr. A's first reaction was not to apologize, but just clam up without any explanation or comment.

I felt his lack of apology and reaction was very strange, and escalated the complaint to our company's management. However, the management didn't take the issue seriously, and Mr. A was just let off with him being forced to make an apology to me.

What I found weird was that Mr. A called me to make the apology, mentioned over the phone that he was ""broken up about it"", and then after the call, he blocked me on Facebook.

Despite him having apologized, and it being over a year since this incident happened, I still feel that he isn't trustworthy, and feel extremely unhappy that no real action was taken against Mr. A.

I'm wondering: Am I taking this situation too seriously? Was this just a joke that would be accepted in any other company, or should I be looking to get the hell out of this company?

TLDR: my co-worker joked about poisoning me 2x, didn't apologize until he was forced to by management, then blocked me on Facebook.",07Jul2020,1

619,"I met her back in high school. At first, she was really kind and humble. We literally did everything ever since we had a lot of classes together in 11th grade. Then one day she changed. She keeps bragging about everything, even things that are not supposed to be bragged about! For instance, we just finished our swimming class, I brought an expensive lotion that I usually use then she suddenly snatched it, used it, and said “we have like a dozen of this” in front of our class mates. Another example, our squad was just hanging out then I told them about my sister who caught Amoebiasis. All of them asked if she’s doing well expect ‘her’ (obviously). Again, she bragged something about her boyfriend getting Amoebiasis, so the whole squad focused on her story instead. There were a lot of situations like this and i’ve noticed that she only do this if it involves me.

I think I finally caught her. One time, she accidentally asked “why are you getting everything you want” with a serious face then she instantly excused herself to the toilet room and kept quiet the whole day.

Then I hit high school. Almost straight away. Marks dropped to 50 to 60 s. I like telling myself I don't know why, but honestly, I do. I do no study. The whole of primary school I didn't and I thought I didn't need to here either. I was wrong. Parents were angry and I needed to do better, per my request they left for a little to sort it out myself. I couldn't. Now the marks are really bad. I just cannot make myself study.

621,"My friends and I are in a group with each other. 6 of us including myself and over the years it's been great, but lately it's gotten me thinking that I don't want to be friends with some of them. For obvious reason I'll change their names.

Patrick(27) is been great, but the past few months or year he's been very neutral, always siding with his girlfriend, never having any backbone, doesn't back me up now, and seems too busy unless you call him a few times plus he's average. By that I mean he went to college not for the passion, but to find something easy and finish it. Now has a job, earning decent, and isn't moving anywhere.

Alex: F(24) Is always letting her past define herself, never getting the help she needs, instead of talking things out she will put you on blast in front everyone, average job and life, holds a grudge and ruins relationships

Amy F(25): I use to have a crush on her, but stopped when she was just playing me. We all knew she was telling a guy to cheat on his GF with her and when I told her it's wrong, she acts like it's not her fault. Because of her parents being rich she has everything paid for, doesn't wanna work hard, but talk, and you can't make fun of her, but she can make fun of you. Last, she is MIA when anyone in our group needs help with anything, but when she needs help we all HAVE to be there

Two of the other friends I think are amazing and they want me to grow, be better, not seek our average, seek out my passion. For example my friend Peter and his GF Mindy both told me that I need to layout a plan. Instead of having just a degree from college, have other things on my plate to help me stand up, build things (coding, apps...etc), learn coding, invest in properties and stocks...etc. Patrick, Alex and Amy aren't bad friends or people, but they aren't the same friends I met years ago and it sucks. I don't mind hanging out with them, but I wanna slowly move them away to the back. They say you're the average of the 5 people you hang out the most.

However, she already has one kid to N who is with a foster family after they abused the poor kid all because he has Autism and they didn't want, and I quote 'a fucking retarded retard who is so retard that not even his own parents love him' now my partner and I had planned on adopting him as our own but had to make the heartbreaking decision to let him go because so long as his parents know where he is he doesn't have a hope in hell at a normal happy, loving family. 

So, of course, knowing this at first I thought I should alert the midwives at the hospital to this and then request to be kept away from her at all times if we end up in the hospital at the same time mostly because when I had my daughter her boy was 1 and her first call to us was to ask if we could swap babies because she wanted a girl, then she convinced N that my daughter was his and he tried to take me for custody. Jokes on him, J is the only guy I've slept with, so I know who her father is without a doubt. Then my MIL spills the beans on her pregnancy. 

Ex has the same due date as me.
Ex didn't know she was pregnant until recently even though she would be 26 + 3 weeks (6 months) along like me.
I have EDS (Ehlers Danlos Syndrome), MCAD (Mass Cell Activation Disorder) and Hip Dysplasia. Ex told my MIL that she has identical conditions and shes stuck at the hospital because she went into early labour. And has been for 2 weeks.

Now I find this all mildly amusing as:
For her to have the exact conditions I do is a 1 in 2,000,000 chance as MCAD and HD are side effects of EDS for me and its extremely rare to have EDS and even more rare to have the same side effects as someone else with EDS.
I saw her a week ago while buying a cot and change table and she didn't look tired, no belly, no outward signs unlike myself of have any of the above conditions (for reference I constantly look like I've been sucking on lemons due to pain). 2 days ago she announced she's pregnant. 
I haven't seen her in the high risk clinic (only 1 day a week in a 2 hour period seen the same 4 ladies there everytime) even though she's claiming she goes. 

So I believe she is playing my MIL for a fool. My MIL knows this isn't N's kid but still wants the kid to call my MIL YaYa like her other grandkids. I'm just debating on whether or not I tell the midwives and request to be kept away from her or just wait and see how things turn out. 

TL;DR: Brother-in-laws ex seems like shes faking her pregnancy by mimicking my pregnancy down to health issues and due date. Not sure if I should tell the midwives about her or not to keep her away from me.",07Jul2020,1
629,"Hey everyone, 

I need help, been stuck for a while now. 

I honestly dont know where to start. I think I am bisexual or gay even. Recently, I downloaded this dating app and met this gay man who’s really caring, loving and genuine person. We’ve been seeing each other for weeks now and yes we slept together - twice already. I think he’s such a great, sweet guy that’s willing to be with me, but there are things I havent told him; one of them is, I’m currently active in a church that I have been around for years and dont know how to tell him that, I dont know even know what I’m gonna do with that or how to tell the church, for sure I wont be allowed to stay in the church if they knew, second he knows that I just got from a break up early this year what he doesnt know is it’s a girl from the church. My friends and family doesnt know that I’m also seeing this guy. I’m so screwed. 

I love this guy, I’m starting to fall inlove with him and he says he loves me too. i dont know what to do, I wanna be with him, I love him, but also I dont want to be removed in the church or even more judge by them, also by my family. what are they gonna think about me. Please help",07Jul2020,1

632,"Over the weekend my girlfriend and I went to a friend's for the July 4th weekend for friend A's birthday and so our group can finally have time to meet and hang with my girlfriend.

On one of the days we were out all day, been drinking and definitely deydrated and along with majority of us drunk. After getting back to the house everyone was wanting to start drinking again and I asked my gf to just drink one bottle of water before we start again, and I did prevent her from just grabbing a beer. Friend B, said just let her drink and friend A gave me a snarky look. I get that were all friends and we can take care of each other but I've drank with my girlfriend and I know her limits well enough that i can tell she wasn't good. I don't think asking her to drink a water and preventing her from drink was controlling but just looking out for her because she's my person. It takes a minute to drink so water. I just didn't want to have to deal with a sick person or sleep with her throwing up through the night. We still drank heavy but at the end of the night she was still sloshed which brings us to the next item.

On this night she asked me to shower with her because she knew she couldn't stand up or make it through the shower without me in there holding her. The night before I said hey, I'm going to shower and she more or less came along and joined me. This is regular and I've told her before if she needs space tell me and we can have space for showers. I find showers to be romantic and an intimate time. Now because of us showering together the two nights everyone is calling me needy and I think it's also along with my flirty nature of if I just walk by my girlfriend I'll just hug, grab butt, or squeeze her randomly. I feel like I do give her space to do her own thing because I'll just walk off immediately because it's a passby. 

After leaving and coming home everything was fine but then girlfriend was texting Friend A yesterday and I could tell it was one of those textings because she was hiding screens and all that but I got over it until she wanted to talk and kinda just have been pissed all night.  

How do I go about calling this out without coming across as an ass when to me I don't feel like I'm being ""needy"" or ""controlling""? I feel like I'm being judged/attacked by them because I was looking out for her primarily in regards to ""controlling""  because she's a pia when drunk and I didn't want her to over do it because she does and gets embarrassed when she throws up and I didn't want her to be shy around my friends. For ""needy"" I don't know what to do because I never felt like I had to have her all over me or with me all the time like they were saying.",07Jul2020,1
633,I have someone in my life that I feel so attached to yet I know I’m being emotionally used and abused which I cannot tear apart. They have never even once considered to give me respect or show any sign of affection yet I keep forgetting this like an idiot and forget after a day and run back. They have once again hurt me and I again have the feeling to cut them out and forget about them. Is there a way I can make sure to keep hating that person rather than keep running back? How can I train myself to let go and forget about them and when I see them just treat them coldly? I am a person that gets easily attached and this is one of its biggest downsides to the point where I cannot even realize the harm they’ve done and realize all they did was make me sad and never once have been nice or treated me with respect. I would really like to know how to act cold to a person I have never done something like this as I’m normally a bubbly happy person who can’t hide their feelings like a fucking idiot. I want to act so different and cold to the point people will notice and realize I do not care for them anymore. And I hope I can make it permanent. Not doing this to revenge (because that means I would care about them) but to heal myself emotionally and be true to myself and cut out toxic people who have never even considered showing a sliver of respect to me. I know it’s quite vague but this is much I feel comfortable saying. Thank you all.,07Jul2020,1

I asked the lady who makes schedules if she had my schedule yet and she said to call later after my shift. When i called she acted like she had never heard of me in my entire life and just told me to come in at tuesday at 2 30. This is so incredibly vague and has set me over the fucking edge.

635,"Me and my bestie are planning a spur of the moment five day road trip for this weekend. Neither of us have ever spent that much time together and i’m excited! We will have fun. I’m just really scared. I love her but she has... lack of basic judgment. She’s a really bad driver and every time i’m in the car with her she almost fucking hits someone every time. And we will be driving... a LOT. In my car. So i will not be driving the whole way, i decided when we first brought up the idea that even tho i’m the main driver almost every time we hang out, i won’t be driving the whole way. It’s equal driving or nothing (i will probably end up doing 3/4 of the driving at least) . 
Anyways...
I’m scared for our safety. When it’s her turns to drive is when i will probably be taking my sleep breaks and relaxing. I won’t be up in the front seat screaming at her to break, or don’t lane change now!!! there’s a fucking car in your blind spot. I will bring it up with her today about the safety of driving. She failed her drivers test two times btw and barely skimmed by the last time. She’s an adult and i’m worried she will get offended or sad when i tell her i don’t feel 100% safe in the car when she’s driving so she needs to watch drivers training videos before we go. Is this an okay thing to ask..? like. I feel like i’m embarrassing her by asking her to retake some online classes but i don’t know what else to do to relieve my anxiety. It’s MY car that we are taking and GOD am i screwed if anything happens to it. 
Is there anything else i can say or do?? to help her. Like a certain talk i can give her that lets her know she needs to genuinely fix her driving. 
What also freaks me out is shes not an inattentive driver, she has her eyes glued to the road and both hand on the wheel yet still seems to get in near accidents everyday.
So this is the other half of it, once i express concern for her driving she will feel super guilty and her anxiety will go through the roof, if u couldn’t tell she is an anxiety ridden driver as it is, because most drivers who have had their license as long as both of us have, don’t need their two hand glued to the wheel at all time or we can look down at our phone once in a while to switch playlists. 
I want us to treat each other like equals the whole way and me criticizing her every driving decision is bound to create tension and bursts of annoyance.",07Jul2020,1

638," My non-step non-biological brother is getting the African treatment for his actions. We are an African family so I went through the same though not for the same reason.anyway I’ll get to the point.

problem: is if you don’t agree with him then he will try get someone else against you till he finds the right answer he wants. He also has very little awareness and he lies a lot over the stupidest of things. So sometimes it gets really frustrating and since that’s how my parents were raised that’s how they treat him. Remember we are African. And his mother just believed him whenever he told her anything so he hasn’t really been disciplined till he came here. When he first came here he was a nightmare. Because he expected his mother to defend like she did before. But when he was here he realised that changed. Then he went to my friends house and was telling them stuff like ‘we were beating him for no reason. We were abusers’ which I supposed is technically right but he never talks about the reason he only says those things. He also randomly comes in and out. And his habit of just getting up every 5 minutes to go to the bathroom or for a drink. When my parents beat him I feel bad for him. But when he does annoying shit like that(almost every 15 minutes) I understand why. Though recently I started seeing if he would respect me if I was to treat him nicely and like a normal human being. That worked but he then did take me seriously when I gave him instructions. Then again, he never did that. I try not to physically hit him. But now I realise that is the only way that he will listen to you. If you threaten to beat him. Tbh the hardest part about restraining myself is that whenever he gets in trouble, he will say something completely different to what I asked him.and even when you tell him to listen and say it slowly. He will say whatever he wants to say and not what you ask him. That’s the hardest part of restraining myself from slapping him. He’s sweet, but he’s obnoxious annoying and very stupid. He was 5 last month. I thought that if I just ignore him that would work. Nope. He will continue asking you and if he doesn’t get your attention he will stop at nothing to do so. Now I don’t hit him for the most time, but I find it easier that whenever he asked me for food( at the worst possible moments) when I’m done I will shout his name so loud to let out all, my frustration. Of course I can’t do it at night, also note that he’s been here no longer than 6 months. I really don’t know what approach to take towards him. What do I do?",07Jul2020,1
639,"hello all. usually a lurker here but figured I’d try this out. NYC! One of my closest friends since high school and I are now 23 and living with our other friend in our first apartment in Brooklyn. I love them both greatly but living together has shown me things about them both that have been perspective changing to say the least, however I expected that. However with the pandemic + the BLM movement going on I’ve noticed things in my one roommate that displease me. For ease I’m going to use Jack and Jill to explain some context. Jill is a Hispanic woman like myself, who grew up as the “responsible one”, grew up in les (Manhattan) and other minority neighborhoods in Harlem and the Bronx,grew up with more difficult home situations and knows the importance of supporting our people and local businesses. Jack is also Hispanic &amp; Queer however he grew up in a rent controlled building in midtown, after that lived in a fairly nice part of jersey; and now lives with us. I’ve always known he was a bougie bitch as he always liked name brands and carried himself a certain way- which I like because I too like the finer things in life. However after living together for some time and seeing the things going on I guess I have to say I’m a little bit disappointed he doesn’t care more ? The whole pandemic he’s been home (he works for apple) and has been mostly upset about not being able to go out, but not in an overbearing way, as he is still concerned about flattening the curve. However lately he’s been going out to drink more and even went to a party, and when we went on some errands before I asked him to pick a small local business to support and he asked why, and I said because we’re basically gentrification here (I’m from south Brooklyn, right now we’re in East bk where it’s cheaper) and it would be nice to put money back into the community rather than our previous target runs, yk? He didn’t say he was against it but didn’t say he was for it. We went to an lgbtq thing in the city for pride and while walking ran into a dope speaker speaking about bipoc issues &amp; how most of the problems out people face are due to capitalism, and how she identifies as a communist. After we spoke about it and I asked how he felt and he said he generally doesn’t think communism is sustainable. I personally don’t politically identify with anything at the moment but I’m def more along the lines of being a liberal and as someone who grew up in the hood I just feel like our upbringings have been so contrasting. I guess my issue is I feel like he doesn’t care about the issues enough. He is someone who had to move out young and live in various more “hood” neighborhoods after high school due to home issues so I feel like it kind of sucks that someone who had to go through stuff and struggle  still supports a system that creates a struggle. Jill is about to move out after a year of our lease because of her own financial circumstances, but between him not being independent enough (basically think reg Hispanic dude babied by mom) compared to Jill (classic Hispanic forced responsibility) who is very on top of errands, whatever bills she’s in charge of, and who’s political ideals align more with mines, I’m a bit worried about us living together moving forward.

643,"All through my childhood I maintained my grades and my parent's expectations on me through parental pressure.  But when I reached 10th grade it all changed. I started procrastinating on things. I was too lazy, to do anything really. I would get a lot of rage and frustration directed at me from my parents who just wanted me to get up and do something. And after every scolding I got I would study out of guilt and it always resulted in good grades. As a result of parental pressure I got good grades on end exams throughout 10th, 11th, and 12th grade. But sometimes I would just forget everything and procrastinate and the grades would stoop down( on minor exams) and as a result my parents would go mad, and this would drive me to get good grades on important exams. And now I'm in medical school. Now my parents don't care for some reason. I think I'm the problem because every time they try to advice me I go hysterical remembering all the times they used to get angry at me in the past and now I just lash out in anger. Hence, my parents don't try anymore. So the parental pressure factor is almost entirely gone. My procrastination is out of control now. I just cannot control it. Every time I try to self motivate myself it never ends well I always ultimately resort back to my lazy ways. I looked it up and it seems some people are just more lazy than others. I want to know how to conquer this destructive habit. It is lockdown here, and I don't have any drive for doing anything and as a result end up wasting my time doing nothing at all when I should be studying. Sometimes I get this urge to get my life back in control and draw up a schedule but every time something minor happens or I fail to do something written in the schedule I procrastinate the whole day. I know it's a way of escaping my responsibilities, but the problem is I can't control it. I've been trying for four years now and everytime I procrastinate, by the end of the day I'm always this depressed mess. Sometimes I lose faith in life altogether. However I will tell you one positive thing about me. If I initiate anything, for eg, studying or working out, I do it a lot. Like a lot lot. If I start studying right now, if I'm truly invested in the subject I can go 3-4 hours in full concentration. But the problem is always *initiating*. People have always described me as being intelligent( my teachers and my therapist). And yes I am going to a therapist now I am taking antidepressants and sleeping pills to combat anxiety. Its always the studies that get me worked up and not being able to utilise my intelligence to full potential. I'm sorry for ranting so much here, no one will listen. They resort to calling me lazy and irresponsible( I know I am all these but I feel like it's out of my control). So please, I need to get my life together.

644,"I recently got hired through the referral of an old friend, and the old friend is training me. There are 3 of us in our positions, one coworker who does nothing, myself (still in training), and my good friend - who has taken it upon themself to take on the task of my training, as well as their own workload, and picking up the slack for our lazier colleague.

The lazy colleague is well-liked at the company so our issues with them, though they’ve been raised, are largely ignored.

My friend casually mentioned how much they make yesterday, and it’s $7,000 less than I do. I don’t think it’s fair, or right, and I feel like I need to speak up. I’m selfishly worried about this affecting my job, which I’m lucky to have - but never would have gotten if it weren’t for this person. We’re talking almost $500 extra a month.

646,"I (21, F) have always felt an incredible disconnect to the name that was chosen for me. Since I was a child, I would write my name down and attempt to visually alter it by adding accents on one of the vowels or taking away the capital letter. I have never felt like it represents me and it bothers me a lot. My mom saw my name in a fashion magazine that she was reading when she was pregnant with me and loved it, which is how it was picked.

In recent years, I became aware that you don't actually need to sit with a name that you dislike and have brought up the idea of getting my name changed a few times to my parents. It is no surprise to them as I have continually spoken about how much I dislike my name for most of my life, but despite this, my parents were incredibly offended and think I am disrespecting the name that my mom chose for me. They completely shut me down and I decided to stop speaking about it to them.

Recently I have finally found a name that deeply resonates with me and feels like me! My closest friends in my life have been calling me this name for a while, most of them have even changed my contact name on their phones.

647," 

Hi, new person here! Wasn't sure what to put as a title but yeah, long story ahead and I want your advice and opinion on the matter!  
**Advice on:** Am I the shitty person in all this? Have I acted wrongly? Or is she at fault? Am I truly that bad of a person for telling her off?  
**Short version:** Starts with unconsented kiss on the shoulder, the acting like we're married, to ignoring me when telling her off, to blocking and then her getting angry with me for kicking her out of a facebook group.

**Cast:**  
Me (25 year old woman)  
Ex friend (Let's call her Mari, a 31 year old woman)  
Different friends.

So this story starts three years ago. I know this story will be long but you'll need all the context for this.  
This summer me and a friend were at an event. I never meet Mari outside this particular event and only chatted online. We were doing roleplays based on already existing characters and the event allowed that you dress up as characters which is what we did. Two characters that we were roleplaying as, in fact.  
However... Things took a really weird turn already at day 1. I was getting ready with my other friend and Mari walks in and starts greeting us for the first time in a year. I think nothing off her chatting until she suddenly walks up behind me, wraps her arms around my waist, press me against her and kisses my bare skin/shoulder. This shocks me as we're not a pair in any way shape or form, our characters are in the plots but we're not. I try to get free and honestly shocked to the point that I can't say anything but she won't let me go until my friend gives her a warning glare.  
This whole weekend is the same, but as my friend is more aware of how touchy Mari is without my consent Mari don't try to hold onto me again but follows me around and calls me her wife. This freaks me out and my already existing PTSD and anxiety makes me spiral straight down into the floor the following months. To the point that another friend of mine takes me to a psychologist who tells me to get care and medication because I'm on the brink of being suicidal.  
After this, the roleplays get a lot more sexual than before. Sex takes over the plot completely and when I tell her to stop she gave me excuses about how her illnesses and sexual assault that happened repeatedly since a young age makes her not see an issue with all the sex. I tell her it makes me uncomfortable and that I don't want it but she often shrugged me off. It could be good for a few days after I told her off but then she was right back at it again.  
And this took a toll on me even further as I kept repeating I wasn't comfortable with it but she manipulated me into thinking it's OK so I eventually stopped telling her off as much as she was getting more and more upset every time I told her off. (My PTSD makes me shrug away extra much from confrontations, sadly)

In 2018 when it was once again time for the same event, I knew she would be there and that made me anxious as she clearly didn't take no for an answer and didn't respect me or my boundaries. I tried to keep my distance but she somehow always found me and it was like she kept tabs on me and my friend. When she thought we had left the camping site (we stay at the same camping) without a word she send both me and my dad, who drove me and my friend there, a really nasty and angry message about it and accused us of stealing wood bricks from her and her mother. FYI, we didn't leave. We just got a more shaded spot for our dogs.  
It was after this that the friend who got me to the psychologist had enough as she saw how it took a toll on me and everything I got a message from Mari, she said it was like all life and light just vanished from me. So with my permission she told Mari off. I was beside her the whole time so I knew what she wrote. Mari tried to first manipulate her into taking pity on her because of her medical issues but my friend wasn't having any off it. She too has a lots of those things and wasn't doing this stuff to others. So when Mari couldn't manipulate her, she turned to anger and blamed me for stuff instead of taking responsibility, everything was bad because of me according to Mari. When that didn't fly either, as I had showed my friend the facebook conversations and I had witnesses to the events previously mentioned, she gave up and came to an agreement with my friend that she would leave me alone until I was ready to contact her.

That lasted 4 months. I was healthier than ever but then she contacted me in early December, wanting to reconnect because she missed me as a friend. I told her that I wasn't interested in being her friend as I had finally come to the realization how much better I felt without her in my life.  
This did not sit well with her. So I blocked her on facebook in the end.  
It was quiet for a while until she once again tried to reconnect with me over instagram. I told her off as she once again couldn't take no for an answer and refused to listen to me and tried to blame me for everything. She even attempted to turn her friends against me, putting herself out there as a victim of a bad friend (me) who she had told everything too and now stabbed her in the back because she didn't want to change. She realized later we had common friends who saw it all and blocked them all.

I told her before that same event we both went to the previous 2 years that I didn't want her to contact me in any way during that event. This made her snappy and she said she had no plans to do so and how her world didn't circle around me, yet I saw her several times during that weekend and the event hosts over 12'000 people on a university campus...  
I wish that's where the story end but sadly not. She kept writing cryptic messages on her facebook wall about what a toxic person I'm and how bad of a person I'm for cutting her off without giving her a chance and for wanting her to change etc. She posts everything on public so those not blocked could still see it and some of my friends removed her when things started to come out what she did so they could still see it.  
That's when I decided that enough is enough and I started to gather every evidence I have of what has happened, including the roleplays, so I kicked her out of the facebook group so she wouldn't be able to delete anything or contact me through the group. Copying everything wasn't an option as we got over 20 threads at least filled with over 1000 replies over the years.

But kicking her out set her off big time. So I told her my reasons, that I didn't want contact with her as stated many times before and that I was holding it as evidence in case it goes to court. Because at this point, it's that serious. And I'm admin of the group and she has no legal rights to the roleplays as they are all based on already existing characters owned by others.

She did not see it that way. After she was blocked everywhere she sought out my private email (I still don't know how she found it and I never told her) and sent me a really nasty, threatening email telling me how shitty of a person I'm and how I'm not worth some of the achievements I have done through these three years and that it's difficult to find a worse human being than me. She was really threatening too in that mail, all because I kicked her out of that group and she didn't like that and wanted back in. That's what sparked this email. Ofc I told her off and told her that if she contacts me I'll file a police report against her and try to get a restraining order.

Am I the shitty person in all this? Have I acted wrongly? Or is she at fault? Am I truly that bad of a person for telling her off?  
Her last email really had my question a lot even tho I know I have the right to kick her out of my group and she don't have legal rights to any of it.  
But... Am I a shitty person for letting my PTSD and anxiety stop me from telling her off way before I did?

651,"In my sophomore year I took APUSH1. I did enjoy the class but honestly I was pretty bad at it. There was also a lot going on in the beginning of my year and I have a winter job so that may have affected my preformance. The only reason I was able to get above an 80 was because of covid. Our teacher is wonderful in history and english but is terrible at technology so all the online tests were easy.

I have some friends dropping out next year and not taking apush2 because they realize it’s not for them, not their career path, and it takes up too much time. I agree with that as well. I’m not going into any area of english or history and i’m definitely doing something more science related. I’ve talked to people and basically decided not to take it and take regular USH instead. But, my mom’s upset about it and is swaying my opinion. I’m debating taking it because I’ve started it and should probably finish it. The last year of APUSH in sophomore year feels like an absolute waste. Please help.",07Jul2020,1

Was offered a project to her, the problem is the client, actually works in a IT company, say things like call u in 10min and won't call and etc. Ofc She stays in standby waiting for a feedback, but she has the chance to go to the company, do the work there and stay close to the client. Today she snapped and Said things as ""i gonna cancel this and have my money"".

653,"My best friend moved to London a couple months ago to move in with her fiance and his family. Her fiance's dad cheated on his wife and became a drunkard right after she moved in and things have been a disaster since. 3 and a half weeks ago she tried to kill herself and failed. I've been working with her towards the end of last week on a game plan to get her home. My boyfriend managed to scrounge enough for a ticket to get her home, and I messaged her a couple days ago to iron out times and ticket details but I haven't heard back from her. I've tried calling too and her phone goes unanswered.

I am legitimately afraid that my friend has killed herself in another country. I have her address, and her current phone contact and nothing else. If she were in the US I could call for a welfare check just to find out she's alive. If she changed her mind about coming back and doesn't want to tell me, or doesn't want to talk to me for whatever reason, that's fine, I just want to know she's alive.

657,"I (25F) have always been the artsy type, never into sports, the outdoors, or anything where you get dirty and sweaty. I don’t have anything against it, it was just never my thing. 

My boyfriend (25M), on the other hand, has been camping and hiking since he was a toddler. He loves the outdoors, and jumping from quarries, and getting all dirty and sweaty. 

Last week, we went up to his parents house, which is located in a very woodsy, isolated area. It’s large enough for us to hike around without being around any other people. So he took me hiking with two of his friends, and to be completely honest I didn’t like it at all. There were so many bugs, I was sweating profusely (I hate sweating because it makes me feel gross and dirty), I could barely keep up on account that I’m only 5 ft tall and have shorter legs and my boyfriend is over a foot taller than I am and has longer legs. So I felt like everyone was being held back by me, despite them all reassuring me I was doing well. 

I’m wondering if there’s a way I can look at hiking differently so I can keep hiking with my boyfriend. I know it’s a big part of his life and the last thing I want is to be that girl on the sidelines who doesn’t want to participate in anything. I want to show him that I care and want to be involved in the things he loves, and that I can get dirty and sweaty with him with no worries in my mind.

659,"I have a female friend. She's married with 3 kids. She recently asked me for some help buying a phone. She basically wants me to buy her the latest iPhone (11 Pro Max something something) and pay me back on a payment plan of 3 months.

&amp;#x200B;

At first, I was just uncomfortable with the idea. There's so much I could be doing with nearly $1,000. The more I sat down and talked to her the more I went from uncomfortable to ""holy crap, is this even real??""

&amp;#x200B;

Some facts:

&amp;#x200B;

* She and her husband are tight on funds, the husband lost his second job during the Covid-19 crisis.
* they are sending 3 kids to a new school, which they have to be busting their asses to fund in the coming September
* they have a truck sitting in a garage for repairs that could buy 3 iPhones each month with profits alone. it didn't even cross her mind to fix it up until I mentioned it...
* she doesn't have a phone right now so when I mentioned getting a cheaper phone temperarily she insists on only the latest iPhone
* when i asked her about getting a loan to fix up the truck she mentioned that her bank won't lend her cash, I press and find out she maxed out her credit cards and defaulted on the payments... she swears she's on top of it now and making payments. When I press further on this, she admits she's only making the minimum payments....
* admitted to me she had (has?) a spending problem
* she already owns me money that she should have paid me back weeks ago

&amp;#x200B;

I sat down this morning and really analyzed the situation and wow, I can't believe for a split second I even thought about actually doing this. No wonder my gut was telling me something is off.

&amp;#x200B;

How do you have 3 kids going to school in two months, a husband who's income was recently reduced, in credit card debt, go and ask a friend to buy the LATEST iPhone LOL. My gut is telling me that if I even lent her this money, I might never get back all of it! Another side of me is saying that after she gets this cash she and her family will disappear.

&amp;#x200B;

669,"Not posting on AITA or relationship advice because my BF reads those regularly. I think this fits guidelines but I’m sorry if it doesn’t, I can edit. 

I know the title is weird but hear me out.

I’m an empath. When I met my boyfriend, he was emotionless, but I helped him get in touch with his own emotions. The next step was to understand other people’s emotions, but he doesn’t really see that as important so little progress is made. 

The problem is, he’s extremely selfish. Not in an outwardsly narcissistic way, but he views everything from the lens of himself and whether it serves him. His best friends’ gf died and he didn’t console him because ‘I’m not good at stuff like that’. I would feel so guilty if I had done nothing. 

We got to the point where I’m always doubting whether I love him. I emotionally support him, plan dates, care for him, but didn’t receive this back. When he has to plan a date he would say ‘but you’re so much better at doing this stuff’ and get upset and I would plan it instead. Over time, I stopped being the loving girlfriend I was. I hated that this is what I had become.

So we spoke and I reinforced that he needs to be more empathetic because I can’t go through life feeling unsupported. He’s generally a wonderful person, cares about me a lot, is always open to talk and listen, but empathy and caring for others is how I define myself and I can’t be with someone who is so different because I lose myself. That’s not his fault, but it’s just not right for us then. 

He had promised to set up a date night for us. It took over a month for him to do it but I didn’t cave this time and waited for him to come up with something. He told me he was going to throw me a spa night. He was promising me a full body scrub, mani pedi, full body massage, facial massage and exfoliation etc the whole works.

When the day came, I was blown away by his setup - it was so romantic (which he typically isn’t), candles everywhere, hot towels etc. We started with a hair mask, then face massage and then a manicure. My birthday was a while ago and he basically put no effort into that, which really hurt me, so I was so happy that he was making up for it now. But I could tell he was a little off and unenthusiastic about what he was doing. I had asked him beforehand if he was too tired and wanted to reschedule but he said no. 

After a while, I caved and asked him what was wrong. We have recently taken a smoking break, and he said he felt a bit unsettled. Now, we have done these frequently before and we know that the first 2-3 days are a bit agitated. He just had the urge to smoke. I had it too but we both know that the only way to get through this is to sit through the discomfort. But because he was looking so uneager to continue I offered to end the night there and watch a show, which is what we typically did every night and recently agreed we wanted to stop doing. 

I felt like an idiot sat there with my hair in a wrap and half done nails. We literally stopped then and there, played a board game whilst I waited for my nails to dry (I finished them off myself) and then I hopped in the shower to wash everything off. He didn’t mention anything about the night ending abruptly.

The reason why I would be upset is because we have a long history of him replacing moments that are meant to be about me with himself. For example, my family is physically and emotionally abusive and basically hold me captive sometimes, but for months every time it came up I would end up consoling him because he ‘didn’t know how to react’, even though when I first told him before we got together he insisted it didn’t bother him and he wanted to be there for me. 

Normally, I drop everything when he needs me, but I just wanted something for me for once. I’m so tired of minimising myself so that he can always take up space. I’m tired of having to get upset and express this for him to realise that he should proactively think of my feelings.

This post is obviously biased because I’m upset right now, so I would love some neutral opinions. WIBTA if I were upset? At least he tried? Is it rare for men to be open and communicative and willing to work on issues? Is this part of that process?

I don’t have any female mentors or close friends or anyone I can talk to about whether I’m being crazy. So I would really appreciate some feedback :) sorry for the long post!",07Jul2020,1

674,"So I’ve recently moved home from living in Scotland for 7 months. It was mostly due to my ex’s family as there was always something happening whether it was drugs, arguments and fighting. This was pretty much every other day. I left her and I feel so so guilty but that was so much for me to deal with. I didn’t want to leave her at all, but I felt the only way I could feel comfortable was being at home with nothing to do with all that. 

I moved in with her mum(ish she’s always staying at her partners which left us with the son) he was always up to no good and I couldn’t take it because it was stressing her out and myself out because she was stressing. It became a cycle. She said she wants to get out of that place but I did. I had to get out, only way I could do it and thought about it at the time was moving back in with my parents. She’s not massively keen on the idea about living in England (she’s very close with her Mum, basically sisters). I have such a huge friendship circle where I live and up there she hasn’t got many people to speak to. I feel living here would help her but her anxiety will probably not help that. 

I’ve considered again moving back up but having nothing to do with the area we lived in or the family if I’m honest. I just want her. I’m scared she’s going to move on but at the same time I’m also like, it’s 4 years when we were together, she’s not that girl who sleeps about, parties she’s a very quiet and closed girl. She doesn’t talk to guys. I just don’t want her to think I’m not thinking of her at all. It’s constant and all week I’ve not been sleeping because I’m stuck in my life. 

I want to tell her my plans about possibly trying again or asking her to move here for a little while and later moving in Scotland (so much cheaper to live there and I adore Edinburgh a lot). I don’t know if it’s the right time, we’ve been separated for 1 month this week and as time goes on I feel we’re just becoming more and more friends. We’re always talking, on the phone when she’s having abit of anxiety, when she’s in the middle of work (working from home) I see it as a positive sign that she knows I’m there but I just want to ask her out again but scared of rejection. 

My plan is to stay here, go back to hopefully seeing her often, like twice a month or something (Covid may ruin it) but work up a lot of money where I can and save it and move somewhere to rent with her and start fresh. 

I’m sorry for the long paragraphs.

So I'm close with this person, and he's been borrowing a lot of money from me. It's been a while since this started. I know him enough to trust he's gonna pay back. I don't have any problem with him taking his time. I understand what he's going through is tough. 

I just want him to know that I've got his back and that I'm willing to help with his financial problems as much as I can. He talked to me earlier today and he said he's really embarrassed that he's borrowed so much and that his debt to me is huge. He's guilty that I have next to no money to spend for myself even though I do have things that I should want and/or need nowadays.

I don't want to hear that I should be strict and that ""helping"" him means forcing him to stand on his own two feet, I'm aware. It's so hard saving money when you're poor.

I don't know what else to put but I will be editing this as stuff comes up. Thanks in advance for all your answers!

681,"This is my first post ever on this throwaway account. This is a little long so please bare with me. 

Whew. 

Where do I begin? 

I (27F) live at home with my mother (57F). Disclaimer: Not sure if this matters but, I’m still at home because I don’t want roommates and I live in one of the most expensive cities in the US. When I leave, I want to be stable enough to live on my own. Even if this means buying my own house. I’ve pay rent and bills since I graduated college so I’m not speaking as a freeloader. Lol 

My mother is a hoarder. 

Have you ever watched the show hoarders? It is not a lie. It is not exaggerated. It is very much real. 

When I was a child and my parents were together, I didn’t really notice it (plot twist: my dad is the clean one). When I moved to another part of the city with my mom as a teenager, it became more apparent but it wasn’t to a point where I am feeling now. 

For the last few years, it’s gotten worse and I am currently feeling like a shaken soda can ready to pop. 

She mostly hoards paper and clothing but other items are in the mix too. You cannot walk through her room without almost breaking your ankle. It’s extremely dangerous and a fire hazard. I’ve expressed this many times. 

It’s very hard for her to throw things out. This also includes food. I’ll be ready to throw fruit out that is clearly going bad and she’ll get mad and say that she’ll use it to make something, then she won’t. When I start to bagger her about cleaning up and she tries, she has to look at every single thing. This why, her room is the way it is. 

I REFUSE to let the rest of the apartment get in the same condition so I clean up when I can because I’m the only one who will do it. I work almost 60 hours a week so it’s not everyday. I’ve been so over it recently that I sometimes just stop cleaning up behind her until I get tired of looking at the mess. A few days later, things end up in the same condition and the cycle continues. 

My mom has a huge room with a king bed, an extension to her room that can be used as an office, and walk-in closet. I’m confined to a much smaller room but I make due. She has not slept in her room in years. She has made the living room couch her home. Better yet, she has made the entire living room her second bedroom. She constantly brings stuff from out her room into the living room and therefore I can’t enjoy it. If I want to sit down and watch TV after a long day, I am confined to my room. 

I work two jobs so I can save up to eventually leave and I am extremely tired of coming home to chaos. It’s not good for my mental health. 

Just this morning, I had to get on her about her stuff blocking the front door because it’s not safe. 

What’s making it even worse recently is that my grandmother (her mother) unfortunately is suffering from end stage cancer and is currently in hospice. Her hoarding and lack of care to clean or really take care of herself is beginning to peak. She’s also very forgetful and evasive. The unstableness is very apparent. 

While this living situation is unhealthy for me, I know if I were to leave anytime soon, it will get out of control and I’m afraid the whole apartment will transform. Maybe even face eviction. I love her and I care for her and this is the last thing I’d like to see. 

I’m also in a mindset where I know I’m not ever going to be able to live how I want to live until I leave. So I’m battling between selfishness and selflessness. 

She was with my dad for over 20 years and he dealt with the same behaviors. I find myself venting to him constantly because I feel like he’s the only one that understands exactly where I’m coming from. He has suggested that I pull sometime of invention but I’m just not sure she is in the mental state to really handle that.

I am not a perfect person by any means in terms of being spotless but I always get my stuff cleared away. I myself is still working through certain issues from past traumas and my living space so I know how sensitive people with different mental health issues can be. 

Has anyone here dealt with someone like this? How did you go about addressing it? Was it ever resolved?

2. I feel it might be inconsiderate to my new roommates, in my new college town, to go on a vacation right before moving in with them. I'm pretty sure they are both driving up to school and not taking planes.

My wife and I had infertility issues. It took us five years but our prayers were finally answered late 2018 when we found out that our 4th IVF attempt was successful. At that moment I beamed and instantly became a proud papa. July of 2019 my son was born. No words could explain how happy I was to see his little face and to hold him. Tears are falling as I type this because it truly was the happiest moment of my life.

  2020 has been a complete whirl. Since January my wife and I started planning his first birthday. Booked a hall, chose a theme (Cat in the Hat - because he always lit up when he saw the show) we were so excited to have friends and family celebrate his first year. As soon as the pandemic started, we knew that the chances of still having his first birthday party were bleak, but we held onto hope that things would get better.

  As time went on, we realized that in order for us to be safe or anyone for that matter - we cancelled the venue. Granted, we’ll still have a small birthday party for him with a small group of close family members and maybe a couple of friends...I was really looking forward to throwing him a huge party.

  While I realize the rest of the world is dealing with bigger problems, just going reminding myself what my wife and I went through to have my little guy makes me feel “down in the dumps” to not be able to throw this party for him. His first birthday, his only first birthday he’ll ever have.

689,"ive been for quite a while now, completely emotionless

and now trying to figure out what to ask you guys i see clearly that it has been since i started dating my current GF.

my current GF is all you can dream of beautiful, intelligent, caring and she lets me follow my passion which is music.

when i started dating my current GF there was also another girl which i met a couple of times at some parties and tho we only talked a little, but i really feel like there was a very strong connection. this girl lives on the other side of my country basically and i thought she was way out of my league anyway. it all started when i was standing in the bar bartending and she looked over at me from the dancefloor and her look just melted me. i was standing next to an old friend who was also bartending and he also saw it. sadly we couldent figure out who it was for initially, and me not having the best confidence ever i thought well it was probably for him. the end of the night comes and somehow one of my girl friends who we were suppose to sleep at asked if that girl could go rest in my car cause she was not feeling well. ofc i agreed, then later when me and my friend from the bar was suppose to go to my friends she was tagging along, i kept making eye contact with her in the backseat. we get to the place and after 30 mins, she announces she's going to bed, i wait 15 min and then go in there she is still awake.

now as i said my confidence has not always been the best, so i enter she looks at me and i decide on sleeping with one bed inbetween (i know im an idiot). a couple of times during the next 30 mins she looks at me and i at her but im still unsure if she really wants me.... so after 30 mins she gets up quite angrily looking and she dissapears. then after maybe 15 mins the girls who lives there enters the bedroom looking for condoms for the girl and my friend, and then i think ""well maybe it was just me who miss read all the signals, phew im glad i didnt embarrass myself""

i cant really sleep anyway so i decide to help look, also because i cant really believe i was that far off. so i follow her downstairs expecting to see them all over eachother. but instead im met with her just rejecting him, and basically playing with his emotions.

we all decide on making a bonfire instead of sleeping so while we are out there he starts making advances towards her again and again and gets rejected eachtime to the point were us others have to tell him to stop (he is one horny mf) and at one point the girl who lives there says ""damn he's really crazy about you"", and infront of everybody she says ""well he is not the only one"" while looking at me

&amp;#x200B;

and that just makes me think she wanted an reaction from me thats why the other girl came in there looking for the condoms, to see if it bothered me... its a little bit foul play, but i can understand she was getting frustrated with me and my low self esteem at that point....

&amp;#x200B;

time pass and somehow i actually end up at a place with her again down the line some months later, at another girls place with the same horny friend from earlier.

all tho this time its just me and her talking, and she made quite clear that it wasent him that she was interested in. but this time its our mutual girlfriend who pulls her to her room when its time to sleep. like ofc it can be me having too high thoughts of myself, but when she insisted on taking her we were in the middle of talking and she didnt want to go. 

we were talking about the world, injustice, climate change all those 6 am subjects

4 months down the line, she only posts things on facebook that honestly i would post, it seems after that talk she really got into all that eco warrior stuff, i myself am a bit of an SJW (communist/socialist might be more accurate) so that made me think she was trying to tell me something.

2 months after i host a party, my new GF is there, she crashes early on and i let her sleep in my car. around an hour after she went to sleep the other girl shows up, and i cant hide my excitement when i see her. i pick her up and give her a big hug, we immidiatly start talking, and i end up offering her a drink so we go to the bar where i forgot ""Horny friend"" is working the bar, i get us 2 drinks and we stand there talking for a couple of hours, and out of the corner of my eye i can really see its bothering ""horny friend"". i later find out that horny friend is actually in love with her......

i politely tell the girl that since last time ive gotten a girlfriend, she doesent get mad or anything, maybe a slight glimmer of dissapointment is what i could see on her face

&amp;#x200B;

i am allready having a really hard time decide at that point if i should write the girl who lives farway. but in the end i decide not to, cause i all ready had a beautiful loving caring girl + she lives so far away + my friend is in love with her.

at that time khalid and normani made a song called ""love lies"" and everytime i hear that it i can only think of the girl who lives far away.

and the scary part is for the last maybe 1½ years hearing that song is one of the only things that actually brings some feelings to me, its the feeling of sorrow but atleast a feeling.

even when ive been doing awesome shit that i know should feel good i feel nothing.

This has been really hard for my music making skills aswell cause i cant feel anything, i used to feel my way to what sounded good.

i think basically what it is, is i have shut down my emotions because that was easier, so now i dont have any, only the feeling of being a giant douchebag. and the only thing that brings emotion is that song cause it reminds me of her...

i feel really sorry for my girl for what i have done, i feel like ive been stringing her along.... i love her no doubt, maybe if we didnt see eachother for a couple of weeks id feel it. i wish it was that simple, but this being emotionless has gone on for so long now i just gotta find an answer to it

Reddit please just give me some sort of advice

all my current friends just tell me to stick with my GF. and it is definently the logical reasonable choice, but i just dont think love can be reasoned with.... sadly....

693,"Tldr at the bottom! 

I (25F) had a pretty good job before COVID-19. It wasn't in the field of my degree or anything (does that actually happen, or is that American propaganda?), but it paid well and I was good at it. 

Got laid off in March, got up with a new company in a few weeks. The new company explicitly told me, ""Hey, the old team butchered the billing department, so we're revamping everything. You'll be trained, but the system's a mess and it's going to be hard work."" 

Cool, fine by me, I love hard work, let's do it. Yada yada. So I start, and it's fine. We audited the old system, found where there are holes. Then I started training. For whatever reason, I started training with two people to bill for two different companies (the parent company has several entities under it). Someone else that started when I did is only billing one, and I've yet to get clarification on why I got two.

Cool, fine by me, I love hard work, let's do it. 

So I start training, and my interviewer was right--it's a mess. Disorganized, multi-system, unclear communication, the works. As I'm training, my boss says, ""Hey, we have this employee who bills for another company, and does [this thing] on the side. They need more bandwidth to do the billing, can you train with them on the [this thing--it's not a project, but a part of their job] so you can help alleviate their workload?"" 

Cool, fine by me, I love hard work, let's do it. 

So now I'm training with three different people for three different jobs (two of the jobs are billing, but they're for different companies, so the rules are very different). A couple weeks in, they fire the person that's training me on [side job]. I knew it a little, but my training definitely wasn't done. They warned me they wanted to get rid of them (revamping the department and all), but I didn't think it would be in the middle of my training. 

CoOl fiNe bY mE iLoVE hArd WoRk lEt'S do IT?!?!

That was a mess. So I scrambled and learned that shit real fast, and now I'm still training with the other two.

I'm technically supposed to be solo since our last month-end, but there are so many weird instances and one-off situations and generally complicated nonsense that if they let the people I'm training with go? The company would tank overnight. Slight exaggeration, but not far off. 

So, I'm tired, man. I'm depressed like everyone else over a billion things, the money and job security is nice, but I'm tearing my hair out over the stress of this job (literally, I have a skin picking thing, and my scalp is bloodied up on the daily, sorry if TMI). 

It's goodish money, and they promised that once I'm solo billing everything that is get a raise, but how far off is that? I know the pandemic has affected the company's profits, so who knows what a raise would actually look like?

Sorry this is so much. I suppose the advice I'm looking for is--well, just your opinion on whether toughing this out will pay off, or if calling it quits is reasonable. I don't have much experience in the corporate workforce, so I don't want to be a baby, but I don't want to be taken advantage of.

I don't want to quit. I know I wouldn't be able to collect unemployment, and I'd feel bad for having them out all this effort into training me, only for me to bail. But things keep stacking up and there doesn't seem to be an end in sight.

I [F19] have this friend [M25].  He's really generous, he treats me food and would give me money even though I'm not asking him to. He's clinically depressed, so the scenario in which he always displays a pessismistic vibe is usual for me. Often times he would say jokes about harming himself, even when he knows that im not comfy with such things cause Ive had a friend who also did the same thing back then. But it's okay, I understand where that comes from and I still do my best to comfort him. 

Whenever I try to open up though, he doesn't seem to care. I would try to subtly vent about my problems in hopes that he would see that I'm trying to open up, but he would just respond with things like ""Oh Ive been through something much worse than that!"" I feel like he doesnt listen to me at all. 

Another thing is that when he apologizes, he always says ""Sorry, I'm just really dumb. I'm an idiot"" and he does that almost aaaaall the time! At one time he messed up when he was commissioning me for art, I sent him sketches and asked for his approval and he said yes so I pushed through. When I sent the final output, he wanted almost everything changed. Then he just apologized like that. ""I'm sorry, I'm dumb. That's just how I am, silly me.""

A week ago, we had a minor debate about a game, and it led to us talking about ""life"" stuff. All the things I wanted to tell him, I told him. Usually, when he has an episode I sugarcoat my words to make him feel like he's not alone. But at that instance, I wanted to be frank, I dont think that the habits I pointed out is healthy and could help him improve. I told him those through chat. Before doing so, I told him that I dont intend to insult him, I just wanted to be THAT friend who tells you the things you need to hear. That was the last thing he read. After I sent the things I wanted to say, he didnt even leave me on read but still continues to post online and play. 

It felt like removing a thorn out of my neck when I said those, but I also felt extremely guilty because 1. he was always generous and kind despite all those, 2. he mightve done something to harm himself because I hurt him.

I asked a few friends for advice, most of them told me to cut off ties because its not healthy for my mental health (?) And some of them told me ""maybe hes just busy""

So normally I'm not at all a picky eater (I'll eat pretty much anything except really spicy food) but recently I've felt completely disgusted by foods with certain textures. I don't have any issues with crunchy or bread textures, but everything else is completely horrible, even foods I normally love. When I eat stuff, I feel like I have to choke it down and I just want it out of my mouth. I feel like I'm panicking and start thinking about everything it could be (how meat could really be human or snake, how yogurt or mashed potatoes could have literally anything mixed in, how soup broth could be spinal fluids or whatever, etc). It helps a lot if I can easily identify what it is for sure, but the foods I'm okay with eating are still super limited. Veggies and fruit are very easy to identify, so I've been eating a lot of those. Crunchy peanut butter has a very distinctive taste and has the nut pieces mixed in so I can eat that. It's easier to eat things if I make them from scratch and stay in the kitchen while they cook or if I watch my parents cook so I have the peace of mind of knowing for sure what's in food, but the textures are still horrible. 

This happened once before when I was 12, and it went away after a couple months, but it appears to be back. Clearly this isn't ideal for getting proper nutrition. Does anyone have any tips on either how I can get over it or how I can prepare foods so that they're more pleasant to eat? My parents seem stressed right now so I don't want to bother them with this.",07Jul2020,1
704,"I'm filling a room that's opened in my apartment. There are two candidates, both of whom seem like good fits, and I'm having trouble deciding between them.

The first candidate and I have mutual friends. He has similar interests to me, and, on paper, seems like he'd be someone with whom I get along well. However, he lived with two of my good friends four years ago, and they butted heads with him over tidiness of the apartment. I know that these friends can be a bit up tight. He's currently been living with a different friend for the past month, and that friend reports no incident.

The second candidate is a random person who contacted me through the room posting. He and I don't share any major interests, but from our conversation, we seemed to get along well. He seems responsible and a bit goofy. I could imagine living harmoniously with him, though I don't expect to click on a deeper level.

In short, I am more excited about the first candidate but worry that he could end up being less pleasant to live with than the second candidate. I think that I'm willing to sacrifice a little cleanliness for a significantly more compatible person, but it's very hard to make that judgement call without having actually lived with either person.

She had no prior warning and actually felt great the night before. The next morning my brother just tells me ""Hey, uh, mom had to go to the hospital."" I think he is joking, so I walk into their room and my mom is not there. This is especially worrying because our annual Florida trip is this Thursday.

and im just realizing it

im not living in the present moment;

well, it might be cuz im at home all the time, but i might start obsessing over minor things such as the way i walk or talk;

after jerking off it goes away; for like a minute; it was all clear; i was like, i know what i got to do. for example, i gotta study for my exam or whatever, more level headed. like i cant even explain. but it was good.

and now im just realizing how fucked it is;

like, the way i was even like 2-3 years ago was so much different and simpler; lighter;

its not even that im depressed or anything, but now, i basically obsess over things that aren't even real, or even like hypothetical situations; im just always in my head; sometimes even things like the way i use my hands while eating or weird stuff like that.

any ways of avoiding this??

713,"**Hello!**

So about one week and a half or something ago, I met a girl online that gave me her Discord and she told me I sounded really cool to talk to and she wanted to talk.

We talked, we played together, we shared music tastes and we were pretty similar on it and some games, she complimented my name and gave me many compliments.

She also opened up about some serious mental/health as well issues (basically she was venting to me about it). 

After this, she goes to sleep and tell me we can play together our favorite games when the next day starts, she was very friendly and didn't seem to be bothered.

But the next day she didn't message me at all, and now it's been about 5/6 days and I've only seen her play two times for a short amount of time and even then she didn't answer to me or asked me to play with her.

I did see her being online, go offline, etc though I didn't see her online today, but she doesn't message me. 

Now the thing is, I don't mind if she doesn't want to talk anymore (ok, I do slightly mind but I can understand and I'll leave her alone if she wants me to), and it's been a extremely short time (technically I've talked to her since just 3 days so it's not that big of a deal), but I'm still thinking about maybe sending her a message next week or something (what would be the more recommended time to wait for?) if she still haven't messaged me just to ask her if she is ok regarding her issues she talked about me last time because I was a bit worried, but I don't want to come off as annoying or like a stalker or something.",07Jul2020,1

This happened months ago

I have a teacher whom i have a bad r/s with
Its a long story but i was skipping my after school activities for months , to put it simply it was because i felt sad when i went for it , and bc my school shows favouritism towards the sports groups not being in it made me feel shameful and embarrassed + my class is really sporty so it just made me feel like crap 

Bc i kept skipping it she scolded me and throughout the scolding she called me a spoilt brat , pampered child , immature etc without any evidence or basis this was kind of the trigger point for me , im used to teachers scolding me because im one of the naughtier kids, but no one has ever called me these without any proof
But im just a 14 yr old girl so what can i do about it 
Its common for students from other schools to skip without a valid reason but i guess because my school’s one of the elite schools its unacceptable behaviour And just because of this i had to go counselling :/
She’s scolded me about 3 times and every time she scolds me it just becomes worse and worse

Nowadays when i see her i get angry then sad like some roller coaster of emotions 
Sometimes before i sleep I suddenly think of her and i start crying 
I cant seem to get her off my head and its been like that since March 

Yep so i just felt like posting this and i was hoping if anyone would read this and give me some advice or help about it , shes probably going to come after me again since im still skipping (she’s really persistent about it , she thinks it’s an essential part of school life) , but this time i think ill try to speak up and tell her my opinions",07Jul2020,1

She has begun to settle in but there are a few issues she’s had along the way. The big one has been constant harassment from one child in particular, he’s around 11 and has been in foster his entire life I believe. My sister has told me countless times that she’s seen him hiding in the bushes staring at her, following her around, calling her names (bitch, fat, ugly), listening to her conversations through the floorboards, and the list goes on. I have been allowed to visit her throughout this and from what I gathered about this kid I think he might be suffering from some kind of mental disorder. He hurts animals and has no consideration for other people’s feelings. The foster parents seemed to have made no attempt to stop him in his creeping.

Back story: 
I had a thing for her for quite some time. Took a lot of time for me to finally tell her. We used to talk a lot. I always felt like one of her priorities 

We'll refer to her as A and her crush at that time M

Now i knew she had feelings for someone else but at that time I didn't know it was M. M had a thing for A's Best friend and never thought he'd end up asking out A.
I had already fallen in love with A. She became that one person I could trust and be myself around.
During new year time she used to tell me she really likes me and stuff. ((I will state this. She is an amazing person and never intended to hurt me. It's just how it got played out and I don't blame her for anything.))
M eventually asked her out and I was as you know heart broken

During their relationship she still regrets what happened. He was abusive and was the type that will get jealous and abusive If he saw her talking to some other guy.
A eventually broke it off but still felt guilty about what she did. (never understood why)


A and me slowly got back in contact. Never was able to get over her because never found anybody as perfect as her tbh
We had been together for almost  11 months after everything. We were happy and it had been official for the past 6 months.
Recently A had her exams and wasn't able to text me or even be in call with me. It became very frustrating. We argued a lot and fought.
I'll be honest i used things that happened in the past as crutches for the arguments (petty and shitty I know)
Today she said wouldn't be able to devote time for her exams and studies and it would get stressful. To avoid future problems she said we should end it. I still love her very much and as far as I know she does to. She just doesn't want this to get ugly.

I will point it out that I love her to bits. She helped me a lot when I was under meds and therapy. She haleped me come out of a dark spot. I don't want anything to weigh down on her and didn't wanna push anything. 
She also stated that we could have normal conversations. But it will be very tough for me to look at her like a friend anytime soon.

I also am a very introverted person. I don't talk about my feelings or anything what so ever to anyone. She was the only person I had conversations with. Rest all people is small talk. Losing the one I talk to is not easy 

I wanted advice as to what I can do rn and
 any more questions I'll answer in the comments

Hi! Can anyone help me? I have a problem, and I'm sorry idk where and who to ask about this problem, i hope somebody can help me. 

Idk how to express what I'm thinkin and feeling right now.

Yeah I'm an artist and draw stuff digital and trad, I'm mostly on the lineart or sketching, and coloring? Not so much but I'm working on it 😅

I love my talent and I love what I'm doing, in the past years I've been distant in posting my stuff from the net cuz personal reasons, but now I'm more motivated in posting again. 

Whats my problem? 

Just recently I've been seeing posts about art reposters - about the exposure those art resposters get and less exposure for the real artists, uncredited artworks, stolen pieces, rudely edited and "" there I fixed your art"" issues. To all the artists that exprecienced that, I felt the pain and frustration that they felt cuz I've been there and now that I'm motivated again in posting - those recent issues just made me down and my enthusiasm to share, create and post just crumbles. 

 The worries of my art being stolen or edited or uncredited etc just pressures me. Sure of course I can draw without posting and sharing, but thats what also drives my enthusiasm. It's also like I'm leaving memories that I can show and share to others. Not only that I get to learn, improve and study my progress. 
I'm happy when I make something for my family, friends, people in need, or just those who need an art appreciation. 

I just dont know how will I protect my stuff and overcome those worries. I DO know I can report them and talk/contact them if needed. I do also know watermarks, should I just make them bigger  them to see? Ik that it can also ruin the image too.

-No point of a hotel or Airbnb because we’re only going there to spend a lot of time with her parents. 
-There is an event on Saturday that I have to attend, so I at least have to go for that.

The first week during the breakup I decided I would quit the last day of the month. My boss told me to take some time and make sure it was the right call (this isn’t a 2 week notice kind of job, you quit that’s your last day), and let him know by end of next pay period. With the COVID stuff I decided to stay so that’s all fine, but since then I’ve just been really struggling to put forth any effort at work. 

My tasks are mounting from each day I’m letting them roll over, my targets are down (work in sales, so units out), and I’ve just overall lost focus. I was so out of it I had to call out Saturday and ended up losing two sales which would have had me on track for the month. Now obviously i’m 2 behind which isn’t the easiest to make up when I can’t bring myself to do anything.

I’m talking mindset wise. I turned F21 like towards end last year not long ago. And I’m responsible, I work , I study and I help my family out

 (and yes I still live with my parents, it’s more cultural thing and it’s not that common in Sydney or maybe I just went to a very cultural school so I haven’t seen it much other than it’s mainly international to students out of the state) 

But my parents and I are both happy as long as I’m studying and yeah it’s still the same helping out. 

However i was just thinking am I being immature ? Or am I doing okay? 

My friends and people I know haven’t said anything bad. Most of my friends or people I know from uni are still living at home. Same thing for some cultural friends. 
I’m just wondering how would an outsider see this as.

Also with my likes and dislikes it’s not that different as it was when I was 19 
I mean I still study, still work, still think about dumb things, day dream in my spare time, cry over tv shows and I’m still a bit of a living meme.
Parents are chill just there’s still some things I can’t really tell them or they can’t know yet. 
Nothing’s really changed I guess other than now I study at uni and uni life is different but my uni environment is still a bit like high school. 


just last week me and my friend were laughing at random noises and then tied my friends shoes up on a tree. Then we got yelled at by a lady kinda like a Karen that asked how old we were and then was even more mad since she thought we were 16.
After that me and my friend were just thinking are we actually not that different than we were when we were 19?? 

Like I’m not even kidding me and my bestfriend had a 2 week phase where we wanted to become rappers just to be “famous” lol that we actually recorded at my boyfriends studio and he just face palmed the whole time lol cause we were literally being serious and actually made a plan to become famous lmao anyways that phase ended and we had a dancing phase and then that ended. Don’t know what our next phase is lol

I mean is it meant to be that different. Like other than acting professional at work and in certain areas other than that I’m still very much the same. And tbh I don’t feel like I’ll change much until I’m like 25? 

Had this talk with my boyfriend who admitted that I can be a bit immature (I think he can too lol) but other than that he sees no problem with me. Like I don’t even told him I don’t even wanna get married until we are 28 and he was okay with that!! I still ofcourse love him and only see him in my future but the idea or “marriage” seem so overwhelming!!! And at the same time the idea of turning 22 scares me now. I wish I was 20 turning instead of 21 turning 22!!
It sucks cause the covid made most of my 21 year old self bored and feel like I did nothing 

Other than that from 19 I still Literally have the same mind set, same humour, other than acting professional at work I still have my dumb moments. I mean I still wanna do soo much before  like I wanna travel, make a YouTube channel (pranks, vlogs , make up tutorials), finish of my studies (I finish in 2 year so at 24)

731,"This may be long but I’ll try and keep it short. 

I dated my ex for 3 years. He decided to wake up on day and leave me because he wasn’t happy. He was mean, controlling, and completely narcisstic. I sacrificed everything for him to get his dream career and allowed him to use my family as a crutch while he worked towards those dreams. My family vouched for him to friends and colleagues so he could secure his dream job. He would not be where he is today without me and my family. 

When he got everything he wanted he dropped me like a bad habit and I was crushed. Not only did he emotionally destroy me as a human being throughout the 3 years we were together but ghosting me like he did after we had just moved to a new city .. well, it took a lot of therapy to get to the place I’m at now. 

Before I met him I had been building myself into the woman I wanted to be, a woman I was proud of. When I met him I didn’t need him, I was happily single and looking for someone to add to my life. He manipulated his way into my life and the control started slowly and then all at once. I have never been a victim of emotional abuse and now I don’t know how to move past this. I have become an avoidant attachment and regardless of how “gorgeous, successful and fun” I am described to be.. I am a shell of the human I used to be. 

I put on a fake smile and pretend I’m happy with where things are at but being almost 30.. I feel like my formidable years I could have spent building a life with someone have been taken away. I sacrificed my dreams of continuing my education because he had to get his career .. I waited because he said “wait until we have kids then go back to school later” On top of all this, he gave me herpes and that has completely halted all hopes I had of dating/ having a future or family with someone because I can’t fathom having a conversation with someone regarding my status and being rejected over it.. I haven’t been rejected a lot (if ever) in my life. I also know for a fact that he is not disclosing his status to anyone he sleeps with. 

SO the advice I’m looking for: 
- Books, podcasts, articles 
- general advice from people in similar situations

My counselor has suggested that I take an Honors English 12 class this year, and I am apprehensive for two reasons:

1. I don't want a potential failure in an honors class to drag down my GPA and make it look bad on college applications.

2. English is one of my less-liked subjects. Although I have done well throughout the past two years, I am not particularly interested in adding more English to my workload, as I don't enjoy the class as much as chemistry and history.

So, my question boils down to this:
Is it better to apply for college with a 3.9 GPA and no advanced classes, or with a potentially lower GPA and an Honors class taken my senior year?

My friend was staying with me for a week since she lives about an hour away and came to visit. When we got home she started initiating sex. When I woke up she was beside me on the bed and we were both undressed.

She woke up an hour later and didn’t talk to me much and honestly I don’t blame her. She’s upset that she slept with me when she has a bf and doesn’t want to be considered a cheater. Things have been weird between us ever since. What should I do",07Jul2020,1
739,"Since I was a preteen (Maybe even before) I’ve just hated it when people compliment me. (Like “oh, you look nice today”) or something like that. Once in sixth grade, I wore a white dress and curled my hair for picture day. Everyone in the class cheered as I walked in to the room. On the outside, I smiled. But in the inside, all I could think about was how cringey it was and how embarrassing I felt. For the rest of that year, every time I walked into the classroom, I felt that overwhelming feeling of embarrassment. I’m pretty sure that’s when it started. But the thing is sometimes I like being complimented. I love to feel special. But most of the time, I just get so angry and lash out at the person who complimented me. My mom just thinks I’m being ungrateful (her reason for all my negative feelings, thoughts, and reactions). But I think there’s something more going on. Does anyone else ever feel like this. I just want to be sure I’m not just some negative Nancy or if I really am an ungrateful butthole who can’t take compliments from other people.

744,"I work at an Urgent Care in Arizona. We’re currently and hot spot for COVID. We do COVID testing as well as normal urgent care visits. 

An article was just released about a different urgent care company in the city that I live in, and they were talking about the safe practices they are doing to keep patients and employees safe. For example, COVID testing patients use separate entrances and different exam rooms. There’s designated COVID rooms. And how long a COVID room sits vacant after it’s been cleaned before allowing another patient in the room.

My work does not do that. Our boss mixes COVID rooms and non COVID rooms. We have the same entrances. We only have one set of equipment to get vitals (blood pressure, temp, pulse, O2). So there’s cross contamination. He says that we don’t need to wait for the room to sit vacant after it’s cleaned, that we need to just put the next patient in. He doesn’t think all PPE is necessary.

There is so much more, I am awful at describing and telling stories. And I’m overwhelmed and over worked so my brain is working just right. I’m crying typing this. This man won’t listen to us. He’s money hungry and doesn’t listen. And I’m also nervous about posting to Reddit because I’m new at posting.

747,"Hi everyone! I’ve been leasing from my landlord for about 2 years and have had a few problems with him in the past, most of which had a clear resolution. However, over the past month or so the relationship has been more hostile with him ignoring all communication from my roommate and me, and us subsequently not renewing our lease. Quite frankly he is being petty. 

I haven’t seen him wear a mask once and he’s been showing up to the apartment unannounced without any care towards the pandemic. He gives us 16hrs notice at best (24hrs is required here) IF he gives us notice at all. Last week he came to make a repair (that took &gt;4 hrs for some reason) and I decided to leave because the last time he was in the apartment (without a mask) he cornered me with a conversation about tenant/landlord trust. During this conversation he repeatedly said “huh, what, i can’t hear you under your mask” while I was basically shouting at him. Obviously I was super uncomfortable for many reasons and I do have pretty bad asthma that has put me in the hospital twice. 

We’ve now asked him twice to wear a mask in the apartment and he has ignored our request. I live in Michigan where masks are mandated. He is supposed to come to the apartment today to repair a leak in the ceiling and we have provided him with a mask, gloves, fans, and hand sanitizer. Despite this I have little faith that he will comply, any suggestions on what to do? Since our living situation is a bit hostile and we’ll be moving in a month, we’d prefer not to take legal action due to the time and money that takes. We may file a complaint but is that even worth it? Can I prevent him from coming into the apartment if he refuses to wear a mask? What would you do?

755,"For context, I live in Alberta, Canada. The current data for coronavirus in our province is [here](https://www.alberta.ca/stats/covid-19-alberta-statistics.htm). We have a relatively small amount of active cases, but just in my city we are still getting around 15-20 new cases every day. Relative to other places in the world, this is a very low number. But I think that's a bad argument that, for some, eschews responsibility in practicing health precautions.

Out of my friends, my girlfriend, and my family, I am probably the most cautious/apprehensive about the virus. I try not to be extreme, but I try to always maintain 6ft from others outside of my household. I don't make special cases for friends and my s/o, which has caused some interpersonal conflict recently. I know I'm being a little paranoid at times, but I also feel a moral obligation to protect the community/general population around me.

Anyway, I am in a group chat with a group of my friends (and within this group are friends of friends who I have not met before) who want to get together on the weekend in a backyard to have a fire. Normally I would be okay with this because social distancing can be carried out properly and the risk of transmitting the virus (through asymptomatic carriers) is low. **However, the majority of my friends in the group chat are wanting to have it charcuterie-style where everyone brings something for everyone on a table and food will be shared**.

At least in Alberta, this is classified as a high-risk activity by our governing health body. I personally don't feel comfortable going through a table touching food that may have already been touched by others. **I don't know how to approach the situation.** I've thought about a few scenarios.

*Message the group chat and tell them you don't feel comfortable doing that.* – I don't know if others are being consciously ignorant of the situation (or if I'm making judgments about my friends?) but I feel like I would be swimming upstream and stirring the pot, per se. I feel by saying ""I **personally** will not be participating"" that I am implying that others should also not be participating.

*Show up on the weekend but don't eat anything* – Doing this would possibly make me look like an asshole and make others feel guilty for what they're doing. I'm not sure how the group as a collective would respond to this.

*Show up late and make an excuse so you don't have to eat (lie)* – My least favorite option, for obvious reasons.

So im a 22[M] from The Netherlands and where I am from I am kind off the popular guy (or at least one of the) i am now at an age where these things dont matter to me anymore but that is besided the point.

All my life i have been around people that only wanted 1 thing and that is to be on good terms with me because people would see them being my friend and their popularity would go up

I know this because i did this too when i was younger (not proud at all) but it was kind of my way to secure my place in the world

But then i became my own person and stopped caring about how people see me and i met totally different people who seem to be open and very nice and outspoken about how much they like me

But now i have this problem, i dont trust these people either, although they dont give me a reason to , i just deep down assume they want something from me , and to make matters worse i keep giving myself reasons to think that by giving them the whole ‘show’ i do to make myself look my best all the time

I’m pretty close to one of my teachers and I was in contact with her almost everyday whilst we still had online learning. Just mainly asking how she was and other things related to the subject she teaches.
This was fine and all, she’d always respond, maybe taking her time occasionally but that’s fine as she used to get very busy, since trying to teach online was kind of a pain.
Anyway, for as long as I could remember, I’d always be worried that I would be wasting her time if I ever tried to contact her, since I knew she was busy and whatnot. Especially when it took her a while to respond to my messages, it would make me afraid that I was putting her under some pressure.
Someone told me that it may be a self-confidence issue, I can neither confirm nor deny this as I don’t really have any parameters to test my confidence, but I wouldn’t be surprised if that was the issue.

A bit of backstory, so I asked a girl out over FaceTime that I really liked. We are really close and supportive a lot. She said she would think about it given there is a lot of stuff going on in our lives. She said it wasn’t awkward and was kinda blushing.

I always send her a morning text and hear back within like 2 hours usually max. So the next day I did and didn’t hear for like 9 hours or something and I got a bit worried. She had some stomach problems and wasn’t feel good the whole day and we just chatted a bit.

The next day I sent my morning text and heard back like 7 hours later. She just had an unproductive day and was feeling a bit down about it.

But, he immediately blocked me. I later made an alt and lied saying my friend dared me. He unblocked me after 2 days. I then got invited to a conference he had attended during his junior year. I asked him if I could ask him a few questions about the conference and he agreed. But I ended up asking him too many questions so he asked me to stop dming him. I later asked him to block me and that happened in March. And he still hasn’t unblocked me. I know I’m a horrible person for liking him and I also basically harassed him.

764,"some background information: I already struggle with anxiety and depression but that has only worsened because I am premenopausal because of Turner Syndrome. My boyfriend has been doing nothing but sending me BLM articles. I like to stay informed on these sort of matters as well but I just donnot have the psychologically compacity for him pretty being reduced to a b-o-t that is designed to do nothing but send me updates most of time. And plus....I feel like him doing this is taking away from us having real conversations over in our chat box on discord and I feel like there is barely any spark between us because of that.

Therefore, I sent him this text:

”Look babe.....I am just as concerned about the state of world as you are and I like to stay informed about it too.....but I would also personally prefer to spend 2 or 3 days out of the week to not read any news articles or even think about this chaos because overindulging in it has really been taking a toll on my already bad mental health. And i can literally feel myself on the verge of a mental breakdown. After all, the human mind is not built to consume negativity 24/7 and that especially applies to me now since I am trying to fight menopausal depression and mood swings and one of the things that I read helps menopausal women is to spend time doing relaxing activities.

So....if you don’t mind.....I would appreciate it if you can avoid sending me news articles on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays

And no offense... I am starting to feel like I am dealing with a BLM bot at least 75% of the time in this chat box and not a real person. And what I mean by that is that I feel like we barely have real conversations anymore and because of the lack of genuine conversation....I feel like we have DRASTICALLY lost the spark we had earlier in our relationship. I mean, in the beginning we were so passionate, excited to hear from each other, constantly sending each other sweet good morning messages, and flirting and saying how much we meant to each other. And you know....I kind of miss that. Like a lot.....💔🥺💔

But make no mistake.....I am not mad at you about this at all. Because I am starting to believe that one of many reasons you buried yourself balls deep into the BLM movement is because it helps with your depression. Like maybe it is a reminder for yourself that you are not the only one with problems or that life can always be worse. Or something along those lines.

Is that true? Because if it is, I have no right to be mad at you. Because everybody deals with depression differently.”

i kind of now retreat sending him that text now because I want him to have girlfriend he can be completely open with and he struggles with depression himself and refused to be open with me because have been dating a week shy of three months. And I want him to be more open with me about that but that probably didn’t win me points in him trusting me with that down the road.

766,"I’m a 23 yo male who grew up with a single mother my whole life till I went to college and am now living on my own. I met my father for the first time when I was around 10 yo and spent a summer with him and my younger half sister a state away from where I was raised. I remember having a great time and finally being happy to have my biological father in my life. I didn’t understand much at the time but what I knew was that my parents didn’t get along. 

I go home and it’s another 5 years till I see him again. No phone calls and no visits from him till he randomly shows up in the middle of the night at my mom’s apartment. At this point I’m 15 and as expected angsts and suspicious.i don’t remember the details but apparently my father was homeless and needed to stay with us. Despite being suspicious I was somewhat excited to have him back in my life. I started growing facial hair and started having insecurities about my masculinity due to mostly being raised by women. The one good thing my father did for me was teaching me how to shave but after a month or two he disappears again. We later found out that married some chick named, I kid you not, Barbie and moved in with her. 

Now that I was a little bit older I was finally given some information about who my father is. Apparently he grew up poor but excelled in academics and got a teaching degree in college where he met my mother. She says he was a very different man than what he is now  but “changed.” I wouldn’t know what that change was till later.

So I go through the rest of high school without him even though we live in the same state now he never came around all the while posting on Facebook how proud of me he is and sharing my accomplishments as if he was apart of them. He was never there for a football game, wrestling tournament, or an art show. As I’m growing into manhood I was constantly remind how much I look and act like him, which to this day I despise. It’s not till HS graduation that I see him again. Against my wishes he was invited to my graduation and I tolerated his presence enough to get on with the day. There was a moment during the ceremony where the principal wanted to acknowledge the parents who helped my class towards graduation by asking them to stand in recognition. My sister later tells me that my father stood among the crowd. After that I took one picture with him and told myself I would never see him again. 

Flash forward another four years I’m spending winter break of my college senior year visiting relatives on my father’s side of the family and my half sister. At this point my sister and I are adults and came out to each other about how we both distain our father. I consider her situation worse than mine because to this day she is getting over daddy issues developed from his absence. It is here that our aunts finally tells us the truth about our father. They tell us that my father was really smart but drugs were really bad in their family, one of my aunts nearly died with drug involvement and my father practically fried his brain on drugs. That’s the excuse anyway.

With that, my aunts convince me and my sister to give our father one last chance at being our father. By now, Barbie divorced him, he had gotten in some legal trouble in my state and moved back to his home state where, to my knowledge, he now works as a dishwasher at Red lobster and mooching off a older woman. He’s invited over and we all have a long talk. From my end, I expressed anger and resentment toward him and my sister shared how she blamed him for the abuse she endured over the years. With seemingly no remorse he doesn’t claim responsibility for our hardships and just makes excuses for himself. We even catch him in a few lies as well. I even HUGGED him when he fell back on “well my life wasn’t easy too.” “My father wasn’t around either.” By the end of it we made a deal that if he called us regularly and showed effort, we’d welcome him in our lives. But if things didn’t  change, we will never talk to him again.

I go back home at the end of December to finish school and after a week the phone calls stop for both me and my sister. I wasn’t surprised but I was also disappointed. Come graduation in MAY I all of a sudden start getting phone calls and voicemails from him. The gist of which are an assortment of “I’m proud of you.” “I love you.” “Give me a call.” They continue to this day at least once a week and I’m debating if I should block his number or finally answer him. I don’t know. When I look in the mirror sometimes I see him and it truly disgusts me. I needed him when I was a kid. What use is he to me now? Especially when he doesn’t have his life together.

TLDR: My deadbeat dad pops in and out my life, and now that I’m grown he’s making some effort to contact me.",07Jul2020,1
767,"I'm having a deep existential crisis that I can't stop thinking about, nearly every waking moment.  
TLDR at the bottom.

Quick background about myself (I'll try and only include relevant things):  
I am a 26 year-old living in America. I was born to parents who met at Narcotics Anonymous and following the death of my father at age 11 I was raised impoverished, by an emotionally-absent mother, who had the potential to be clever and loving... but let depression get the better of her and died a shell of her former self in 2016 (heart troubles). At present, all that remains of my family is me and my older brother (29). We're all each-other has left as far as family goes. I moved across the country (West to East) in 2017 and have since bought a house, attended college for nursing (in between semesters) and have a stable job in my field. Since my teens I have struggled with depression and suicidal ideation.

At this point, I feel like I'm at a crossroads in my life and I need to make a decision.

So, where I'm looking for advice:

I feel like I could do great things. I feel inspired to make a positive change for my country, for the betterment of the American people. Maybe I'm conceited or foolish to have these aspirations, but I feel inspired by those historical figures, everyday people who stood up for what they believed in and accomplished changes that shaped the world for generations to come.

I also feel defeated. I'm on medication for my depression but what's wrong with me is more than a chemical imbalance, but also a theological one. I find the world inevitable. A part of me knows that happiness is fleeting and our existence is irrelevant in the grand scheme of things. I'm curious what comes next and find living exhausting, like pushing against a current that will drag me away eventually. However, logically I also know that I have responsibilities that tie me to the world. I owe it to my brother to live. I owe it to myself to thrive. I owe it to my community to contribute, and to my friends, I want to be present in their lives.

I ask myself where I see myself in 5 years, and the scariest answer to me is in the same place.

TLDR:

How do I get out of my own head and act decisively? I feel so weirdly lost and I feel like my friends can't understand what I'm feeling... I feel like I'm the only one who constantly thinks about these things (though, I guess that's likely not true)... I look at the situation and tell myself, ""Obviously, you want to live your best life"", and yet I find myself on a default setting of not wanting to bother. It's like a constant fight against what I know is right and what I know is easier.

I don't know what advice could help me at this point, but if there is any advice that you could share, I could use someone else's perspective please!",07Jul2020,1
768,"I have a cousin that’s in an organized club sport. Recently I’ve heard/seen some disturbing things that involve the club and its members about underage drug abuse, alcohol abuse, drunk driving, and even rape. It’s a coed club with members from 12 years old to late twenties. I’m extremely worried for my friend, I’ve talked to their parents and they don’t seem to care. I want to go to the police but it’s a small town and some of the cops have kids on the club. My cousin is 13, and they have confirmed the peer pressure to make younger members drink. I’m in fear of my cousin’s safety, what can I do?",07Jul2020,1
769,"Me and my best friend has known each other since the fifth grade. We are both 19 now and we went to high school together and we’ve been together almost every day since the fifth grade. He’s the type of guy that I trust with my life and tell him everything no matter how personal it is. 

Anyways. Ever since we were young he has always had connections with bad people since he grew up in a very problematic area in our city. He himself started getting into a lot of trouble when we were younger and when his parents started noticing they moved to a better neighborhood. He calmed down for a bit but everywhere we went he would always be drawn to the wrong people. He always made good friends with drug dealers, gang members, etc and they would always respect him for some reason even though he was never involved in any illegal activity. But almost all throughout high school he would be the center of attention among all groups that he would hang around and even the worst of the worst would give him a lot of respect for some wired reason. 

However. Recently some of his friends ended up in a very serious altercation with one of the biggest and most dangerous gangs in our city and my friend were almost involved because he knew almost everything about the altercation and knew people from both sides of the “beef”. Luckily he were never involved and managed to avoid any heat. But he still has a lot of “bad” friends and I feel like if he continues to hang out with them he is sooner or later going to end up in some serious trouble. What alarmed me the most was one time when we were in McDonald’s together with our group of friends and we met some people that were involved in the altercation and they took him to the side to speak to him. These people were not his friends nor did they know him very well. I have no idea what they talked about but after they spoke to him he just came back to our friend group and sat down with us like it was normal and nothing had happened. He didn’t even seem slightly concerned that a bunch of hardcore gangbangers took him to the side to speak about an altercation that he is not even involved in. 

I’ve tried talking to him several times but he always responds with “naaaah I ain’t gonna get involved in nothing. I know these people it’s calm”. 

He’s an extremely smart guy and it’s scary how good he can read people. In high school he almost had straight A’s even though he never studied at home. It was kind of like he already knew how to get an A in some subjects before we even got assignments. Sometimes he can take on look at a person and based off of how he or she dresses, talks and carry themselves, he will be able to tell what type of person it is. 

I remember one time we played the game mafia at a party with some people we didn’t even know and in the first round he could already tell who the killers were and explain their whole thought process based on the first victim. 

We’re going off to university now and it would be such a shame for a guy this smart to waste his whole life because of some stupid lowlifes. What should I do to make him back away from those people?",07Jul2020,1

775,"Hi all. A few weeks ago my (23f) fiance (23m) went to visit his family for a weekend. His aunt, who I had met one other time, was there. She has been very generous (she paid for us to fly up there to visit), but is very opinionated and a few things she had said in the past have rubbed me the wrong way (i.e. I was stealing my fiance away from his family, which simply isn't the case). 

Anyway, when I informed her that my fiance and I discussed him changing his last name to mine when we get married, she freaked out and said I was essentially telling him to give up his heritage and who he is as a person. She said some very hurtful things to me. (For more detail, see my post history.) I told my fiance, who was not there for the conversation, and he agreed that I was owed an apology. However, he didn't say anything to her about it and things have been quiet since, despite my trying to bring it up.

Yesterday, she ca my fiance and offered to pay 2 months of our rent, as my fiance has lost his job recently. I feel somewhat conflicted about this because I still haven't gotten an apology. I can't tell if this is a way for her to apologize with apologizing, or if she is trying to patch things up with him so he'll reconsider the name change, or if it's just a gift.

Name: Kodak

Race: Human

Age: Around his twenties

Job: Outlander

Background:
Kodak is a well-known wizard in his village for his superior talent and knowledge for it. Brimming with confidence, he tried his luck to the city but instead he faced the grim reality that he both had no talent and money for more academic pursuit of magic. He then made a deal with a night hag, to increase his magic power. The hag told him that it would cost a thing that allows tears, a thing that allows fears and thing that can't be seen. Knowing magic is all he has and there simply is nothing left to lose. He exchanged it not knowing what it is in the first place. With it, he got the Eyes of the World. Even then, using the eyes shortens his life expectancy. Realizing he has been had, he shouted to the witch with all he had. While the witch was cackling, everything seemingly stopped. Kodak then looked around, it seemed that he was transported into a different space altogether. He woke up in a foreign bed albeit a comfortable one, woke up with newly prepared breakfast on the nearby table and saw an unfamiliar face. Kodak asked if he was captured, bombarding the stranger with many questions yet Kodak was forced to stop when suddenly his head writhed with pain. He now remembers. He knows this place, he SHOULD know this place. But... He can't. Kodak ponders a bit more, no but he doesn't... He then got transported into a barren wasteland, on the ground full of clustered pieces of junk. Kodak tried to push himself up, now seeing his own body, riddled with scars and recent gun wounds. He shouted in pain once more. Then all of a sudden, he finally answered what exactly is going on. The hag took... His memory. He can only remember how many times it happened but other than that, he forgets everything that happens after the accident. Kodak then wandered the wasteland a bit more. On the pile of rubble, he got a seemingly magic book. And then it happened again. Now it seems like he was now transported into a mountain. But now, he still has the book. It turns out past him has now been writing the stuff that happened before that moment. It turns out, Kodak has instead been training his body, on how to wield a dagger, on how to steal and how to run. Kodak then wielded the dagger he found on his clothes and it seems like his body at least retains muscle memory. With his newly found hope, Kodak started adventuring.

Personality: Kodak is a bit aloof and weird. He writes any significant thing he experiences on his book.

Inventory: 
1.) Devil's Account: A notebook that chooses it's user and a notebook that's seemingly blank. But when used by the user, can display the specific information written by the user himself instantly. The notebook can list down spells and scrolls but in the form of a ritual. Int is the spell casting ability.
2.) Thief set - a cloak and dual daggers that has 2d4 piercing
3.) ??? - An item of foreign material that's inscribed with: ""Don't forget.""

Skills:
Eyes of The World: Activating the eye is a bonus action and can stop time for 1d4 turns. In that turn, all magic or magic items used to attack has a +10 and an automatic critical hit (if weapon) on the target used on them. Because of these eyes, Kodak can lose memory seemingly at random intervals (Dm supervision) even without activating them. Every turn this is used takes the age of Kodak. 4 turns is equal to 8 years of his life expectancy. After using this, Kodak is rendered unconscious for the day.

Eyes of the World: Affects the people on Kodak's field of vision by 3d12 necrotic damage.


As you can probably guess, the rp is based with some D&amp;D aspects but very limited in that regard. This character... is the first one I thoroughly enjoyed. I'm still new into this roleplay thing and I have only made 3 characters. Each session was so amazing that it's safe to say that those days have been the best times I've ever had since quarantine started. How Kodak interacted with the world starting off into this bumbling mad man with humor then turning him into someone who can face his problems head on is just so emotionally investing for me. Each character in the rp is now facing each of the big bad or at least coming into terms with the things in their past. But there's still so many unanswered things in Kodak's backstory. I tried writing it but it just doesn't feel... Good? Every single backstory I write feels so bland and repetitive. If not, feels too unnatural and is just text dump. The rp is postponed in the meantime so I have more time to think but yeah.",07Jul2020,1
778,"TL;DR: my brother has anger management issues when it comes to playing video games and I’m not sure how to calm him down at this point. 

As I type this post, my &lt;10 year old brother is slamming my keyboard because of an inability to get into a full multiplayer lobby. He has also lashed out at me for asking him to calm down.  This has been going on for a few months now, and it’s come to the point where I’m just scared of intervening out of fearing he may lash out or that I may lose my own patience. 

He is generally a mature kid for his age and we get along well often, but it is during these games he seems like an entirely different person to me. A few times I’ve asked my parents to talk to him about it, and later, once they’re out of range, he’d wail at a pitch so anguishing once he found out I told our parents.  

As to what games he plays, he plays some competitive games on Minecraft and others like Valorant and League of Legends, but he’s also capable of lashing out at even casual games whenever inconveniences come his way, like poor internet connection. The worst of it is probably in teamwork-intensive matches. He’s willing to blame other teammates, even when I’m among them for failures and is overall in poor team spirit. 

At this point I’m not sure what I should do or how I am supposed to approach him. I understand anger is a natural occurrence for anyone, but the frequency at which these episodes happen and the level of anger he displays has become too much.

782,"
I’m 14F (sophomore in high school) and he’s 18M (sophomore in college). I like him a lot and I know I’m the most stupidest person for liking him. I’ve also never met irl. 

It started when I requested to follow him from a senior’s post. He accepted my request after 2 weeks and also followed me back. I slowly developed a crush on him and I confessed. But, he immediately blocked me. I later made an alt and lied saying my friend dared me. He unblocked me after 2 days. I then got invited to a conference he had attended during his junior year. I asked him if I could ask him a few questions about the conference and he agreed. But I ended up asking him too many questions so he asked me to stop dming him. I later asked him to block me and that happened in March. And he still hasn’t unblocked me. I know I’m a horrible person for liking him and I also basically harassed him. 

Idk why I like him so much. I’ve never felt like this before. I know it’s not love. It’s probably infatuation or I’m just obsessed with him. He doesn’t feel like a crush at all. He’s my first big crush and this is the first time I’ve dreamt about a crush. Usually moving on isn’t this hard for me. But, this time it’s so hard to move on. I’ve been trying to move on since the past 3 months. 

I also thought a few times that I should contact him again when I’m 18 and I should ask him out. But, yesterday I realized that I’m so stupid. He would never like me and he would never feel the same way about me even when I become an adult bc for him I would still be a immature person who is 4 years younger than him. 

And plus he probably hates me bc I’m a horrible person who basically harassed him. Idk what to do anymore and he probably doesn’t even remember me anymore.",07Jul2020,1
783,"So I go to college, and there I made a lot of new friends. I didn’t have a spam Instagram account/finsta until one of my friends suggested I make one, and I said, oh! Why not? So I did. 
One of my other friends, A, made a finsta in fall 2019 but deleted it because of some drama that one of my relatives (who is my neighbor back home and also attends the same college) kind of started. I was following that first spam account with my main account. 
A couple months later she made another one, and again, I requested to follow it with my main account, and she accepted. I had been liking every post and commenting on a couple. She also added me to her private Snapchat story, so I thought we were good friends. 

A couple weeks after that, though, my relative requested to follow her and she did not accept. I was still following her though. However, today I checked and I think she either removed me as a follower or blocked me; I tried searching her account but couldn’t find it. I know this happened because I couldn’t see her spam with my main account (it wouldn’t appear if I searched it up), but if I searched it up with my spam account it shows up so I know the account is still there.

Would I be stepping over the line if I asked her why she took me off or if I did anything wrong? I don’t sense any tension or anything when she texts me; this was just so random and I am unsure if I did anything wrong or we’re just not as good friends as I think we are???

785,How can I increase the size of my penis without surgery or any devices,07Jul2020,1
786,"This is going to be a bit long, so TL;DR at the bottom 


Backstory: I (15 F) have been best friends with this girl “Emily” (16 F) for around 6 years. Our parents quickly became friends since they had a lot of similar interests, so Emily became my go to female friend. I’ve always had a hard time making friends with other girls, so my friendship with Emily has been really important to me, especially since we have similar personalities and like a lot of the same things. Basically we’ve just always gotten along really well. Over the past few years, we’ve grown up together and continued to make new friends throughout middle school and high school. 


The only problem i’ve ever had with Emily was her tendency to lie about stupid, little things. These lies were mostly just about her having older brothers which she didn’t have, or her doing something she didn’t actually do. Just all things that I knew to be lies because of my relationship with her parents. I’d always try and call her out on them whenever i could, but I didn’t think much of it since so many people I know lie about silly things like that, especially around our age. I figured she’d just grow out of it when she got a little more mature, but boy was I wrong. 


Here’s where the story starts: Me and Emily hadn’t spoken in about two months since school was canceled because of COVID. We’d only talked a little bit about her regretting her decision to break up with her ex-boyfriend, but other than that there hadn’t been much contact. Then, about 4 weeks ago I got a call from her. It started off with just normal small talk, but after a few minutes Emily said she had to talk to me about something important. I asked her what was up and her response was just “I’m pregnant” 


Now, you can probably imagine how surprised I was when my best friend calls me for the first time after 2 months of nearly no contact and tells me she’s pregnant. I was shocked to say the least. 


She then proceeded to tell me this story about how she had started to talk to this boy named Matthew 
(16 M ?) who she’d known for a while from various social events. Apparently, they had started talking, then Emily had to go to the hospital to have surgery because of her celiacs disease (she does actually have celiacs disease, that part isn’t a lie) and that she had developed “stage 5 cancer” because of it (??) and while she was in the hospital Matthew started coming around to check on her and socialize with her family. She then told me that her surgery had gone wrong and she ended up going into a coma for a week, and that the doctors hadn’t hooked her up to any type of life sustaining equipment, so she pretty much didn’t get food or water for an entire week (????) then when she woke up her heart stopped a few times and she had to be revived on multiple instances. 


The day after her heart had apparently stopped several times, the doctors sent her on her marry way, after conveniently having her also go through a plastic surgery to get rid of all of her scars and wounds from the surgeries. Then when her family went back for a follow up doctors visit, her mom had apparently arranged to send her off to Russia to be studied for how she somehow survived being in a coma with no nutrients for a whole week. But for some reason Matthew was also there, and he took the “Russia Contract” ripped it up, and then convinced Emily’a mom not to send her away. 


That night Matthew and Emily were left alone at Emily’s house, where they had unprotected sex. Then, only a few days later at another doctors visit it was revealed that Emily was pregnant. Because Matthew had gotten a girl pregnant, his mother kicked him out of their house. He then was apparently allowed to move into Emily’s house and live with her, and he was staying in her own room no less. The last thing she told me was that she wasn’t supposed to be talking to anyone about this, so I couldn’t let her family know that I knew about the pregnancy or Matthew because they didn’t want people to know, and how if i ever saw them they’d be acting normal as if she wasn’t pregnant. 


Jesus I cringed so hard typing that all out. Anyway cut back to us on the phone call. 


I was extremely surprised, doubtful, and just completely bewildered by everything Emily had just told me. I had many doubts, but I didn’t think that one of my closest friends would lie to me about something this extreme, and that she just explained some of the things that had happened in a weird way. We talked on the phone for a while after about everything. She told me about Matthew, and how he was pretty much the most perfect guy in the world. She told me all about his life and his younger sister with down syndrome, his best friend, his family, his job, a lot of stuff. 


I started to talk more with one of me and Emily’s mutual friends “Bill” (16 M) about everything going on since Emily had also told him about everything. We basically just talked about what was going to happen and how it was all going to work blah blah blah. Emily had also been talking about this to another mutual friend of ours “Amy” (14 F) but i didn’t talk to her about it until later.   


At this point, Emily had shown me some pictures of this Matthew guy, and I knew I recognized him from somewhere but I couldn’t figure out where. Later that day I went over to her house for a sleepover, and to my not-so-surprise-but-also-surprise, there was no sign of another person living in their house anywhere, and Emily had no pictures whatsoever of the two of them together on her phone. Later on in the night Emily told me that she had gone in for an ultrasound, and found out she was having twins. As soon as she said that I was about 95% sure she was full of shit. At that point in time she would’ve been only 3 weeks pregnant. There’s no way she would’ve been able to go in and know she was having twins at that point. 
I realized that her whole surgery and cancer spiel was also a lie when Emily’s mother started talking about how *she* had just been in the hospital having surgery, and conveniently didn’t mention anything about Emily having any type of medical issues recently. Emily also had no physical signs is surgery what so ever. 


The next day I voiced my concerns to Bill, who had also been having doubts for the same reasons. We talked a lot about how we could know for sure and stuff, and my main thing was trying to figure out who the guy in the pictures was. I’d reverse image searched every picture of him she’d sent me, but non of them had results. Then, just last night I stumbled across Emily’s TikTok account, and her first post was a photo montage of pictures of Matthew. There were some in there that she hadn’t sent me, so I screenshoted them and reverse image searched them. This time I got results. 


The pictures she’s been sending me of Matthew, are all pictures of Matty Braps from his instagram. She didn’t even make up a new first name for him, just took pictures right off of a celebrity’s instagram page and told us that he was her boyfriend. She even told us that Matthew had a little sister who had down syndrome, just like Matty Braps. I was, and still am, so excruciatingly angry with her. I immediately told both Amy and Bill since they were the other people Emily had been lying to, and they’re both just as furious as me. We all feel extremely betrayed, emotionally manipulated, and very hurt that Emily lied to us like this, and that she thought we were stupid enough to not realize who her imaginary boyfriend actually is.


Emily had also been doing this weird thing where every single time I told her something about something that happened with me and my own boyfriend, she always had a strangely similar story regarding something with Matthew that was bigger and better in every way. Like she was trying to one up me in everything relationship wise while also insulting my boyfriend in various, indirect ways. 


For the last few hours me, Bill and Amy have been trying to figure out how exactly we should approach this and how to confront her in an effective way. I don’t know whether I should go straight to her mother, or try and confront her myself, or if we should all confront her together, we just dont know. Emily is supposed to come over to my house today for an early birthday sleepover, and i’d feel really bad about ruining our birthday hangout with this, but I dont know what to do. 


(I feel like it’s worth putting here that a few other things Emily has lied about this past month are; having amnesia, getting in a car accident, coughing up blood and going back to the hospital, her parents being abusive, imaginary Matthew getting in fights with everyone who offends her in any way shape or form, having older brothers, Matthew having brain damage, Matthew somehow renting a car at 16 to drive to see his brother in Wyoming, Matthew having already graduated high school and having an associates degree at 16, how Emily isn’t going to survive child birth because she has cancer, Emily having cancer, Matthew making 100$ a day caretaking for an old man, all of her siblings and family loving Matthew, and everything else regarding Matthew)

789,"So this really started in about sixth grade. One of our teachers brought in her daughter for take your kid to work day and she spent the whole day with our class. I got to know her a little and can’t lie I got a little bit of a crush on her. In 7th grade her mom decided to let her come to our school. And me and her became somewhat closer and we’re good friends throughout middle school. I liked her the whole time, and that never really changed throughout middle school. When we got into high school I started dating this girl, and my best girl friend (Fran) happened to become like best friends with this girl. Long story short me and Fran started talking during this relationship and Fran wanted me to be with her, and honestly I wanted to be with her too. But back then I was dumb and just wanted to be with someone for sure. So me and the girl did happen to breakup. And I ended up dating Fran... for a day. I broke up with her to get back with my 9th grade girlfriend. Pretty messed up, but I never stopped liking Fran. In 10th grade I started dating another girl who was a grade about me, we were pretty awkward in the beginning and I was talking to Fran at the same time. And honestly I wanted Fran more, throughout the whole ordeal but everyone was pointing me in the direction of the girl I ended up dating. It was hard because me and this girl dated... but she acted like she was nothing more than a friend. She was scared to kiss me, scared to talk to me, and it was overall just a terrible, and miserable 9 month relationship. So that year was a total BUST. So fast forward to 11th grade year... oh man was this bad. I dated this foreign exchange student from turkey. And she happened to be perfect for me. We were perfect for each other and a lot of “firsts” happened. Problem is she hated Fran. Hated her. I couldn’t even look in Fran’s direction without getting bombarded with questions. And I hated it. Me and this girl ended up getting in a lot of fights and I ended up cheating on her. Not the best decision of my life, it ruined me for a little. But I started talking to this girl I cheated with. And she was SO jealous over me and Fran being friends. Kind of a reoccurring theme here if you haven’t noticed. So me and this girl never did end up dating, but we were a thing for a WHILEEE. I ended up going to homecoming with Fran and we were both in a broken state at that point. So me and the girl stopped talking. Now senior year. I openly stated many times that I was in love with Fran. And honestly Fran has shown so many flashes of liking me, or at least I thought. And this summer we had a small get together after graduation and we all got drunk and stuff. Me and Fran were sitting down and I just asked her straight up “ why have we never kissed “, she says “ you never seemed like you wanted to “. This broke my heart. It really did. Because I love Fran, more than I can ever admit to anyone. More than I could ever tell her. I need some advice on what I should do. She leaves the state in less than a month for college. And I can’t start anything with her. But I feel like I have to do something. Or else I’ll regret everything forever. What should I do?",07Jul2020,1

794,"I might be overthinking this but I am basically the master of ill-timed ideas! 

I have been working from home since mid-March. My immediate team of 10 have been catching up at least once a day over video calls which has been nice but lately the conversation has become a little bit stale. So around 2 weeks ago, **I decided to try boost team morale and suggest an online activity like an escape room game**. I did a poll and 9 of 10 said yeah let's do it.

Then later that week, our company announces that they will be making redundancies of up to 10% of workforce (of about 100 staff members). It's a 6-week long process so I thought I'm sure many will still be up for this. So I set up a date for our gaming night for tomorrow.

Aaaand surprise surprise, we get an email from management today to say by **tomorrow those who will be assessed for redundancy will get a call**. Now I know I'm safe as I've been told my role is still required so I'm not worried about getting any calls soon. But starting to get worried maybe a few of the guys in my team might do. 

**Should I go ahead and cancel the games night?** Many people have said yes already but also worried they might get a call tomorrow while we're playing our game. I say games night it's actually late afternoon (5pm) so things could get a little awkward if someone gets a call in the middle of it.",07Jul2020,1

798,"For context, I'm a 27M living in the UK, working in tech and I've been single since Oct 2017, where I had to break off a wedding engagement. It was messy but we are friends now. She wanted kids much earlier than I was ready for (We were not AT ALL financially ready to support a child)

I've had since then to be single and develop myself. To be happy on my own and honestly, at moments where I am doing my own thing (walking, playing games, joking with friends on discord, reading, writing), I feel like I've become addicted to this lifestyle and I find it more enjoyable than chasing women (coming up to the year mark since I last knocked boots) or trying to develop any sort of direction towards having a family of my own. I don't love or hate children, but I am not at all broody. 

To top that off, my one brother, 10 years my senior, has 3 children with his wife and lives on the other side of the planet. My mum used to project my future with a ""Oh you'll come around and want kids"", but since my brother now has 3, she doesn't ask about it anymore. I am for all intents and purposes, free to not have a family with no repercussions if I choose to do that. 

I guess my main worry is that I am tired of women now. I've dated a few times and none of them have really made me feel any kind of spark. The date just feels boring and I really try to make it interesting. Maybe I'm just not as good at picking women than I thought I was. But It's disheartened me from trying anymore. I know that if I give up entirely in this endeavour, then the ""family"" door will close for good and... Idk, I'm worried I'm going to regret it?

My problem is that my mum and brother keep ordering take out such as fish and chips, Turkish Kebab etc. 4/7 times a week to feed me and I find it disgusting. Occasionally they cook a steak or some seafood but only with rice or a soup as a side and I’m sick of just meat and no veg of any sort.  I do not starve myself as I do eat it but I feel grossed out and oily afterwards. I cannot cook and if I could, i don’t have the ingredients to make a decent meal for myself that isn’t frozen. When my mother asks for dinner she always says the same thing eg “Pizza, Chips, Burger” and i always say no to all of those options implying I want to eat something else but she does not listen and makes me feel ungrateful (am I?).

801,"F(22) I've been working in the restaurant industry for the past 7 years. Doing this for a long amount of time has really taken a toll on me mentally and physically. The constant high stress has increased my anxiety and depression I already struggle with. I have a reoccuring lower back muscle spasm that I keep having to go to physical therapy for because I'm over exerting myself at work. I've been applying to many different places to hopefully find a different more enjoyable job I actually find rewarding while I'm going to school full time. 

Fast forward to last week I get a message on Indeed from a veterinary clinic for a receptionist position I applied to inviting me to do a phone interview. We set up a time and day and when it rolls around to that time I recieve no phone call. I give it 10 minutes only to be told the main practice manager had to leave for a family emergency and they take my info down and tell me they will relay the message. 3 days go by..nothing. I call them back. Receptionist tells me practice manager is still out but will again relay the message. She also says I didn't hear this from her but that I'm the only potential candidate she's seen. I also send an email through Indeed letting practice manager know I'm sending my best wishes for whatever she may be going through. 

4 days go by, I recieve a call from the practice manager apologizing for the delay, she informs me her sister has been told she has terminal brain cancer and it's been really rough for her. I tell her I completely understand and that I'm sorry she's having to go through that. She invites me to an in person interview which would now be last Friday.

I come in for the interview 10 mins early and fill out a bit of paperwork. Practice manager calls me back and we have a 2 hour interview that goes extremely well. The main vet was there and he chimes in on our conversation and looks at her as he's exiting the room and gives me a thumbs up. Practice manager seems really impressed and gives me a full tour of the vicinity and at the end tells me she would like to set up a trial day to see if we both think this will be a good fit. She tells me not to worry if I don't hear back in a day or so. 

Fast forward to the present. We're now on Tuesday and I haven't received any phone call or message. They were closed for the Fourth of July and I didn't hear anything on Sunday. I called yesterday afternoon just to touch base and the receptionist informed me practice manager was in and out yesterday morning but that she'd transfer me over to her voicemail so that I could leave a message. I leave a voicemail saying my phone's having connection issues (which it actually really was) and that I was just checking in to make sure I didn't miss her call and that I still am very interested in the position. I leave my call back number and tell her I had a great time speaking with her this past Friday. This was yesterday. I still haven't heard anything. 

Am I overthinking this? It definitely seems like I 90% got the job, they even took down their job posting. I just don't get why they haven't called me yet. I understand she's having family issues but it's definitely been more than a day waiting for a call back. My family says I have the job and that they'll call me so I shouldn't worry. I'm really stressing about this because it's so close to my apartment and everything I want in a job right now. Currently I drive 45 mins each way to a job I hate. I've been trying to be proactive and am still applying to other places but I really have my heart set on this job.

First off obvious throwaway as I imagine most people here have. Im not sure if this is the right subreddit for this but yeah if its not im sorry and I would appreciate it if you can point me to the right one. :)

I have never really had really good friends I have known for a while IRL so I always went online for it.

I have had a friend for about 7 months now and we have chatted and talked ALL THE TIME or even played video games together.

We considered each other best friends and shared a lot. There was a lot of effort put by both of us I would assume.

But now they met someone else and for the last month or so I have been feeling compleately down by the fact that they started to ""ignore"" me or put a lot less efforts into talking with me and shifted them to that other person.

I have tried talking with them pretty vaguely but they assure me that person doesn't matter to them but day by day I see that's not true.

I am indeed pretty over protective of friends to be honest (clingy ? god i hate that word) because of my past friends going away for a lot of stupid reasons.

I don't know if Im just being too paranoid or what but still it feels like all of the efforts I put were for nothing and I actually cried over it quite a lot.  
I can't imagine losing this friend or even stopping to talk with them. Its just insane.

So in the end what should I do about it ? Have you even been replaced by a best friend ?  
Im not even sure if the problem is in me. Just need some feedback to be honest.",07Jul2020,1
809,"I work at a small diner/ice cream parlor. It is in a small town and as of right now we only have four employees, besides the two who run the business. The ones who own and run this restaurant are an old couple about 70 who do not work here besides ordering what we need and paying us. Because this place is so small we only ever have two people working at a time. 

We have stayed open during this whole pandemic. We haven't been closed even one day. We have all done our part to run this place the safest way possible and due to us being one of the only places open, the business has really succeeded. The owners gave everyone a raise as well. 

Two of the employees who work here are the granddaughters of the owners. They just went on vacation in the mountains last week and are back to work. I have a vacation scheduled for the week of July 19th but when I came into work today I noticed I'm taken off the schedule for three whole weeks. Apparently the owners decided to quarantine me after I get back but they did not quarantine their granddaughters. I feel this is unfair because I do not plan on being unsafe on vacation. I am not going to a hotspot beach, we are not flying, and our plans only consist of sitting on the beach and getting take out because most places there are still take out/eat outside only. I am also going with my family, who I live with but the granddaughters stayed with friends who they do not. It was a group of 9 when mine will only be 4.

819,"So I am a 19 year old bloke and Immigrated to England when I was 11 almost 12 so lived here for 8 years now. I’ve been trying to learn English and pronounce words and build sentences, slowly getting to perfecting my English.

I think I’ve gotten pretty far (to the point where most English people can’t tell that I’m foreign because I have an English accent) but at times especially when I feel emotionally excited (for example anxious or overly shaky due to a stressful situation) I start to stutter/ mumble my words and when I try to slow down with my speaking I end up pronouncing words with an accent.

This is an ongoing problem for me because I want to be speaking at the speed that I WANT to speak, not having to slow down and I feel like if I will be able to do that then I will be able to live my life the way I want to live. This concerns me because it’s not rare that I decide to not say something when I want to say it simply because I’m scared that I might stutter or start mumbling words. My stutter is a weird type of stutter aswell, I tend to make a short noise on the first word of the sentence and then it’s like I can’t make another sound, almost like my throat is blocked and because of this I instantly get anxious which makes things worse and I try to speak faster which leads to me going in circles.

I was thinking that this is probably a psychological problem for me because I had a hard time at school in England. I didn’t speak any English at all years ago and my deepest fear for me was someone speaking to me and me not being able to understand it, I avoided conversations at all costs and developed a deep hatred for school, got a good amount of anxiety and got depressed.

Now of course I feel a lot better and feel like I came a long way, but not far enough. I can now speak to people and none of them can even tell that I spoke no English half a decade ago but at this point in my life I need to “complete and polish” my speaking skills as I am going to university this September and in there I want to achieve my deepest personal goals that I had developed over the time that I was alone and isolated from everyone. This is one of the most important things for me.

If anybody here could give me advice on how to deal with speaking anxiety, stuttering, pronunciation (even any good online sources I could use) and help on how to stop thinking of what I’m going to sound like when I speak so I can focus on actual speaking would be greatly appreciated.",07Jul2020,1

822,"A couple days ago one of my closest coworker friends confided in me that she thinks that she has covid because she has pretty much every symptom possible. I asked her if she was going to get tested or tell our boss (we only work in person right now 3 days a week but we interact lightly with the public when we do) and she said no because she doesn't work again until Wednesday so it's probably fine. I'm of the belief that for the past 2 weeks she could have been carrying it around and the people she was in contact with have a right to know if she has it. 

Many of my family members are now telling me that it's now my responsibility to urge her to do the right thing, get tested and tell our boss that she may have been contagious the past 2 weeks...even though I felt like my line of questioning obviously let her know what I think she should do. We are good friends as far as coworkers go and I really don't want to ruin that friendship at all however I take covid extremely seriously and don't disagree that maybe I should keep on her about the things I think are right...

823,"I (F 20) am friends with this person (Also 20) I met through an online game and I really care for them. However, things have happened in the last couple of days that have made them show a side that I haven’t seen before. The quick gist of it is that they are afraid to show their true selves in front of others because they believe that it would be better if they didn’t care about the things happening around them. They want to not care so as to not get hurt by the things going on. They want to go back to who they were before they met me. They want to pretend to be okay with everything and just pretend to not care so that they won’t have to be involved with others' lives. They don’t want to be themselves because when they are themselves, they get jealous, angry, and annoyed over things that they believe they shouldn’t be (Which I think is a normal part of being human). I have told them I like them the way they are now and not for who they pretended to be. However, I can’t get through to them with just by talking I need facts and examples of the sorts to help them understand that being themselves is a million times better than pretending that everything is okay.So could y’all give me some advice on how I should go about this situation and link some good studies/reads to help them understand that they can let people in their lives that truly care about them and still be happy.",07Jul2020,1

I'm someone who's been diagnosed with severe anxiety and depression just 2 years ago (M 18) it had been hell for me back then its been more so right now. Everytime I look at any social media i get bummed out seeing all the political events in america and in my own country, the disease has stopped me from visiting places i visit for relaxation as well as my therapy with my psychiatrist.

Its been extremely rough on all of us im sure... i usually solve my worries with video games, movies and food. But when i dont have access to those things i start to worry and worry and so on, especially since the recent events in my country has worried me too much to not ignore it. 

My country has done little to do something about the virus, it was a suprise to me how little it had done, they had never prioritized it and they were caring more about naming the capital's airport and the banning of one of the national tv channels rather than mass test people. Not only that but they have introduced a bill that allows them to arrest anyone as they see fit under the guise of ""anti-terrorism"" . 

Im worried, for myself, my family and my future, I've just been accepted into a good school and my family has been supporting me ever since i dropped out, everthinf has been going downhill for me eversince i started to better myself, how do you stop worrying about something that is a danger to yourself and to those you care for?",07Jul2020,1

828,"I hate every single aspect of my body and don't feel comfortable in most things.  So, for the most part, I wear really baggy t-shirts (like size xxl) and jeans.  I hate the feeling of clothes being tight on my body.  I also really hate sweating.  I only want to wear jeans or pants made of cotton because they absorb the sweat.  I have a painful bladder condition called interstitial cystitis, so if I sweat a lot, I get a pain flare-up that makes me lose the ability to control my bladder.

My boobs are double to trouble - D.  I hate them with a passion.  I hate the sweat, back pain, and sagginess of them.  Most bras are really uncomfortable for me.  I have tried brands that people swear by.  I have been fitted for my bra size multiple times to make sure I'm wearing the right size.  But I can't wear any of them uncomfortably, and I have wasted so much money trying to find things that work.  I also hate sweating on the band and having to wear a wet bra all day.  So, I just don't wear a bra if I don't have to because I don't know what else to do.

Growing up, my mother was extremely abusive and strict.  I once got a haircut without her permission and was punished in insane ways for it.  She demanded that I keep my hair long, like hers.  She chose the clothes I was supposed to wear.  She wanted me to look like how she wanted me to be.

When I went to college, I basically spent 3-4 hours a day every day exercising and lost weight.  I felt the best about my body that I had ever felt in my life.  I felt like I had the ability to wear what I wanted, and I could cut and dye my hair.  I wore makeup and feminine outfits.  I definitely looked my best when I first met my now-husband.

But, I'm about to be 30 and my body is different now.  I have been putting on weight and I've been trying and trying to compensate with changing my diet and exercise, and nothing is working.  I have been spiraling into a deep depression.  I can tell that my husband isn't as attracted to me anymore.  So, I have no will to take care of myself anymore.  When I try to dress up and take care of myself, I just hate how everything looks on me.  So, I take it off and put on a really baggy shirt and jeans, like I wear every single day.

When I look in the mirror, I look like my mother and my grandmother.  My grandmother is mentally crazy, very overweight, and she sometimes loses control of her bodily functions in public and isn't even phased by it.  I feel like I'm gross and I'm just like her.  My mother is also mentally insane and she constantly takes weird selfies on Facebook, but her hair is disheveled and she actually looks creepy in these photos.  All I see when I look at myself is my mother and grandmother.  Even when I am wearing full makeup and trying to dress nice, I feel like I look like a dressed up pig.  I feel ashamed and embarrassed for trying to look nice when I am so obviously hideous.  It feels like it is just wrong...like putting on lipstick is this last resort effort I'm trying to do, and it just looks desperate.  So, I stopped trying to take care of myself.

Whenever I talk to my husband about my body issues, he just says I'm healthy and if I want to change myself, that I can do that.  It just makes me feel like he isn't actually attracted to me, and he's just saying it in a ""nice"" way.  It makes me feel so much worse about myself.  Like, all my crazy thoughts are true...that I actually AM really hideous.

830,"Hi,

I agreed to let a friend stay in my place for a couple months rent-free because I was away. While I'm still paying rent in the place my friend is now staying in, I'm not paying rent where I am now, and my hosts here are paying all /my/ living expenses, so I decided to pay it forward. I'm not paying for anything else and my rent is pretty cheap, so I can afford to be paying it, and I would be paying it whether she lived there or not. (Moved unexpectedly due to COVID. Everything in this situation is due to COVID). 

I want to come back  to my apartment (again, somewhat unexpectedly) because my current living situation is becoming untenable. But our apartment is small. 

If there is not room for both of us, and I need somewhere to be, what is the reasonable solution? I obviously will give my friend notice if she has to move out, but I'm paying rent on my apartment and I feel like I should get first priority to live there. If I can't go back because she's there I want to ask for help on the rent.

Thoughts? What is the non-asshole way to deal with this? I've been saying IDK what the situation would be in the future but she could certainly stay while I was gone the whole time. But now I feel I would like to be back, and I'm not sure what's reasonable.

Also- she is staying in my room, and there is another open room in the house right now. If it stays open, is it reasonable to ask her to move? My room is nicer but again I feel like this is reasonable because it's my room.

also, yes, I know this situation was very poorly planned- everyone's plans are constantly changing due to COVID. I would never be in a situation like this if there wasn't a global pandemic. 

tl;dr how do I handle logistics of rooming situation with good friend?",07Jul2020,1

832,"I did a post about my grandfather the other day, but this was all going on before all of the porn stuff... To start off, I'll say that my grandfather is loved my many people in my town and is known as a very loving church-going guy. He loves hugs and giving people kisses on the cheek. When I was younger, he would always smack me on the butt. Despite me telling him I don't like that, he continued for a long while. I don't like him touching me at ALL either. The problem is, I don't have any reason for this really. Him crossing boundaries about the butt smacking thing wouldn't make me THIS uncomfortable I don't think... I just tense up and feel almost nauseated when he tries to hug me or wants me to tell him I love him. I discussed this with my grandma and she asked if he ever ""did anything"" to me. I don't remember any of my childhood because of other trauma, so I have no idea if that's what's going on... Is there anything I can do about this or am I just stuck in this never ending loop of discomfort?

833,"Hey sorry for the long story but i gues you need a bit background.

About 6 Months ago i moved with my girlfriend, lets call her E., into an appartment which belongs to her mother. At first everthing looked pretty good. We got nearly everthing what we wanted and needed for the appartment and i supported her by buying all these things because she is still at school and it was no problem for me because i work 40 to 50 hours a week as an electrician.

Then the Shutdown came and things got a bit strange. I still worked fulltime and she was bored because she was now all day at home and had not much to do. Thirst thing i noticed was that my best friend lets call him P. was like 2 or 3 times a week at our place when i was working, not uncommon but i was a bit suspicious, but they toled me there is nothing they are just friends and he has much spare time because his company also shut down.

Things kind of got back normal at this point so i thougt everything is good and we talked like before and we always had the appointment that if there is a problem talk it out loud and we find a soloution.

One Month (the evening before my birthday) ago E confesd to me that she doesnt love me anymore and she wants me to move out. It broke my heart but okey i toled here i get my things together till friday.

The next day in i worked till 5 o´clock and as i came home E was gone and i broke up in tears, so i called my best friend P. if he could come over so i am not allone at my birthday after this.

P said that he has no time and we talk tomorrow, i was brokken and done with everthing so i called my little brother who lives about 1 1/2 hours away if he is able to come, after he got to me we got to our parents and i sleeped there because i couldn´t sleep in ""our"" Home anymore.

Next day i called my boss, because there were no nerves left for working, if i could get a few days off work. He said no problem get your things together. After this i meet P. and he toled me out off no where that he is going with E. to Finnland and starts a new life. I could not hold back and got away, my best friend that i´ve known for over 20 fucking years betraid me like i was no one.

Nearly a month later i am back at ""normal"" life and everthing is pretty hard for me. I still work and do things with other friends even drank a coffee with a nice girl i met a few days back but when i am alone i struggle with everthing. I even got 15 kg more on my hips now.

What advice you can give to get out of this? Once i was a young man who stood up for his belives.

Is there any useful information, books or something that may help?

How do get back to belive in this fucking dark world?",07Jul2020,1
834," 

Hi, even though I'm not in a relationship, I feel like I'm in a LDR. To start, I'm closeted gay (M/19) and from Canada. I like this guy (M/22) whose country I'm not going to name but my mom is from the same country. This is my second account as my guy has Reddit as well.

We been talking for 3 + months now and I know he has stronger feelings then I have for him but it's the most I felt for anyone. Its my first time experiencing this stuff as I'm only 19. I can't stop thinking of him. For some reason, I started yearning to meet him irl. I feel like I'm on a roller coaster as my feelings are up and down. Btw, I should point out that we video chat many times and were pass the point of trust issues.

I know he would be hurt if I dated someone else, but he would still respect my decisions but he said it would be very hard to move on. I would feel the same for him as well if he dated someone else. But believe it or not, he's the most happiest thing that ever happen to me which sounds like crazy talk to me. I really think of him a lot and he cares for me. I know my feelings aren't strong as his feelings are for me, but I my never meet anyone else as him. I'm a suicidal person and I don't expect a lot from the future, but ever since we started chatting I started seeing myself with goals and talking to him sometimes gives me motivation for something great in life. I already got attached to him.

At this point, I should say my parents are homophobic. My mom snooped through my phone saw our messages, the ""sweet talk"" and heart emojis and she freaked out. I told her it's part of a joke. She said that I'm too young for that and I shouldn't get too close with people and she said some homophobic stuff. I don't have a lock on my phone (that's a long story) unfortunately, so I'm just hiding the app me and my guy communicating on. As my guy is aware of the situation, we're keeping things on a crush level for now and were just enjoying each other's online company.

I don't want to kick him out of my life just because of the distance and my pessimistic thoughts. If I kick him out of my life, I feel like I'm making a mistake. I don't know if I'll ever meet anyone like him because in the course of 3 months, he made me happy. I know were not on the same page, but we both respect that. He even told my best friend that it is his first time he felt concern like this for someone (Aka me). He carved my name into a tree which touched me. Do you think I'm wasting his time for someone better then me. He's going to be 23 soon, and I feel like I'm wasting his time..he could've been cuddling someone experiencing real life love instead of this long distance thing.

Would it be wrong if I dated someone else because their closer? If I did, it would be hard because my parents are restrictive about me going out (even to meet my friends) and also the pandemic (which I totally understand for safety).  And who wants to see their partner only 2 time a month or so. Moving out is a far future move and my mom doesn't even want me to move out.

I just want to meet him so badly though. And If I were to date someone else, it would feel so wrong. I'm just having mixed feelings. Any advice??? Btw, blocking him isn't going to be my choice if anyone is going to say that. Stay safe everyone!

Thank you!!! :))))

835,"His friends are very sexiest. One is even a Trump supporter and im just fed up. I highly dislike his friends because of who they are.


** One talks non stop shit about his sister (one who pays his tuition and let's him live rent free)


 ** When one isn't around they talk shit to eachother about whoever is gone. 


** They are always ALWAYS around, my boyfriend picks them over me including go to a national park by telling me he's going to help them then I found out they went with three girls as well(I wasn't even invited). 


** I'll ask to do something and my boyfriend says no. As soon as his friends as the exact same thing, they are on it..  he spends a lot more time with his friends than me, acctually he spends NO time with me.(he will take me to the store and he will say ""that was spending time"") 


** He is always doing sneaky things with them and will always defend them but never me. 


** I've even told my boyfriend they stare at my ass when he's gone and he just won't believe me and continues to defend him. 


** (This isn't fully an issue) but they are seriously also very dumb and they tell my boyfriend stupid things all the time that he beileves. Like for example they all three think that females really don't get paid less than males...

838,"Hi, everyone I could use some advice 

A few years ago my family moved across the country from Illinois to California and due to financial reasons moved in with extended family. We just now are buying a house and we can move in next month. My family had a lot of stuff stored away in a relatives basement for the past few years that we need in our house like silverware, small furniture, clothes, WiFi routers, etc etc. There around 12 large boxes of stuff that weight 20-40 lbs.

Checking his face book and. OH what’s this? He has had girlfriends but no boyfriends. I’m getting kind of paranoid about it. Maybe I am jealous, he’s taller, slimmer, more wavy hair, and his ex’s actually go crazy when he is near them.

What do you think redit?",07Jul2020,1
840,"I don't really know where to start but my relationship with my parents has never been the best. They were never physically abusive or anything, other than I think the odd spanking or slap on the wrist that I don't really remember, but my dad in particular is unpredictible and emotionally insensitive. He goes from laughing to angry to back again in seconds and is very hard to read. Everything seems to be about him, what he wants, and how he feels. He can't seem to go more than a few days without shouting or criticising other family members over things that barely even make sense a lot of the time. He used to at least apologise to me and my brother when he shouted at us as kids but over the past few years he doesn't even do that any more. He always seems to do this in front of other family members and doesn't consider what should and shouldn't be kept private. He often uses threats to get his way and I've never felt like I could have an open discussion with him where he actually believes me and takes my feelings into account. I don't know if I'd go as far as to call him abusive because I've always been told that I'm too sensitive but I definitely don't think his behaviour has actually ever led to anything positive, even if it actually works at making other people do what he wants I lose a little trust and respect for him each time.

Anyway, I feel like I've rambled a little so I'm going to try to stick to the current situation. I'm 21 years old and just finished my degree. Until a couple of months ago I was renting a room in a house with three other students. Lectures stopped months earlier than originally planned because of the coronavirus lockdown and I didn't really have any other choice than to move back into my parents place, I actually moved in even earlier than planned at my dad's request so I ended up leaving a lot of my stuff behind. We went to retrieve it recently and to be honest it probably is an excessive amount of stuff which is completely my fault (I bought a lot of clothing and books during a mental health episode I had before I began the process of getting a diagnosis of proper treatment and organising and getting rid of things has always been a struggle for me). Being forced to move out before I had a chance to organise everything and donate some stuff meant that I'm now stuck in my tiny old bedroom with a ridiculous amount of suitcases and boxes. I have almost no storage here and barely any room to even organise things into pile so I can decide what I should and shouldn't keep. I already feel humilitated as I know it's my fault and my parents won't leave me alone about it. Honestly, I have struggled with concentration for as long as I can remember and since I suddenly moved away from my old doctors practice and it was difficult to make appointments to register for a new one during the lockdown I've been struggling to access my medication and I don't have the solid routine that I used to have with it as it got changed the last time I spoke to the nurse who normally deals with my mental health stuff. 

I also have always had a very odd sleeping pattern for some reason and it's hard for me to keep it to what most people would consider to be normal. Again, it's my problem and I feel bad about it but over the past year or two in particular it seems to have gotten to the point where I can never get a solid sleep without waking up several times and I often find myself either experiencing sleep paralysis or feeling like I'm trapped in a dream. I can't seem to get it to make sense to other people but I basically have episodes probably at least every couple of months where I end up being completely asleep but aware that I need to wake up yet can't. If I let myself sleep without alarms I end up becoming practically nocturnal after a day or two so I have to force myself to at least go for a walk each day in the morning or afternoon so that things don't end up depressing. It takes me hours to fall asleep during the night but then even with close to 8 hours of sleep I often end up taking a nap, and I tend to respond to strong feelings of sadness by falling asleep. Anyway, let's get things back on track. I can fully understand why my odd sleep schedule and the fact that I spend most of the day in my room annoys my parents and I've tried to gradually wake up earlier and go to bed later but it's just not the ideal environment to do that. I can't explain it to my parents in a way that doesn't sound like a dumb excuse but the constant noise from other people means I don't even feel comfortable sitting in my room without headphones and white noise and with my parents, my brother and his girlfriend being in and loudly watching TV or listening to music most of the time means I probably only get a full rest period from about maybe 5am to around noon depending on the day. I don't particularly know what's causing my sensitivity to sound but it's been noticed by other people since I was in primary school so it's not something new and my parents are definitely aware of it. The only possible explanation I have is that it has been suggested I might have autism but getting anyone to actually test me for it has been a struggle. My mum tries to help with my sleep schedule sometimes but she just wakes me up at inconsistent times and refuses to listen when I tell her about the things that actually affect it. She seems to believe that having a degree in Psychology means I can fix all my mental health problems through self-therapy and doesn't realise that firstly, I do that anyway as I also lost access to my counsellor and I moved, and that therapy would also probably involve me either setting more firm boundaries with my parents or getting away from their behaviour. She also has a habit of telling me she'll get me up at a certain time and not doing it. She's never been good at keeping promises. 

I find it very hard to organise my thoughts on this matter as there's kind of a lot to it but I'll try to summarise my thoughts now as I've already rambled quite a bit. Since moving back in and finishing the final year of my degree, completing assignments, writing up my dissertation and doing extra coursework to compensate for the fact that we haven't been able to complete exams I mainly just want to work on my own routine so I can at least get the time and motivation to apply for masters degrees and start counselling again. I feel like I can barely talk to my parents. My dad often criticizes me the second I walk into a room. Today he woke up from a nap and started an argument as soon as I saw I had come into the room. I actually came reasonably close to actually defending myself properly for once and told him that I'm going to move out as soon as possible anyway and that I don't feel like he wants me around. He thinks I should be able to get everything sorted in a matter of hours and said I should ask for help even though we've already discussed the fact that I never feel comfortable asking them for things because of the way that they react, and my mum always makes promises that she doesn't keep. 

The main issue I have is that my dad is threatening my pet snakes. He seems to think that it's okay to either rehome them without my permission or release them into the wild where he knows full well they won't survive. It might just be an empty threat but I want to do more to defend them since they're mine. I've had them for like 10 years and raised one from a baby. I have paid for their food and bedding even while living away from home and they're honestly healthy and fine but dad is convinced that having a bunch of suitcases in my room means that I somehow can't take care of them. What do I do if he loses his temper and puts up a post on Facebook or something to try to sell them? Would it be possible to maybe take them to a vet and get some proper paperwork for them? Could I prevent someone else from taking them even if they paid my parents for them if I could somehow prove they were being sold without owner consent?

Also, would it be entirely unreasonable to cut off contact from my parents and demand some changes if I moved out? I actually wrote down a list of boundaries recently but I've never felt able to set any so I don't really know what is and isn't reasonable. I think that at the very least dad should get some help with his own issues and recognise how he affects other people, mum should work on promises and respecting my property and routine, and the household as a whole should work on respecting boundaries when it comes to noise and basic respect. 

Thanks in advance for any advice. It was good to just get this all out and I know it's a lot to take in but even just a quick message to give advice on my main questions in the last couple of paragraphs would be greatly appreciated.",07Jul2020,1
841,"Long story but I will keep it to main details. 

I have a group of friends, we all get along well. We have never had drama/issues.   
My friends and I went out one night, and it was fun but a friend and I saw what we thought was one of the guys stealing from another guy in the group. We were shocked, but I was too drunk to confirm what happened and we left it at that. Now, fast forward weeks after, my friend tells the guy that we thought was being stolen from that we BOTH saw what happened and that our friend was stealing. Mind you, It could have been the case, but we had 0 contexts and I was too drunk to be sure that was what was happening.   


The guys talked about this and they seemed to be on good terms. Everything passed. I feel kinda terrible about this whole thing because the guy whose stuff was being stolen (still not confirmed) was sad that we didn't say something sooner. I am mad because I never wanted to be involved considering I was in no state to confirm what happened. The guys and I never talked about this (We aren't that close), but should I just tell him my side of the story and why I never wanted to bring it up (me being drunk etc). I also hate speculating. Now, everyone has solved this on their part and it is chill, will this just bring out another side that doesn't need to be said? Or am I validated to say my part?",07Jul2020,1
842,"Hello everyone. I am new to reddit, just started seeing the wonderful and actual meaningful advises people give to others in need, so I hope you can guide me as well.

Introduction:

I (21F) am a student about to give her final two papers of professional qualification, live in the GCC (Middle east), and currently work at my first job in an audit firm. The thing is that, I just started in February, pre-covid, but thankfully no layoffs have occurred so far.

I was born and raised here, my father has spent his 35-40 years of life in this country, however, despite being born here I am not a citizen but rather a resident (If I do not have an ID card I have to leave the country).

Things have been crazy all my life. My father has supported, brought up, fed, educated, and married off about a dozen of his and my mothers family members. When I mean dozen I mean dozen families, about an average of 6-7 members in each and whatnot.

He believes in this and thinks this is important as, when there is someone below us, we, as good human beings need to take care of them. However, despite doing that, he has never compromised on our life style. We have lived in luxury, in comfort and in peace since a long time. He got us all five siblings (3 older brothers and 1 little sister) good education, food, clothes, up-bringing whatnot.

However, when I was 10 years old, he got fired from his job. The employees around him ( two employees who were his best friends, who used to spent hours at our HOME, eating our food day and night without any payment, and gratitude, his children would openly take our stuff etc) got him fired because my father rejected to get involved in any unethical situation. Long story short, my father got fired, he out of anger, signed away his rights to any pension or after service benefits. We were devastated. At that time, one brother of mine, S1, was studying in the UK at a top university. Another brother, S2, was just about to join another top university in UK. Brother F3, me, and my little sister N1 were in school. S1 had to defer sessions and try to work as much as he can as a student, S2 had to leave his partial scholarship, his university offer everything, as the office refused to go ahead with the visa process. Me, F3 and N1 had to leave school for 6 months.

In this difficult time, the dozens families my father and mother fed left and abandoned us. The office employees who used to come and eat at our home day and night would turn away when they would see us on the road. So at the age of 10-11, I, promised myself to NEVER trust anyone, and that the only people truthful to one another is our direct BLOOD FAMILY, no one else (and I still believe that strongly because as I grew older I have seen that become more truthful).

After 10 years of struggle (my mom getting diagnosed with depression, my father having to restart from scratch, S1 forced to leave UK as we could not afford him being there, S2 stuck in a cheap university where his professors would literally call my mother and say ""why have you sent him here, he deserves better""), we made it out of the darkness. S1, S2 and F3 are married and F3 has a child. I have just two papers left of my professional qualification (while scoring the highest marks in almost 6 out of 10 papers in the middle east) and landing my first job as an audit trainee at a great audit firm.

However, corona virus came along and has put us in a difficult position again. My father just last week was forced retired from his job. Honestly the man has worked his entire life and we should have been happy that he can rest now but that is not the case at all.

Between the 10 years timeline, my father, with the job he had, had to education us all, again look after his family (the reason why I say his family, his mother, his sisters, his brothers, his sister's kids, his brother's kids, his brother's kids's kids and so on and on is because they never accepted my mother and us kids, they have tried to harm us all in many ways), so he has some savings but not so much. We were not able to buy a house of our own, we have lived in rented house all our lives. So the money is very short.

My little sister, N1, just graduated from high school during covid and has to join university. So the money he has left and will get as pension, will either just cover the cost of buying a house or educating my sister. 

So the main advise I need is what should I do. I earn about $733 per month if I state it in US dollars. I and my mother have very little savings of our own. Another issue is that I am not a permanent employee yet. As a expat in this country, I will become a full-time employee after 2.5 years (right now I get no insurance/health coverage from the company) due to strict laws of the GCC to hire only ""nationals"". So the security of my job is heavily dependent on the firm itself. They have been really good so far. I am assigned many audit assignments till 2021.

However, what I want to do is also earn money on the side. Can someone advise on any sort of investment I could invest in. Is it possible to purchase a low cost home/apartment/loft in any European or American country. Can someone recommend me any online/freelance jobs as well so that I can earn more.

I want to support my sister and my parents. My parents have done alot for us, I dont want them to bear this burden alone. My brothers are ""apparently"" stating they will help, however, it has been two days since my dad told us the news and my brothers have changed their behavior despite the fact that my dad had a minor surgery just today (which he also had previously and his heart stopped). So I need advise, any suggestion on what to do. I am not in a country, where, I, a female can just change the course of our lives within months. I cannot work in part-time jobs (because they wont give us any). I can't get a loan. My father has to find within 3 months another ""party"" to have our residence ID. We at the moment have insurance, but as soon as we have our residence ID with the other party, it will be gone. My mother needs to go to hospital and get medicines because of the previously stated reasons as well as due to her being diabetic, high-pressure problems and weak heart. 

Please, any advise would be helpful (even prayers if possible).

Thanks.",07Jul2020,1
843,"Hello reddit i'm just looking for advice on what to say or do here. 

My girlfriend has a complicated family situation. Her grandparents are about to sell their house to the bank and move into a nursing home, she can't stay with her biological mother because she was abusive and she doesn't want to, and she can't stay with her aunt and uncle for reasons i will not disclose. This means she has to stay with her biological father.

The issue is that her father, though pretty chill and nice around other people, is very mean to her, arguably emotionally abusive to her, when they are alone. She says he never hit her and she doesn't think he will hit her, but he says very mean and just plain horrible things to her. He has called her worthless, fat, blames things on her that are completely not her fault at all, yells at her, and just says horrible things to her. 

Something i want to point out is that she has bad depression and when he is a dick to her she says it makes her feel suicidal even. I suggested therapy one time but she said she already had a therapist but it didn't help her. 

What do I do or say? I can give more information if needed. Thank you.",07Jul2020,1
844,"So basically I got scammed on Facebook Marketplace. It was my fault and I was being really dumb. Basically I was attempting to buy a Nintendo Switch that I saw on Facebook Marketplace for 320$. This is my first time buying something on the Marketplace and essentially, I screwed up and I was being a fair bit stupid. I texted him on Facebook Messenger and we agreed on the price. He then requested the money through Facebook Pay and I sent him the money (stupidly) without receiving the product. He then asked for my address and my full name in order to ship the product. I tried to see if we could just meet in person but unfortunately, he said he was “out of town” (red flag, I know), but he did say that he would ship it on Monday. When I insisted that we meet up, he said he would be back by Wednesday and we can meet then. He also said he would refund me on the app if I wanted to pay cash and he’s just waiting on a representative to get back to him. I happily agreed to that and was just waiting for him to text me back. After that he just stopped replying, even as I kept asking him for updates and such. I know I was being very, very stupid, but now he’s blocked me (I know because I can’t view his profile or message him) and I don’t really know what to do because I’m out 320$. I spent the money on my debit card from bank of america. Any ideas on what to say when I call them reporting scam?

I cried when she’d drop me off at school, I’d miss her during the day, even through middle school I’d find myself randomly thinking about her. But once I turned 13, things changed. I no longer wanted to be around my mom at all, she annoyed me beyond belief and I just overall didn’t like her as a person. I thought it was normal cause I was going through the normal teen angsty stuff, but after talking to my friends I realized my feelings are different than most. Whenever they’d talk bad about their moms they’d always end it with “I still love her, though.” and that really made me worry.

848,"Hello Reddit! I hope you are all safe and healthy. This is going to be a bit long please bear with me.

I (19F) come from a large family (9 aunts and 5 uncles from both parents combined). We were a very close-knit and loving family. Most of the uncles married girls who were closely related to us so all the “outsiders” literally had a good sense of our familial relationship and really contributed to it. Anyways, about 4 years ago, the youngest uncle from my dads side marries a girl from a relatively distant group of the community. My grandparents are very open minded so they agree to the marriage and everything is fine. My youngest uncle’s (lets call him Jack) wife is 4 years older than me so we bonded real quick. This good relationship kinda thing went on for a year until she made a full 180. We (me and my parents) live about 300km away from the city Jack and his wife live. The contacts became less and less frequent until it was only us initiating contact such as calling or texting them and then responding in a very dry manner so my parents just decided to stop watering dead plants and see when they will call or text and they haven’t called in 2 years. We have a tradition like most families to always call to congratulate New Years and birthdays and we’ve haven’t received a call from them for years. Just for the record, we hadn’t seen Jack and wife for 8 months before everything changed and nothing had happened between us. So one time when we were visiting our grandparents, we figure out that jacks wife (let’s call her Ana) has stated some false claims about us to our grandfather who literally fell for it all. Mind you, in our family, respect for elders is so crucial that you literally can only sit in a specific way when a elder is in the room, you can’t even stretch your legs in front of an elder, let alone backbite?. Anyways, my grandparents fell for her innocent acting role and believed everything said about their eldest son (imagine the level of acting innocent to get to that level). My grandparents start a huuuge fight while we are visiting for a week and it was honestly heart breaking. So Ana later tells one of my aunts that she set that up because she wanted us to be afraid of her and to do what she says unless she’ll start a home wrecking fight all over again. My grandparents are on her side 100% my dad doesn’t want to stand against his parents and he literally wishes all of this would go away. This happened 2 years ago. Ever since the incident, multiple similar incidents have happened. My grandparents grow fruit in a medium sized farm and just so she can get herself out of working when we visit, she just starts a fight and leaves. The victim is always us. Her husband is brainwashed I believe. My dad hates it but I really think his brain is blocking that part out. He hates talking about it and all he can do to make himself feel good is to help his parents in extra ways to prove his kindness. His parents have nothing against him but they just believe Ana’s lies about us over and over again. Because of what Ana is doing, many people in the family have seen her power and decided to be her ally. So many new faces of people I used to love have been shown, it’s heart breaking. My mom is negatively affected by this. She thinks about it a lot and feels betrayed by her own family. If I was younger I would not give 2 shits but as an adult seeing the sheer effect on my family really makes me want to change the situation. My parents relationship isn’t as good as it used to be. We’ve all become so distant. Also, we have tried to take many civil means to confront her but she just won’t budge. I think the problem stems from Jack and Ana moving to a city further from the capital of the country where we live and maybe it’s jealousy? She’s subtly mentioned that she regrets the move but can’t do anything about it. But I really believe the problem is bigger than that. Idk what you you do if you were in my shoes? Any advice??",07Jul2020,1

850,"Yep! Title. There's no sugarcoating it, lol, but my appearance is actually ugly. There's no other way to put it. I am a young Korean girl living in South Korea, a country that many will know as a very harsh and cruel country when it comes to appearance. Just take a look outside and you see all these beautiful models everywhere advertising plastic surgery, and plastic surgery clinics literally anywhere you go. I really don't want to turn to plastic surgery as I'm very young but also because I know that if I do one thing, I'm going to get addicted and end up doing every single procedure there is. Not necessarily due to greed, but rather the constant thought of ""well I did (for example) my eyes, anyway, might as well do my nose"" and so on.

I seriously think I will be single forever, at least if I stay in Korea. And that may be okay, but not here. Not getting married is basically just choosing to be a loser, and as an only child I'll just cut off my whole bloodline ahahaha. All the men here think looks are the most important. Maybe there are a handful who value other things like money or status or education, but I've never seen or heard of them. Just take a look of some of those interview videos on YouTube, there's one that asks if you would be fine with a girlfriend who is beautiful but has an absolutely disgusting personality -- every single one of the interviewees didn't see the problem and just said they don't care about her personality as long as she is beautiful. This makes it extremely difficult to think I am pretty (and I'm not) and to generally love myself. Just look at the K-pop idols. I can't ignore the media when it's everywhere.

All the people in my life are so beautiful. I don't know how. Well, I haven't seen anyone uglier than me, anyways, so that probably is just the same here. But the girls my age or younger or older literally anyone I know is beautiful. How... Maybe not necessarily beautiful like goddess beauty or something like that but they are definitely above average. And they probably know that too, they have never expressed discomfort or concern in their appearance and love taking selfies. I wish I could do that too but if you're Korean you would probably know -- if you're ugly but try to ""own"" your appearance you just become hated on and Korean bullying is straight up evil. I moved here from being in the US and it's different here in social aspects.

If anyone is curious, here's my face's description (ew): 

I would say I look like a below average Asian girl.

I'm not sure why I look like this, none of my parents have had surgery but I don't directly resemble any of them, like my parents both have prominent double eyelids naturally with big eyes and no ptosis but I somehow have ptosis AND monolids, probably a grandparent's recessive trait.

I have small eyes with monolids AND moderate congenital ptosis (drooping of the eyelid) so I am constantly having to ""open"" my eyes because first off, because of the goddamn eyelid I cannot see anything above eye level and have to tilt my head (resulting in lots of neck pain) and lift my eyebrows (resulting in premature wrinkles and painful headaches) so that's one thing but also if I don't ""open"" my eyes it looks like I am glaring at you. I have no aegyo sal either, which is vital in having a pretty eye smile. If I do smile it looks fake since there's no aegyo sal. Basically no joke, I look pissed off as hell, especially since my eyes have slightly upturned corners. When I am not ""opening"" my eyes I cannot talk to someone without them asking repeatedly if I'm mad or sad or why I'm glaring at them or that it's rude to look at them like that or even to stop sleeping... but usually people who have an ugly feature have one beautiful feature -- not me. I have my dad's nose. My nose is extremely flat and does not match my face. The nostrils are big and the nose tip is very fat and round. It sticks out very flat and unflattering. It is smack in the center of my face, and I'm extremely conscious about it. I'm actually happy to wear a face mask since it covers my hideous nose. It's like a witch nose but flat and fat and the tip also sags down. Literally the opposite of the ideal Korean nose lol. My lips have downturned corners, making it look like I'm constantly frowning. My teeth are really bad and I have braces right now to fix them. My jaw is also small for my face and it's big and round and fat, making me look really out of proportion. I have a narrow forehead and can't get bangs to bring volume to my face since with a narrow forehead bangs just don't work. 

On top of that, I'm also pretty tall in Korea -- around 167 cm? Average height is around 160. All my friends are 155 so I just seem like this ugly awkward giant. I have never met a guy who likes tall girls. Every single man here would tell you they prefer short girls. Even the tall guys, since a height difference is very important to Koreans and Korean guys are also pretty short compared to US guys. I tower over lots of guys. This I can't even change.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't need any of the ""you're beautiful"" ""beauty is subjective"" stuff. Please don't say any of that. If anyone can relate, I hope they can share how they are coping especially if they are in a similar society where appearance is everything.

Before I go, I'd like to thank you for your time. :')",07Jul2020,1

853,"So here’s the background: I’m a 22 year old university student who studies linguistics. I’m on my 4th year but barely passed 2nd class. I honestly don’t like my major a bit and was seriously considering switching to literature or Latin this summer, starting all over again. 

The job is a mix between a real estate agent and a translator. I’ll sell estate to foreign and domestic buyers (mostly foreign though). The place works on a wage system and the fixed wage is 5k/month without bonuses. That’s more than twice the minimum wage in my country (For scale, a teacher makes 4k/m). The thing that intrigues me more is the bonuses. I’ll get around 2% comission from sales at the start. It may sound small but depending on the gig, it can be huge. The place sells hotels and villas in a touristic area, which can be sold up to tens of millions, if not hundreds. If I were to strike a 10 million deal, that would give me approximately 200k, three times more than a full year’s wage money - only from a single gig. 

I know it sounds too good, but here comes the “but” part. The thing is the “boss” wants me to leave the college and start working immediately. He’s a partner (as in business) of my father and is a really good businessman, but he’s also too ambitious and insistent. Too much that it sometimes makes me think that his ambition makes him unable to see things clearly. I’m not sure if he values my career geniunely. I know his will is good but he could be making a mistake unintentionally. 

There’s also my mother, whose biggest wish in life is to see me graduate. To be honest I would like to have a university degree too, be it literature or Latin. I feel like I would kind of feel unsuccessful if I were to dropout. This feels like gambling, really. 

So here I am stuck with these thoughts. Any advice on what I should do would be appreciated. Thank you so much",07Jul2020,1

857,"Hello everyone, I'm a 15-year-old from Vietnam.

I'm about to take one of the most important examination in a Vietnamese student's life - the high school entrance examination. In Vietnam, when you enter high school, there are 4 different type of high schools. One is run by the government but for normal students, one is also run by the government but for good to very good students called specialized and gifted high school , the other two are run by the people (these are for wealthy families or really rich family). My parents have already set a goal for me that is to enter the specialized high school in the chemistry major in order for me to become a doctor. I've taken many classes of chemistry but my grade in the specialized test isn't that great. My grades in normal entrance test, however, are actually quite well. So if I just apply for the normal school, I will most likely make it in but I'm not sure about the specialized school though. My parents did say that it wasn't compulsory for me to enter that school but after costing them quite a large amounts of money in studying chemistry, I feel like I'm going to be such a failure if I don't make it. Furthermore, I don't even know if I like chemistry or not. I feel like I've been lying to myself that I liked chemistry in order to study it well and I even fail in that. Many of my friends are applying to that school too, so I will feel more like a failure if I don't make it in the chemistry major. And even if I make it, I don't know whether I will enjoy my time studying there. The subject I like most is English but since I don't take any extra classes in English and the grade you need to get into English major is high as hell ( usually 9/10 in Literature, 8-9/10 in Math, 10/10 in basic English and above 6/10 in the specialized English test which is really hard ), I think I most likely won't be able to make it. Now I feel lost and don't know what I want, what I like nor what I will do in the future...

863,"Okay so a couple of weeks ago my family and I were eating something and I had drunk beer and the butter was tasting disgustingly weird. I thounght it went bad but my family didn't find anything wrong with it. I just ate very salty food and when I drank banana juice it tasted weird. My partner says the drink is fine, it does taste a little weird to him. His food is less salty than mine.

Now, as you can read I am suspecting that its got to do with the salt in my food/the beer, but I wanted to make sure that there's nothing wring with me... cause like, iced tea was fine to drink but the banana juice not, the butter tasted disgusting but the bread fine.

I am really confused cause before these incidents I never had anything like this. Does anyone have an idea whether that's normal?",07Jul2020,1
864,"Hello, r/Advice. I recently started working at a warehouse, and I am concerned by the fact that virtually none of my coworkers wear masks. My state is under an executive order from the governor that mandates the wearing of masks at work, yet the company does not require employees to follow this order. I try to maintain a safe, 6 foot distance from my coworkers most of the time, but this is not always possible. 

Although I always wear my mask and gloves while I am at work and I take off my work clothes as soon as I get home, I am still worried about potentially contracting the virus and spreading it to my family. Although it is nice to be making money, and this job pays significantly more than any other unskilled labor, I am wondering if I am being selfish by continuing to work there. I do not \*need\* this job to survive; I am a college student on summer break just looking to make a couple thousand dollars before school starts again.

My request for advice is twofold: 

1. Am I being selfish for working in a job that I don't necessarily need when there is a possibility that I could contract the virus and spread it to my family, or am I being a little too paranoid?
2. If I am to continue working in this warehouse, how can I try to hold the management accountable for protecting worker safety? I have already reported the warehouse to the state for violating the executive order, but due to the high number of complaints the state will take a very long time to process my complaint. I am also going to drop a complaint in the company's suggestion box, yet due to the disregard for safety among nearly all the staff, including the administration, I fear that this will go nowhere.

Thank you all in advance for your help!",07Jul2020,1
865,"I’ve been talking with this girl since around January, and we had been really close friends from the start. She was funny, nice, and seemed to like me a lot. I however did not like her in the same way she obviously did, I had always thought of her as one of my closest friends. 
I ended up caving and getting into a relationship with her, which didn’t go too well, in that she loved me while I didn’t as much. That lasted about a month or two before I had to say something, and after that we didn’t talk for a few weeks.
We started talking again and quickly got really close, because we liked talking to each other. I thought I was being super clear about I felt about her, but apparently I wasn’t because about a month after that we got into a fight about “what we were” and again, we stopped talking for the better part of 2 months.
I didn’t take that month very well. She was one of my best friends, and thinking about how I led her on not once but twice really fucked me up. I felt bad for what I did, and I thought us not talking would fix the situation.
Now cut to beginning of June, she texts me and wants to hang out. I say yes, and for the third time we quickly get really close. We were a lot more open about how we felt about each other, but I could tell she still wasn’t over me. But it was fine, we talked everyday about all kinds of things. Then literally last night, we had a big long conversation over the phone about “what we were” again. Again again. We talked about how she wasn’t over me, how I didn’t know how to feel about her, given our close friendship, and how what each of us want are really at odds. She wants a nice perfect relationship. I want a friend to talk to. One of us isn’t going to end up with what we want.
I need to friend zone her somehow. I want to to do it without it ruining us as friends however. Is that selfish? Yeah. Very selfish. But all I want to do is talk to her because she’s just the nicest person, but I can’t for the life of me see us in a relationship. Or maybe what I want doesn’t matter and I should just be with her, so that she’s happy. That’s all I want. Or do I stop talking to her, so that she can see I’m not the man of her dreams, and I’m just some lose that leads people on?

866,"I would like to give a bit of context before we get to the issue. I come from a family full of traditions, and one of the traditions is that your first male and female are named after my father, my name is the same as my grandfathers and my sons name should be the same as my fathers.

My wife and I decided to have  a child and its a baby girl! So following my family traditions her name should be my mothers name. The issue here is that we (my wife and I) don't love my mothers name and we chose another name, our idea is to have our name (let's say mary) and add it to my mothers name (Sophia) so that way her name would be Mary Sophia (im just using generic names). The real problem is that my mother is expecting her granddaughter to be named after her and I need to tell her that we are adding a second name before hers. I don't know how to approach my mother because I don't want to disappoint her, I love my mother and I don't want to sound like I don't like her name.

How can I approach her without being hard on her or being too aggressive with my decision?

867,"Over the weekend while on a hike my ""friend"" told me that a couple of people at work think I'm harassing her. I originally laughed it off. But, as the conversation ensued, she told me that she agreed. I was surprised and hurt. I wanted to apologize immediately as that is the last thing I want to do to a coworker and friend. She then played off her comment and practically threw the people who supposedly told her under the bus. She then changed the subject and dropped it completely. My gut was telling me that she was hiding something. Now, I'm a superstitious person, so I went to a psychic yesterday and told her what had happened. As the psychic was doing her reading on me, she was surprised by what she saw. Turns out no one at work is suspecting me of harassing my friend. My ""friend"" is telling people that I am. Now I got mad. The psychic told me that she told 3 people, 1 man and 2 women. The man I know who it is as I see him everyday at work and we have a solid, professional rapport. The 2 women are tricky as I don't know who they are worh certainty. Is smart to pull the gentleman aside and tell him my side of the story in order to avoid this from escalating?

Anyways, I was open to dating a few months ago, dated a guy for a month but i noticed I felt really overwhelmed 😞 and i think in turn it just did not make that couldve-been relationship work and it ended. It was my first try at ANYTHING romantic. Never dated in HS either so everything was new and i just didnt know how to juggle things.

I want to date, for sure. I want experience but I dont know if I know how to manage my time for it properly. I see my friends date around me;  i ask how time works for them and all they say is ""if its important you WILL make time."" Which is nice and everything but making the time is where i start feeling overwhelmed. Every week there is an assignment due with bugs i have to fix in code while i also have to remember the job I have right after class and ALSO remembering to make sure I hang out with friends too.

870,"I am a 29yo female virgin. My whole life I have waited for ""the one"". This, along with a very religeous upbringing has caused me to repress and avoid sexual acts my entire life.

871,"I have a very dear friend (let’s say her name is Paul) who is close friends with someone that I absolutely cannot stand (let’s call him David).

Paul is hilarious, compassionate, smart, and has always been there for me through really tough times in my life. Paul has grown into an amazing person. Paul has been friends with David for many years now. David, however, is pretty immature and loves to make “edgy” jokes and bigoted remarks that are racist, sexist, homophobic, you name it, and basically seems perpetually stuck in a middle school edgelord phase even though we’re approaching our mid twenties. To be honest, sometimes his presence just makes me feel uncomfortable. Paul knows this, and he's expressed before that he's not comfortable with David's behavior sometimes, but they're still friends.

Sometimes, Paul will have a few friends over just to hang out, and sometimes, I’ll be there with David. David and I don’t get along because I don’t find his edge lord humor to be funny. I react to his bigoted jokes by telling him to stop, or saying that’s not cool, etc, but he doesn’t change his behavior. In fact, I think my reaction (and others’ reactions) to his jokes/remarks just enables him more. Expressing my dislike for his “jokes” doesn’t seem to work, and I’ve thought about just going the whole “ignore him and he’ll stop” approach that you usually take with toddlers, but I don’t want to just let his bigoted remarks slide either.

I’m struggling with what to do here. I adore Paul, but I cannot stand David. Telling David that his jokes and his views are cruel doesn’t work at all, but I also don’t really feel comfortable just ignoring his behavior. I don’t really want to give Paul an ultimatum either.

873,"Greetings, I am not depressed, committing self-harm, nor suicidal. However, I feel conflicted and it is affecting me heavily.

To begin with, I am a 20 year old American law school  student (1L) and a Marine reservist (Corporal). Due to coronavirus, my tuition has been left dirt cheap (I only have to borrow 9k for the entire school year). However, I feel that I am wasting the best physical years of my life.

Ever since I was young, I always dreamed of becoming a military pilot in the US and simply be in the skies. Whether it would be in a helicopter, jet, or airplane, it has been a lifelong goal.

Perhaps, it has to do with the fact that I saw planes as an escape from my corrupt mess of a third world country. Everytime I went on a plane from my crappy country to America, it felt like heaven. To be able to drink clean water from the faucet, not risk food poisoning everytime I ate at a restaurant, not have to bride police just to drive somewhere, and many other factors that made this country look like a completely different world than the one I was living in. Regardless of all the other problems the United States may have, this country is a hell of a lot better than what I grew up in. My strong attachment to aviation is due to this.

Today, I longer hate country of origin and understand that It wasn't my fault I happened to be born there. Life just gives you random cards, so deal with them. However, now that I am an adult, I do not wish to live there.

However, when I finally had the opportunity to begin pursuing this goal (17), my family persuaded me to instead become a military lawyer (judge advocate) first because I would do far greater than by simply being ""another pilot"" in the military.

In response, I listened and decided that the Marine Corps would be appropriate for this goal. So, from 17-19, I became a reservist and finished my bachelors' degree in legal studies. I enjoyed the study of law and the Marine Corps has been an extremely positive experience, so I don't have any regrets from this.

Now, enter law school. Ever since I started, I've felt that I am throwing away a once in a lifetime opportunity (becoming a military pilot) for something that can always be done later in life (I've met plenty of people their mid thirties going to law school and they seem happy to have gone later). This doubt has gotten so strong that it is affecting the quality of my studies and my own motivation. Sometimes, I have to stop studying take a walk to reflect because I feel useless to my family. Law school takes the bulk of my day away and 3 more years without having the ability to progress professionally is difficult to accept.

I still want to become a lawyer in my life and there is no doubt about that in my heart, but I honestly feel that I could be pursuing much more productive goals with my life right now.

Right now, these are my options:

A. Drop out and start applying to any guard, or reserve aviation unit. From what I've heard, its fairly easy to do an interservice transfer for my unit, especially now that there's way too many Marines in my section and I am awfully sure that there are going to be budget cuts after this pandemic. In the meanwhile, I could enroll in a computer science program offered by the flagship university of my state (I will not disclose). The program is also dirt cheap, online, and I would like to get into patents one day.

I spoke with a nearby army guard aviation unit and was told me that the next selection board is in November. What is great is that I can apply while still with my unit. The process is fairly long (flight physical, service uniform photo, signatures from unit, etc). If I get selected, then I would have to receive permission to get released to go into the national guard.

The earliest I can begin training (which is almost 2 years long) is in February 2021. I will get paid, progress in my military career, and fully qualify for the GI bill. The benefits here are plentiful. If I miss this board, then I can apply to the April board and go in August 2021. No problem for me.

Additionally, an attorney mentor from my origin country has informed me that with my bachelor's degree, I could easily become a lawyer and work with him remotely. This is because in that unlike the US, a law degree in country of origin is a bachelor's degree. The only thing I have to do is either submit a thesis on a legal topic that is currently relevant for the country of origin, or take some exams the areas of law for which I have no credit (roman law, maritime law, tourism law, etc). I can take them at any time and then I'll be sworn in once I am done. It will only cost me a few hundred dollars to submit my attorney package.

I have only borrowed 3k from law school, so its a minimal loss. Right now, I only have 33k in student loan debt, so it could give me an early opportunity to start working towards repaying it.

B. Continue and finish my three years, while staying in my unit and then by the time I am 23, I'll start to pursue my goal of becoming a pilot. I could collect my entire reserve gi bill (14k), which would be a nice little bonus to deter initial loans.

I will be approximately 73k in student loan debt, but I will be a lawyer in both the state I live in and then my country of origin. The good thing about the state I'm currently in is that my country of origin has a heavy trading relationship with the state and my mentor travels here all the time to visit and deal with clients, so I could definitely make something of it if I network my way with him.

I apreciate any constructive criticism, or advice.

Thank you for reading.

td;dr: gmail was hacked, password changed, googles telling me i cannot get the account back due to getting recovery gmail questions wrong, is there another way to get my account back?

months ago I made a gmail so i could play a game, this gmail was solely for this game, so i didn't really take the gmail seriously since i never planned on using it, i just made it so i wasn't using a random gmail to play the game. So I never thought to put a recovery gmail or a recovery phone number. well a month after playing the game I decided I'd sell the game account since i had bigger ambitions than the game now. well the person I was trying to sell the account to, long story short got access to the gmail and the game account and changed the password to both. I got discouraged and just gave up, actually i didnt try to recover the account because i knew it was damn near impossible. but recently my friends told me i could get the account back. so i emailed the devs of the game  and told them what happened and showed them screenshot proof.  and they said in order for me to get the account back, i have to recover the gmail. well now heres where things get tricky, i tried account recovery but all it is, is enter the last password you remember, get a verification code from your backup gmail (which is his literal own gmail). so i press try another way, then they tell me to enter my first phone number, which i doubt i put in a recovery phone number, but i put my phone number in just in case, then they tell me they cant confirm the account is mine. which is understandable, after all i didnt put up any defenses and thats the end of the process. does anyone know a way around this? or some advice?",07Jul2020,1

879,"I’m a female, 26 years old. I had two best friends ever since I was 15. We had a huge falling out a few months before I turned 21. The falling out was my fault. 

They said they wanted to try and stay in touch but can’t guarantee us getting back like we used to. I spent two years trying my hardest to fix things but they were still cold to me. It made me miserable obsessing over whether they liked me or not. I decided to delete their numbers and unfollow their social media and try to forget (by that time we graduated university so i’m not seeing them everyday anymore) 

I got a job and new friends but every once in a while I would remember them and feel really sad. I kept having these recurring dreams of us being best friends again and I would wake up feeling really upset. 

Fast forward three years, i’m in quarantine and with so much free time I kept thinking of them more and more and decided to message them again. They were really happy to hear from me again and wanted us to stay in touch. They added me on social media again and are friendly with me. 

The problem is, they don’t seem like they forgot our falling out five years ago. we speak like acquaintances not friends, and they don’t update me on their life or share much with me. They don’t show affection like they used to, and if I say anything affectionate the conversation just turns awkward quickly because they don’t respond well. 

I miss us so much, and how much we relied on each other during tough times, and how frequently we told each other we loved each other. It seems gone now. I am back obsessing over whether they liked me or not, just like I was when I was at university. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to get past this stage in our friendship? Its draining mentally to constantly worry about this, and I have to force myself to keep our conversations dull without oversharing and making things awkward again

880,"Hello. I am 22f and recently endured some bullying that cost me my job, and overall mentality. I reconnected with a (mean) girl from highschool hoping she had changed. Things were great for the first couple of weeks, and she still hung out with her ex because they had the same friend group and encouraged him to see other people as she was already seeing other people. While we were sitting at a table at the bar, everyone else was talking which left me and her ex to have our own conversation as we were on the far end of the table and couldn’t hear anybody else anyway. It was fine, I’m nota interested in him like that at this point. She notices this and after we leave the bar says that “it’s fine, and she supports it” if either one of us decide to “become friends” and that “we’re both adults and can make your own decisions.” It was suspicious but I didn’t think anything of it because I didn’t think HE would do that, he still seems interested in her. 
Well, he did invite me to coffee one morning and I agreed because I was new in town and I wanted to actually get to know more people other than my friend from highschool. Nothing suspicious happens at coffee, it was early like 7 am and we just had real casual conversation then went on with our day. I ended up hanging out with her later on that evening and she did a complete 180 when I told her I met him for coffee. She told me it was “fucked up” and “none of her friends would do that to her” and then told me to leave. I felt extremely set up, as there’s more to the story between her and him. As I’m on my way to work the next day I’m getting an onslaught of messages from her purely attacking me, my character, my friendships with people from our hometown, why I’m a horrible person and then HER friends started messaging me as well. I was able to get through to one of them (the only one that didn’t block me before I responded) and she said she was sorry and it would all blow over. Then blocked me. Well I pretty upset over this. And my manager noticed this, but typically tells me ALL ABOUT what’s going on with her life inside and outside of work and got hurt clearly when I didn’t talk to her about it. It effected our work day because I was still learning from her, and she put off many things I needed to learn because I was being “weird.” (I just didn’t want to talk about my personal life) I was shortly after, fired, apperently for “letting” my personal life effect my work life. (They went bankrupt a month later. Not surprised.) So now I’ve lost my job, the dude friend hates me because he thinks I had bad intentions( I think he had bad intentions) I no longer have a group of friends to enjoy the city life with and i totaled my car driving it for money after loosing my job. I couldn’t take it anymore, so I moved BACK to my hometown ( fml) and now I’m in a good relationship in a good house but I still have a lot of remorse for the way everything unfolded the way it did and how I got here.

884,"Hi Reddit,

I already made some posts about it in other subreddits but it is really bugging me and making me really unhappy. Sorry for the long story. 

So the backstory. I matched with a guy on tinder and we kinda clicked. I soon found out, through a mutual friend, that he has some history with another friend of mine. I red some chat groups searching for his name and found out that they kissed at the university and that they ended things in a week. I decided to hold back in our conversation because I didn’t want to do something with him if they had any history. However, he kept texting me and I liked almost everything about it. He wanted to meet up a few times and actually went to the places I was studying to meet up with him. I tried to avoid him as much as possible, because I wanted to make up my mind first. I asked my friends for advice and they said I should pursue him and talk to my friend if I thought he had potential. They also told me that they had sex. The thing is, I didn’t know if he had potential. I wanted to find out, before I made unnecessary drama. So I decided to go on a walk with the guy. Beforehand I decided I didn’t want to kiss etc with him, before I talked to my friend. The date was nice, he was cute and we decided to have some drinks afterwards. He tried to kiss me and I kept dodging him. He ended up grabbing my head and kissed me. I felt flabbergasted and I explained the whole situation. I expressed my boundaries and told him I didn’t want to kiss or have sex with him before I talked to her!! I was very very clear to him. He didn’t validate her feelings and this kinda bugged me. He told me it was over between the two of them. He also told me that I was here for myself and that I should listen to what my body wanted. I still told him no and I began to feel shy and uneasy. He dragged me on his lap and told me to look in his eyes. He told me that I should be clear about my boundaries and I told him I was. I actually was very turned on by his action. Still he decided to try to touch &amp; kiss me. And I liked that he couldn’t have me, yet wanted me so bad. It kinda became a game. I told him no, he tried to unzip my pants and later zipped them up again etc. He also said that I started because I put of my shoes. And he told me that my mouth said no, but my eyes said yes. Then he told me he didn’t have condoms at home and that I shouldn’t be scared because we are not having sex anyway. We cuddled a bit more. We felt asleep and later he started grinding against me. I still found it hot that he was turned on by me. Then he put my pants off very quickly and gave me oral sex. I enjoyed it a lot, but it felt very wrong towards my friend. I went to the bathroom and put my pants on again and went back like nothing happened. Later that evening he put me on top of him and slides my panties away. He tried to push his penis inside me. I panicked and told him no. I told him I didn’t take the pill and that I was afraid for STDs. He told me it was fine, but that he still wanted to cum inside me. He pressed my head down and I agree to giving him oral. 

I really regret this, because I feel like it did this because I thought it was the “best” option at the time. 

A few days after it happened he asked me why I didn’t text him anymore. I told him he crossed my boundaries and he said sorry and tells me that it was not his intention multiple times. 

I really worry about my friend and I start to think he did something similar to her in their time “together”. Especially when I find out through a mutual friend, that she had unprotected sex with the guy at had to get MAP multiple times. This doesn’t sound like something my friend would do. 

I decided to go to my friend and come clean about the whole story. She doesn’t take it very well. She only listened to the half of the story and I soon found out she still had feelings for the guy. She wasn’t in a great mental state for the last few months and she told a friend of ours that she wanted to get in a relationship with him so she would have those bad feelings anymore. She probably feelings like I destroyed her chances to getting happy. 

She also kinda considered me as his “side-chick” and she is mad at him because he wanted to fuck me while he loved her so much. But in fact he probably doesn’t love her at all...

So I went home and kept quiet for about I week. I still had to think a lot about her and decided to write her an apology letter. I choose to do this, because then she didn’t need to get confronted with me and she didn’t had to give me a direct answer. 
I thought it was a good idea...

So I wrote about everything that went down and my intentions in the whole thing. I apologized a few times and told her I knew I hurted her a lot and that I take full responsibility. I think my letter was really sweet and respectful towards her. 

I went to her roommate so she could let me inside. I planned on leaving the letter behind but her roommate insisted that I gave it to her in person. I felt a little uneasy about this, but I agreed and gave the letter to my friend. My friend reacted a little bit rude and said “Wtf should I do with this” and she walked away angry. I directly went home afterwards.

Today she send me an answer during in between a few important presentations (I had to defense my thesis 3 times) for me. She knew this and I know for sure she did this on purpose. We talked in our friend groupchat about the exact times of my presentations and everyone wished me goodluck (except her). 

So basically the told me that I am a liar, because I have a those beautiful words but my actions don’t match up so all my words must be untrue. The told me that I was really bothering (like stalking etc) her to an extreme extent and that I should leave her alone in the future. She told me I am putting up a big show etc. The also told me that I should work on my mental state because there is clearly something wrong with me if I am such an attention ho that I decided to hurt her to get a little bit of attention from her guy.

These words hit me hard. I blocked her immediately so I protect myself from saying stupid stuff to her. It felt like she is choosing that asshole over me. I cried multiple times over this and have constant headache because of this. I know I am wrong in this situation and that I shouldn’t meet up with him, but I feel like she is really really harsh on me after everything that happened. 

I am also hurt by her words and I actually want an apology from her. I know that I should leave her alone for now, but I am worried she is going to get manipulated again by the guy. I also want to make our friendship working again, but I want her to apology because she is basically saying that it is my fault while he did those things. 

I also want to get through this whole situation, because I actually feel really shitty right now. What should I do to make the best from this?",07Jul2020,1
885,"I know not using a throwaway might cause me some embarrassment if my friends come across this but I’m past caring really. 

So a couple of months ago my girlfriend split with me. We’d been dating for a year and a half and had a truly great relationship for the most part. It was mainly me moving away in September and lockdown keeping us apart that led her to make her decision. While I wasn’t happy, I was coping okay. 

Then about a week later I received the news that she had feelings for a friend of mine and he had feelings for her. They’d been talking behind my back for months as “friends” but I trusted them both enough to take it no further. This news was crushing to me and I spend night after night sleepless, I lost my appetite (which I still haven’t fully recovered and has caused me to lose a stone in weight) and I suffered a generally low mood. Some time a few weeks ago they became official and it made me feel like absolutely nothing. The fact that I could be moved on from that easily suggested to me that I was useless and worth nothing to my ex for the whole relationship. I had some dark thoughts, drank more than I should’ve a lot of evenings and at one point started whipping my own back with a belt. While I’m not as bad as that at the moment I still don’t feel myself. 

My friend group used to have great laughs but of course it’s not the same after what happened. The thing is, nobody seems to have criticised him for what he’s done apart from a few jokey comments. I feel like an outcast. I feel like none of them, not even my two best friends can be bothered with me anymore. My friends often meet without me and have said to me that if they were meeting me they’d want him to be there out of guilt of leaving him out. How has he been able to turn my friends against me like this?  Should I say anything or keep quiet and see what happens?  I just need some advice on something so crushing. We’re only 18 and I understand it might not matter too much but still.",07Jul2020,1
886,"There wasn’t much tying me down to my city to begin with. I work remote now (we had started to just before the pandemic hit), so I can work basically anywhere. I’m considering moving back home once my lease is up at the end of February, but I don’t know if it’s the right decision.

On the one hand, moving back home would help me save so much money. I could pay off my car loan and/or student loans in a year or so. I could keep my mom company because she’s losing her job at the end of September and not really wanting to find a new one until this all starts to get a little better since my dad is high-risk... and I’d be able to spend time with my family. Who knows how much worse this is going to get.

On the other hand, I’d be moving away from the city I’ve called home for most of my adult life. I’d be leaving friends. I wouldn’t be able to date in my hometown because 1. I don’t really want to date here anyway. I’m not staying here forever and 2. I never really meshed well with most of the people here. If I lost my job my only options would be essential work or fast food, jobs that I don’t want to take because I don’t want to expose my parents. There’s nothing in my field in my small town.

It’s hard because I don’t see myself having much of a social life anyway because of Covid. I don’t do much now except work and play video games in my apartment. 

Would you stay in your city to see if things get any better and still have the opportunities of living in that city? Or would you move back home for a year to save money and spend time with family, potentially having to start over once you decide to move somewhere else?",07Jul2020,1
887,"So I am a few weeks away from being 21 and a female. I have been looking for work and had an interview at one company. I was very interested in working there. After my interview, I got a call back asking me to come into a job orientation that afternoon. I accepted and was excited to have a job. While at the orientation, the manager training us mentions 14 of us have been hired, but 3 of us they have not decided on and mentions I am not hired. They said this an hour into the orientation, so I had already worked an hour without pay. They new from the start that there was an issue though since us 3 were placed in group together and brought in separate 5 minutes after the bigger group to join them. It seems there was a mix up and three of us were called back before getting the job, but were still expected to be there the whole orientation without being hired or on payroll while 14 people were being paid. They said they will call me back today if they want to hire me. Part of me now hopes they do not.
I really do need a full time job, but if they are so disorganized that they honestly accidentally called back 3 people without giving them the job I don't know if I want to work there. Should I ignore the mess up and carry on with persuing it if hired? Should I decline the offer to work and keep looking elsewhere? I am really torn over this, I don't want to willingly decline work when I need it, but they knew before I got there that there was a mess up and did not inform me.",07Jul2020,1

As time went on we both fell for each other and started dating in June, and soon after found out she had slept with her ex a few times during the months before.

896,"I am a female in a muslim country (it's not **that** bad, just lots of misogyny) and I am almost 21. I make my own money (parents help out too but I could live without help, just it would be harder), I am in one of the best universities in my country and it is 500km away from my hometown. Which seems pretty independent on paper.

The problem is my mom and other women in the family. They are well educated and ""modern"" so I never thought this would be an issue. Ever since quarantine started about 4 months ago, my mom became overprotective and paranoid.  That I would do stuff ""unladylike"", flirting, swearing, having a lot of male friends, laughing loudly, wearing tank tops.. (Which I do, but I did my best to keep it from her. And I mean, these kind of things never used to be a problem. It feels so **unreal** that these are my problems.) I ignored it and tried to keep her happy, I mean, all this will end one day and I will get back to my life, right?

Well here is where the problem starts: My job asked me to come to the office starting August, and they would pay me a lot (like it could last me a year). The problem is where I am to stay. I could rent an apartment, I've been staying in a dorm for 3 years with 3 other girls in a tiny room. I thought sooner or later id get my own house. Got a big ass nope. 

I have 3 options in her mind:

\-Get the apartment and stay with my 14 year old brother (and take care of him too, she said he would keep me safe because he is a **he**)

\-Crash on my uncle's couch, he lives 2 hours away from the place I work

\-Or stay in a place suited for **young ladies**, and pay 3 times as much, so they could monitor me. (I am not monitored in my dorm)

The part that pissed me off is this: I asked her when I could live on my own, get a house, start a life. She said when I get married. The fact that she prefers me as some man's wife, passing on my responsibility to someone else than to see me manage on my own. All this so the neighbours won't gossip about the dishonoured daughter she has. I tried so hard to get into my school, to start a life where I didn't know anybody. And all this is so that I can be a wife someday?

When I say independent is not making my own money or getting my education. I want to make my own decisions. Can I ever accomplish that? **Can my mom see me as she sees my kid brother, a person who can be on their own and make their decisions, a ""male""? Or am I fighting with hundreds of years of tradition, where a woman is passed down from family to her husband? And my identity will only be someone's wife in their eyes?**

And fun fact: I am bisexual. Man, I really hope I end up with a male person.

Another fun fact: I stayed in fucking New York for 2 months by myself. This is the same women who encouraged me to go.",07Jul2020,1

I’ve lost 60 pounds, still have around 20 pounds to go as I’m a little chubby, and I’m super bored of my diet and have no willpower to do that anymore. My hobbies are collecting records, playing guitar, and really all around anything music or film related. I also garden and try to read, I’ve been into Ernest Hemingway lately. I used to be way into gaming and history but video games aren’t fun anymore and I just kinda lost interest in history. I don’t have a girlfriend and that makes me kinda lonely, I have a solid group of friends but I’m not very popular or well known. I also enjoy the NFL and College football but that doesn’t start until September. I’ve tried to well-round myself and keep many different interests and hobbies but I’m still so bored! I have nowhere to go, everything feels the same all the time. I can’t make new friends because I have nowhere to go to meet new people.

I have money but I don’t have anything I want to buy (other than records). Also, I work as a tutor and that’s fun I guess, I may end up becoming a high school music teacher later in life.

The fact is, I don't know why, but I just feel so guilty about staying at home. Because in my head means I'm ""wasting my day"", because I'm not socializing (told you, very extroverted guy), and in the end I feel so guilty I force myself to go out, and sometimes this makes me feel even worse.

900,"I [17M] have a really close bud who I usually share stupid and funny photos of myself with. We have that sort of closeness that brothers have and I couldn’t imagine him breaking that trust, ever. But that’s been starting to change recently.

We’ve had the mutual understanding that we trust each other not to share these pics with anyone. And we jokingly tell each other pretty dumb secrets that could really ruin us if others heard it and misinterpreted it. We talk and usually meet up on the daily, and we’re always looking out for each other like bro’s would.

But I’ve been noticing that he’s been sharing these things about me to another one of my friends (let’s call him Person A). I’m not sure if it’s intentional, or if it’s just a slip of the tongue to be honest. I’m starting to get clout chaser vibes, and it’s not getting any better. 

It started a while ago when he started staying up all night to play PS4 with some other guys, including Person A. He continually pestered me to join them on this filibuster of video games but I told him that sleep is important. I made this decision because I read something on Tumblr that really hit me: it went something like “Don’t sacrifice your health for someone who with all likelihood won’t remember your sacrifices a year from now. Don’t stay up, sleep is more important.” I advised him to do the same because I care about him. He continued anyway. 

During these video game filibusters, I have no clue what he would talk about with Person A - and I like to think positively of others so I did not and will not make assumptions. But it became apparent that he started sharing stories to Person A that I personally told him, and that I thought would stay between us two. One of them was a fight that I got into at a Dairy Queen because two racist girls were verbally assaulting a Punjabi worker, and I wouldn’t have any of it. He was there with me, and I remained silent during much of the exchange because much of it turned into them and their boyfriends insulting me left, right and centre. This was obviously embarrassing but I learnt that it is beneath me to respond to insults with insults, so I only responded when they brought in the worker again. This humiliating yet very personal story should’ve stayed between us - and we look back at it jokingly and have loads of inside jokes about it. To my dismay, my bud memorized all the insults and the entire story and shared it with Person A. I didn’t know how to respond to this so I just stayed silent, I basically gave him the benefit of the doubt. But I won’t lie that at that point, it hurt that he had to use my humiliation to fill in the silence between him and Person A in a call on Houseparty. 

Then again this happened yesterday, and now we go back to the stupid photos that I sent him. They stayed up all night again yesterday and for some reason, he felt the need to share my photos with Person A. They even called me at 5am (and I’m usually up by then and they know it) to ask me why my moustache looked the way it did. I kind of cracked a joke at it, but I stayed silent for a long period of time and I think he got the hint that I found it pathetic that he shared it with Person A. When I confronted him in the call, he said “It’s just person A, chill.” He assumes that by clarifying that he sent it to Person A and not anyone else, the problem is resolved. I was really upset - I am no where as close to Person A as I am to him. 

I don’t know how to respond to this. I’m conflicted in several ways. I see him as a brother and I usually let slide what he does to me that I assertively would never let slide if anyone else did it. At the same time I feel like he betrayed my trust in many ways. I also feel like he’s trying to use me to get closer to Person A (who I actually introduced to him). I don’t know if he’s chasing clout, or if he’s bad at keeping secrets but I find it hard to see him as the brother I used to see him as before. I really don’t know what to think of this.",07Jul2020,2

902,"I had a rough time growing up, but my parents have turned into better people. Not sure I feel comfortable completely forgiving them, but I also don't feel comfortable being spiteful anymore, since they've changed -- and being spiteful never did me any good to begin with. In all honesty, I regret feeling bad at all. What could I do that keeps my relation to them in a mostly neutral spot, that doesn't require me giving up neither the relationship entirely or my own integrity?

I'm getting older, and quarreling internally about the such-and-suches of how I should treat my parents, and how they should treat me, just doesn't seem worth it anymore. It's hindering my own life to spend time recollecting memories and planning and plotting how I should feel and act, what's right and what's wrong with regards to this.

So I'm at the point where I could move out and away, but this brings me to another issue: My dad is insisting that he pays my rent, and many of my other major expenses. This feels awkward, both because I want to be independent and don't want my finances reliant on someone else -- it ruins the whole idea of growing older -- and I don't wanna feel beholden to him given the above. 

He treats me as if the past in which he was aggressive and ruinous for my family at large never happened, and he wants to get close to me in a way that I don't feel is right anymore. In his own words, he ""wants things to go back to the way they were"", which I see as essentially impossible; I don't have that kind of patience, and even if I did I'm not sure it'd last given my dad's constitution and tendency to shift and avoid blame. An example of the latter would be the time when he said he ""would never hurt anyone"" and ""just wants everyone to be happy"" in response to me confronting him about my hurt.

I don't have the energy for any of this. I just want to move on, I'm so tired, sad and my head just doesn't work as a result, in general. I don't want to hurt anyone, but at the same time I'm bored and genuinely so jaded with watching excuse after excuse, and the same old patterns of personality play out time and time again, and bothering with something that I don't even want to nor really \*have\* to engage with anymore.

This is where I'm at, thought-wise. I'm at a loss for what to do, and I'd appreciate it a ton if anyone could give me some advice about where tf I go from here (or even just tell me their own story, I'm down to listen).

A few days ago I woke up with bumps all over me. They began to itch and burn and the pain was unbearable. I have never seen so many red welts on me before. I have never been allergic to anything, and I’ve never woken up so itchy and in pain. I understand the seasons are changing too but I have never experienced itchiness like this. I put hydrocortisone cream on and it quickly went away.

Yesterday I woke up again with twice as many bumps, it’s like a big rash all over my body. I couldn’t stop itching for hours and hours. I tried Benadryl, Claritin, Hydrocortisone cream, I have a nasal allergy spray that didn’t help. I took an oatmeal bath and I put ice on the rash- nothing. It suddenly just stopped itching and I was able to fall asleep. 

Last night I woke up to uncontrollable itching again. Same symptoms, I laid in bed for hours pretty much crying because I couldn’t bear the itch. I managed to cry myself to sleep. Woke up again this morning to the same rash/bumps all over me. I’ve taken all the same medication again but it’s still bothering me.

I live in Oklahoma, and unfortunately the corona virus outbreak is really bad. I wear a mask in public and I don’t go out unless I’m working. When I’m working I’m wearing a mask and constantly washing my hands. I’ve seen some people say a rash is a symptom and I’m seeing some say that it isn’t. I was tested a few weeks ago but it was negative. Could this sudden flare up possibly be corona? I have no idea what it could be. I haven’t changed my diet, I’ve been using the same detergent and soaps like usual. I haven’t switched or changed medications. I’m truly at a loss here.

i’m wondering if anyone else has had a covid diagnosis in their workplace and if so, how did your superiors handle it? a parent of a girl in my mother’s toddler classroom tested positive and her directors are doing nothing because the parents at their center can no longer come into the building at all to drop their kids off. i may be too close to the subject but i think it’s weird that they don’t seem to care about the fact that my mother is in close personal contact with this little girl whenever the girl isn’t in close personal contact with her covid positive mother.

When she does I have to take my clothes of. (I can leave my underwear on).

Following a 2-3 month decrease in happiness for both of us, she cheated on me with another guy - she felt bad about it and told me almost instantly.

I told her we would work through it, but she didn't want too - due to a lot of stuff with my mental health, I was overworked, unhappy with life in general, among other things, I neglected her - especially so in the final week. A couple days before we broke up I told her I wanted to make a lot or changes with myself and I began to better myself.

In comes a few bits of hope where I try and get her to try again - she came over to my house, we had sex (twice), she didn't want to get back together, left my house, came back 30 minutes later and asked to get back together.

I agreed and she changed her mind.

A few days later we got food together - in the drive thru she 'joked' about getting back together. Once again I agreed. We kissed multiple times and everything felt okay.

She changed her mind again. 

Then I went on vacation for a week or so, before I left she said she wanted to try again when I got back, ""just dinner but nothing serious""

I came home and we saw each other. We spent about 2 hours together and everything felt perfect. I kept saying that I should go home and she kept saying I could stay if I wanted to - ended up doing some sexual things in the car with her. She goes home and says she doesn't regret anything, things felt amazing. Overall a lot of the stuff in my life has been much better - I honestly feel happy. I just want her to be with me again, as the times in my life where I havent struggled with depression (from last april to this april/may) we were so happy.

She gets home and we text all day for a couple days, then I brought up getting back together again. She told me to 'just stop' and I got angry and accused her of using me for sex, food, and my netflix. (She asked for my netflix password, I didnt give it to her, and she guessed it and used it anyways. It really ticked me off.)
I told her that if she wanted me in her life it had to be in a relationship. I promised myself I wouldnt message her.

36 hours later, I turn up at a Walmart near her work and tell her if she wants to have some subway, she can meet me there when she gets off. She got mad at me and told me she didn't love me, that I've done this to myself, she's happy without me, and several other hurtful things. She ended off with telling me to get out of her life because I'm obsessed with her.

I feel a lot of the stuff that's happened to us has been out of our control. The virus and everything else happening has played a role in separating us - her dad cheated on her mom in May, among a bunch of minor things that added up.

One of my friends died in a murder-suicide early May and it contributed a lot to my depression. She denies ever being happy in the relationship, but after 4 years, I know when she's happy and when she isn't. Part of the reason things went downhill is because I'd ask her what was wrong and we wouldn't communicate. I didn't know how to help her so I forced her to go to therapy. I just didn't know how to help, but she interpreted that as me not wanting to deal with her.

Over 4 years, I've known to tell when she's happy. She hasn't been happy in months (since march) - and when we were together after we broke up was the happiest I've seen her in a long time. She recently made a post on reddit talking about how lonely she is.

I feel like we can make it work, she doesn't. She doesn't think I can change because I've never changed for good before. (I was always forced to change, never made the decision myself)

So I've accepted that it's over. I don't know how to move on from her. Part of me hates her for stringing me along for a month, the other part of me knows that this isn't her. Part of me wants to just be friends. Part of me wants to block her and never speak to her again. Overarchingly, I just want to go back to last Christmas, where I was happier than I've ever been in my entire life. Or last October, September, even January, and not do the things I did that hurt us.

How do I move on? Literally everything feels right in my life except not being with her, and everytime I think about her it brings me down. I miss her so much, and I'm blaming myself.

Tldr; how do I get over an ex?",07Jul2020,1
909,"I’m really insecure when it comes to my body or appearance my boyfriend says I look fine but every one else always has something else to say like oh that’s too revealing oh you too skinny you probably don’t eat that’s why you so skinny and small , so whenever anyone makes comment about me it makes me feel even more insecure what should
I do",07Jul2020,2
910,"
Honestly im not even sure how to put this into a post but im gonna try my best to make it as coherent as possible.  

My dad has always been very insecure and struggled with mental health but has always denied it. He also has a very large ego which he hides his insecurities behind. 

As a kid my dad was always really good at guilting me. He would always make comments like “youre gonna find a boy and then leave me,” “youre gonna grow up and not love me,” stuff like that. Made me feel really shitty as a kid but I figured that my dad was an adult and he was just sad I was growing up. 

I thought that my dad would eventually come to terms with me growing up but its just getting worse. I moved back to my hometown with my boyfriend after college and now that I’m close to them they pretty much want me to see them once a week, which I pretty much do but they don’t see it that way. (If I just see them for a quick minute to pick up some stuff they see it as errands rather than spending time with them)

I wouldn’t say that my boyfriend doesn’t like my dad, but he sees the way that my dad guilts me, talks down to me, and talks down to others, which makes him hesitant to have a full and open relationship with my dad. My dad also has no reason to think that my boyfriend doesn’t like him other than an argument we had with my parents a year and a half ago. During the argument my boyfriend said some stuff along the lines of not wanting to have a close relationship with my dad, my dad was really hurt by this. But my boyfriend apologized to my dad multiple times for what he said, my dad still isn’t over it. 

Yesterday I had to take my car in to get repairs, so my dad picked me up from the shop. I spent about 3 hours with him at his house. There was good conversation but majority of the conversation was my dad asking me why my boyfriend doesn’t like him, what my dad can do to make my boyfriend like my dad, why don’t I hang out with my dad anymore, I have replaced my dad with my boyfriend, and other stuff along those lines. One of the things that keeps repeating in my head is that he said “yeah summers aren’t fun anymore because I used to have an adventure buddy. But now my adventure buddy has found her own buddy.” He is constantly making comments like this, that I don’t spend time with him anymore because I don’t want to see him. Or I don’t love him. One time when we were out at a store he said to me “You don’t love me anymore.” I said of course I loved him and he just ignored it, and that was the end of that conversation. That wasn’t the first time he’s said that though, he has said that to me so many times I’m kinda just numb to it now.

We’ve hung out with my parents multiple times, all of which have been fun and enjoyable. But yesterday my dad told me he feels like my boyfriend and I just wait for him to say something bad so we can go home and talk about how horrible of a person he is. I have NO IDEA why he thinks we would do this. My boyfriend and I aren’t the type of people to gossip like that and I feel like my dad is just pushing his insecurities onto me. 

Im honestly so emotionally exhausted from all the guilt that he puts onto me. I only hung out with him for 3 hours yesterday but for the rest of the day after I left I just felt down and out of it. Like my dad doesn’t think I love him anymore even though he has absolutely no reason to think that, and theres nothing I can do to convince him otherwise. Even today I just feel down and I feel drained. Its hard to even spend time with just him anymore because its just him asking me what he can do different and all I can say is “its just in your head dad we don’t think that, I love spending time with you” My boyfriend thinks that I would really benefit from therapy but I feel like nothing is going to change until something with my dad changes. But I feel like my dad is never going to change. Has anyone had a situation similar to this? Has anyone gone to therapy for problems with their parents and was it helpful? Any advice or even thoughts from a different perspective is appreciated because I just feel lost. Im also happy to answer any questions in the comments.",07Jul2020,1
911,"This is going to be a bear of a post, as I'm feeling so incredibly adrift, and have no idea which direction to paddle. Let me know if there is a better sub for this sort of macro advice.

Recently I came to a crossroads in my life, and quit my pretty decent art job of nine years due to some very serious burnout, depression, and general job dissatisfaction. I knew it was going to be a hard path, but I had lots of alternative goals, both still in the art field, as well as not. But basically I didn't have an exact decision of what I wanted to do next, aside from to take some time to myself.

A few months after quitting, I found my depression had dimmed, I was no longer feeling suicidal, and I was slowly regaining my desire to do art again. But also I had spent a lot of time exploring other outlets, like cooking, guitar, fermentation and even mycology. I was feeling energized by all of these outlets, as well as old art passions like traditional painting/illustration, or possibly teaching. I was starting to see seriously pursuing all of these as potential careers (except guitar, that's just for me), and I could envision all the potential futures...

...But the problem didn't occur to me until recently. I've been trying to pursue ALL of these things simultaneously.

One week I'm seriously into the idea of freelance illustration, the next week, I'm studying business startup prospects for growing mushrooms or micro-greens. I'll go from working on an oil painting all day, to writing a game design document for an indie game the very next day. Then I get tired and frustrated and want to go get any job at a restaurant or something and just keep all these ambitions as hobbies.

I feel like a teenager again, except I'm almost 34, and it's seriously not that cute anymore. I'm also a year past my quit date, and I feel like I have little physical to show of my little ""sabbatical."" I know my problems stem from a general indecision and fear of commitment/failure, but I can't seem to shake these even while aware. I feel like I'm seriously lacking the tools to find any sort of focus in my life, and I'm seriously wondering if I have some form of un-diagnosed ADHD. 

I know I should probably pick just one goal to focus on, but my brain seems completely numb to the idea. Even if I pick something, it only seems to last a week before the dedication just fades away in all the noise of my brain. It's like I'm writing with chalk in the rain. And the idea of focusing on one pursuit, only for it to fail, fills me with such dread that it further fuels the rapid directional shifts. 

I'm just frustrated and completely at a loss. Each week that passes I become more and more paralyzed by indecision and fear of failure. I need some serious concrete tools. Something actionable that I don't just put on a shelf in my brain to forget. Any leads would be appreciated.",07Jul2020,1
912,"For a back story my parents are divorced. When I (f23) was 9, my mom threw my dad out from our house bc he was cheating on her. Me and my younger sister were seeing him once in a while, we had a good contact with him. When he visited we had a good time and he always bought sth for me and my sister. 
I'm in a relationship of 6 years and I'm planning a wedding that's happening next year. My dad didn't like ma fiance(m26) when we started dating and he didn't get to know him bc of how rarely me and my dad would see each other. We're living an hour away from each other now. But the times when my dad was seeing me and my fiance  he didn't seem to not like him honestly.
Two days ago me, my fiance and my mom visited my dad to talk about the wedding. Since there were also my aunts and grandma, my mom took my dad aside and started the topic. I didn't hear everything but from what I heard my dad said that he was not seeing himself in that situation, that this is my and my fiance's decision and our thing to do so he won't help and give us some money. And it sounded like he won't attend his daughters wedding. It crushed me.

Did he say it because he may not like my fiance? Shouldn't parents support their kids in everything they do and try to make them happy? I don't know what to think of him right now.

913,"I really feel lonely and left alone. During my school days, I had a lot of issues with my classmates. I was an only child n tried really hard to fit in. I was still made fun of and nobody ever took me seriously. My parents did notice the change in my behavior and once casually asked one of my teachers who was from our hometown how I'm in class n if I'm okay? The teacher read it as I was being bullied and in class she started giving me extra attention which I really hated. It just made the name calling and teasing worse. 

In high school I changed schools. I really tried this time. I don't know why nobody likes me. Even my roommate (I stayed in hostel) spread rumours about me that I snitched on something. I swear to god I never snitched on anyone. I really really liked all my batchmates. I was told directly to face not to interfere in things as well as not to keep asking ""what happened""?. I really don't know how to respond. You are sitting around me and talking about a topic (e.g. something funny a lecturer said in class) what should I do? Then why talk sitting next to me? 

I'm not understanding what I'm doing wrong. In college I kept to myself. Made sure never to interfere in anything. Made sure I always maintained my boundaries. Whole college knows me because I did have important roles (e.g. think class representative but at a placements cell level) but I have no friends to share my feelings. I have one friend. We got close as were from the same place. 

She always insults my choices. I had a boyfriend during my third year of college. She said he was useless and always said whatever he did was a red flag. We broke up in final year. I know I'm not the prettiest but she whenever she says openly that I'll probably stay single for long because of my fat ass, it really hurts. I gift her a lot during her birthday, yes I'm atleast trying to buy friendship, n she doesn't even give me a card on mine. 

We still stay in touch n past few weeks we have been in contact more n ik it's because her birthday is approaching. 

I feel left alone. Everyday when my colleagues make plans with their friends or mention how it's going to be a boy's day. I feel really jealous. It makes me sad. I want to have friends to talk to when I'm low. I want to have friends when I want to share something I achieved at work. I want to know what I'm doing wrong.",07Jul2020,1
915,"Let’s call my friend, “A”. 
when we first met we were inseparable. We had a very strong friendship for 6 months, then had a falling out. (I don’t remember what the falling out was about). I broke ties with her for 6 months before giving it another try. The second time we were close again, but she chose to invite a particularly bad friend around me every time we’d hangout. I wouldn’t normally let a friend of a friend distort my view on the friendship but her friend accused me of stealing from, “A”. I talked with A about it and she assured me she knew I wasn’t stealing, and for some reason A decided it was ok that her friend stuck around despite her secretly stealing from her (she thought her friend was a kleptomaniac and excused it all of the time). Eventually I cut ties with, “A” again because I was accused of something I didn’t do, and she wouldn’t stand up for me and would constantly allow this friend to orchestrate lie after lie. It was toxic and I didn’t want to allow her friend to create drama in my life anymore. A few months later, I made amends with, “A” again and things seemed better than ever. Her friend was finally out of the picture, and A finally came to terms with how toxic the friend was. Then she began a relationship that isn’t healthy, she’s vented to me many times about this SO. I’ve given her my honest opinion and supported her through it. On the other hand, she has a strict BF she lives with as well that dictates her free time. She essentially tells me every day she can’t leave the house otherwise she would be in trouble with the BF to which I have been patient about even when she’s cancelled plans many times. Every day for the past 2 weeks she has canceled plans with me or hasn’t followed through with them. (We would normally see each other Atleast once a week). We keep in touch frequently and she has admitted to seeing the SO (not the BF) instead of following through with our plans. I don’t give her a hard time about it, I just try to be patient and hold my tongue. But she has continuously chosen this toxic relationship over me. I’ve tried to be patient and understanding of her circumstances, but at the same time I have asked for her support. I understand I cannot demand her support and she has her own life to deal with. So she chooses to be there for me when it’s convenient for her. 
I don’t know if I should even bother talking to her about it because she’s done this before and I cut ties with her for a long time before I thought I was ready to try the friendship again. I promised this time I wouldn’t leave because she is a genuinely good person and I value her, but this doesn’t feel right. 
I woke up feeling an immense amount of grief.  It feels like I lost my best friend again.

917,"My brother’s girlfriend bought herself an engagement ring and a wedding band and is actively wearing them.  The other day she wore them while shopping for her bridesmaid gown for my wedding and was holding out her hand and mine next to it and asking store attendants questions like “Aren’t our rings beautiful”? I was kind of weirded out by this becuase it seemed kind of like she wanted to show off that she had a wedding band on before me or something like that? Which is really weird because I’m literally getting married next week lol. 

Anyways, I feel a little betrayed by this. I’m very close to my brother and don’t think anybody should pretend to be engaged or married to somebody when they’re not. She was even planning their wedding already. However, the twist in this is that she has been with him a long time, like 10 years and he’s pretty much raised some of her kids.

919,"My (30F) boyfriend (37M) lost his job after being a head manager there for 9 years. It’s a local non profit organization and is a pillar in our community. This morning, with no notice, he was let go. They didn’t provide any reasons other than they thought he broke a plate several weeks ago and didn’t fess up. He never had any write ups, talking tos, or any of the classic indicators that they were dissatisfied with his performance. He has received bonuses and raises every year since being promoted to manager. So, over all, we are devastated, upset, and confused. Like any younger couple these days, we relied on both incomes to make it. 

There are some things we can do. He is currently applying for unemployment compensation and will begin working on his resume, which he hasn’t touched in almost a decade. We are feeling very bleak about being able to find a comparable job in times when unemployment is so high, job opportunities are at a low, and the bills continue to flow in.

We'll call the person who is addicted to drugs ""Harry""

Anyways, soon after both of Harry's parents unfortunately  passed away due to cancer he became pretty depressed and insanely religious. He soon was offered drugs from a close friend and instantly became addicted. Me and my other friends noticed massive personality changes and mood swings from him that we have never had seen before and were really concerned. We tried to help but Harry would always get mad for suggesting he did drugs and denied it entirely. Eventually, he promised he would stop taking drugs but sadly he never actually did. After multiple heavy arguments we got in contact with the Nhs to rehabilatate Harry but he was still denying doing drugs and was mad for bringing rehabilitation up. Thankfully, soon he finally accepted it and once rehabilitated stopped doing drugs for several months.Flash forward to present day where he is once again addicted to drugs.

Please, I beg give me advice I'm tired of this. Me and my friends have always been supporting him to stop but should i shout? Should I yell? I don't know what I can do anymore to help him.

He keeps going on how he's God's third eye and religious talks and what not even saying his father died to watch over him which is fucking insane. He plays songs, sometimes religious ones but whatever the song he will sing it and bump the volume to the max no matter the time even night which fucking pisses me off. He also stares at the wall and day dreams randomly and stops and stares in between conversation. Also before rehabilitatation he made conspiracies that the government where watching him and called out his friend and even me for being a spy. He won't cook and even if he will it will take an insanely long time. If you want any info please tell me in the comments I'm counting on you guys so don't hold back.

Also Harry has kids and rely on there mother to cook .The kids haven't said anything to Harry concerning drugs. The reason I am not going to contact the Nhs for now is because Harry's children and wife heavily suffered due to Harry not working for around  6  months and he tried to extend the deadline with the excuse of his parents death and stuff and his children don't deserve this punishment

932,"hello guys,i feel pretty helpless at the moment. I dont have a reason to stay alive. I just dont know what to do.  
First of all: Im 14 years old(pretty young, i know) and i basically just feel bad for around 1-2 months now. you guys might think something like that im just fake depressed but i really have a lot of reasons for all my sad emotions. Well, it all started when i was 6-7 years old. I was in primary school and it already started in the first year: almost my whole class bullied me. I never did anything against it so that went on until high school and I never told anyone something of my problems. The stupid reason for that is just because im really short. Now im 14 and im 4´11. and im still really, really short. So when i got into highschool i was suicidal. I thought i was on a better way but those hopes ended when i fell in love for the first time. i REALLY REALLY loved her. When i first told her about my feelings she acted like she loves me too. 5 hours later she just started to ignore me what hurt me so f\*cking much. A year   later i started to feel better and i found a new friend. He was the best friend i ever had until he told me around 1 year later that im annoying and unfunny. So everybody was chilling with him and i was just alone. those times were really hard for me. Since than i never really felt better anymore. I lost the contact to my last few friends and now i got nobody. There are actually many people in school that like me but when we all get home i stay home alone while they are meeting. They dont even ask me if i wanna come with them too. Im just sitting home and start crying if i see their insta stories.  
I literally dont trust myself to talk to people online because i sound like 10 or something and many people just make fun of me. Everyday im hearing jokes over my voice or my height and it just really hurts me. There are a few more shitty things that happened to me im just too lazy to write them all down.

933,"Hey,

So I work at a pizza establishment and my coworkers seem ok/nice most of the time. However, most there (though not everyone) like to sh*t talk each other. It’s all in good fun, and I don’t take personal offense usually. But it bothers me for some reason. It just doesn’t really feel right to me. Plus the managers like to make sexual innuendo jokes too (nothing crazily overt), which is weird to me. One manager frequently pranks me too, which again, I don’t take personal offense to, but it gets annoying after awhile and feels childish. It’s starting to get to the point where I’m actually losing sleep over it, believe it or not, as I feel emotionally not good working there.

However, I’ve heard horror stories of people working in fast food with terrible, manipulative managers etc., and I’m worried most fast food environments are like this, and it can only be worse.

937,"I have no desire to connect with my parents.

In the beginning of this year, my parents sat me down and expressed concerns about my relationship. They said that they saw signs of emotional abuse and that my BF was controlling and ever since the past year, I have changed into someone who is quiet and submissive. 

Although the change that they saw was because I have been going through major life transitions the past year, with relocating out of state for my  job and moving in with my BF. I felt stuck at work and was away from friends and family. 

However, my mother took it really far and started spouting out all these horrible allegations of my bf. That it is odd that he holds my hand all the time, and he probably does so to control me and that he is a narcissist who is going to kill me and them. And my parents have been comparing to the controlling, abusive relationships they have been through. 

They have said horrible, vile statements about our relationship such as drug use. To be clear, we don’t do drugs. And we have had our bumps in the road but it wasn’t how they described it at all. And I told my parents that I can see where they are coming from but my relationship isn’t like that. They really broke me to a state of no repair. That led me to have no desire to connect with them at all. We have had cycles of them trying to be understanding and learning what I am actually going through but then they would pull a 360 and not believe anything I am saying and would turn it against me. They would say I am changing the story. The fact is that they keep launching into tirades about my relationship and telling me to tell my BF that he can burn in hell. I have not said much to them, because they believe what they want to believe no matter what I say. It has gotten to the point that I no longer want a relationship with them.
 
If they are going to talk to me that way, why should I bother? And my silence hurts them and leads them to the assumptions that I am being controlled. They say that my BF has caused me to distance from them, but I have distanced from them because of their behavior towards me. From changing the locks in the house to bringing finances into the problem to cursing me out, I no longer have the desire to be close with them but the complete opposite.

And my BF and I have broken up, because of this situation. And they fail to see they are a large of the problem. This has gone on for half a year now. 

My father is hurting because of a physical condition and my mother is not doing well. They say that they were just parenting, and that I have been a problem with my relationship, and I should call and visit more often. And that I am a terrible daughter for not doing so. 
 
But I really have no desire to connect because of their behavior and actions. How do I handle this?",07Jul2020,1
938,"hello. My period happened 2 days ago. Last night me and my boyfriend decided to have no condom sex. He wasn’t really in me sense it was our first time. He wasn’t in for long because I was fearing pregnancy. So, I made him “pull out” (he wasn’t really in). I’m just nervous about pre cum. I’m on birth control. I have been for a long time. Due to bad periods. I always take it at night just not at the same time (same hour). I went on vacation before my period and experience some spotting. Not sure if it was due to time change or what. I also don’t take my last line the “sugar pills”. This morning after what happened last night, my stomach was upset. Not sure if it’s due to being so stressed and looking up all of this stuff fearing pregnancy. I know it wasn’t the best idea to do this if I wasn’t ready. Just my boyfriend is going into the military and has been moving pretty fast in our relationship. Anyways thank you so much for reading this. Advice would be so much need thanks. :(:",07Jul2020,1
939,"Im 21 F and I cant seem to get over a person I had a huge crush on in High School (who will be mentioned as HSC). Also I apologize if this is long but I feel the information is relevant.

Background: HSC was a senior when I was a sophomore. I first noticed him in my freshman year and decided to take initiative to find out who he was and reach out to him over social media. We messaged each other, hung out outside of school a few times, and ate lunch together every now and then. The more I got to know he the more I liked him, as he is (still) a genuine, intelligent, and artistic person.  I also began to look up more information about him online so I could find out what he liked and try to bond over similar interests to get him to like me back (as one does). I ended finding some of his writing and some music he composed and crushed harder, as it was truly beautiful. Anyways... fast forward and I admitted my crush on him the same summer he graduated. He rejected me, but I kept in touch with him because I still valued his friendship. I also kept him on social media so I could keep up with his creative/musical endeavors.

Several months after his rejection I felt like I was moving on and in the second half of my junior year I began to pursue another individual. That person ended up liking me back and we started dating. We are still dating and will be celebrating 5 years in February 2021. I enjoy our relationship and appreciate my partner.

Here's my problem though: sometimes I still think about HSC and what my life might be like if we ran into each other and pursued each other in present day (in these daydreams I'm single of course). I'll have a lovely or intimate dream about HSC and then look up what he's doing and the crush is reignited. HSC and I message each other from time to time (platonically) and I would be horrified if he knew how much I still think about him after these kinds of dreams. I admire him greatly. I don't know what I would do if I actually ran into him again, probably hide or run away out of pure anxiety and nervousness. I also feel like my crush isn't entirely related to him anymore, though the person I've created and lusted after in my dreams is based off of his existence.

Also I would like to note that this has only been a problem in recent years. In the first years of my relationship with my current partner I did not really interact with HSC in dreams or conversations... 

Has anyone else experienced this kind of thing? What did you do to get over the crush? I don't want to cut HSC out of my sphere of social media because like I said he's doing interesting things and I value the few times a year we talk to each other as friends. Am I nuts here? Please help",07Jul2020,1
940,"So uh,, a few days back me and my boyfriend went out and bought some weed and got high. It was his first time smoking, and he never gets in trouble. I on the other hand, am pretty experienced with things of this nature. He said if he took it home he wouldn't be caught, and I agreed cause if I got caught with it again, I would end up back in drug classes or getting kicked out of the house.   
Well.. it took them all of 2 days to find it. I guess he never even took it or our bong out of his bag so,, he made it pretty easy on them. As expected, they told him he had to dump me. But I uh.. am actually willing to get sober over this. Seeing him act like me ruined the trip and made me realize I didn't want to do this anymore, especially not with him. Does anyone have any advice on how I should go about discussing this with his parents ? Or should I just give up all together and not try ?",07Jul2020,2
941,"The only thing I feel “guilty” about is my lack of guilt. I notice whenever I hurt someone or act selfishly, it bothers me on an intellectual level, but emotionally it doesn’t bother me at all. I’m not emotionless at all, I’m very emotional, but I feel like my empathy for others is like a switch I can turn on and off and I literally just don’t feel bad for doing bad things. I want to be a good person, I want to feel guilt. I generally love a good life and act like a good person, but it feels so hard to not act selfish when I don’t feel any guilt for my actions. I don’t want to be this way. How should I deal with this?

P.S. I am very empathetic to most people (people describe me as warm and loving) but feel like I can “turn off” that empathy for most people at will (not family but non family easily yes), and while being empathetic with most people, I just wont feel any guilt when I do something bad.

943,"TLDR: Boyfriend moved his dog in to my house. Within two weeks the dog attacked me five times (the last being a deep bite), attacked my cat once, attacked a skunk, and killed a gopher. Has history of attacking my boyfriends sister and father. He’s threatening to leave me because his dog can’t stay and he refuses to rehome him. I don’t know what to do. 


My boyfriend and I are coming up on a year next week, we’ve never been the type to fight much because up until now we agree on generally everything. 

I just purchased my first home at the end of May and had my boyfriend move in with me. I have a cat (F, black cat, very small, 9 years old) and he has a dog (M, pit bull, medium size, 7 years old) who were also tagging along. We got everything set up to bring his dog home two weeks after we moved in to give my cat time to get a little acclimated. We set up a baby gate to divide the house because my boyfriend was unsure how his dog would react to her (my cat). 

A little background on his dog who I had only been able to meet a few times throughout our relationship. My boyfriend and his dog lived at my boyfriends parents house with them. The dog unfortunately was very territorial of my boyfriend and was causing problems in their household as well. From what I’ve gathered from his relatives and the little glimpse of it I’ve seen he would attack my boyfriends father by jumping/scratching, aggressive barking, and occasional nipping. His father though on the other hand did try instigating at times so I wasn’t sure how much of this to take into consideration. However my boyfriends dog just the few times I was there would go after and pin down my boyfriends mother’s dog whose significantly smaller than him. He would also constantly push between you and my boyfriend if you were anywhere near him, shove you back, or r e l e n t l e s s l y hump you! Which may sound silly, but when I say relentless I MEAN it. He would grab onto your leg and as soon as you pry him off of you he’d start up and would do this for hours. My boyfriend kept halfway gaslighting me about it or brushing it off as the household itself just being very small (which it was) which would cause him to have pent up energy/be stressed and act out. 

I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt so my boyfriend ended up moving his dog in like I had mentioned before. Immediately he continued the shoving thing to me, separating us whenever he could, getting too hyped up to where he legitimately would stay up however late I did to watch me around my boyfriend. He’d snarl at me, left scratches that had left dark bruising, then started to fake nip me. He would jump up on my arm and loosely mouth it without applying any pressure. I obviously became frustrated and concerned for my own safety, but anytime I tried addressing this to my boyfriend he’d gaslight me about it and act like he wasn’t aware. Let’s skip ahead a week and his dog had managed to attack me four times with the jumping up, scratch/bruising, and mouthing without me instigating. We had obviously fought during this whole time which led to him begrudgingly (finally) getting a dog trainer for his dog. The first day of the dog trainer coming his dog broke through our baby gate and attacked my cat. Fortunately my boyfriend was able to pull him off before he could do anything, but I was an absolute wreck because my cat physically pissed herself in fear! My boyfriend still deflected and avoided this and would threaten to leave me if he had to give away his dog. Which MIND you he could have just brought his dog back to his mothers house where he works five actual minutes away from to visit everyday. 

Three days after the trainer came we went to do a daily training session and my boyfriend suggested I try it so we can start getting his dog accustomed to me as an “alpha”. Before I could even say anything he went after my wrist and wouldn’t let go till my boyfriend dragged him off of me.  My boyfriend brought his dog back to his mothers house just for her to inform him she won’t be allowing his dog to stay after his father (who just had surgery) gets home from the hospital because of his dogs history with him. My boyfriend is now at a loss and is (in my opinion) being highly ignorant about all of this. He is blaming everything on me for not allowing his dog to stay after all of that, threatening “I’d rather be homeless with my dog than find another home for him.” I found out over the weekend he lied about his dog never attacking anyone before me. His sister informed me she went to visit their parents two years ago and upon walking in the door my boyfriends dog latched onto her ankle and needed to be prayed off leaving wounds so bad through leather boots she had to get stitches. At this very moment we are fighting about this because he’s still insisting he’s going to “find something to do” so he can keep him. At this point I’m at my wits end with this situation because he’s refusing to listen to anyone or anything outside himself. Every person that’s ever encountered or lived with his dog has feared him. I used to volunteer at shelters so I’m more than ready to ask around for a good home or sanctuary for him since he has behavioral issues, but my boyfriend is being unreasonable.  

I was hoping someone out there could have suggestions for me. Am I being unreasonable?",07Jul2020,2
944,"
Isn’t that just a nicer way of saying “fuck off?”

We didn’t burn a bridge but he practically said right now a friendship couldn’t work out between us other than texting and I interpreted this as not caring anymore. For a while I wanted to do other things but he’s been guarded for personal reasons (it did turn to a one sided crush at one point that I moved on from) and he admitted he hasn’t not enjoyed texting, but only did it to be polite. So I was upset but I don’t want to stress it and find new connections.

So I posted something on my insta story being upset about something unrelated a week later and he responded to it defending me. I didn’t respond, but I’m wondering why he’d say all those things about not caring about being friends and then would contact me.",07Jul2020,1

I’ve never been diagnosed. To be honest I’ve never talked to anyone about this. Just few friends. For the last few months maybe a year or so, I’ve been inexplicably sad. I’m a teenager so I don’t know if this is just me going through puberty or if I actually have a mental illness. Some days I feel happy. Most days though I feel sad and alone. I’m an only child. 

To be honest I feel like there is no reason why I should be depressed. I live in a nice house in a decent neighbourhood. I have two parents who are happily together. There hasn’t been a tragic event that occured to me recently yet I feel sad every day. 

I don’t know anymore. Sometimes I joke about suicide but recently I’ve been thinking more about it. I shouldn’t. Nothing bad has happened to me and yet for some reason I feel this way.

At the moment I’m living with my aunt and uncle for personal reasons, so I decided to tell my uncle about him on Sunday. He was fine with it as long as he didn’t take advantage of me and I did things that I felt comfortable with. I told this to this boy, and he told me he’d never take advantage of me, but he then told me he’d probably take advantage of someone else. This along with the other things he’s said about s*xual assault gave me absolute chills, but I was afraid he’d get mad at me and tell me I was sensitive if I called him out on it. I told this to my aunt, uncle, and my cousins at the dinner table while we were eating take out, and they told me they were very concerned about his words and were very concerned about his previous actions I told them about regarding him.

i’m only 15, a freshman in high school. i am fed up with feelings helpless in our current climate. i was thinking about how it’s difficult for teens and adults to that during this time how they can help, and that led me to think: 

What if there was an organization run by poeple willing to put in time and take a stand to  teach others how they can help with the problems that surround us in the US and the KC area? we could create a free website and social media accounts where we could have outreach where we could teach poeple how to take action in the community!

for example, 

-a page of petitions to help make change, 

-information on covid, police brutality, voting, etc.

-how to register to vote or to reach out to your state or regional government representatives

-how to support POC, LGBT, or less fortunate communities in need of aid.

-bringing light to things happening around the state or country

-how to support local businesses and black owned businesses

-volunteer opportunities

-we could sell shirts or bracelets or merchandise like that to support a fund of the month

960,"I’ve known him online since April and we’ve talked almost every single day. The first time was worse I’ll admit. That time he just disappeared without a trace and messaged me a week later saying he wanted a fresh start. So of course I was extremely happy he was back but apparently he cut off all his other friends and I was the only one he came back to. It was a little suspicious but he seemed normal (he was acting weird before he left) and happy so I was happy. 

This lasted for maybe 2-3 weeks, us being happy and back to normal. Last night he started work and was stressed so I spent an hour on a drawing to cheer him up and let him call me in the parking lot since it was dark and he was alone. We talked again when he got home and all was good and normal. Then he left me with some other random dude we were playing video games with and told me to make friends which annoyed me (he did this once before too) and made me think he just wanted to get rid of me. 

Which I guess is true because a little while later he came back for a few rounds, said his mic broke, and then typed bye I’m doing something else. Then he asked me if it was wrong to not want to play with someone anymore and I asked if it was me and he said I didn’t say anyone. He then said bye and told me that he was ok but I may not hear from him for awhile because he wants to limit his time online. I didn’t think limiting online time meant blocking and unfriending me for the second time even after I told him the first time he did it made me feel like shit. I don’t know how he went from happily talking to me to abandoning me literally 2 hours later.

But even after all this I still can’t be mad at him. I’m annoyed definitely and upset but I still am hoping for him to come back. My friends all say I shouldn’t give him another chance but I can’t help it whenever we talk it just feels so happy and perfect and then he just leaves.",07Jul2020,1

She has talked to me about wanting a long distance relationship while I explained to her that I don’t think something like that would work and that I see her more as a friend. after I rejected her she wanted to date me even more. 

So some time goes by and I noticed that she has been responding way less to my messages so I ask her why that is and she explains to me that she is trying to talk to me less so she stops being in love with me. 

Now I understand why she would want to stop loving me since she knows a relationship between us isn’t going to happen, but I feel like the way she does it is destroying our relationship we have together as a whole. 

We both agreed that we still want to be friends but it now takes her more than a day to respond to one message and it’s really demotivating to even keep talking with her this way.

If it is an event I am hosting or have any say in, I always try to make sure everyone is invited. We have a fairly large friend group, so depending on the activity it’s not always practical to have all twelve or so people invited. I hate that he feels that way, and sometimes it’s made me feel guilty that I was invited and he wasn’t that I will come up with an excuse to not go to the event. I’ve suggested that he talk with one of the friends that hosts the smaller events as I don’t think the hoster knows how being excluded makes our other friend feel and I think it could be a productive conversation. Excluded friend feels like there is something more personal involved, but he’s not ever the only person from the friend group to not be invited to these occasional things.

968,"25 (f) I feel really lonely and I do have friends, but I feel I am either not important to them, they are too boring or too busy. I know this guy I really like talking too, but he has sooooo many friends, so we don't really hang out. We text every day. I have another friend who only really cares about his girlfriend. Two friends who are really busy. Two friends who live far away, so I don't really see any of my friends except for maybe once a month. It kind of sucks. I used to have 3 close friends I would see often, but they were really toxic and it was codependent friendships. I am happier now alone than having toxic friends that bring me down, but sometimes I get really lonely I get depressed. I know the easy answer is to just make friends, but I think to build solid healthy friendships takes time. I also don't want to fall into another toxic friendship, so i am cautious about who I let into my life. In the meantime, how do I not let the loneliness get to me? I live with my family, so I am definitely not alone. I don't feel like I can talk to them, but at least physically I am not alone.",07Jul2020,2

973,"CONTEXTS 
We are 4 childhood friends and one of us got a girlfriend 4 years ago. We understood that he would have less time to hangout with us know but is was ok, when you are in love you only want to spend time with the one you love. 
 The time went by but he never got around to be with us. He only had time to hang with us perhaps 2 times a year and like spontaneous. You could never make plans with him because he always had an excuse. He stop calling for a long time. 
 There is a exception to this he doesn’t call us thing, he calls us when he needs help. This spring he called me because he wants to start studying and he needed to do a math class. He wanted me to do everything for him, when understood that I was just solving his homework. I asked him which chapter he was one he told that he haven’t read the book. This is just one of my examples. 
 This summer we gave up on him because his latest excuse is that he never spends enough time with his family(mom and dad). And that’s why he can’t be with us this summer. But when it was midsummer(we celebrate it in Sweden) our friends parents was going to be with one of ours family and celebrate it together. But then the excuse was that met them last weekend so he would rather be with his job. What an asshole. His childhood friends is only good enough when he needs help. Before this summer we blamed everything on his girlfriend because it’s been his excuse for 3 years. But now we know that we have been fools, his tools. 

yesterday  I talk to him. I wanted to tell him how we felt. I thought that if I told him that he would try to patch it up with us(because I am gullible). This summer was like his last opportunity to do so. I did not want him to wast 10+ years of friendship even though I was angry at him. The problem is I also told him what the other 2 felt and said too , he said he hadn’t noticed anything. “After our conversation said that, Now” he knows we are angry at him and he wants to fix it. 
The sad part is that I angered my 2 real friends, because if he was really our friend he would have done something by him self and not get the key handed to him on silver plate by me. A real friend would solve the issue by him self. Now my 2 other friends are real mad at my and they feel that they can’t trust me because I told him what they felt and had said about him. 

It was not my right to tell him how the others felt. I should’ve only have told him how I felt. I know what I did wasn’t right but I cannot undo it. What should I do, I don’t want my 2 other friends to be mad at me. 

What should I do?

Now, I’m normally not a bitch, but I’ve been without a bed for a couple of days now. It’s my first big purchase and the only reason I bought it was because it seemed like a good deal. I don’t think I should be compensated for everything that goes wrong in my life, but not a having bed for almost two weeks is a pretty big issue for me. I don’t know how to be proactive and demand compensation, I’m at my wits end sleeping on the floor.

I am  not delusional and I understand we are in the middle of a pandemic, but that thoughtfulness should be two ways in this instance, no?

When I came back I noticed she hadn't listened to me and hadn't fixed her mistakes.

I decided to just let it go for that night, but I let our boss know about what happened since he told me to keep and eye on her and train her since he noticed she was messing up a lot. He kind of shrugged it off since he isn't confrontational (which is why he didn't talk to her and instead is having me retrain her).

I have to work with her again in a few days. I'm sick of fixing her mistakes and having her not listen to me. I'm not afraid to point out her mistakes again, but I was wondering if there was a way to make her actually listen to me.

But then a couple of nights later I have woke up to him actually having sex with me.  I flipped the fuck out and would have left him that night but unfortunately he has a financial hold on me.

Well obviously I quickly realized that was a bad idea and started back taking them that without telling him. And last night I woke up with my shorts pulled down to my ankles.

982,"Okay so not expecting replies really since this sub Reddit isn't very active but I feel like shit I guess and don't really have anyone to talk to so maybe if I post this then perhaps someone might reply?
Like any reply will do I'm not fussy (:

But yeah I don't really know how to start, but I suppose first things first I hate my life really.
I guess I always have. So growing up was a little rough, my dad is a heroin addict, well a drug addict and criminal in general and he spent around the first 7 years of my life in prison. He got sentenced and was in jail between 2002-2009, and then ever since has been in and out of there. So it was just me my mum and my brother mostly, my mum would have different boyfriends over the years whom mainly were good to be fair but there was one who had abusive tendencies so that was a bit of a struggle, my mum has  mental issues mainly, has like depressive bi-polar episodes is the best way to describe it, my brother has pretty bad anger issues too so my house is always lively to say the least.

So around 2008 when I was around 7 years old I was molested by an older man he was probably at least 30, and I guess it's always stayed with me you know? I feel as if I can't really get over it, and maybe its sorta added to shaping me into the bad person that I eventually became. For a long time I didn't think about it, cause obviously I didn't know what was happening, I was just really confused and scared and didn't know the seriousness of the situation. My family don't know about it, I don't know why but I kept it to myself. Which in the long run was probably for the best, since that sorta thing is sorta shameful in a way if that makes sense? Obviously it's never the victims fault but a part of you always hates yourself for it and even blame yourself for it happening. Like it's hard to explain you could only really fully understand what that does to a child if it happened to you.

I used to self harm alot, I had issues with eating too, I was rather anorexic and  bulimic, would make myself puke up alot. Started around age 11 I think, I guess it was a way to cope, it was something I actually had power over for once, it felt like something I deserved, I deserved to be hurt, I thought I was fat as fuck, but in reality I was terribly malnurished if anything. This sorta lifestyle lasted for a while, not as long as some people but a few years. 

I'm also gay 18 year old boy btw, which is sort of a struggle for me, myself and my family are all Christian so it's an issue to say the least, obviously they don't know that I am, I could never tell them, how could I expect them to accept me when I can't even accept myself.

 Truthfully I hate being gay, which isn't to be confused with me hating homosexuality, because that's not true I really believe that being LGBTQ+ is fine, I support it completely like I think that love is the most powerful force in an existence, it's what makes us human. You can't help who you love, you can't change it, and everyone should feel free to be and pursue whatever they desire. But I just wish that I wasn't one you know? 

I wish I could just like women but I like men, you know like I really would want my own child one day but I just don't think I could actually fuck a woman. I don't know it's a hard situation man like I'll probably end up with one when I'm like 30 just to please my family and to have kids of my own unless I run away from my hometown and never come back. 

It's complicated like I think women are amazing, every girl I know is really kind, caring, affectionate and just lovely in so many ways. I think they're all proper beautiful, like beyond beautiful. But just not in a sexual way, more like when you see a beautiful flower, or a sunset, you think it's dazzling as it makes your eyes twinkle and your heart flutter but you don't want to put your dick in a flower obviously, I only want to put my dick into men, they're who I find sexually attractive.

 Fuck like I could maybe love a woman, truly care for her, be affectionate, and want to protect her from the world just like I could with any other person regardless of their gender but I just don't think I could have an actual sexual relationship with one, I couldn't please them sexually, I could only be properly sexual with men. 

It would make my life so much easier if I was staight though and that's the truth, I wouldn't have to live with the guilt of being a faggot,  that's what I call myself since I don't even call myself gay anymore, I feel as if you need to be proud of it to address yourself as gay or homosexual, but since I'm not really that proud I would address myself as being a fag. 

I wouldn't have to live with the fear of being found out by family, and then having to run away to dodge the conflict that it would cause. I wouldn't have to worry that I'd get beaten up or targeted for my sexuality, I wouldn't have to feel ashamed to hold my boyfriend's ( I don't have one btw :c ) in public since people would stare or attack us or shout abuse at us.  Yeah, being this way is just another reason to hate myself which is rather lame.

Then around when I was 13 or 14 I started getting into drugs, you know how it starts first a bit Weed and then it just progressed onto harder substances, Ecstacy, MDA, Ketamine, Cocaine, LSD, 2CB, Prescription Pills,  Lighter Fluid etc; Drugs sort of became my way of coping with everything, and over time it replaced my cutting and bulima, everytime I'd feel depressed, or like shit, or just fucking empty I'd go and get high somehow, it didn't matter what, it just hurt to be sober, sobriety was and still is really painful for me. I did Heroin for the first time when I was 16, no one knows about it, except maybe like one person, which I told that it was only once and that I didn't do anymore but that's a lie. I do still do it sometimes when I can get my hands on it. I hate myself for that too really since I became what I didn't wanna be, I always saw my dad like that and now its happened to me too.

But the worst part is the fact that I dragged alot of people down with me, peer pressured them into taking drugs with me, forcing addiction onto them. In school we'd sniff lines in the disabled toliets, go to class fucked up on drugs, the teachers knew, they definitely did how could they not? In my school you buy lines of MDMA for as little as like £2 for a line, so alot kids were doing that but the teachers never did anything about it, which was a shame maybe they could have done something I don't know. So I feel really guilty about that, since I know some of my friends I've ruined their lives as well as my own. It fucking hurts to look them in the eye and see that, and what hurts more is that they don't even seem to blame me for it and I really wish they would. Since that's what I deserve. 

I used to sell drugs, I'd buy them from the internet, import them into the country and sell them to people, usually people at school, kids younger than me, my friend's, I didn't care who. I just needed money to feed my own addiction. I'd take advantage of vulnerable people's addiction and exploit them for my own personal gain. This lasted a long time really. Dirty money. Dirty drugs.

 I didn't give a shit I was getting high and making money. I'd never go to class so I failed most of my exams. After leaving school when I was 16 reality hit me. I realised that I fucked up. Terribly fucked up. I looked around and saw everyone was looking forward to the future. Going to nice colleges and sixth forms, doing their A Levels planning on going to Uni. But not me. I'm jealous of everyone I know. Since they have everything I want, a plan, a future, positive freinds, nice family, not being poor, car, having relationships shit like that. The past two years watching everyone be happy and successful is just tortuous, it really hurts.

But I don't have anything like that, all I have now is my self hating mind, guilt, regret and my addiction.

You know it really hurts to know that no matter how much you love the drugs, they can never love you back, and that's so fucking lonely man. Painfully lonely, you know I haven't hugged someone in years. I literally haven't. I'm so desperate for some love, some affection anything.

I hate the way I look, I'm ugly, I have shit hair, shit teeth, no chin, no jaw, big ass nose, thin lips, scrawny, I look like such a crackhead, you can take one look at me and be able to tell that I abuse drugs.

I've been planning on running away, changing my name and just getting the fuck out of here.
Because I can't stay here.
It hurts me too much to see everyone be happy when I'm not. It hurts to much to see everyone achieve their goals when I don't.
It hurts too much to see everyone find love when all I can find is loneliness.
I just need to go, start a fresh. Be someone else. Not have to be me anymore.
Since I'm the worst person I know.

I just hate myself bro.
I'm an absolute fucking parasite, plagued by addiction, doomed to never ending sadness and loneliness.
I wish I could tell people about this, but I just lack the heart to do so.

I just stay at home each day feeling like this, getting high and suffering in silence. Which I accept that I created most of these circumstances in my life but I'm just sick of it, I'm just sick of me.

I'd do anything to change. I'd break my own fingers just to feel okay for even a mere moment. But I can't. I wish I wasn't an addict, I wish I had a future, I wish I felt okay about how I look, I wish I didn't hate myself, I wish I hadn't ruined lives, I wish someone would hold me, 
I wish someone loved me.
I wish I could cry, maybe it'd make me feel a little more human, a little more weightless but I'm so numb to it that it appears that all my tears have already dried up.

Anyway rant over.

985,"Ok so because of COVID, my place of work has closed and is starting to begin to reopen. It’s a sports club and bar where members play rugby/football (soccer)/cricket etc and have a quick drink before they go home. We also host venues for parties varying from Christmas discos to funeral wakings. 

The problem we’re facing now is that the building is run exclusively by a board of 60+ year olds who have never worked a day behind a bar in their lives and think they know the ins and outs of everything and that they know what customers want. 

They seem to think the building will run swimmingly if they fire Mum and the assistant manager and replace them with middle aged and older volunteers. Volunteers who have no idea what they’re doing and think and I highly doubt they’ll clean the bar to the extent I and other staff do at the end of the shift. Things like bleaching the drip trays, the dishwasher, mopping, etc all at 2 or 3 in the morning, sometimes later. Not to mention that they won’t be providing masks, hand sanitiser or social distancing restrictions. 

One of their sons is the General Manager who equally has no idea what he’s doing. His name is A. 

He’s an alcoholic fuck who regularly forgets to charge people for the use of the hall, doesn’t give customers vital information about said hall and is horribly creepy towards my mother (she’s the bar manager), by sexuality harassing her in person and over the phone. But he’s defended by the board for ALLLL if this. Either they don’t care about A acting the way he has or they simply can’t be bothered to deal with him. I think they’re leaning towards the former because he’s still working there on furlough illegally and my mum has received a letter warning her of her redundancy. Not to mention all the casual staff like me haven’t received anything from them. No updates, nothing. We have had no contact whatsoever from anyone. 

Mum and the assistant manager are going in for a meeting with them on Wednesday, I believe, to basically give them hell and possibly threaten them with legal action. 

Let me give you a list of some of the thing A has done:

-Couldn’t be more obviously staring at my mum’s boobs during work hours. 

-Grabbed the collar of her shirt to stop other men  from staring at her boobs. 

-Sending unsolicited flirty texts and sexts to her at all hours. 

-Sending pizza to the house for no reason. 

-Bragged about the size of his dick in casual conversation 

-Routinely, drunkenly calling her at 3am to tell her either that he’s hard or about to hang himself. 

-Threw a gin glass at the wall in a jealous, drunken rage after seeing Mum dare receive attention from other men at the bar. 

-We have no proof, but we know it was him who was loitering around our front yard in the middle of the night on at least 2 occasions. 

If anyone has any suggestions as to what Mum and the assistant manager could bring up or discuss at their meeting, we’re all ears",07Jul2020,1

Our country is lifting most of the restrictions at the moment and our summer vacation will start in a few weeks. Me (F. 15) and my friends (mostly boys around 15-18) will be out a lot, going shopping, eating ice cream, typical summer stuff!

A year ago tho a person badly hurt me by breaking my trust and almost killing me by pushing me in front of a car. It took a long time to recover mentally and I‘m slowly getting better! That person spread rumors about me, send people pictures (non nsfw but the people know how I look) and wont stop contacting / following me. He even tried to manipulate my relationship with my Bf but I blocked him on most social medias (where I knew his @) and mostly made new accounts + new nicknames everywhere. I didnt see him in a while but it will be very likely that I will meet him in our city and / or people who know him and believe rumors about me. My friends dont know his face (except my bf) and I‘m very likely to get anxiety attacks when I hear / see him or get approached by people who hear rumors bc I just want to forget about all of this. In the worst case he will follow me as soon as he sees me and wont leave me alone.

I don't know what to do because I need to talk to someone about my grandma's death and how it's affected me but I'm not sure how. My dad is always working and probably won't care.

996,"Im case it matters, I'm a 16m autistic kid, and my dad is not normally a sympathetic person.

Yesterday at dinner I went to grab the salt shaker from the cabinet and It slipped out of my hand and shattered on the counter. My dad yelled at me and said ""Why would you do that?!"" I said that it just slipped and I made a mistake. Since the only thing I know about how to clean up glass is that in home ec in middle school I was taught to get an adult if there was broken glass, I do not know how to clean up glass. I told my dad that I didn't know how to clean up glass but I'd clean it up myself if he told me what to do. He then said ""You can't be that stupid, what's wrong with you?"" (He then explained it to me and I cleaned it up but that part doesn't really affect the story)

I interpreted that as him calling me stupid because he's basically saying that I'm stupid if I don't know how to clean up glass, which I don't. Today I told my mom that I didn't like being called stupid by my dad and she told me that I interpreted what he said incorrectly.

998,"So this post may be long as I have been dealing with this for a while so I apologize in advance for the length. 

I (22F) recently got married to my wonderful husband (23M) and joined his friend group of two other guys that he hangs out with a lot. They showed interest and have gone as far as saying they want to be good friends with me so I was excited to be accepted into the group. 

As time went on though, I noticed that one of them (23M also) doesn't ever listen to me when I speak in the group and often cuts me off so he can talk. (He doesn't do this to the other males in the group). I didn't think much of it at first because this happens a lot to me in other friendships because I am a good listener. But every time I speak he shows disinterest and/or discomfort that I have a personality...at least that's how it feels. I have brought this up with my husband who hadn't noticed but since telling him has started to notice this behavior when we are hanging out with him. 

This friend likes to give me generic compliments that seem fake - as in he compliments what he thinks I am rather than getting to know me. For example, compliments my appearance because he thinks that's what girls want to hear or says, ""I bet you are a good singer,"" then when I try to say anything in response, ignores me and moves on. It's like he is giving me these compliments to show outwardly that he is a  nice guy but also shuns me at the same time. It feels like he is objectifying me as he treats me the way he treats most other girls that aren't in a friendship role. Like talking about me near me to my husband but doesn't want to really talk to me unless I am listening to all of his stories. 

Recently, my husband approached him one on one and mentioned that I was feeling uncomfortable because he ignores me and makes me feel unimportant by doing so. He didn't apologize or anything just mentioned that his ex gf used to feel the same way about him and that he did want to be good friends with me.

Immediately after that, he bought me a drink which was nice and also gave me some more of the fake objectifying compliments....but since then the behavior hasn't changed and he makes me feel like a burden to the group. 

Am I overreacting? How should I deal with this?",07Jul2020,1

That basically describes me.  I won’t get into details, but I live off a work’s comp settlement.  It’s more than enough to live comfortably.  

At the same time, I’m trying to get vocational rehabilitation and looking for ways to gain new skills that fit my new health problems.  Also, attain even more education, hopefully.  But this is not really a sure thing (at least for the near future) since I’m facing many hurdles with those because of the pandemic.  The Voc rehab person has forgotten about me, for example.  Employers are being extremely picky and my skills aren’t yet where they need to be at in order to be at this point in time to be employable with few accommodations.  Even lower wage service jobs are being picky.  For example, a local supermarket didn’t hire me because I have gaps in my employment history.

I'm watching South Park these days, and it commonly occurs while I'm viewing it. I love that show and it's one of the best series I've seen, but whenever Eric Cartman does his manipulative assholery, it reminds me of one of the 2 guys I've mentioned who was a serious asshole back in school (I'm still in touch with many guys from school, and we all have a few stories about his bullying), and I lose track of what's happening in the episode. It's just one example of me being reminded of my school days.

I try to be productive and to improve myself, but I'm getting more and more consumed by these thoughts. I constantly find myself uttering profanities to distract myself from thinking about those times whenever I'm reminded of them.

1001,"Hi Everyone!

So I am 24 and still living with my parents in NJ. I work right in the heart of New York City and am lucky to still have my job that I love. I've saved a lot since living at home and I feel that I am so ready to move out on my own. Basically I want to have a lighter commute but am even more hesitant over this pandemic so I thought I'd hear it out a bit. 

Currently when I wasn't working from home my commute was basically an hour and some change one way. I love where I'm from and I love owning my own car but I am basically feeling stuck constantly weighing these two options at the moment. 

1. Move closer to the city but stay in the burbs only shortening my commute but a little and keeping my car. but I won't have access to the city as much as I would like. Maybe for the better with the way NYC is going down these days. 
or
2. Move out of the suburbs and into a city. Sacrificing my car, closeness to friends, just for comfort to be closer to work. With higher price rents though for a short while. 


My older sister lives in Manhattan, shes been encouraging me, but put in my mind that I should want to find a place where I could go grab a drink after work and meet new people. I don't disagree with that but all this keeps circling in my head and I can't put a finger on it yet. If I don't move towards NYC will I regret not being able to go out for fun at the cost of just keeping my car? if you've had a similar path i'd love to hear your experiences.

1002,"I (18F) am having trouble reconnecting with my best girl friend (18F). We have been friends for years, but about a year ago she got involved in a relationship where the boyfriend cheated on his girlfriend with my best friend when she knew he was in a relationship. This came as a shock to me and made me lose a lot of respect for her as I’m in a LT relationship myself, and we even stopped talking for a few months because of it. She lost a lot of friends from it for awhile but also got closer with another friend who she is much closer to than me now. About a year has passed and we have reconnected since and hang out occasionally and talk almost every day, but things just don’t feel the same. Her relationship with her friend she became closer with is kind of like how her and I used to be which makes me a bit sad, but also makes me wonder if we aren’t as close because she found someone to fill that spot in for me almost? We both aren’t very confrontational with each other with problems with each other (there usually aren’t any) so when I have tried to mention I miss her and want to hang out more to try and get closer again, she just says something along the lines of “Yes of course!” but nothing really changes. The cheating incident isn’t something we really talk about but I wonder if she resents me some for not being there for her during that time because she got a lot of backlash? She is really my only good friend and we used to have so much fun together and be a lot closer but I don’t know how to build our relationship back up to that and would prefer not to have to talk with her about it in depth as we both aren’t very confrontational like that.

1003,"Hi all,

I (F mid 20s) am living with roommates, and I am ready to move into an apartment on my own. Rent is expensive in Southern CA, think $1,500 for a 1 bedroom apartment. From what I understand, all landlords want proof of income showing you make at least 3 times whatever your monthly rent will be. I don't make $4,500 per month, I make closer to $3,500 per month. That being said, between my savings and financial aid (finishing my master's degree), I can put down a deposit and 6 months of rent up front, no issues.

Other than making less than 3X what I will likely be paying for rent, I think I am a decent candidate for renting. I have a solid credit score, no criminal/eviction history, and a steady job plus great references.

If I am willing to pay 6 months of rent up front, do you think some landlords will be willing to let me slide on the 3X income requirement?",07Jul2020,1

1005,"I keep seeing my ex-boyfriend in my dreams and intrusive thoughts. This wouldn't be an issue if it weren't going on for almost three weeks straight.  Background: When I was 18, I got into a relationship with a seemingly nice boy. He turned out to only be motivated by sex and dumped me after six months of dating. After the initial breakup, he kept inserting himself in my life, once trying to convince me to be FWB and another time catfishing me and trying to get photos from me while being in a relationship with his current gf. His Gf is crazy btw, has violently threatened me on two occasions, recently (9 months ago) for even being in the same place they were at a public fair. I keep track of each time in case I decide to pursue a restraining order against her. For obvious reasons, I don't talk or communicate with him in any way. In the dreams we talk, sometimes confronting all the manipulative and not great things he did in our relationship and him with remorse and other times we talk about how we used to be. Before we dated and in the very early stages of our relationship, we were friends and I enjoyed being near him. It's been two years since we dated and I have no idea why he's coming up. I've had so much therapy to know he isn't who I want in my life and yet my dreams are a different story. I don't know what any of this means and frankly I'm tired of him appearing and not understanding why.

This whole issue has taken place over like 5 years now. But the person who I see as my best friend hasn’t really ever treated me like I’m a person. I’m always at fault, I’m always the butt if the joke, and I’m always the one who has to apologize for something I didn’t even do. I’ve asked him, and others, multiple times to stop treating me like this and all of them have, except my “best friend”. He’s also the only person I ever felt like I could trust to share things with, in which he’d either tell everyone else or use it as insults against me.

Also once he made fun of me for having other friends, we went on a band trip to Hawaii and I got rather close with them and one night for dinner I was talking to them and was going to eat at their table and he responded with, “Oh yeah, go eat with your NEW BEST FRIENDS.” Which made me feel horrible so I ended up sitting with him.

In February I finally broke a little bit, I was already in a bad mood about something that happened the night before but we were just talking in the admin channel of a friend’s discord. And I made a comment, that was something like “I didn’t even realize I was doing well that game.” And he responded with, “Oh shut the f*** up stop acting that way we both know you’re self conscious and you’re just saying that so we think better of you.” That might not be EXACTLY was was said, but it’s to the same effect. After reading that I immediately left the discord because I didn’t ever want to have to deal with him again. And I didn’t, until two days ago. I finally built up enough courage message him so we could both try and rebuild the friendship. I was met with delayed messages and with him clearly not caring or wanting to. 

Me: “Whenever you're free I want to have a serious conversation with you” sent at ~3pm on the fifth
Him: “About” sent at 2am on the sixth
Me: “To make an attempt to salvage our friendship” sent at 10am on the sixth
Him: “What is there to talk about” sent at 2pm on the sixth
Me: “That I want to explain everything and actually try to fix the issues” sent at 2pm on the sixth
Him: “Yeah I just don’t see what needs explaining” sent at 3pm on the sixth
Me: “I want to explain how and why I reacted the ways I did, both of which might have been too extreme, but there are still points I’d like to talk about if there’s even a chance of rekindling” sent at 3pm on the sixth

End of conversation

I’ve been talking to another friend about this whole situation because they seem to actually care about it. And he’s been saying that there’s nothing else I can do with him being intentionally obtuse, except for rejoin the discord server because it’s really hard to change things that I can’t even be present for. Which makes sense, but I just feel like if I join again nothing will change but I’ll make myself feel like it has, and just wait until I finally have another break and try to cut him off again.

I have 3k in savings, and I will need to make it until fall 2021. I actually already have college figured out financially so that is not a concern. I make 11 an hour at my job, and will be working 25 hours per week during the school year. From browsing craigslist it seems like the lowest cost for a room around here is 500 + utilities. Plus I am sure the people would want proof of income, and there is only like 1 ad posted a week and they all want a very specific kind of renter... And guess what nobody wants to live with an 18 year old on his own for the first time. Also, all the 1 bedroom or studios in my area are like 900+ have a 2 year waitlist and want 3 years of rental history.



But, the town which is about a 30 minute drive from my high school and is out of state seems much more promising. Several ads for rooms for rent are posted each week, the cost is only about 300-400 even with utilites, and people definitely seem less picky about the renter. The other thing is the resteraunt franchise that I work at has a place in this town. They pay 13.50 an hour because minimum wage is higher.

I (17F) am proud of myself when I find, for lack of a better word, a *thing* that I enjoy (book/movie/band/actor/author/etc) that isn’t “mainstream” or famous. Obviously, I’m not going to be the only person who knows about the thing, but I always feel a little shitty when I find out a classmate or acquaintance also likes it.

I know I should be excited that other people share my “taste”. Instead, I end up feeling like whatever I liked is less cool than I originally thought and I feel sort of stupid for liking it in the first place. I think this is really douchey of me and probably a toxic mindset. I think it prevents me from enjoying myself and making valuable connections with others. I also want to add that I don’t think it’s bad to like popular stuff and I certainly don’t think it makes you stupid or lame.

TD;LR: I feel sort of special when I “discover” something I really enjoy that isn’t very popular, but then feel stupid/shitty when other people I know like it. How do I connect with them over it instead of feeling like other people enjoying the same things as me makes it less cool?

My side of story is(which i told her somehow and its good now) that whenever i think about period my brain thinks about blood and mucus coming out of uk private part and idk why i taste it? and its just...idk very gross the taste..of blood coming out of their..idk i havent been able to change the image popping up and taste when i hear period.
Also, I am disgusted by gay p*rn, I guess thats normal for boys? I once saw it when i was young and  it grossed me to my core, But i have nothing at all against gay people. On the other hand i only judge people on their action and nothing else, i dont have a gay friend byt you have to beleive me on this that i dont hate lgbt or any community. But whenever i hear gay that image and taste of d*ck in d*ick mouth and idk you got it by now. Its like a chain reaction. Hearing the word gay- thinking of image- taste and then disgusted and grossed.
Idk how to control it. It doesnt affect me rn at all but i dont want to be like this",07Jul2020,1
1028,"so my dad sucks, he's manipulative and childish and an overall jackass. he treats my mom, my sister and I horribly along with his own parents, but but is a saint around anyone but us. he is a horrible person who cheated on my mom and constantly accuses her of cheating and threatening to spread rumours about her all over our town. so my mom ended up getting a divorce around 2016, and me (17 turning 18) and my sister(19 turning 20) stayed with my mom, but my dad is over all the time which we hate. he can never spend more than an hour with my sister without starting an argument or yelling and constantly harasses my mom over the phone 

examples of his shit behaviour is that he refused to but my sister a $12 bathing suit but the next day bought a $15 000 kayak, and when I was mad at him on the way to a baseball game I sat in the backseat since I didn't want to be beside him, my head was on the window and he swerved the car for my head to bang against it to ""smarten me up""

we all hate how he behaves and treats us but we can't exactly cut him off or he won't help pay for anything like my sisters golf, our future school things or anything we might do or need, and im scared he could possibly harm my mom if we tell him to leave us alone or when me and my sister are away for college in the future. my mom only keeps contact with him to keep the peace and so we can still pay for things, but I don't want my mom or sister to suffer anymore

what should we do, or what advice can anyone give

I may go into detail of more shit he has done to us in the future but its too much for in here",07Jul2020,1
1029,"Am I just being insecure and jealous?


I’m a (27f), living with my boyfriend (28) and my 29 year old sister. We have been living together for a year with my sister and we have been together for two years. 
When we first moved in, it was cause me and my sister had no place to stay so my boyfriend let us both live with him as we aren’t making enough money. He knows me and my sister come as a package and there’s no way we would live apart due to family and financial circumstances. So at first my boyfriend and sister were more reserved around each other but I’ve noticed now that my boyfriend has warmed up to her and enjoys her presence. This has made me feel jealous and paranoid that he might like her. For eg. he made some food and I didn’t have some yet and he offered her the rest but he said it was because I said I didn’t  seem like I wanted them. But that made me feel jealous. Am I being crazy?
for more clarification, sometimes he will tell me we can get my sister along if we go out, and he will tease her and they joke around and be mean to each other sometimes and laugh and talk , and they weren’t like that before cause they were both reserved and still didn’t understand each other’s personalities yet. But all in front of me and they don’t do anything behind my back.Are these signs he has a crush or is he just being nice and friends with her, seeing as she is my sister?
TL;DR: my boyfriend teases my sister and jokes with her and will ask to bring her to our dates sometimes. Does he have a crush or is he just being nice?",07Jul2020,1

So there was this girl I really loved her I still have no clue why, but she was a bitch, she then told me she didn’t like me because I became too soft to her (ik wtf I was being nice), so I still really loved her and then my best friend calmly and briefly says to me “I like “x” a lot you know”. I’m thinking hold up it’s been like two weeks, so he starts really getting into her and we go to this festival sort of thing, I’m there just sadly walking around with my friends who all have girls and there is those two, up close looking at each other, so I  died inside and went home and just slept. I then told my friend how I feel and he asked if I he has permission from me to get with her, obviously I can’t say no so I just say yes and then he tries to get with her but then suddenly they don’t, anyways I get kicked out of that school for other reasons and now I attend another school. So over text I’ve told my ex best friend I don’t like him and don’t want to be friends and then he tells me he went for a scholarship at the same school as I did and now we both are attending the same school on rugby scholarships, both on the same team playing together, not to mention the same classes, he now says he’s very sorry and wants to be best friends again. Now I don’t know whether I should forgive him because I really liked this girl like a unhealthy amount and he just decided he wanted some of her as-well, he has told me he wants to be friends again but I have declined. We go back to the same new school in September playing rugby together shall I forgive him or not?

So my Dad has built up a very prestigious architecture firm since he was my age and my brother has been working full time a part of it for the past 6 months. before that he was only working 3 days a week and studying for registration/ licensing exams on his own but as I know hes said he wasn't studying too much to me. 

Since now hes full time all he does is complain about the office to me. That our parents are just to old and not listening to him but in fact I feel they are doing a great job running a successful business with long standing employees. He's an emotional wreck and by now I have no idea how to handle it. I'm ashamed I'm writing this about someone in my family more so my own brother. But the core truth I feel is the problem is his attitude... talks so fast and he doesn't realize when he's being insulting, even to his own family, and a demeanor of always has to come off knowing more than you. 

As a normal family would we all get along but tell him to his face when one or all us think why would you say something like that we've laughed things off. But his defense mechanisms is either resorting to two options saying ""I just wanted to have a normal conversation about this"", not acknowledging his own lack of family pride. Or saying ""NONE OF THIS IS NORMAL"" and then storming off. 

The reason im writing this is that second one happened and he stormed off and slammed the front door didn't come in for a day. Frighten the shit out of my parents thinking the most extreme happened. Its as he expects my father to hand over the company to him after half a year making astronomical changes that haven't been wrong in 35 years. He's had blow ups but this one takes the cake. I work at a large firm in NYC and cannot wait to get away from all this drama for a little but its every month now. I've tried talking to him about this but he gets extremely pissed off and can't believe I don't see his way. I know he wants to make the company better but he has to have a little humility in doing do. What can I say or just leave him be?

First, I want to say that I know I am in the wrong in the story, I am not here to be lectured. I already feel guilty enough.

So,  I rent an apartment with two other girls, and I'm the only one still living there this summer as they went back home.  Since I was alone, I have been... Well, I haven't been cleaning as often as I should have. Earlier this week I had to come back home, and I left without cleaning the apartment. I admit that it was pretty bad. I thought I'd just do a huge clean up once I go back tomorrow. 

The thing is, my roommates went to the apartment today, and needless to say they are (rightfully) mad at me. I promised it would never happen again and I apologized, and I swore that once the clean up would be done I'd send them photos as proofs.

1048,"Hi, I need advice on how to properly handle a situation.
First a short backstory:
My dad has a criminal history and has kidnapped me when I was little, I haven't seen him since I was 3 and have little to no memories of him. My mom raised me alone. 
Quite a while back he first came into contact with me via social media and we talked and we exchanged numbers. 
After talking to him a couple times I realised I didn't really enjoy talking to him and ignored him (Ik I suck).
I kept this from my mother as she wouldn't have enjoyed us talking to eachother.

He occasionally sends me a text asking to talk and I usually don't reply. 
Last summer I decided to give it another go, however once again I decided it wasn't working and talking to him was a hassle since I had to stay up late if we wanted to talk (Timezones). Our conversations ended abruptly after I once again decided to ignore him (I Suuuuck).

I have to say he has straightened out, he has a new family and a proper job and I believe he has changed.
However we haven't talked about what has happened between us.

He also send me some texts which I can only describe as  him not accepting or willing to come to terms with what happened. (Basically calling my mother a Liar).

He still occasionally messages me asking what went wrong and he's really trying. Although the messages are pushy (he might be desperate)

 I feel bad, am I leading him on? What should I do? Should I break contact? How can I tell him that.

I really don't know.

this is my first time posting on reddit so i’m sorry for any issues 

firstly i just want to make it clear that i am in no way sexually attracted to my sister- all this is purely emotional

okay so my sister (15f) and i (17f) are super close, she’s one of my closest friends. we hang out every day and often spend the entire day together. i don’t know what i would do without her.

one of the things that we do together the most is kind of weird, but we like to play games where we pretend to be characters, kind of like role playing or when kids play games. for example we’re both into tmnt right now so we play games as the turtles. i know it’s a bit childish but we’ve been doing it for as long as i can remember. we do couples a lot. one thing to note is that when we were younger is (tw) sometimes we would pretend the characters where having sex, which was basically me getting on top of her and humping her leg. i used to orgasm from it. i know this is disgusting and i am ashamed of my actions and i have not done anything like this for a while but i thought it might be relevant. 

the problem is that whenever i picture spending my life with a partner of something i can’t. to be honest i really want to be with my sister for the rest of my life. i want to live with her when we grow up and just be together forever. i just can’t imagine existing without her. 

i know that i’m horrible for feeling this way and it eats at me every single day but i still feel it. i don’t know what to do. is this something i should see a psychiatrist for? or do i need to try to distance myself from my sister? i love her so much i don’t want to be like this. any advice is appreciated",07Jul2020,1

Previously, I was in a minor car-to-car accident so my vehicle insurance in CT went up. While I consider myself a New Yorker, high insurance premiums and the extra sales tax (8.32% in NY vs. 6.35% in CT) are detractors to registering the vehicle in New York. But, at the same time I am aware that CT takes property tax on vehicles.

I have family in CT, so I can keep the vehicle and the license registered in here. But, I will be physically living and working in NY. Thus, I will be paying NY income taxes since that would be the state that employer witholds taxes. Should I decide to claim residency in CT, I would be paying income tax in Connecticut as well (resident in CT and nonresident in NY income tax return).

In addition, the choice of state residency (vehicle registration and driver's license) will affect the opportunity to obtain in-state tuition for public institutions in New York State.

1053,"Just a background: My entire life I've always been the black sheep of my family. My older brothers (I am the youngest) have always been academically and professionally excellent, going to Ivy leagues and working at prestigious jobs, just like my parents did. It was never like that for me. I always struggled in school and now that I'm about to graduate from college, I'm struggling to get find a job too. While growing up, my parents and siblings often made sure to remind me that I wasn't as gifted or hardworking as them and I was wasting my life. My older brother even tried to convince me that I was likely mentally disabled when I was 12 (long story, we're on much better terms now). Even teachers who had my brothers in high school would openly call me ""the dumb one"" or ""wasted potential"". Needless to say, it's done a number on my self-confidence over the years. Every single report card would say the same: ""he is very smart but clearly is not trying! He is not using his potential!"" but I had no idea why. I didn't WANT to ""waste my potential"" but I just couldn't seem to get myself to do it no matter how hard I tried. No matter how much my parents punished me. No matter how much I knew my inability to focus was hurting me. 

However, I was recently diagnosed with ADHD Inattentive Type (formerly known as ADD), and all of a sudden a lot of the problems I had growing up made sense. I realized why I always had so much trouble following instructions, behaving, having self-control. Looking back and thinking about all of my problems throughout the years, it seems so obvious to me that there was something going on other than me being purely lazy. After getting the proper treatment, my grades and performance skyrocketed, getting a 4.0 GPA for the first time in my life despite having probably the most challenging course load I've ever had. I've become one of the highest performers consistently in almost all of my classes. It feels like everything snapped into place in my brain and I finally have a sense of control. 

With that being said, lately, I can't help but feel a lot of resentment towards my family. I can't shake the feeling that if my parents tried to understand why I was the way I was instead of blaming me and calling me lazy, my life would have been so much different. At this point, I learned about my ADHD a bit too late. My GPA is too low to salvage with my last 2 semesters, and I go to a pretty unimpressive school. With COVID piling on, the odds are seriously stacked against me in the job hunt. Imagine what I could be doing right now if I was diagnosed early in high school (when I was struggling the most) instead of my junior year of college? Imagine what schools I could've gone to? Imagine how much more confident I would feel in myself if I didn't grow up known as the dud who would forever be living in his brothers' shadows. 

I know I probably sound pretty entitled right now. I still love my parents and brothers a lot and I know that hindsight is 20/20. They couldn't have known. They're old fashioned immigrants and don't really think about mental health like most American parents do these days. They sacrificed a lot for me and did their genuine best, and I really do appreciate and love them for that, but I can't shake the feeling that I've been cheated. I feel like the people who I needed the most to look out for me growing up never gave me the benefit of the doubt and it's had a substantial negative impact on me as a person and my life. 

Maybe there isn't any real advice to give about this and I just needed to vent, but I'd love to hear if anyone has felt the same way about their family. This has been eating away at me now for the past few weeks. I feel like I don't really have any right to be all that upset with my family, but those feelings are still there, louder than ever, and I can't just ignore them.",07Jul2020,1

I broke up with ex girlfriend back in November. We were together for 6.5 years, and it’s a decision that I feel really good about. She was extremely manipulative, mean, and over the course of our relationship I actually tried to break up with her 5 or 6 times and in the end I just apologized. The first time that cycle happened, I wound up depressed and went to therapy, and I actually lied and told her (and the therapist) our relationship was great and I only broke up with her because I was depressed, although I “could put a finger on exactly why.” 

I’m not sure what exactly caused me to finally be able to end it, but one day I just had enough. I was going to a comedy club with my college roommate, his gf, and my gf and I told her I was going to go down 2 floors to the roommates for a drink before the show (there was 2 hours until we were leaving). She said, no we don’t have time (which I knew she was going to say because over the 6 years she hung out with me and my college friends as infrequently as possible, and my high school friends, who are my best friends to this day, no joke less than 5 times). I said “Obviously you would say that, but we do. I’m going and you can come if you want. Long story short, she took an Uber alone and met us at our seats at the show, I was pissed the whole time, and I broke up with her later that night and did not feel a single feeling of doubt.

The real turning point was when one of our friend's pets passed and I was talking to him in the groupchat, trying to console him and give him an ear. Jane jumps into the groupchat and ignores the hour long convo to tell us how their lip is swollen from oral. I got really upset at that, cause our friend was really going through some shit.

To add to that, I recently got a car and made plans to visit Jane (socially distanced of course) but the day I was supposed to visit, Jane bailed because Jane was hanging out with their boyfriend the night before and got too drunk. I was leaving the house, asking what they wanted for coffee for the hangover, and Jane said not to come. Had I not asked Jane what they wanted they would've had me drive there without telling me they didnt want to hangout. Not to mention, Jane has never once made the effort or offer to visit me, which kind of hurts because they were my best friend.

This happened a few days ago, and I told another friend that I was upset and they told me to acknowledge how Jane is going through some things right now, but that doesn't excuse their hurtful actions? Jane has always been a little self absorbed, and maybe its just because 2020 is hitting different, but I'm fed up! Any advice how to go forward with this?

Note: I'm using ""they"" cause those are Jane's preferred pronouns, even though I reeeeally hope they don't see this",07Jul2020,1

1061,"Hi guys! More inquiries. 

So, I work at a mom and pop shop in my area to make a bit of money over the summer. I don’t like asking my parents for money, so I try to work as much as possible. 

With Covid being a thing, I’ve been doing as much as I can to keep myself safe. I have a baby sister (7), and my dad (50) has high blood pressure. I wear a mask and face shield (in addition to a clear raincoat) when I’m at work. I’m a cashier, so I deal with customers the most. 

In seeing that a lot of customers were not wearing masks, I spoke to my manager about it and discussed my feeling unsafe. They said they’d handle it, and I believed them. A sign was put up—9.5x11 inch sign sat amongst the many other posters on the door, with a lovely 55pt font that said “Masks are required.” That was all. No man at the door to keep customers at bay, but I obliged. This was around 3 weeks ago. 

Today at work, I had a customer come to my register without a mask. He literally had a mask in his shirt pocket, but I left it be. So I asked that he stand behind the plastic. He proceeded to move from behind the plastic and said, “Man, I ain’t got that shit.” 

“I understand,” I said, “But out of respect for public safety, I’d be helpful if you kept your distance.” He threw his hand up at me and said, “Now I’m gonna talk in your face too. Take my number.” He then leaned over the register counter and started stating his number, obviously to get closer to me. At this point, I am shaking. I have terrible anxiety in relation to covid, and would be devastated if I contracted it or gave it to someone else. I asked him again to move back and he ignored me. I rang up his things as quickly as possible and he snatched up his things and left. 

I was almost in tears by the end of this transaction, and very antsy for the rest of my shift. This is not the first time I’ve had issues with unruly customers who hate masks, but this is the first time someone actively threatened my space. Managers see maskless customers all the time and allow them to continue shopping freely, so usually customers get upset with me when I say something, and it’s understandable. However, I saw this as the last straw, and I quit today. 

I don’t know if I took action out of emotion and made a bad decision, but I’m not sure what else I could’ve done. Am I overreacting?",07Jul2020,1
1062,"Because of me taking care of my looks and being more sensitive than others (I just think roasting people is dumb, therefore I might come off as such), people are saying I'm gay. It's peculiar why would even someone think this way, despite me often picking up girls at parties and so far having had two 'more serious' relationships. 

See, in Poland basically any guy who doesn't like sweatpants and football can be considered gay, and even people who declare as non-homophobic will still use the gay label as an insult.

Its important for me not to come off as gay, because it's just sending the wrong message to everyone, including the girls (obviously). I accept gays, I support gay rights, but if someone calls me gay I'm pissed, because I just ain't one, and this recently became a fucking rolling joke.

Since I'm not going to give lectures to my friends about what I think about using the ""gay"" as a swear word, and I ain't gonna stop dressing the way I want (which is really just bunch of normal clothes from the chains, perhaps just matched bit too well, and too little comfortable-oriented), how do I earn some respect? 

There is no option of changing friends either, anyway wherever I go people be asking if I'm gay.

1064,"Hello to anyone who is reading,

As the title says, I'm in the ruttiest of ruts right now and have no idea how to get out. I am a college-aged woman living on her own who is not taking classes or employed (lost my then-current job and the summer job I had lined up due to the pandemic, what else is new) right now, pretty much surviving off savings and unemployment paychecks. I was kicked out of the house about last year because I am trans and my family does not support that, so I have to pay for everything on my own. The only reason I can go to school is because I qualify for full tuition coverage under university policy because my yearly income is so low. I've hardly been able to even complete full semesters and pass my classes lately because of struggles with social anxiety, depression and attention disorders, and although I'm close to graduating, I'm not even sure if I'll be able to power through this next school year and get my degree.

The reason I haven't try to go back to work yet is for a lot of reasons (I don't have good insurance so I'm worried about contracting the coronavirus, my former place of employment is still closed down, I often can't handle the stress of a new job and quit in a couple of weeks, etc etc.) so right now I'm just trying to bide my time with passion projects, but those aren't even going anywhere. I'm an English major so I write a lot, and have been trying to write a lot, but I've been in such a writer's drought that most everything I write (creative stuff, articles for my school newspaper, reviews on media I like) I hate as soon as I read it. I'm passionate about video games in a ""I want to make video games one day"" type of way, so I've been trying to work on a little ROM hack project but I suck at computing and coding so that hasn't been going very well either. I have a decent amount of other little hobbies but I'm not good at them either so I just get frustrated whenever I try to start anything.

Like I said before, I was kicked out of the house and don't talk to my family anymore, so my few friends and my girlfriend are really the only people in my support system. They're great and I really do love them like family, but it's really hard when you have this support of a biological family for decades and it suddenly gets pulled out from under you and suddenly the whole foundation feels like it's crumbling down. Because of all this I've just felt like a burden for my friends lately, that I'm lazy and useless and a waste of space that just ends up bothering them with my problems. With the pandemic too, a lot of my friends have been more distant so there's really only two or three people I see on a weekly basis and can hang out with. Seeing them is nice, but at the end of the day it just feels like a distraction, and then I have to go back to my shitty life. That's really what it all feels like, distractions. Distracting myself for the next two months before school starts, but then holy shit school starts and I have all this responsibility and should try to get a job again and then if I graduate I'll be in the ""real world"" and oh my god I have no idea what my plan is for after college. Teaching, maybe? Journalism? Working on video game development would be cool but feels like a long shot since I have no experience.

I really just do not know what to do, and it scares the crap out of me. I know I need help, but I've seen therapists and doctors and am on an anti-depressant right now and none of it has really helped in the long run. I hate the therapy process to the point where I'm just afraid to talk about my feelings to anyone I don't 100% trust, plus I'm super introverted so it's terribly hard for me to go outside and make new friends and such and such. I just want to give up, honestly. I even attempted suicide back in June but couldn't go through with it; the cops were called on me and I was sent to a mental hospital for four days. The only thing that experience taught me is that mental hospitals are not a good place for a person like me and that I never want to be in one again. I'm not actively suicidal right now, but I'm not a fan of living and I don't know how to help myself at all. I've honestly even considered detransitioning and going back to my shitty family and doing what they want because it feels like I have no agency anymore, so why not just give up.

So yeah. I feel so stuck right now, the future is incredibly scary, and I can't envision my life past a couple weeks. Every day is a fight for survival, and the only thing I've really accomplished recently is the odd day where I get out of bed before the evening. If anyone has been in a similar situation or feels like they have any pertinent advice, I would super appreciate your input. Thank you so much for reading through this all and listening to what I have to say.",07Jul2020,1
1065,"So my friend's (20f) parents are super controlling of her (didn't let her move away for college, previous to the last few months didn't want her to leave the house at all) and completely controls her bank account/ won't let her get another one.

1066,"Me (33m) and my wife (38f) have been together for 3 years, married a year and a half. She got birth control early in our relationship for us to decide if we want kids or not, well the date to make a final decision is coming.

Cut to the present, Saturday we were chatting with her cousin and somehow the topic of kids came up. My wife has been on the more depressed side lately because teenagers (my stepchildren) are assholes more often than not and they are wearing her out. She has said on numerous occasions she wants to end her life and yet usually comes back from the brink and chills out a bit. Well, this past weekend she was in one of these moments. She asked me if I would get a vasectomy so she can stop her birth control (she thinks it is contributing to her depression) as we have decided we don't want kids. I said, that ""in her current state I don't know and what if she was to take her life, I met someone else and they wanted kids? That doesn't seem fair to me."" 

Well, she takes this as ""so you want kids, just not with me."" I said no I don't want kids but if you take your life it's not like I can reverse it easily. So, I called yesterday to get a consult, on her suggestion and went to the appointment today. After she calls me and asks how the appt went and then says she is concerned about how I want kids just not with her. Well starting yesterday I made a conscious decision to be much more reliable, more decisive, and get things done as I have a habit of procrastinating. 

I would have never even called if I haven't made my final decision which I made over the course of the weekend. Well she says today, that since I want kids with someone else I shouldn't get it done. And I told her I wasn't saying I wanted kids, I was being realistic since she was in a suicidal state. Now she is not and I have made my decision and I am comfortable with it. So then she says she no longer supports the idea and I shouldn't do it. I told her I made my decision and I will do it with or without her support at which point she now says if I do she will divorce me. This is so damn toxic I don't know which way to go. My decision is made. So basically the argument ended with me telling her to have a nice day and just hanging up. Any suggestions??",07Jul2020,1

Well currently im at his house for a sleepover and he was trying to pull his blanket away from me, but i wouldnt let him have it, so he did the hand by my throat thing. As a joke i was like 'one day im not gonna push your hand away and you wont know what to do cuz it'll be awkward' so he tried to do it again i guess to continue to the joke and i pushed his hand away. He then made a comment along the lines of 'well the days not today' and i yelled 'nope' and continued to try to pull the blanket back to me. 

He then reached again and choked me and i froze momentarily, i dont fully remember it either. He pressed down and after a moment of hesitation i finally pushed his hand off. (Btw, no i did not freeze because i enjoyed it, i dont fully know why i did, i think it just caught me off guard tbh)

1073,"So due to covid messing the world up, my final year at school ended in March instead of July and yesterday was meant to be the last day. I was sitting here thinking about that and it got me thinking about all my school memories. It was nice for a few minutes until, like always, my mind started thinking about sad and bad stuff

Since March, I have kept in touch with 3 people from school via Snapchat. I consider them close friends and just friends, I haven't even seen their faces. Of course, part of that is lockdown but for a while we have been allowed to go out and those 3 people, yeah, I have been talking to them but let me tell you, it's hard to maintain a relationship through just snapchat

This just gets me thinking. In september, everyone I know is going to University and moving away while I am not and if simply school ending is enough to make us lose friendships, what will people moving away do to me. I am going to be lonley. Is this just a part of life at my age (18). Losing friends? Becoming lonely?

I consider myself an introvert but I knew that I would socialise with people, even if they weren't my friends at school. Looking back, I loved school for what it gave me. A Social Life. Now, the only people I have talked to since March are my parents and little brother. Am I going to be lonley for the rest of my life?

I feel like my ears are ringing/throbbing or I’m hearing my name it’s kind of hard to tell bc Idk if my imagination is getting the better of me. So a week or two ago, on about 5 separate nights I had hypnagogic hallucinations (hallucinations right after waking up from sleeping) and I noticed it happened when I stopped drinking coffee daily so I thought hm, maybe that’s why. And now I’m drinking coffee again, past three days and I haven’t had it happen again. (These dreams for me happen about every summer btw. I tend to drink less coffee in the summer and I think that’s part of why) However, now, it feels like my ears are ringing or maybe quarantine has just freaked me out. I say that because I also had a really large cry about being bored and missing people and just feeling rlly depressed from it. I’ve talked to people about it and I’m trying to do more different things and it’s helped. But it hasn’t stopped the fact that I’m either hearing my name or I’m not?? I’ve thought oh maybe it’s because things are too quiet so my inner voice is making it up. Or maybe I’m freaked out from my dreams and I’m making it up/ it’s allergies because I have a huge allergy problem with my ears where they’ll get clogged and I can’t hear very well/ear infection. And I think all of these things or maybe I’m just developing some type of schizophrenia since I turned 18 in November. And I know that’s a lot but if any one has advice on what you guys think.. I will say this and this is also why I don’t think it’s schizophrenia or something like that; because I hear it allllll the time unless it’s actually quiet in which I just hear silence. And if I actually fully try to hear it I hear nothing like I said, or I hear my ears like thumping or throbbing which happens to sound  a lot like my name (but when it’s quiet it clearly isn’t my name, it’s the sound of my blood flowing, like a whooshing sound). Please help I know u guys aren’t doctors but I just don’t want to freak my mom out if there is no need to so I just want other opinions thank you. And I’ve told my mom about the thumping and stuff bc that’s what I do hear, and I only rlly hear my name if I’m anxious about it but I really can’t tell it just worries me because of my nightmares. Sorry to ramble But now this ear thing it just rlly worries me because quarentine won’t be over for a long time so I just worry that it won’t go away bc it seems anxiety related from being at home, I just don’t know if maybe there is more to it. And if there is more to it, I want to get on it fast in case it’s more bc like I said I am a bit of a hypochondriac

People make fun of me for my short height. All the girls at my school are like 5'8 or taller and all the guys are at least 6 feet. And then look at my short and weak body. I also have severely impaired vision in my right eye, and my eye defect is noticeable, so people always give me dirty looks and avoid me.

And I'm terrible at school. I have dyslexia and dyscalculia, and I cannot survive school at all. It takes me forever to learn anything, especially with math and science. I have to take all on-level courses to keep my GPA above a 3.0. My SAT score is garbage, and my parents are very disappointed over my most recent report card. I'll be a senior once school starts, so I have little hope in school. I have literally nothing impressive when it comes to academics. The only extracurricular I did was a debate club that I dropped out of my first semester of my freshman year because it was boring to me. My parents can't afford a tutor, and whenever I watch a review video online or get a review book from the library, it only makes everything more confusing for me.

And I'm just really incompetent in general. I mess up when I do everything. For example, if someone asks me do something I'll always forget to do it or seriously screw it up. I get tired really easily, so I have to take a break frequently when I do chores, and my parents yell at me when I take a break because they think I'm being inefficient and procrastinating. I suck at literally everything I do. I do terrible at school, and I'm bad at everything else, from music to art to sports.

Furthermore, I have a bunch of other disorders. I have paranoia and anxiety, and I always worry about things that could go wrong. I spend hours praying each day and trying to meditate but it never helps me at all. I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was in elementary school, and I never got the help I needed for that.

I don't even know what to do. I have no future, and I can't go to college. I probably won't make it past my senior year. I'm terrible with everything in school, and everyone makes fun of me for being disabled. I need to hurry up and figure out what to be when I grow up and start planning for the future. But I can't.

1081,"TLDR: social isolation and  crappy friends have left me somewhat depressed and unmotivated, no one invites me to hangout anywhere and it has been harmful to my mental health. how do i get over this?

&amp;#x200B;

apologies for the rather dramatic title.  i never thought i would write one of these asking for social advice.

&amp;#x200B;

background:

&amp;#x200B;

my family moved from spain to the USA for two years when i started middle school, then back to the USA for 8th grade, and moved back to spain for 9th grade, which i have now completed.

9th grade was difficult for me social wise cause i had  an expectation that i would really connct with a few old friends and it didnt happen. we hungout, but after november they became really distant. in short, other kids had joined out grade the year i was gone, old friends came back mid this year, and a new kid became friends with him.

&amp;#x200B;

from November on, we didnt hangout alot and he would say digging comments like "" that joke isnt funny anymore"" or just second guess me when he asked me something. mostly he was nice, but he didnt go out of his way to seek me out, and i was on the outside of the social group. he would leave me  out to dry if he made plans with someone else,  he wouldnt follow up if we made plans, stuff like that. I would always see them going to movies or hanging out, and i was never invited. no one from that group sought me out during school either, i was generally starting conversations, even though i had asked to hangout with a few of them several times, they were usually busy or (once) called sick.

&amp;#x200B;

apologies for the detail,  i just wanted to set the background for my turmoil.

&amp;#x200B;

this lack of social  contact has hurt my self esteem and confidence, as well as my mental health. im in kinda a crappy place rn, i feel unmotivated to do rly anything other then  play video games with my cousin.  i often wish that i was back in the states with good friends.  i have friends i talk to and message online, but those are just  ppl i see at school, not really friends.

1084,"I’m going to have to give quite a bit of background here, forgive me for the formatting I’m on mobile. TW for mentions of self harm in this post

My parents got divorced in 2018 when I was in my senior year of high school and my sister was in 9th grade. This was the last straw for my father and he went off the deep end. He has always dealt with underlying mental health issues and psychosis and he just kinda lost it.(Government conspiracies, antivaxx, anti mask, stalks my mother, kidnapped my sister and I, all that good stuff.) My sister now refuses to see him which is understandable so she lives with my mother and I. 

Recently I lost my job due to COVID-19 so I have been in the market for work. I heard that the restaurant that my sister worked at was hiring so I asked my sister if she would be okay with me working there and she said yes. I applied right way and got the job on the spot. I was thrilled. I asked my sister a few more times before my first shift if she was okay with me being her coworker and she said yes every time. I was really excited to be working with my sister because she is my favourite person in the entire world.

On my first day I got trained and was working in the kitchen away from my sister. About 4 hours into our six hour shift one of my new coworkers poked her head in and told me my sister was going home early because she was nauseous. I went and checked on her and gave her pepto and then happily continued working at my new job.

When I went home that evening my sister came and talked to me. She told me to quit my job. She said that being around me made her so stressed that she was physically sick and that I couldn’t work there. I was really shocked. My sister has been dealing with serious mental health issues lately, the doctors she went to diagnosed her with some sort of psychosis and they’ve been trying and failing to treat her, she’s been distant lately but I thought that was why.

I told her I would quit but I pressed her as to why she couldn’t be around me. We were always best friends as kids. She said she loved me but that she hated being around me. She told me that living with me and my mother made her want to hurt herself and that she has been cutting herself because she has to live with us. She said that she would voluntarily go into foster care to escape living with us.

This DEVASTATED me. I do everything in my life for my sister. I went through serious mental health issues when I was her age so when our parents divorced I did everything I could to protect her from any trauma. I sat up every night thinking about how to protect her. I bought her everything my mother couldn’t afford to give her because of the divorce, I got a job right out of high school to start saving for the expensive art school she wants to go to. I love her more than anything.

I don’t know how to help her. I told her to talk to her therapist about it but she says she doesn’t want to be hospitalized because our mother would find out. She told me that if I tell our mother she will start cutting again. Even if she didn’t threaten that, our mother was emotionally abused as a child and by our father and cannot handle anything that she perceives as a criticism against her. She has a total breakdown leaving my sister and I to care for her. We’ve done family therapy before but all my sister would do was sit silently for the entire hour and a half. 

What do I do? Should I call the hospital and get her admitted against her will? Should I tell my mother and try to deal with the fallout? Do I get her a foster home? I don’t want to lose her! I don’t know what to do.

Tl;dr I found out my sister hates my and she cuts herself because of my mother and I.",07Jul2020,1
1085,"I recently got a job at a call centre and found myself really overwhelmed with the training and workload. I was supposed to be trained for 1 week and then put on the operational floor. Reading reviews on the company, a lot of past employees said it wasn’t worth the trip nor pay for the treatment they endured. I also have a history of depression and self harm and I found myself feeling quite scared to catch and change trains for my 1.5 hour commute. I didn’t trust myself on the platforms and found myself creeping towards the edge to jump. 

Speaking to my family today, I felt like a burden and like I should’ve just sucked it up and gone. Everyone told me to just breathe and go. My strategies weren’t helping me in calming down - communicating that I need help, being mindful and acknowledging that my thoughts and emotions shouldn’t have a hold on me didn’t quite help. I couldn’t stop crying and feeling panic and nervousness. 

I feel bad that I quit. I feel so worthless and pathetic. Is it wrong that I quit? Is it wrong that I told people I wasn’t okay? Should I have just gone? What should I have done?",07Jul2020,1
1086,"I (29 F) found out after 11 years of being with my husband (29 M) that he is a malignant narcissist. I, also, have narcissistic tendencies. We are not officially diagnosed, just in the midst of a life crisis regarding my mental health. At this point, I’m recalling the quote “if character does not show over time, it certainly will under great duress.” He supported me (somewhat emotionally) for about 2 weeks before his narcissistic tendencies began to fully surface. Over the course of 4 months, the trauma of the mental health experience combined with his actions and words are weighing on me. He began to excessively trigger me- yelling and saying words he knows to set off my anxiety and planning what seemed to be “punishing” activities with threats of abandonment in the middle of the night on a couple of separate occasions. He has successfully painted a negative image of me to friends and family members. 
At this point, he has control over everything...  it seems as though he derives pleasure from my misery with constant reminders of what he is capable of accomplishing and that he will “make it to the end of his life” as he understands the prognosis of my condition. 
I’ve found out that I’m, unfortunately, incredibly co-dependent - even more so related to circumstances at this time. Prior to this, I was functioning in a full-time position and doing well. I had a mental breakdown and have not seemed to improve... 
At this point in life, I’m at a loss.... I’m not well enough to divorce and I’m not exactly certain of a future.

1087,"Hi all,

I mostly just need some encouragement. I lost my job because of Covid, got hired for my dream job that same week, was put on a sort of furlough (they gave me a start date for 3 months later and encouraged me to apply for unemployment). I contact them 4 times and they give me the same start date and encouragement that they are excited to have me start. And one week before my start date they rescind my employment.

So, I've been applying for one shitty job a day for 2 weeks, calling them back, and I finally have an interview for tomorrow. I emptied my savings account in the first 2 months and have relied on my husband's income since then. WA unemployment has been assessing my claim, which meets all of their requirements, for over 3 months. These past two weeks they have been calling people to resolve these claims that have problems. There are 4 days left before they will stop calling people. I have emailed them 4 times and have tried to get through the phone lines over 100 times. So if they don't call me in the next 4 days, I feel like I have absolutely no hope of ever receiving that money. 

Any advice, encouragement, honesty?",07Jul2020,1

I made a joke about a guy getting a police stick stuck up his throat.

I know from the title, you can already tell that this looks like I’m a racist scum bag that doesn’t care about the blm protests. Here me put on this one though. My friend posted a story about someone getting brutalized by the police force by getting a police stick getting stuck in their throat. I’m the type of person that would usually be pretty immature since I’m only 14 years old, so I jokingly make a comment about the situation. Now, here’s where it gets a little out of control. My friend dms me about the comment that I made and calls me a racist unfunny and cruel person. I try to calm her down since I didn’t mean to be any of those things. So, we go back and forth for a while on how I think she overreacted and how she thinks I’m a racist piece of crap. I just ended the conversation because it ended up going nowhere. We’re not on speaking terms as of now, and I don’t know what to do.",07Jul2020,1
1090,Hello I'm [F17] really afraid to drive a car. Here in the Netherlands you're allowed to drive in a car alone when you're 18. Last september I began my driving lessons and especially in the beginning I was really afraid but around november it kinda went away. In march I was forced to postpone my lessons (COVID-19) and a few weeks ago I could start again. The problem is that I just started to drive on the highway before corona and I was kinda afraid back then but right now I'm really afraid. When I'm driving next to a truck I'm just so afraid and I just can see myself making the smallest mistake and the only thing I can think about is the fact how dangerous everything feels. I feel like this is not really helping my lessons because I start to make mistakes in other parts when I'm driving which I didn't do before (I drive manual btw). I really don't know what to do because the last 4/5 weeks I've been only driving on the highway so the fear of it should have gone away I guess. The biggest problem is just that it makes me so nervous to even go in the car before a lesson.,07Jul2020,1
1091,"I've have this friend, we'll call them Jane for simplicity sake. I've known them about 5 years since we met in high school. They've always been a bit quiet, but lately has really come out of their shell. A lot of that has to do with the fact that Jane got a boyfriend several months ago and is head over heels with him, and he seems to have greatly improved Jane's mental health. That part is great, and I couldn't be happier.

However.

Jane and I are in a groupchat with 4 other friends of ours andtalks VERY openly about her relationship. To the point where Jane sends us pictures of their own hickies and talks about things that honestly make me a bit uncomfortable. I understand that relationships are fun and whatnot, and hell, I used to date Jane's brother and I imagine me talking about that stuff was awkward, but I never posted pictures of hickies to a group chat.

The real turning point was when one of our friend's pets passed and I was talking to him in the groupchat, trying to console him and give him an ear. Jane jumps into the groupchat and ignores the hour long convo to tell us how their lip is swollen from oral. I got really upset at that, cause our friend was really going through some shit.

To add to that, I recently got a car and made plans to visit Jane (socially distanced of course) but the day I was supposed to visit, Jane bailed because Jane was hanging out with their boyfriend the night before and got too drunk. I was leaving the house, asking what they wanted for coffee for the hangover, and Jane said not to come. Had I not asked Jane what they wanted they would've had me drive there without telling me they didnt want to hangout. Not to mention, Jane has never once made the effort or offer to visit me, which kind of hurts because they were my best friend.

This happened a few days ago, and I told another friend that I was upset and they told me to acknowledge how Jane is going through some things right now, but that doesn't excuse their hurtful actions? Jane has always been a little self absorbed, and maybe its just because 2020 is hitting different, but I'm fed up! Any advice how to go forward with this?

1093,"I’ve always believed I was straight. Very very straight. Lesbian porn kind of grosses me out, not that there’s anything wrong with it, I just cringe by the thought. Yet I kind of wish I was gay? Sometimes I wonder if maybe I’m pansexual. I think women are really attractive and beautiful in a way a man could never be but I can’t really see myself kissing another girl. My family used to ask me frequently if I was gay and it made me super insecure and gave me a lot of self doubt. 

My best friend comes from a pretty Christian household and when I met her she fully believed that homosexuality was wrong. She gave the argument that they can’t reproduce. It honestly pissed me off a little lol, so I just kept exposing her to the lgbtq+ community and at this point she says that she’s okay with it. If I’m being honest, I think she knows deep down that her opinion is wrong, so she claims to be accepting of it but I just don’t believe her. I really don’t. I’m quite the opposite, always open to new impressions and what not and the coolest thing I’ve discovered this year is probably Harry Styles and his fashion sense. She makes a face when I mention him wearing a dress. I would love nothing more than to wear masculine clothing, like dress pants and a shirt instead of a dress and high heels. I just don’t want people to make the face at me that she did to Harry S.

I feel like I can’t talk to her (or anyone else) about my doubts about my sexuality. I don’t want our friendship to change. I was drunk at a party with her a few weeks ago, really, really drunk and I casually said that I may be pansexual. It gave me so much anxiety the next morning because I’ve never told anyone. I just... Would it give me anxiety if it wasn’t true? She brought it up a few days later and I quickly said I was just drunk and denied everything about it.

I don’t know how this is going to come across but I’m attracted to my own body. Idk if that’s a normal thing. I feel like I shouldn’t be a least because I’m into men, right? 

I’m a tomb boy, big time and I often feel like it would be easier to be gay because I wouldn’t have to worry about not being very feminine or the way I dress or talk. Not as much at least.

I hope this post isn’t offensive, I’m just really confused and very alone with my thoughts. I can’t make sense of it all. Telling people I don’t label my sexuality seems like such a relief, but having them assume that means I’m gay (etc) almost gives me a genuine panic attack. But hey I would also rather be a boy and I’m not trans so maybe it’s just because I feel like it would easier/make more sense if I was gay? 

I’ve always supported the lgbtq+ community, so I don’t understand why I’m so afraid of being labeled gay etc either. I really shouldn’t care",07Jul2020,1

1096,"I know this isn't as serious as anybody else's problems, and this might be weird, but please hear me out.

So I am a huge fan of collecting coins, cards. And I have been thinking about collecting the Uefa Euro 2020 cards for around a month. Now, my mother knows about this, and she called me childish which I am unsure if I am. My husband doesn't mind my collecting hobby at all, sometimes he also helps. 

If collecting cards wasn't childish, well my next question will be. Hear me out and please don't judge.

My mother sent me a big pack of those cards because she found one in the shops. I don't want to accept anything from her after she ruined my childhood with mental and verbal abuse. It's not that I hate her but I don't want to accept her money.
She stole a lot of money from my dad through lying, which resulted in my father almost never being home at all but work so he could give my mother all the money she demands. He worked 7 days, each day 12 hours of hard physical work which really tired his already ill body. If it wasn't enough, when his boss didn't pay as much as he needed to, my mother would scream at my dad for ""hiding the rest of the money for himself.""
I feel like accepting any money or anything from her would be me supporting her cruelty in the past. I feel like it's dirty money and someone's happiness was ruined by earning it. (My father became an alcoholist and I haven't seen him smile for ages, despite my best attempts at cheering him up, and I hate seeing him like this.) 

My mother always found her happiness in only the money, I tried telling her money won't make her happy but she doesn't even care to understand it.

My husband thinks it's really silly not to accept a gift. He thinks this might be my mother's way of an apology for the past (I mean, he might be right. After all, my mother always tried to solve everything with money), but I just really can't bring myself to accept the gift. How could I accept a gift from someone who did not only abuse me but my father too? 

It has been lying next to the table for some weeks now. I don't even want to open them, and it made me thinking about just quitting collecting these cards. My husband tells me not to quit something I always enjoyed doing, and he wants to try cheering me up but I just can't bring myself to it. This fuss over cards got the best of me and made me hate this hobby.

This isn't about the cards. It's about my relationship with my mother and her way of solving problems. Buying me stuff won't make me forget what she did and she knows this as well.

I really need advice on this. Am I being childish for not accepting her gift over the past? Am I making the right choice by this? Is there something I should do differently?",07Jul2020,1
1097,"Hi everyone. Hope you're all making it through these wild times okay! Anyways, here's my issue: My (35M) partner (28F) of nearly two years now has told me lately she feels a lack of connection between us. The first year of our relationship was great; like the honeymoon period never stopped for over a year. We began dating in August of 2018 and became engaged in Oct of 2019; at the time, it just felt right. We didn't live together yet -- but I felt like everything was on the right track and we were both on the same page. She enthusiastically said yes to marriage; we picked out a ring together. Fast forward to about four months ago, and that's where the first signs of trouble began. She quit her office job for a contract position (which she recently got laid off from) and the whole world became affected by caronavirus. We had traveled to Europe in February and that's the last time our relationship seemed like the fairytale it had been. She began acting very disengaged around me and quiet around mid-March when I began to talk about making definitive plans to move in together (she has lived at home w/ her family her entire life and has never lived w/ a partner). At the time, she said she was just scared of leaving her family and we kinda of agreed to push moving in together back and from there, things seemed to improve somewhat, although they never got to where they were before.

This past week, she acted disengaged and quiet around me and she admitted she felt a lack of connection with me. She said our conversations had become mundane and just really felt confused and unsure of things. We have some good things in common, but sometimes trying to get her to talk about stuff is like herding cats. During her quiet moments, she usually says she's tired and just not in a talkative mood. She is, after all, someone who values her ""me time,"" so to speak.

Truth is, in hindsight, I suppose we got engaged too soon and it put some unneeded pressures on our relationship. We also never saw the caronavirus thing coming and although that affects everyone, I feel like if our relationship were meant to be, we'd be strong enough to get through this. Because of it, we don't go on dates like we used to and are more so confined to walks/hiking and hanging out watching things on TV. We had a wedding date of Oct but had pushed this back to May of next year because of caronavirus. For the most part, we get along very well and never fight; we travel well together too.

We briefly broke things off, but she agreed we should work on it. What do I do? Should I keep fighting for this relationship? Take a break? Break it off completely? How do I get my partner to feel that special connection again, or is it even possible? I'd like it to work out, but don't want to keep prolonging the inevitable if this isn't meant to be. We've agreed to try and work on how we communicate and she does claim to still be physically attracted to me and our sex life has always seemed fine, although she has admitted she hasn't been into it as much as me. I'd really like this to work out, but I just don't know what to do. Thanks!!

1100,"Weird scenario, but it's tearing us apart. I cry with frustration almost everyday as I have no idea how to snap out of it. We are both so sad and just why things to get back to normal. My boyfriend is yet to be diagnosed (starting therapy tomorrow!!) and has scary intrusive thoughts and some physical compulsions. He is a textbook example, more so than me. Despite how scared and disgusted he is by these thoughts and tries to avoid them,  I just can't accept that it's JUST OCD. Whenever he tells me an intrusive thought and reveals how scared and disgusted he was, I immediately think ""disgusting/sick man, OCD isn't even real"". I'm so terrified because sometimes he worries he enjoyed a thought for a second and if that's true, wtf, how could he THINK he could enjoy a thought like that? How is this even OCD anymore?????

I'm so upset and my new therapist thinks I too have OCD (for my health obsessions and my deep fear of my bf being a bad person).

1104,"I’m not sure if I’m in the right subreddit, or if I’m even doing this right at all. Please stay with me, this is my first post ever. I always go to reddit for advice anyway, so I figured I might as well ask. 

Okay, so I have worked at this place for almost 5 years now. In this specific department, I am going on 2 years alongside my coworker who has the same job title as me. I am 21 and he is over 40, so he’s obviously more experienced. 

He has bullied and harassed me for a bunch of different things for those 2 years. I won’t go into details as this post will get really long, but to summarize: he has mocked my art, my work, said I’m not qualified for my job, etc. Pretty nasty stuff that I tried to write down and document when I could. 

Eventually, I got fed up and went to my manager who then took it to HR. There was an investigation and the next day, he was in. Okay, maybe it was a write up.
My manager then comes to me and tells me that I need to tell him when to stop joking around. That he claimed they were all jokes and I never told him to stop. She believed him. (Disclaimer, I told him to not speak to me like that. Hell, he’s even seen me leave the room crying too. Pretty sure the whole department did.) 

Needless to say, the behavior didn’t stop. Luckily, he went to work from home while I stayed at the facility. I told my manger that the behavior didn’t stop and if I could move my desk. She said she’d have to regroup with HR about it. This was back in May.

Now, they’re switching desks around in the office. I emailed her, asking if one of us was still able to move. She said that we would discuss it later. I went to HR to see what could be done and they said that they can’t force her to move me / him. And that my manager never “regrouped” with him about the harassment not stopping. 

Her and I are going to talk about this tomorrow, but I know that she will defend her stance on not moving me. It makes sense that we’re right next to each other, because we have the same job title. However, we never work together on projects. It wouldn’t be difficult to move him/me. 

I have told her that I do not feel comfortable around him. That he won’t stop and that we just don’t work well together.

What can I do? 

I don’t want another job, because the pay is really good at this one and I also love the facility (apart from this manager.) 

This might be a stupid idea, but could I possibly get a doctor’s note? Not to get, deep, but I suffered with an on and off ED for a little under a decade now. Due to his constant comments on my weight, it triggered me to relapse on multiple occasions. It really sucks. Could I ask my therapist to write a note to further push my case? 

I just don’t know what to do. I’m at the point where I was thinking about going to a different department when he returned. I really don’t want to do that either. I worked so hard to get in this department. 

I feel as if they don’t want to take any action against him, because of his experience. He’s good at his job. I’m not asking for them to fire him or suspend him. Just move one of us. 

What do you guys recommend ?

I was, and still am, burdened with expectations that I will have a great successful future by everyone in the family. Since 2017, my father supported my education and did not hold back any kindness he could of given; needed a place to live? He rents it for me. Needed to pay my bills? Those are paid too. He practically relieved me of anything that burdens my education. All I had to do was study to get a degree, that’s it. Nothing more and nothing less, yet even after all that help, I couldn’t find any joy of studying for any cause. Slowly I became negligent of my education. I get those moments of “I will do my best in this term!” Then those moment turn to “Eh. There’s always next term to do better. No worries.” Whenever I am in attending the classes I listen to the professor and am intrigued by the subject and want to learn more because I actually enjoy listening and learning! But when I am home and open textbooks for studying or for homework, I just suddenly lose all motivation to do anything at all. My daily schedule was wide open and I had no pressure or problems, but there’s no motivation. Yeah sure everyone despises studying, but if I truly hate studying then I wouldn’t of even tried to study at all! I don’t understand how I got to this point.

I have tried to get a hobby. Sense I had free time I decided to get a part time job just try to break out of my problem bubble. I don’t care how much it was paying me, as long as it’ll give me the will to do anything. 


I am sorry if this is overloaded with too much information, I just needed to get it off my chest and ask for help.",07Jul2020,1
1108,"And I am so EXCITED!!

My other dog is an old rescue, so I plan on potty training them both at the same time! (Wish me luck lol)

I've been working with my old dog, taking him out every hour and keeping him on a leash when he's not next to me (he likes to sneak off and pee) so I plan on doing the same with the puppy.

Is there anything I need to expect? Never really been around a puppy before. 

They're both beagles, I expect the puppy to be as stubborn as my old dog, but with more energy. 

Any tips? 😊",07Jul2020,1
1109,"  

So I have recently realized I am a liar. I don't do it because I like attention or I feel like I have to make things up, I lie because my reality is so shitty it easier for me to lie to myself and believe the lie as reality. I'm so convincing sometimes I have false memories of how my life is. But Anywho, let me tell you how I fucking managed to ruin my life and my lies are catching up with me faster and faster each day. I just need to tell the truth for once so I can feel better. Something about being anonymous makes this bearable. If I went through the origin of lies we'd be here all day so I'll just start with post-college. Okay, so I'm 23, back home with my parents, and contemplating suicide regularly. Why? Because I couldn't financially make it in the big city I'd moved to after college, and I have a BA in History, so job prospects were dismal. I was so embarrassed about this turn of events that I lied to my friends in the city and said I got a good job back home. The only place I could get a job was as a car salesman, and I sucked at it btw. I was making $12 an hour, working like 50+ hours a week, selling like nothing. I'm very likable, but the negotiation part is where shit was bad for me. And as a woman, tbh, it's tough in this industry if you're not hot. I'm not hot. I'm more like a cute little sister. Seriously, my bosses liked me so much they didn't want to fire me so after my first 4 months, they created a job for me. The downside is, it was the same pay, fewer hours and I was left alone in an office all day. They just wanted me to come out of the office, and talk to people who had their car in service, convince them to trade the car, and let someone else sell them a new one. I know what you're thinking, sounds like an okay set up right? It wasn't. People are really fucking mean in service, and I was being swatted down all the time. and It just really started to wither me down and I expressed that I hated my job to my parents, but they told me to suck it up. and i tried, I really did. I asked for more training, and asked for administrative tasks, I was putting on a smile every day at work but then I would cry and eat my weight in food every day in my car. So here I am, turning into a house, more depressed than ever, and I just decided to quit and follow my passion. BIG MISTAKE. I was trying to be a makeup artist but I lived in a town where no one was checking for a makeup artist. Oh and I was lying to my parents and saying I was going to work when all this is happening. The first two weeks were great, I was getting high, still eating my weight in food, and trying to create a brand like every other 20 something. but by week 4 my parents start questioning my work, because sometimes I'd be home before them which never happens in the car business. So I wanted to make my lie less shaky, I started going to the library and applying for jobs. I wanted to get into a makeup kind of role. I know I love makeup, I love people, and I thought there was a chance at upward mobility. When I tell you, I heard back from 0 of the 200+ apps I did, it was devasting. So I can’t find a job, I’m running out of money, and again, the lie is starting to catch up with me. 

Here is where the story gets worse. My sister comes home to visit from her new move to another state. She could tell that I was not doing okay and I guess my mom told her that she suspected that I was depressed. I didn’t realize it at the time but I packed on like almost 30 pounds in like 4 months. So while my sister is home, she decides to surprise me and take me to lunch. My job tells her that I’m not there, and that I haven’t been there in a few weeks. My sister calls me while I’m at the library doing my usual routine. I’ve been caught, so I confess my lie. She tells me my secret is safe with her, and that I’m moving in with her. She tells me I’m going on a diet, and that I have to make it my mission to geta job or she’s gonna have to send me back home because she can’t afford to support me. So I agree, I told my mom that I quit that day (even though I had quit a month ago) my mom sends me off with 200 bucks assuming that I’m still expecting one more check from my job that I *just* quitted. So my sister realizes I’m nickel and diming it, so she helps me out, for my first month out there. I got a job at a makeup counter and making $15 now plus commission, and I’m not bad at it. I realize soon after working at a makeup counter in a department store that its more sales, less makeup. Its whatever though, its paying the bills. And I finally have a routine. More and more things start irking me about this job. I’m still embarrassed that I’m doing this job unlike my friends who are getting their first real career jobs, so I lie to them to make myself feel better about the work I’m actually doing in the new state. The more I’m at this counter, the less of a person I feel. We’re wearing these stupid lab coats, the managers are threatening us for not getting folks to open credit cards, and I got my first write up for being over 5 minutes late to work. Mind you, the schedule is so inconsistent, you have no weekends to do things, or seek other employment, and you’re pooped from dealing with customers and impossible sales goals that keep getting raised. Not to mention there’s also my manager who would steal sales to hit her quota and gas lights us into feeling like she does things like that to train us. I could go into a whole other conversation about that, but I’m gonna focus on my wrongs and reasons. So what’s happening on the sidelines is my sister lost her job, and tension had begun to build and build because we just weren’t living well together. She even told my secret about what happened at the car dealership, and when my mom asked me about it, I denied it. I was livid that the person I trusted so blindly told on me,and I was even more mad at myself that I couldn’t just be honest with my mom, because I didn’t want to lose her trust, or her help. I decided to get my own space, because I didn’t want my relationship with my sister to change. She’s my best friend and I couldn’t afford that relationship to sour on top of everything else. So I got an apartment. It was kind of a crappy one but you know it is mine, I had to move kind of far away from my job because it was the only area I could afford the rent (barely). So I made the most of it, my mom helped me out with decorating it and putting the money together for the deposit. I was feeling better about my living situation, and having some independence Finally! Like Finally, I have something in the right direction. I have a place and I live alone. I was losing weight, finally about 40 pounds down.

Just as things are looking up for me at home, things start going down at work. Sales were down because the holidays were over, but we were given even bigger goals, a manager was getting down my throat about pushing the credit cards, but the majority of customers that shopped with me had the credit card already. But of course, it was still my responsibility to hit my sales goals, find new people to open credit cards, and keep a smile on my face. By this point I’m fed up, and I got another write up for my tardies I acquired during my relocation to my new place. So they basically told me, if I was late again I ‘d be fired. So I’m stressed again, feeling less than motivated to continue on, and the pandemic hits my city. The store that I worked for was not really taking it serious, we were still doing makeup, but just wiping down things more. No gloves, no masks, just keeping up with the joneses. I wanted to transfer to another store that was closer to home, so I wouldn’t risk losing my job. They said I couldn’t transfer for 6 months because of my write up, and that I was unable to be late ever in a 6 month period or I’d lose my job. Something in me snapped. I did what I always do when shit doesn’t work for me. I planned to quit. I knew my parents would be against it, and I knew my sister couldn’t keep a secret so I lied to them and said I got the transfer. I figured as long as I had another job lined up within a month it wouldn’t matter. I hyped myself up, told myself that I could find another job, and at least I would be closer to home figuring stuff out. I even found out that my particular store had a no compete, so if you gave them your two weeks notice, but said you accepted a job offer at competitor retailer, they would terminate you and you pay you out for the two weeks you gave notice. So I did just that. At the time it felt great. Just like the last time I quit. Except this time I thought I had finessed a system that wronged me, got my pain and suffering, and I could find something that wasn’t customer facing because of the pandemic. So two weeks later, the state shuts down. If I would have waited 14 more days, They would have just furloughed me. And I would have qualified for unemployment. And the Covid benefits. Just 14 more days. I was feeling so stupid. I just told my family I was furloughed to give myself time to figure out how I was going to undo this mess I’d made for myself.

My sister was pressuring me to file unemployment because she said I’d qualify. At first I didn’t apply for it because I knew that there was no way, I technically quit so there was nothing for me to gain this was around the end of march. And at first I just kept brushing it off, but then she kept asking about if I filed a claim yet and why I was brushing it off, I got the stimulus check and that kept my head above water for awhile, and I lied and said I had filed my claim in April so she’d stop asking. Eventually after paying my bills I was running low on money again So I just filed it. I was honest about why I left on my claim. I said I was terminated after giving notice to quit. So I’m filing these weekly claims, and it doesn’t reject it, it says pending. I suddenly had hope that maybe they’d approve my claim, at least for something. I can’t find work, I have like no money to my name, and I was turning 24 feeling like an absolute idiot, thinking about ending it all I call my mom in a panic, crying frantically about my life. She’s trying to console me but I can’t even tell her why I am really crying. I just said that I was fired, and I had no job, no prospects, and no way of supporting myself or paying this stupid rent that I am stuck to. My mom is helping me out because she thinks this terrible stuff that is happening to me is none of my own doing, when in fact, everything that led me to where I am is my own doing. So my mom is keeping me afloat right now, but even she thinks that I’m going to be getting unemployment benefits and I’ll pay her back at some point. I’m depressed and drowning in lies, and it gets worse.

My sister gets a job at the unemployment office. So now she’s really telling me how she’s glad I filed my unemployment because she’s seeing people “just like me” getting 14k worth of back pay on their claims and not to worry because my money will come. She keeps telling me this could be a reason why its taking so long, and that she learned things about what could make peoples claim say pending. It’s killing me. I’m afraid she’s going to find my claim, and then all of my lies will just come spilling out. No one will trust me after this. I don’t blame them, I clearly can’t handle adult conversations or owning up to my bad decisions. I can’t stop fucking up. I feel like my life is over. I am 24 with a bunch of 6 to 9 month jobs on my resume, all of which digress from one bad job to another because I can’t seem to find something to stick to. I can’t even get an interview anywhere, I have no idea how I’m going to pay back anyone who has helped me. And I just feel hopeless. The worst part is having absolutely no one to talk to about it. I can’t talk to my friends because I lied so much about work to them to make my life feel less shitty, how could I possibly tell them its actually worse than what the truth was 6 months ago. I can’t tell my sister because one way or another it will get back to my mom, and I can’t tell my mom because she’s all I’ve got and I just don’t know if my heart can take disappointing her as much as I’ve disappointed myself. So what do I do? Do I just kill myself? That almost seems easier than dealing with the mess I’ve made.",07Jul2020,1
1110,"During my early teens through now, my mother constantly talked about how horrible of a man my dad used to be. Even though they're still together, she talks so horribly about him. She's told me all about how she didn't want kids, how I was just an anchor baby to keep her in the relationship. And, my favorite, how I'm exactly like him, just in a different person. I used to be so loving towards her. I never wanted to be mean. But I've just realised what's changed in our relationship, and it's that I'm extremely hurt by hearing all of this. I didn't think it bothered me. I used to think it was funny. But the older I've gotten, the more I actually learn what everything she's told me means. Now, my sister is a carbon copy of my mom. I can't stand my sister and she can't stand me. She was my mother's golden child, and I could always see it. The interactions between the two of them have always been more loving and more natural than between my mother and I. I've never heard my mother point out a negative flaw my sister has, compared to at least once a day with me. Now, I don't think the fact that my sister and mother have an actual relationship and have since my sister was born is the reason I can't stand my sister. It's because she has disdain for me because she places my mother on such a pedestal that my mother's opinions become my sister's as well. 

I respect my dad. I hold no other person higher than him. I love him with everything in me. And I listen to what he tells me. But with my mother, everything is a fight for me. I don't respect her. I don't listen. I don't care if I disappoint her or enrage her. I used to hold her higher than my dad in the respect field, but after she started talking about why I exist  and how I'm just like my ""dickhead"" of a dad, I slowly quit caring about what she wanted from me. I turned cold. Our relationship crumbled because she couldn't stand me as a person, and I can't stand her constant critiques.

I'm finally to the point where I want nothing to do with her. All of this sounds like ""Hey, I'm exactly like my dad, and maybe my dad WAS a dickhead."" He could be a dickhead, but it wasn't his only trait. He loves my mother with everything in him and he's honestly find a way to move the moon for her if she asked. I honestly think that if he lost her, he'd go off the rails.

I'm really just asking if you guys think I need to cut ties. And if I cut ties with my mother and my sister, I'm almost positive I lose my dad, too.",07Jul2020,1
1111,"Hey all,

I research in a laboratory and happen to be the supervisor (under the professor obviously). There is a graduate student in the lab who I unfortunately have strong feelings for (she already rejected me because religious differences a long time ago).

Her and I get along very well in the lab and in general. I feel like I’ve helped her quite a bit over the two years we’ve been in the lab together and she frequently asks and expects me to know all the answers to her questions, to which I’d say I’m pretty good at answering most of them. I used to be on “her team” as she likes to say over a year ago before I started my own thesis. 

Since then I don’t run experiments for her and whatnot because I have my own projects and many other students to train. We have never really talked outside of the lab, so naturally I am less inclined to go out of my way to help her with her project because she doesn’t communicate with me about the status of her project unless we see each other in person. 

Recently last month we started communicating more and are getting closer to closing up her project as she’s graduating soon. As per usual, the communication only lasted a few weeks and we haven’t talked in a couple weeks (she NEVER communicates first). 

My issue here is that I’m always the one who has to message her first about HER research to give HER help that SHE asked for. As if she’s doing me a favor for helping her. (Yes I have addressed her inability to communicate, with her)

Anyhow, I genuinely want to help her with her research, want to hear updates about its progress, and want to make sure I get authorship on the paper; so I want to communicate with her, but not at the expense of my self-respect. Throw in the fact that I somehow still passive have feelings, I’m not okay with just being her laboratory servant.

I’m really conflicted as to what I should do in this situation. Any advice will be greatly appreciated.

Tl;dr 
I have strong feelings for a coworker. We used to research on a project together until I started my own. I want to help her with her research but she doesn’t communicate with me first after asking for help and I don’t want to always be the one initiating contact first about her work. I want to stay in contact to make sure I get authorship but not at the expense of my self-respect and I definitely dont want to be “just friends/coworkers” with her.",07Jul2020,1

I suffer from depression and very big social anxiety, and that started when I was about 14 years old (I'm 17 now). It's like something triggered in my brain, because before then I was a pretty social kid and was pretty happy.

Maybe I just have autism, but I don't feel like I do and I've always had an easy time understanding how others feel and facial expressions and all that, which people with autism usually can't. And I was also a pretty normal kid before.

Recently due to the ongoing pandemic and some mental health issues my quality of work has been slipping. I’m running on thin ice at this point because the pandemic has made my role even more essential and I haven’t been able to step up in the way I have needed to. The matter at hand is something I forgot to do about a while ago. The mistake didn’t cost a significant of time or money but when asked I told my boss that I did it correctly. Now my boss is going to submit a complaint about a number of other issues with the department I was interacting with (that are legitimate) as well as the issue my mistake caused and wants to include evidence that they weren’t doing their jobs.  Now I could create evidence that I did it correctly, throwing someone else in that department under the bus. I could create evidence that I did it incorrectly but with good intent. Alternatively I could come completely clean and say I lied. As I said I’m on thin ice so this decision could get me fired.

1114,"So my issue is this. I have a lot of trouble finding the motivation to just...do things. Anything from simple day to day tasks to super important end of the world type stuff I just...don’t do. It’s like I could care less which annoys me because I do care very much, I just can’t bring myself to move. I feel tired most of the time, some days exhausted. I try to stick to a schedule where I wake up early, get some exercise and go about my day. 

The problem is one tiny little thing can feel like the biggest hill to climb. And if I happen to accomplish the tiniest simplest thing, it’s like that’s all I had energy for in the day and need the rest of the day to recharge. 

It’s hard because I just want to be able to function like everyone else who is able to do multiple things in the day and have it be nothing to them. I used to think that it was a lack of rest but even when I focused on my health and rest nothing changed. In fact the more I rested the less energy I had and the more I was willing to sleep the whole day away. 

I’ve looked into therapy as a means of getting my life together but BetterHelp was a waste of money (no one on there and the ones that were responded once a week) and no one else in person or in my area (LA) that was both available and accepted my insurance.

So I'm (27, TF) trying my best to face long-standing issues head-on, but I still feel like some things are beyond my ability to deal with. A couple of things are roughly 15 years of intense body/gender/sexuality based dysphoria. Starting at puberty I felt like my brain started perpetually melting down and often resulted in emotionally volatile crises, which have only begun to be effectively treated the last few years. There were some emotionally traumatic experiences along the way, all culminating in things like intimacy/trust issues and intense fear of sexual experiences. I've been working on these for most of my 20s with the help of counseling and an amazing support system, but I still feel the anxieties that I'm too broken after all of these experiences, or that the fact that I have minimal sexual experience might be major turn-offs for anyone else. 

I don't want to have these turn into self-fulfilling prophecies, but what else can I do to move past these? Is there anything that I'm missing?

1122,"TW : abuse 

So when I was 4, me and my three sisters were taken away from our parents when they went to prison and we were sent to live with our fathers parents. They were extremely abusive to me and my two older sisters, physically, emotionally &amp; mentally. They also abused my father and my aunt when they were children, my father sexually and my father is convinced they sexually abused my little sister. The three of us that are older have repressed memories and can’t confirm if any of the four of us were sexually abused but he’s always made us very uncomfortable and would beat us naked and touch us on the butt often. I know for sure there is evidence of abuse that went on like multiple CPS reports but also she would take photos of my sister that she hated the most after making her vomit, making her nose bleed &amp; of her bruised and all the marks on her body. I don’t know if she still has the photos but she would print them out and show us them and I whole heartedly believe she is disgusting enough to keep them. This went on from the time I was 4 until I was 16, my two older sisters stopped seeing them sooner because my mom eventually got custody of us later on, however my mom knows what happened and still allows my little sister to visit them frequently. My older sisters and I now suffer from PTSD &amp; I have various other mental health issues, so does my aunt &amp; my father. 

I have wanted to press charges for a few years but my therapist didn’t think I would be able to handle going through a trial but I think I am a lot stronger now and I think I’m ready to handle it but I have no idea about how to press charges for something like this because I am now 20. There is no statue of limitations for child abuse but I’ve tried to talk to the cops about pressing charges and they were not helpful. I don’t know where to start to even get the ball rolling but I 100% believe they deserve to rot in prison for the rest of their life and even if I don’t win at least people will know and hear how fucking awful they really are and I think it would help all of us heal taking them to court. I hate them so much and every day they just get to live their life like they have done nothing wrong and it kills me. Please does any one have any advice? Should I get a lawyer or should I try and contact the police but this time with my sisters with me ?

There is nothing wrong with me, at least I hope. I’m a very emotional person. I’m only 15 by the way. Sometimes I will think about something or hear a certain song and just cry. I only do this when I’m alone of course, my family would just think I’m crazy. All of this only started when I turned 15, got worse when the pandemic started. I feel like I’ve just made these people a huge part of my life, even though they are not. 

I don’t want to feel like this anymore. I feel crazy. I had a dream that my best friend and my ex started dating last night. Can’t remember any of my dreams but that one. Every time I think about it my stomach starts hurting. Came across a post on here titled ‘My best friend is dating my ex.’ I don’t have feelings for my ex anymore even though we are still friends. I just don’t know what to think anymore.

Maybe it’s because I’m young and just feeling things, maybe it’s part of growing up, maybe it’s just me. I really don’t know and I just want some advice on how I should get over these people and my thoughts and my emotions. Please don’t judge me, I didn’t ask to feel this way and I came asking for help from reddit because this is something that I trust. Sadly, I don’t want to talk to my family about this, they’re not very understanding.

Sorry about the long post, but thank you if you got here to the end.",07Jul2020,1

1126,"So I am a 17 year old 5'10 male, and for quite a while I have felt fairly insecure about my height, no one has ever said i'm too short or made fun of my height and in fact I was an early bloomer and had my growth spurts early and was the tallest person in my year at school for a while, but i started to notice everyone got taller than me slowly as years went on, and even people who were proper short shot up and are now much bigger than me. Basically, id like advice on how i can feel better about it, because i'm not short and i know that but cant help but feel tiny and insecure about this. ONLY READ THE REST IF YOU WANT TO KNOW MY THEORIES ON WHY I THINK I FEEL LIKE THIS. IF YOUR NOT BOTHERED WITH THE REASONS WHY AND JUST WANNA GIVE ADVICE THEN YOU CAN STOP HERE.

I was bullied a fair bit when i was younger and part of wonders whether now that there are a lot of people taller than me iv lost that one thing i had over some people that used to tease me for being overweight, but then i lost that.

my other reasoning for maybe why i feel like this is fairly stupid. iv never been one for masculinity or trying to act tough or getting into fights, never been a thing i cared about, but part of me wonders whether this is the one thing that the small amount of macho energy in me actually cares about for some reason and is bothered by.

and finally, the dumbest of my reasoning/theories, when i was younger because i was a big lad i used to always get told that for definite that i would be over 6ft, and im 17 and that hasnt happened, and i used to watch WWE a lot and i reckon the average height for their wrestlers is somewhere bewteen 6'2 and 6'6 and then you find guys that are even taller, like 6'8 to 7ft in some cases.

dumb stuff but if anyone can lend some advice then feel free to.",07Jul2020,1
1127,"I honestly don’t me know what to do at this point. Alright back story so I’m an 18 year old short female who has suffered on going physical, mental and verbal abuse from my father and younger siblings. The last few months have gotten worse up until now my breaking point. I’ve always been blamed for things in my house, if anything happened it’s always my fault so I’ve been  the scapegoat for the longest time. My siblings find it funny to blame me and watch me get yelled at and my father gives the the okay to beat me to the ground ripping out my hair, scrapping my wrist and arms and kicking at my joins. (I have really weak joins and haven’t gone to my appointment yet to find out why)  because I use to “hurt” them? My father was in and out of the hospital, medical complications, so he wasn’t there much. He manipulated my siblings into thinking I did stuff like that but when I did get into fights I’d pin them by holding their wrists to the ground and putting my knees up against their waist. They have alway been extremely violent towards me mostly mimicking my dad. Anyways today I was beaten to the point of vomiting, then they stole my laptop and iPad along with my chargers and what little cash I had (I’m not aloud to get a job as long as I live under their roof) I’m getting my head literally slammed into the ground yelling at the top of my lungs for help. After I confront my dad asking for him to get my stuff back and he says “ well I didn’t know this was happening, it’s your fault anyways for provoking them”  I reply still in tears “they stole my stuff for no reasons I just want it back” and then he went on a rant about how weak I am and I should toughen up or join the military and have graduated high school years ago. I just don’t know what to do I can no longer taking living like this please I need advice.

And we kinda have talked about it, but I feel that he doesn’t understand how grand the difference is. (Need to buy headphones and he said that I need to get Razor and they cost approx. 90$ which for me is ridiculously big amount of money on such not priority thing).

2) what choice do this puts him in.

I've changed my major 3 times, hopefully, this one sticks. I have to transfer to a better school for the degree, which means I have to pick one and look for one and I don't even know where to start. 

I'm terrified of the future. My boyfriend of 2 years is almost the same in this respect. I love him with all my heart, but I'm scared our future is going nowhere. I only find joy in playing video games and spending time with him. I never hang out with friends (very introverted and everyone lives in different places). I have a shitty hostess job, I go to community college. I was the first to start college in my family and I'm probably going to be the last to finish it. 

I know that video games and my boyfriend are the only things making me happy. I know that this is probably why I'm not going anywhere. I'm not willing to give up the few joys of my day to possibly better my life. This is my problem. 

It's insanely hard for me to find the motivation to better my life because I'm terrified it'll all be for nothing anyway so who cares. There's no guarantee I'll graduate college. There's no guarantee I'll get a job once I finish college. No guarantee I'll be able to live on my own and have a family. No guarantee that no matter how much I work I will be happy.  I've been scared I'm going to end up homeless my whole life and all I do is watch with terror as the reality gets closer, frozen.

Later in the day she texted me 'turn of events', so I immediately FaceTimed her to get a response right away. She answers, and she's laying in bed with her boyfriend. She tells me she can't come over because it turns out she saw her cousin less than two weeks ago. 

I'm not upset she isn't coming over because of her cousin, but it does hurt to see her with her boyfriend.

I want a relationship with a woman. There are just needs I have that a man cannot fulfill and I told my husband and he went off on me.

1136,"Hi guys,

About four months ago, my friend's boyfriend broke up with her and she has since been on a negative spiral. She's been diagnosed with depression and anxiety and regularly has very, very intense mood swings. For the past three months, I've been doing my best to keep her company and afloat throughout a period which for various, stacking reasons has been intensely emotionally turbulent. We talk more or less every day, with conversation picking up towards the early hours of the morning.

My anxiety mainly stems from two things: 

1) I think I have recently developed feelings for my friend and I am unsure about whether or not she feels the same way. Either way, it is somewhat immaterial; expecting her to process the information that I like her while she's not in a good way would be unfair and manipulative. I only wonder whether or not I'm becoming too dependent on her company because it's beginning to hurt a little bit.

2) I don't know what to do in person if she has an intense mood swing or anxiety attack. I can talk things through over text because I'm at a distance and have a bit more wiggle room to think. If I'm in the moment, I'm scared I'll panic and not be as helpful as I could be. 

Would anyone be able to give me some advice on how I might prepare for her coming over and what I might do to make things easier for myself and her? I have no expectations or plans for watching the movies other than it being two friends sitting together and watching a few films.",07Jul2020,1

1141,"I [F20] met this guy [M23] on tinder and we hit it off really well. We have a lot of things in common but obviously some differences as well. Now here's the main problem, I'm from Canada and he is from the States. But we're only an hour away from each other. We talked about this and he said it would take more than the border to break the bond ***(I know travelling across the border and meeting up isn't an option right now so as of now there's no way to physically meet up).***

Through this time we started enjoying talking to each other and he told me how he really likes me. He also added that I had ran into a keeper aka him. And I believed it all cause he's genuinely a sweet guy. Around the same time, he opened up to me and told me about this particular situation he was stressed out about which was a health issue (turns out the results for normal) anyway the point is that he kept telling me I was there for him through a tough time and how he appreciated that (this will come handy later). 

We continued to talk over tinder for around 3 weeks until he said he would give me his number. ***I should add, I didn't approach him for his number or give mine right away because I've dealt with a stalker in the past and it just didn't feel right until I made sure it was ok to do so.*** 

The first couple days were fine, we had good conversations. He then proceeded to ask me what I wanted and I was honest with him about everything. I even told him the stalker story and how I wanted everything to go slow. He agreed and told me that he wanted to do the same and has been taking his time. He also said that I was the only one he was enjoying his conversation with on tinder and how I was the only one he was talking to. He then suggested we do a phone call and I agreed to, however he ended up being busy that day and told me a few hours later while I waited. I mean I understood but it only takes a few seconds to text that, however I let it go. 

Ever since last Thursday, I've noticed he doesn't message in the morning. He doesn't respond to the last message from the night before. Which again I'd fine but at least start a conversation? 

I'm just confused because he was the one who kept asking if I was ready for his number which to me meant that he would be willing to talk over text then.
I should also add I went on tinder again and saw he wasn't in my matches anymore so I don't know what's up with that? I guess he unmatched or deleted his account? 

Now remember how I mentioned I was there for him?  This past week I was upset about something and through our conversation it came up and I told him what was up and he said ""I wish I could help"" but that's about it. He didn't message at all until the next day at 10P.M and asked if everything is fine. I understand people get busy but it's not that hard to try and send one text. What's sad is that he was the one who mentioned how important communication is to him...

I don't know what to do now. We talked a bit after that before he went to sleep and then it was the same thing again. No message or anything, so in the evening I asked how work was and he responded about 3 hours later and said he was off. Then he sent a couple texts and went to sleep. And before that he said ""you and I need to talk on the phone one of these days."" So there we go again, another mixed signal. I'm so confused, what should I do? I really like him but a part of me wants to tell him this isn't going to work and we should stop talking and maybe remain friends.",07Jul2020,1

1143,"Hey Y'all,

Fairly new to reddit so apologies to the formatting.

**TLDR:** Roomie refuses to follow through on what they say they will do. They aren't taking care of their cat, who is now possibly sick from lack of care. We have tried talking to them for MONTHS (December 2019) about their behaviors and have tried to help them with their mental health. I own the house and am tired of their excuses for not doing their agreed portions. How do I either help make this situation better, or do I evict them? 

&amp;#x200B;

\--- Full story ---

August 2019 I got a house from family that still has a mortgage on it. Told either sell it or take on the mortgage. I took it on with the help of my partner and 3 friends who all needed a place to live. 

Partner is doing great. 2/3 roommates are doing great. The 3rd one is not though. 

3rd one, we'll call S. 

We all moved in October 14th, 2019 and agreed to a basic ppwk lease for 1 year.

So you know the agreements we set up -

Dishes 2x a week if you eat group meals (We all did and do enjoy to cook for each other)

Take out trash and recycling as needed

Keep your rooms clean

Keep your bathrooms clean

Everyone help keep the main level swept and mopped as needed

Lawn work as needed

If pets are brought in, they are the owners responsibility and they have to get along with my cat (Who has been with me for 6 years and all the roomies love) 

Any damages done by the roomie or their pet, needs to be repaired or compensated for by the person at fault. 

There are a few other nuances like having folks over and just general respecting each other, but those are the ones that we have really had to deal with with S. 

S has adhd, anxiety, depression, and more. We saw a vast improvement in their mental health over the past few years and decided to let them move in with us. Other 2 roomies liked S so we all got along and everything was great. We saw S get even better once they moved in, started writing again, getting out more, doing college and excelling - they just blossomed. 

Then around January 2020, S fell off the train. We started with helping just with reminders and listening to them. Trying to make house chores and other responsibilities more lenient towards them. We weren't thrilled but we went in with the mindset of helping a friend. Every time we talked, S said they just couldn't remember to do their portion of chores and would strive to do better.

March 2020 we made a chore chart, and had more conversations about being able to follow through and set reminders everywhere in the house so S could have everything they would need to succeed. 

April 2020 S brought a cat home. This cat was so scared of everything they didn't leave S's room until June. 

We set down the rules of making sure that they clean the cat box appropriately, feeding them, vet visits. Showed them all the ppwk we have for our cat and estimated vet costs depending on what kind of visit. We HOPED that this cat would help S get out of their funk. At least enough to take care of the cat. We know for our cat we would do anything if that is what he needed. 

May 2020 we noticed a smell. We asked S to clean their cat box and they said they didn't smell anything. We went to hang out with them in their room, and promptly left it. It stunk to high heaven. We told S they needed to clean their room and cat box immediately. 

They did.

We started talking in earnest again about chore charts, and doing research on how to help someone with their mental health issues. So we suggested therapy as well as a slew of other things. S said they would make an appointment asap. 

June 2020 we set up a 30 day intense reminder schedule, weekly check ins, as well as medicine checks (Which S ASKED US TO DO) to make sure they were getting their meds, and doing their chores just in their room, not even in the rest of the house, and making sure their cat had a clean litter box. 

Also in June 2020, S ran out of money. Due to Covid, they were furloughed from their job and unable to pay rent. We worked out a payment schedule for July since their work started back up and they could pay then. So at this point we are out Junes Rent.

In the past 2 weeks, S's cat has come out of their shell and is now comfortable coming out of S's room. FANTASTIC! Then we noticed that S's room door was always open  (Important with their cat so it can use their box) and it stunk so badly we could smell it downstairs. 

The reminders got even more frequent and S kept saying they just couldn't remember and they were dissociating too badly and they were tired. I kept pressing. 

Then last Wednesday, July 1st, S had rent for July, but not utilities for June, or Utilities for July. We worked out a plan in earnest since their work had officially begun again and we could see the paychecks. 

That same day, I was working on laundry. I smelled something funny on the futon (Next to the washer) that their cat was laying on. I sniffed it and it reeked of cat piss. I had to wash the pile of laundry 3 separate times to get the smell out and the futon is still in the garage with a bath of baking soda and vinegar that I keep rotating between to hopefully save it. 

I told S they needed to clean their cat box and get the cat to a vet because they may have a UTI. They said it wasn't their cat. I told them how my cat hasn't pissed on anything  outside of his box in the 6 years he has been with me. That is with other cats coming in and out of his life. S said they'll look into it. 

Over the course of the next few days, I saw that their cat was using my cats litter box (Which in itself is fine. Gotta do what you gotta do) and so I was cleaning it even more frequently.  I still saw my cat use it so there was no issue. I cleaned it twice on July 2nd last week. 

I walked out of my bedroom that day and could smell S's room and the stink from their litter box. I stormed downstairs and asked when the last time they deep cleaned their litter box was and they said they hadn't. 

This cat had been in the room using that box since April 18th, 2020. I asked S that on July 2nd.

I SCREAMED at them. I don't scream. I HATE that shit and am still surprised I even did it. I called them disgusting and that what they were doing was disgusting and they needed to change. I couldn't handle it anymore. S said they didn't have the tools to deep clean the box and I handed them the bottle of vinegar that we were using on the futon. Told them to get their shit together and then stormed out. 

July 5th - Daytime - I apologized for screaming at S. I asked how the deep cleaning went and they said they still didn't do it because they were waiting on a shipment of some form of soap that they wanted to use for the box. I told them they needed to get it done that night. 

July 5th - Nighttime - I went to lay down in bed around midnight. And found my mattress had been pissed on right in the center of it. My partner stormed into S's room and told them what their cat did and how they HAVE TO take their cat to the vet. S denied it being their cat but said they might take the cat to one. 

July 6th - 8am - No sleep on my end. Just washing and scrubbing my mattress and all of the sheets. I called the vets office and got 2 appointments. One for my cat, just in case he was sick, and one for S's. We told S they had an appointment and they canceled it saying that they wanted to be the one to do it. We said fine and still took our cat to the vet for the check up. My cat did just fine at the vets and they said he needed to lose 1/2 a pound.

July 7th, Today - S canceled the appointment they set up for today to take the cat to the vet to see if they have a UTI. They said that it was our cat doing the pissing and that theirs was never at fault. 

\---

Yesterday we talked to the other 2 roomies and they both agree that what S is doing is horrendous and that no matter your mental health, you have to take care of your pet. You have to follow through on your end of a lease and that if they didn't start to act right then we would need to either wait out the lease or break it. 

On this upcoming Friday we will be having a full on sit down with the 5 of us about S's behavior and how they need to either step up or they can't live with us anymore. 

I need advice on how to handle this conversation that we'll be having. S's lease is up October 14th. We tried to make it a year with them but we may not. 

I don't know how to help them. I want them to clean up their messes. I want them to stay my friend. I want to be able to keep living together which is why we have been so easy towards them. But I don't know if I can tolerate them any more. I don't know if I want to give them another chance. 

I know at the end of the day it is my decision, but I don't know what to do.

First it was really nice but then she started texting others while I’m writing something and she sometimes didn’t even stay up after 00:00 and just said gn because she was „tired“ idk if it’s true tho. Anyways I almost always had to start the convo bcs she didn’t  even care otherwise. So we had some really nice conversation the last weeks but 5 days ago she asked if I wanted to go swim with her and some friends, and because I haven’t seen her in like 3 months because of corona I was like sure. Yesterday I asked her because  we wanted to go swim today and she answered with: „oh I and [friend] wanted to meet now because of the weather“. Then she asked if she should ask him if it is okay if I come with them. I declined bcs If they already didn’t include me then they don’t want to meet me. So today I just wen out with some other friends and they two met. Then when I texted her this evening she didn’t answer for like 1 hour then told me on Snapchat she is phoning so she’ll be there later. At 00:20 she texts me back and when I told her sth she didn’t even read it immediately but rather still texted the other guy. And this been going on for some days now and idk if it was with him but I’m pretty sure it is. So idk if I even want a relationship i mean I’m still 14 right ? But on the other hand It’s really tough to see her loosing interest if she ever had some. Idk if I should just tell her and then fuck off and focus on my teenage life or if I should try and get some experience and good times. And advice?",07Jul2020,1

1147,"For context, I don’t know where I stand on friends. Some of my friendships faded out and I’m not in contact with that many people, and I don’t see people in person except my family sometimes. My life was somewhat of a mess and getting better, but is clearing up. I’m also getting better, I just can’t influence the people around me so there are things I still have to deal with. And sometimes those things cause me to really just stop working in a sense, but I’m getting better at managing it. Additionally there are a few medical things I need to get checked but partially because of external circumstances not being as much of a problem these things have less of an impact on my life. And I am going to a doctor in a few months because I need to, and hopefully get helpful resources. Additionally, I’m 19F.

I’m in a better place now and I feel like I actually have control of my life, and some of this is giving me the courage to go about reaching out to new people and making friends, and possibly date someone. The only thing with dating is that I’m asexual, plus I don’t think I should give birth (the people I’ve known and my last relationship were looking for that in a partner) because of me and my families medical history; I would feel immense guilt if I knowingly passed something on to a child. Additionally I have a hard time connecting with people sometimes friendship wise, and am also gray romantic. I want to find people who have the same interests as me, maybe that would make things easier and be more relatable. 

I’m just nervous that if I go looking for a friendship or a partner and see if I connect with people that my problems would get in the way. Not that my problems would affect people (besides if I was in a relationship or if I become socially awkward in a friendship), but that people would not want to be friends if they found out I had these problems or that they’ll feel obliged to still try even though they don’t know how to approach me with their knowledge of my problems. I’m not looking to share to them my personal life unless they share with me theirs and I actually feel connected, it’s just that certain things get in the way of me being completely social; for example sometimes I have an aversion to touch, sometimes I can’t fully communicate and I need to stop, and I get startled extremely easily. In the past these things have caused me much problem and have caused people to worry about me, and I don’t want to cause any worry or scare people either. Additionally I’m on the spectrum and some people find it hard to be friends with those on the spectrum.

Should I try to pursue a relationship and/or new friendships with the social difficulty I have? Would it seem off-putting? At what point do i tell people, if at any point at all, an explanation to why I seem to be behaving not like them or in a way that makes me seem scared or nervous? It’s not like I can just get rid of these habits; I’m getting better but they’re still present. And as far as a relationship goes, do I even bother or do the behaviors and problems I posses pose too much of a problem to the point that it wouldn’t make sense if I sought someone out, plus when in a relationship do I mention anything I listed? 

Also does anyone know any apps that are good for dating and finding friends? I’ve tried friend apps a few years ago and they seem to attract a creepy audience or an audience of people or people who just want hookups. Also I’ve never tried searching for someone on a dating app. Is there any app that lists specific things as to avoid creepy and shady people, and also connect people to hobbies that they’re into? Any advice on any of these things is appreciated.",07Jul2020,1

1149,"i’m 19 now. my ex boyfriend leaked my nudes when i was 14-15. he even ended up leaking a picture of us together (we werent naked but it was a suggestive picture which showed we are intimate). to most people, that must mean nothing. but i come from a conservative orthodox family, and it completely tarnished my reputation in the place i lived and in front of my family. back then i did try to file a police report but it simply did nothing because there wasnt enough evidence. and the police said that the social media app i was getting harassed on didnt belong to our country but to USA, so nothing can be done and i had to contact the app online. (it was instagram)
i believe some nasty people screenshotted it, or spread the word to others, or forwarded the pictures.. because just recently a fake account was made on instagram and my picture in the with my ex bf was the dp. i dont know why. i havent argued with anyone or did anything but my picture was used out of nowhere.. and the account was going viral in the place i live. that account even messaged someone close to me and threatened to expose me even more and leak those nudes. i gave no reaction, just reported. eventually the account got deactivated itself. 
it triggered my anxiety and the bad flashbacks.
before that, in 2016 and 2017 ive also experienced these fake accounts exposing my nudes.
because of all this, ive developed anxiety. whenever a account adds me on instagram, or someone with a very low snapscore, or a fishy account with a very suspicious profile, i get so anxious that it’s someone who wants to harm me. and i think about it all day. i feel scared.
today someone added me on snapchat “by search” and i got paranoid that who gave my username.
at this point i dont know who else is making fake accounts apart from my ex boyfriend because obviously the picture has gotten around and there could be several people involved.
i’m deeply scarred and mortified. please advise me.
ive moved to another country to get rid of all those bad memories. but idk the anxiety doesnt go away. i’ve even made a new instagram account now with only trustworthy ones added but.. i’m anxious always that something bad is gonna happen. please advice me on how i can overcome all this.",07Jul2020,1

I’ve had crippling anxiety and depression for years which held me back a lot so this is my first real job. And I know I should feel fortunate I even have a job but I’m already depressed enough as it is so going into work everyday hoping my manager isn’t mean to me and I don’t lose my mind from boredom doesn’t really give me a positive attitude. I’m trying to find a new job and I’ve been applying to places and having interviews but it doesn’t seem to be fast enough for me. I’ve nearly quit multiple times the past couple weeks because I can’t stand working there. I’m trying to tough it out till I can get a new job but the days I have to work alone feel like torture. When someone is there I usually just talk to them most of the time because there’s literally nothing else to do otherwise. When I’m alone I literally have nothing to do all day except clean and the store is pretty small so it doesn’t take long at all. One day I got on my phone for a bit to try to pass the time after I had gotten a bunch of cleaning done and my manager came in and yelled at me for being on my phone and said there’s always more to clean even though there isn’t so I went and cried in the bathroom my whole lunch break. Before COVID I had lots of things to do, I work at a makeup store so I could do people’s makeup and clean the tester’s and clean the makeup brushes and such, now there’s none of that and barely any customers. Sometimes hours go by without a single person coming in. On top of that almost everyone at my work either quit or was asked to resign so I’m basically the only person they have with an open schedule.

1157,"TL;DR: I have great job security but I feel my boss is incredibly toxic. Should I pursue other employment but risk getting furloughed at a new job? 

So I live and work in a specific area of the United States that's been hit extremely hard by the coronavirus, and lots of people here lost their jobs as a result. I fortunately was not only able to keep mine, I was given a 10% raise and my company prides itself on job security (it has several employees who've been there for 20+ years).  The company is also WFH until the virus slows down and has handled COVID well in my opinion. Many of my friends who managed to get jobs during the pandemic have already been furloughed, and some have even been furloughed more than once in the last 5 months. 

While the core of my situation is obviously great, the reason I'm asking this is because of extreme tension with my direct boss. She has a serious temper and will call me at all hours to tell me how disappointing I am. On top of that, she only lets me speak to her, and anything that gets sent to anyone else in the company or to a client must be approved by her first or she needs to be CC'ed. I sort of understand where she's coming from, but mind you I'm in middle management and I've been with her for 3.5 years. 

In addition, she changes her rules to fit her needs that day, then fails to communicate that to me. For example, she'll tell me not to send her X anymore, then gets upset when I don't send her X as a result. She also doesn't lay down boundaries with clients, which causes me to overbill them. I'll communicate this with her, but then she tells me to move ahead anyway, then gets upset with me when we're well over our budgeted hour limit. This happens every month with no change, and of course she directs her anger out on me. She also schedules calls with me every two weeks to discuss our clients, but they just turn into 45 minute discussions about how my clients are on ""thin ice,"" even when the clients and I think we're doing well. It's just another way to express her disappointment in me. 

I feel like because of this dynamic, I wake up feeling anxious every day because I'm afraid of getting yelled at. She's pretty brutal-- over the years she's told me things like how I'm a disappointment (her favorite), how I'm not cut out for our industry, how I have an attitude problem (she says this if I disagree with her) and more. It's also key to mention that I used to have a ton of passion for this job and used to be excited to work here, but dealing with this for the last 3.5 years has left me feeling burnt out and unmotivated, and I know she can feel this because she comments on my lack of engagement. I will say that once she did ask me if my low engagement was due to my mental health and if there was any way she could help, but I obviously can't tell her that she's the reason why I feel this way. 

I feel like in a way, me shutting down and being disengaged is a coping mechanism for having to absorb her anger. She has communicated with me about her mental health issues before, and she treats everyone like this, including those above her. Our CEO has also discussed her ""constant negativity"" with her, but nothing seems to change. We've also had an intern quit 2 weeks early and forego a recommendation to get out of this environment, and one of our new hires transferred to one of our company offices on the other side of the country specifically to get away from her as well. 

It's a very tough relationship and it's been taking a toll on my mental health. And despite how this makes her sound like she hates me, the strange thing is she continues to promote me and give me raises. It's all incredibly confusing, and I wish she could just treat me with basic human respect. 

So basically, is the job security worth this? I know not to take stable income for granted in such an uncertain time, but I don't see this situation improving. Please help.",07Jul2020,1
1158,"My partner and I have been dating for 7 months and living together for 8 (we started off as roommates). We are a great match and have no issues so far with compatibility, communication, etc. We also have an older roommate who owns the home. 

I work in a government job doing labor market analysis stuff. My partner works as a lab manager for a neuroscience lab, and our roommate is a network engineer. I am an hourly employee and have to work 8 hours 5 days per week. My roommate and partner are both salaried. We have all been working from home since March. Roommate sometimes has a heavier workload but more often than not gets paid almost $80k to play video games, bike, hike, etc.

My partner can't really work from home since he works in a lab. He has maybe worked 10 days since March and when he does go into the lab it's only for 2 hours. Even before pandemic he would only work about 4-6 hours daily. I was working downtown 8 hours with a 2 hour daily commute. He went in at 10am and home before 5pm. I woke up at 5am and usually got back about 5:30pm.

I make more than my partner which doesn't matter. The only reason I'm saying it is because I feel like such a jerk to feel the mild bitterness/jealousy that I do towards my roommate and partner when I know how privileged I am compared to many other Americans right now. I really enjoy programming/computers. I've been trying to make some programs for my team but I just have so very little time that my progress in learning is nonexistent. I started learning Python and Linux back in January and have mostly picked up Linux the most so far. But I've been so busy that I haven't touched either in 1-2 months.

My partner wants to eventually make more money, so me doing programming inspired him to do programming. He very quickly surpassed me in Python once he was sent home during quarantine. Then he took on a side project for work that requires Linux. He has finally started learning that and is rapidly outpacing me here.

It's stupid and illogical but I get so sad and want to cry about this. I am mildly bitter, jealous, and depressed that he has all day every day to get paid to pursue the things I love and want to learn. I feel like I barely have any time outside of work due to being an hourly worker. If I miss time for work I have to work even more than 8 hours to make it up or use leave time. I feel like I can't progress professionally because of how much work we always have at work. I enjoy my job but like many government jobs we have been understaffed the whole two years I've worked there and we get no down time. I'm permitted per my performance plan to work on the programming to improve stuff on our team but I just don't have time and my supervisors know this.

I am so very blessed and fortunate to have my job, to get paid decently enough to live a good life, to not be affected by the COVID layoffs, to have a good partner who is the most caring and kind man I know. But I'm just feeling really depressed, bitter, and that I'm stagnating in things that bring me joy while seeing my partner and roommate surpass me in skillset due to free time. I have this anxiety that I will never have the time to learn or pursue things. I think I will talk to my partner about how I am feeling because I can safely confide in him, but right now I just needed to confide in others. I'm not sure how to stop feeling this way and letting it affect me",07Jul2020,1

Unfortunately, her mom wasn't any better than her dad would turn out to be but she had no other choice obviously. When she turned 10, her dad finally decided to show up again and tried becoming apart of her life again.  

My gf was hesitant at first and never really cared for him (understandly so) but they eventually started to get along more and it got to a point where she preferred to be with her dad than her mom. So when she turned 18, she made the decision to move out of her mom's and in with her dad as her mom was very toxic and emotionally abusive to her as well. 

At the time, I only knew her dad from what I saw and he was a super cool and chill dude. He played video games, sometimes with us, and was basically a complete opposite to her mom. I encouraged her to make the move when she had doubts but little did I know that he would turn out to be just as bad.

He somehow always finds a way to be mad at her for sometimes the stupidest things. And he'll always play the victim card on her making it seem like it's always her fault when most of the time it isn't. He blames her for a lot of things and yells at her every other day. And what sucks is one day he can be super cool but the next second he could become a huge asshole. My gf is always on edge because she never knows when he's going to outburst again.

I feel terrible that she has to deal with this and I try my hardest to always be there for her but it's gotten to a point where I can't even see her now because her dad is mad at her and won't let her do shit anymore. (Granted Covid is a thing but even before it was like that).

1167,"I know that this might come off as a stupid question, a question “only I can answer” but I simply need opinions from others before I make my final decision. 

After being unusable for more than the years, I have finally landed a slight stable job as a nurse aide and now I’d like to move to my own apartment. I have also saved up a “fair” amount of money.

I found an appt which in my opinion is a fair rate of $806. It’s in a safe and beautiful neighborhood, one I can comfortably stay in for even more than a year. There are way cheaper apartments in the ghetto but I do not want to stay in a play where I’d be praying to move out again. I want to “settle” but my friends (they do knot know how much I’m paid) say that an appt of $800 and above is too high for someone like me. 

I feel like I can manage with this amount being that I get paid every two weeks: first weeks pay for rent and all, second weeks pay for savings and checkings. (This is the plan) 

But another part of me feels like this plan is too good to be true. I have no other bill (besides phone) to pay and I have no debt to pay off. I have every material item that I want and don’t really crave for really expensive things, so I don’t think that’ll be a problem.

1169,"I have tried everything I can think of and I’m sick of seeing it in the drop down list when I go to switch between my different Instagram accounts.

Basically, on the Instagram app when you log into your accounts it gives you the option to remember the account for speedy login (Apple ID saved passwords). My ex must have chosen this when he logged into his Instagram one time on my phone. He then proceeded to deactivate his Instagram account a few months before his death (which was over a year ago). However, deactivating didn’t remove that account from the drop down list of my accounts, so it’s just been there, reminding me of him every time I switch between my main and my spam account which obviously isn’t the most fun. 

I tried deleting the Instagram app and then reinstalling and logging into my accounts again, and after a day mysteriously his account was back there on the app, still deactivated so I couldn’t open it and take it off my phone, but there in the drop down menu. In my Apple ID saved passwords list it shows the password saved for my other instagram accounts but not my ex’s, so I’m really surprised that it appeared again after I deleted and reinstalled the app. 

I also tried logging into the account to reactivate it, take the account off my app, and then deactivate again, but the passwords I remember didn’t work when I tried them. I’m slightly glad this didn’t work though because if people had seen his account reappear it would have freaked them out. 

If anyone knows how to get rid of a deactivated account please tell me how! If nobody knows I suppose I’ll contact Instagram or possibly Apple if it’s to do with being linked to Apple ID saved passwords?

I'm, just, very confused about this.",07Jul2020,1
1171,"Me (20M) has a girlfriend (19F) who is going through a tough part in her life. She is still getting accustomed to life at university and has been experiencing hormonal changes ever since she has been on birth control. Now before I say anything else, I do not want to come across douche boyfriend who wants my girlfriend to get off birth control so she can be more willing to have sex. That's not what this is about at all. Ever since she has been taking birth control in the form of a shot, her behavior has been on a slow decline. She gets angry and cries over minuscule problems, she has been pushing me away more often when I try to console or help her, and overall has been less affectionate. She and I have talked about this and how her situation affects our relationship, and she agrees that it is not good for our relationship. She and I have also told each other that our relationship is important to us and that we love each other very much. She is currently taking another birth control in the form of a patch and are waiting to see if it's better. It should also be said that my girlfriend and I are introverts, her and I usually spend a lot of time inside watching movies or playing games. However, due to our current situation, I think it would be a good idea to get out of the house and do something. Due to COVID, our options are limited so any ideas in the comments would be appreciated! Lastly, I have talked to my girlfriend's mom recently about our situation. I told her that if her current birth control is not good for her, we should think about taking off birth control completely. I also brought up therapy but this would be difficult considering that she is going to college four hours away in two weeks.  If there is anything else I should do, please tell me.   
I have been worrying about our relationship a lot recently, and it has been taking a mental toll. I hope that any advice I get from this post will lower my stress about all this. Hell, maybe worrying about our relationship so much is a problem and maybe I should just relax. Thank you for reading and commenting.",07Jul2020,1
1172,"I care for my dad, and have recently been chasing up some medication he needed that should have been immediately issued.

After endless chasing and seemingly meeting a conclusion, the pharmacy didn't have the medication (moxifloxacin). So I had to ring all the local pharmacists to check if anywhere had it in stocked. Turned out no where did.

I rang a particular pharmacist and they were rude. I asked about the medicine name (which I admit sounds weird), and the female staff member shouted the name. I then heard the male pharmacist shout that it doesn't exist and laughing between them saying I'm wrong. They asked me to spell it several times, and were belittling, informing me each time that I sound like I'm saying something else. I was then told by the pharmacist that in all his 30 years he had never heard of it, so I said ok and ended the call.

It might not seem like a big deal, but after a stressful few days, unnecessary mean treatment has really gotten to me. The whole conversation was a bit much with their sneering/laughing/judging behaviour.

I am considering taking a picture of the medicine to send to the pharmacy Facebook page, and informing them that their treatment was unfair as I was asking a simple question and reading its name off a prescription slip.

I'm struggling to see if I'm being ruled by my emotions, as I'd had a stressful few days of feeling ignored/lie to my medical staff. Or whether it would be right to inform them of their mistake and unfair treatment?

Not a terribly exciting story, but if anyone feels like giving some outsider comment, it would be greatly appreciated!",07Jul2020,1
