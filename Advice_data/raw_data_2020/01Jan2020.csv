Recently this new girl who started working at the resturant I work at has all of the sudden started talking to me out of nowhere. She‚Äôs been working here for a month now, but in the last two days she started talking to me and I have also started talking to her a lot. She has asked me for help, talked about work, but we haven‚Äôt talked about things outside of work.

So what are some things I can do to imply that I am interested in her? What are things I can pick up on from her?",01Jan2020,1

3,I‚Äôve known some of these people anywhere between 10-20 years and I need to be surrounded with more intelligent and successful people who inspire me to be better. I have managed to find an amazing white collar job and land a Masters degree while constantly battling the temptations of being within this social circle which to this day has inevitably made me prone to taking hard/soft drugs here and there albeit much less than the people I am surrounded with. I want out. None of these people have achieved what I have achieved and the only benefit I would have to them in being intertwined in these circles is if they learn anything from me to push themselves to be better and I need that MYSELF. I know it might sounds ridiculous to some people when I say where do I start to find new friends but at my age it only gets harder and harder. I am a very socially adaptable person and have no issues making friends. I have friends all over the world which I have been lucky to meet during my travels and studies abroad. I just find it the hardest in my own hometown where its supposed to be the easiest. I live in Toronto.,01Jan2020,1

She sends me this as I am at a family gathering having a great time, enjoying each others presence. Then I get this and read it and it‚Äôs just a complete mood killer. Contemplating ending things.

So I am in need for some advice because I'm just stressed and confused.

A girl added me through an online game and slowly we started developing a friendship. She always messages me first everyday and recommends me games to get to play together (which I always do like a sucker)

I think the fact that she talks on the mic alot makes me invested in her also.

The problem is that she leaves in the other side of the world (8 hour time difference)

Also recently she was telling a friend of her on how she had to cut a guy friend of hers off because he was getting obsessive and creepy... Which made me realize I too was getting a little too attached to her.

That same day I got in a verbal altercation with her guy friend so I unfriended him and the girl because they were in the same circle and honestly I think I unconsciously unfriended her to avoid the same fate as her creepy friend.

She messaged me the next day multiple times saying why I did that, etc etc, and how she told her friend to apologize to me. This touched me because not alot of people would reach out after unfriending them.

So I added her back.

A week passes by, and now she sometimes lie about going ""offline"" to play with game without me.

Now my insecurities are increased.. so I confronted her and defriended her AGAIN. few hours later she kept sending friend requests to me so I accepted. She apologized and started teasing me that I was sensitive and a baby... Ugh I can't ever stay mad at her and at this point I just feel terrible because she's always sacrificing her pride for me.

 Im a introvert so I only talk on the mic with people I'm comfortable with so she would join parties with other dudes without inviting me. I would get jealous of course but it's understandable.

Also she would call me bro so I know she don't have the same feelings as I do.. also her messages got shorter and she never used emojis BUT she would ALWAYS message me first. If she senses I was down about something she would always send ALOT of messages at once, drag out her words to be cute, and use emojis. But this only happens i was obviously down.

Also she sends alot of screenshots and videos of us playing together which I love..

I'm confused ASF.. is she toying with me? I feel like she's an amazing friend but at the same time I feel like she likes the control she has on me.",01Jan2020,1

My mom will borrow make up, art supplies, hair straighteners etc that are mine and doesn‚Äôt put them back until I ask her for it and get them myself.

24,"I'm 17, and my cousin is 20.

She and I never buy each other gifts because we instead always get money from our aunts (aka I get money from her mom/my aunt and she gets money from my mom/her aunt). We also live 3-4 hours away from each other, so because of that, we have never seen each other either on our birthdays, we just text happy birthday. Although I‚Äôve known her my whole life, I have somewhat started getting closer to her since April, so I was thinking of coming to her birthday with a bus I can take (takes almost 5 hours but it'll be worth it).

Although I have money, I don't want to give her money because she already has a job, so it's not like she needs a little money from me. It'll be much more personal of course if it's a gift I bought and not just money I gave her. I find that lazy. I was thinking of buying maybe clothes for her, like pants or a shirt. However, I find that it would be really awkward buying girl clothes as I'm a guy, and well if I buy online, I'm going to have to explain to my parents why I bought it and I think that would be too awkward for me to explain, the reason being that I don't think my parents would like that I bought a gift for my cousin, as I've never done it before, and I've never bought a gift either for a family member before. I've only bought a gift occassionally if it's for a friend, however that's only rarely, and I even asked one of my friends if I was going to buy him a gift and he said he appreciated it, but he didn't want a gift. 

As for budget, I think I can go up to 60$ but I'm afraid that hell will break loose in the family then, as everyone will think I'm fucking crazy (though I think everyone already thinks that, but they're going to think I'm even crazier) for spending 60$ on a gift for someone who's not even my girlfriend (I've never been in a relationship before either). She also has a boyfriend already so he might also get pissed at me. The thing is though, I don't have a crush on my cousin at all. I think about her a lot, yes, but I don't have a crush on her. But if you think 60$ is too much I can go up to 30-40$ for a gift.

TL;DR What should I buy my cousin for her birthday? Her birthday is in less than two months, and she and I have never bought each other a present. I'm 17, and my cousin is 20. I can go for a budget on 30-60$.",01Jan2020,1

From my understanding they do have indoor cats that they take care of already.

I have tried to be open and communicative with them about giving her a forever home and keeping her safe as a indoor cat. I.E. no cars, wild animals, possible poisons etc. but they want her to stay so that she will remain a neighborhood cat that they feed.

34,"Some very weird changes are happening to the team, and I'd like some advice as to whether I should be concerned. It's long but will try to keep it as succinct.
We are a very small team with a lot of work. We have a middle manager, one big boss, and two junior analysts (one of which is me). I am one year above the junior-most analyst.
The junior-most analyst and I had a tense relationship for a year. The junior-most and I started at the same time, so they consistently perceived us as peers and yet consistently received worse assignments than I did. The middle manager and big boss didn't assign the junior-most analyst any work, leaving it up to me to manage them, but the junior-most struggled to take my directions and advice believing that I should not boss them around. The end result often was me being frustrated, and/or doing the work myself. The middle manager is well aware of this problem but refused to engage. The big boss is also aware of the junior-most underperforming (though not the management issue), based on various comments he makes in team meetings.
All this while, my relationship with the big boss was really on the upswing. He would call me to thank me for my hard work separately, compliment me on job well done (""I knew it would be just fine since you're handling it""), check in after business trips. He also seemed to become more open and honest with me, about his thoughts and opinions, took me aside to give me individual feedback. The middle manager too would call me to check in on a large project that was going haywire, thank me for job well done.
Long story short, the junior-most person launched an informal complaint against me and the middle manager for ""mistreatment"". There's no allegation of protected class discrimination, but the gist of the complaint appears to be that they've been told that they were a bad employee, that because of this they were getting bad work, that their relationship with the big boss deteriorated after a project gone wrong, and that they were told (by me) that there was a ""retaliation"". The management side overseeing HR complaints came to give me a talk on this, at which point I explained I never said any such thing, and the only occasions I can think of where that analyst may have made that conclusion are in the context of advice. If anything, I tried to wrangle some ""good work"" for the analyst but that effort failed because I left for vacation and no one gave the analyst anything. The management side overseeing HR noted ""hm, interesting"" but still encouraged that I may want to consider switching teams [Edit: to add that there was the ""most complaint"" against me]. The management side asked what was going on with the middle manager too, at which point I explained that the situation in the team is very toxic for a variety of reasons.
The junior-most person later told me about this complaint they filed but also told me, after this follow up, the HR asked her about me at which point they said ""things are better"" with me. The junior-most person confided that they complained about the middle manager too for their mistreatment/yelling/etc. and that they told the HR that the mistreatment did not stop as to the middle manager.
Around the same time, the big boss began holding team meetings including the junior-most analyst (used to never be a thing, because junior-most was consistently excluded), where he would make that analyst read out loud instructions for hours, while both the middle management and I were just there listening. The big boss began to be way more explicit about expectations and instructions, in ways he never was before. He also began to split up projects in the most inconvenient and artificial way possible to include the junior-most analyst (only to have the substance filled out by me, or redone by me at a later time). The big boss has also been making passive aggressive comments toward everyone -- especially pointed at the junior-most, insinuating that they were useless, and taking away their existing work and giving them a ""more important and urgent"" project.
At the same time, the big boss began to act very formal toward everyone and I sense a little big of anger toward everyone including me. This change is not very dramatic for the other two, but the most dramatic for me, as he used to be pretty casual and friendly toward me. He is formal even in exchanges that are one-on-one with me. He would avoid eye contact with me or engaging me in friendly chat in team lunches, unlike before.
The middle manager and I still have the same work, although the team is much slower now, and I'm not hearing from the big boss as much as I used to. The junior-most has no work. The big boss is unusually silent, although perhaps it's because of the holiday season.
The middle manager told me that no one had followed up with them regarding HR complaint.
It is clear to me that the big boss has been told. My concern is whether (1) I will be written up/asked to leave, (2) I will be kicked off the team. Why is the big boss acting so distant and holding all kinds of team meetings + breaking up work in such artificial ways? Is the company trying to retain the junior-most? Any thought would be appreciated.",01Jan2020,1

38,"I‚Äôm not sure where to start, I want to make sure everything is as accurate and true as possible. 4 months ago, my best friend of many years  (joe, M19)  got kicked out of his parents house. Joes parents have never been stable people, they‚Äôre not bad people, but his mother especially has always been completely unstable ( younger siblings of joe‚Äôs (7 and 4) both have extremely poor manners, are allowed to stay up until they pass out, use curse word very frequently ext.) but joe was a much nicer person to be around, we very few issues with ever. Joes parents instituted a new policy, weekly drug tests. Joe had done Xanax occasionally but it was in no way a problem up to this point, but he did smoke weed often. Joe decided to go around the drug tests by doing Xanax regularly. Joe from this point goes down hill. He gets kicked out of his parents house within a month of this, so I let him move in to my house under the conditions of he cannot take a Xanax while he lived there, if he did he would have to leave. Normally I‚Äôm not a person bothered by being around drugs. but at this point, joes health is visibly poor, he needed help, he agreed and said he had quit last week and been clean since. he moved in rent free, and fed until he bought his car back from his mom (93 Honda, 2000$ after register and insurance).  Joe makes about 600 dollars a week at his job. My girlfriend and I worked together taking him to work. So really all he should be spending money on is juul pods, and some weed every now and then(he smoked my weed with me most of the times.). A month later and a half later, no car. I ask him when he thinks it will happen, he told me two weeks. The following week, I find two Xanax on Krauses bed, in plain sight. So I ask him about it. He then says that he‚Äôs been doing Xanax since he moved in. I don‚Äôt know if the next thing I did was right or wrong, but I told him he had to find a place to live within 2 weeks he proceeds to move into my sisters house the next day for a temporary thing, and then be offered by my parents to have my old room. And he accepts, he lives there doing what he pleased with no guidance or supervision. But he manages to buy his car back. After about a month there, his parents let him move back in, so he does. Lives there for 2 weeks, gets kicked out (this point me an joe are not speaking as much but still frequently, had him over and what not). The day after that, I get a call from my girlfriend who just showed up to my house. Door unlocked, my PlayStation 4, my weed (which was hidden in a specific spot) and my yeti microphone were stolen. After I calm my girlfriend down I call joe and ask his what he‚Äôs been up to. He said he hadn‚Äôt been doing much. I call back 45 minutes later with an officer from my local police department and he has joes confession to my PlayStation and microphone. I decided not to press charges on him, as he obviously gave my things back.

My mom and aunt do NOT get along (since they were both in high school and 20 years later), but there has recently been some attempts to get along.  My mother wants to help her out, but does not want to give her money or a place to stay. She feels that giving her money will just allow her to live as she is without trying to better her circumstances and she still feels like she would not be able to live with her if she were to invite her to live with us until she got back on her feet (however even if this were offered, she lives 600 miles away and unlikely to move to where we are). My mother asked me and my siblings what we would do, but we all failed to come up with anything that we thought we could feasibility do. (Like help her get a job, I do not think we could really do more than what she is doing with that).

So how to help without giving money, a place to stay, all while giving moral support?

45,"Hey all,

First of all I would like to say that yes, I did create this account just to post this since I do not use Reddit that much, but I intend to be active in here and listen to what everyone has to say.

Let me expose you my current situation and what has been bothering me this past few months.

My name is Vitor and I am a 17 year old guy from Portugal. In June I finished 11th grade (the penultimate year of school) with relatively good grades after some really difficult 2 years of my personal life. My parents had already inform me a few months¬†prior that we would be moving to France once the school year finishes, since my father was already working there.

I did not really want to go since I had my friends in Portugal, I did not speak French and lastly, because I knew that since I did not speak the language, it would take me a year to learn it and therefore I would be basically losing a year of my life (a school year I mean) and harming my future.

All this thoughts of seeing my friends in the last year of school and all of them heading to university while here I am, alone, in a country that I do not know and having to learn a language that never interested me, really haunted me.

It was difficult for me but I thought that it would be worth it, or rather, so my parents said.

So I came to France and after waiting a few months I managed to join this special class for people who do not speak French and wished to learn it. I did not make many friends mostly because I am shy but also because most of them are not people I enjoy hanging out with (mostly because my personality does not ""combine"" with theirs), and of course the language barrier.

What this means is that right now I am feeling super lonely,  having no real ""physical"" friends here and constantly missing my country and my way of life back there; having no motivation to do anything that I would normally enjoy, since I am constantly overwhelmed¬† by all my worries.¬†

This, along with some experiences of when I first arrived here made me dislike France a bit and not really enjoying learning French anymore.

I am not sure what to do honestly, I just feel so lonely that I do not know what to do or feel regarding my life and France/French in general. I am also worried that once I am placed in a regular class, I am going to attend a school year lower than the one I should be in, which once more will harm my future because I am  losing school years. All of this while missing my country and friends, and constantly thinking that I this is not going to go well and that I should just return home (even though that is impossible and I would never tell that to my parents who sacrificed their lives into bringing me here).

Sorry for the long essay, I just thought I needed to share this with someone and getting their opinion on the subject and on what I should do.

Thanks for reading and sorry for the bother.",01Jan2020,1

I think it would be smarter for me to continue saving money so I can move-out, get my own place, a car and more.

Though admittedly, I'd rather find companionship soon instead of later.

The reason why I said it would be smarter to establish myself is because I mostly don't want women to think of me as a loser and I eventually want to live by myself when I have the money to do so.

I'm not here to sound like a jerk (I truly came here for advice) though let's be honest about this.

I want to be realistic about this topic, so I believe the answer to my following question is: ""no woman would date such a guy"".

What woman would date a guy like me/a work in progress? 

In other words:

A guy who frequently smiles and still pretty much lost count of all the times he got rejected, a guy who's saving money to move-out of his parents' house, who wants buy a car, a nice watch, more formal attire and so forth?",01Jan2020,1

59,"I smoked now and again when I was a teenager. Then once or twice over the years until I was around 18. The next time, was when I met my ex. We lived in a house share in the city with some people who also smoked. We used to chill and have deep conversations and it became a bit of a habit. This was about 2-3 years ago, and other than when I‚Äôve been away with family I‚Äôve smoked pretty much every day since. 
Now the reason for it, which some people will disagree with, was that I suffered (and still do) with mental illness. I won‚Äôt go into the details, but I had a very dark few years at my first job when I was in my late teens. Fast forwarding to living in the house share, I took myself off meds after years of endless combinations of tablets which actually made life more difficult. 
My ex and I moved into our own place round the corner, and carried in smoking. Then the relationship came to an end down to them cheating, and they we quite sly about it and it messed with my head. I took on the flat by myself, and had piling debt from years ago. 
I moved around a bit trying to settle and sort myself out. Each time I moved it was to a slightly nicer place as my job was going well and I tried to sort myself out. 
Present day, until a few months ago I‚Äôve been pretty great. Few hiccups here and there but they were more general life challenges. The weed has helped in some ways, and I think it actually calmed me and assisted me more than any tablet I was prescribed. 
I don‚Äôt really drink, so a joint or two, or three is my thing.

The reasons for wanting to quit now are the following:
- Save money which can be put to better use
- Health and fitness
- Better focus at work and home

The thing I‚Äôm worried about is not slipping back into it again. I‚Äôve started to withdraw from my friends and socialising and I think the weed is starting to make me sluggish and lazy. But it‚Äôs my go to when stressed or for a quick break at work. 
The other thing that concerns me is sleeping. I wouldn‚Äôt say I sleep better after smoking, but when I have smoked, I don‚Äôt dream. Ever. I used to have very dark dreams and they would normally stick with me because they were so vivid. I only noticed this last year when I went away with family for a week and had very bizarre dreams pretty much every night.

Any tips appreciated. 

And happy new year all!",01Jan2020,1
61,"We been together for a year, me 29 and him 39 and he has 3 kids and baby mama and I have nothing..

His ex family lives in another state so it was just me and him all year, always going out on dates, especially every Friday.. We would dress up and go eat an drink and would have so much fun and keep our relationship spicy and fresh.

Well recently his 17 year old son moved in with us because of his bad behavior with his mom and on top of that he plays video games all day.  It's been about a month that he's been living with us and since then our relationship became boring.. We don't go out anymore on Friday nights like we used too, only to local bars to play slots and drink beer.. We only have sex every night, that's the only good thing about our relationship I guess. 

He always promises to go out every Friday to a certain restaurant or place where we will dress up and look hot.. Well once Friday night comes or Saturday, he's to tired. Before he would go out tired or not, but now he always has an excuse.. I know he has money because he plays slots with many $20's so I know it's not the issue.

I tried breaking up with him many times but he tells me he loves me and wants to be with me but his actions don't show. He cried many times to me not to leave him but I don't see him change or make an effort anymore. Our lives became routine, we work 12 hrs, come home, eat, shower, sex, repeat... Weekends we spend the 2 days doing stuff with son because he was bored all week at home.. We don't do anything alone anymore just gamble! Sometimes I think I'm just there for sex since that's one thing we keep up.. 

So what is all your advice?. Should I just break up with him?? Will he change if I remind him about it?? Or is he pretty much about his son now and not our relationship?  Is this where the honeymoon stage is over??",01Jan2020,1

66,"

Sorry for the long post.
It‚Äôs been a little over. A month since we broke up but we were together for two years. She is in the air force now and I am on my first year of college.

The way I would describe our Relationship would be so much understanding and love but also so many childish fears. We went back and forth with me becoming scared and she not wanting to voice her opinion at some points.

She left for boot camp 5 months ago and when we regained contact I just was struggling so hard with the distance and I could see that she was separating a little bit and it scared me. I communicated with her but just broke and it ended in a argument and then a breakup

I spent a month waiting for her to come home hoping she would want to see me but the day she came back someone let me know she had a boyfriend 

The whole time we spent time ignoring each other and she tried to act like nothing happen until she agreed one night to come see me before she left. Everything was just as when she had left, we laughed, we joked it felt so natural but it also scared both of us about what it meant with our situation. At the end of it I told her how proud I really was of her and have her one last hug and a something to remember me by

My question is I know I‚Äôll regret it if I don‚Äôt try to let her know I see how much I support her life choice and how i don‚Äôt just miss her but she is so special and the only one I ever want. I can tell we are scared and trying hard to just not think about it but I have to try

I really do want to support her and be apart of her life.

Tl;dr: military relationship and stress caused us to have a heat of the moment break up so how do I show her I truly love her and only want to support her.",01Jan2020,1

Sometimes I get several hours between action, and it's pretty much required that I get some sleep, lest I fall asleep behind the wheel afterwards. Problem is - it's a work van.

75,"Thanks in advance for reading my super long post about this. 

My mom has a long history of drug and alcohol use/abuse. When I was in middle school, she and my dad were arrested for using and selling cocaine and she almost lost custody of me and my brother.

As far as I know she was clean for a few years after that, and then my dad died and she started abusing her prescribed Loratab (she has a chronic illness). I'm pretty sure she was also using coke again during this time. My bedroom and hers were connected by a staircase and I could hear her snorting and found cut up straws in our bathroom trashcan every so often.

Honestly, everything was fine until she started using Xanax when I was in college. She totaled her car and got arrested and had her license suspended for 6 months. She had to go to narcotics anonymous as well during that time.

Again, things were okay for a while. But now I'm pretty sure she's using again and I'll explain why.

I've never done drugs, but my brother has and has been around people who use since he was probably 15. Not just weed but meth and heroin and pretty much everything. He first brought it up to me that he thinks she might be using some sort of opiate. His reasoning was that her pupils are always tiny, she has lots of mood swings that she's never had so bad before, and she seems to be showing withdrawn symptoms as well. The use symptoms seem to coincide with when she has money, and the withdrawal symptoms seem to coincide with when she doesn't have money.

She doesn't have a job. She has money her parents left her when they died and I support what that doesn't cover. She always asks me for cash but then can never give me proof what she spent it on. Like I'll give her $40 to get groceries and she'll call me three days later and say she needs groceries. When I approach her about me already having given her money for food, she gets super defensive and says I'm being a bad daughter and neglecting her by not giving her more money or food. I understand things happen with money. She has a dog and I know she has to buy things for him, but again, there's no signs that she did.

What's really convinced me that she's using again though, is that I accidentally saw a text where she asked a ""friend"" of hers for ""H."" When I say accidentally, I do mean that. She's awful at technology and I was backing up her phone because she was so behind on updates. I was going through settings and a text came up that I accidentally tapped on and opened. It was from some guy saying he could come by later in the week. The text before that was something like ""I have $30 to give you for H.""

I honestly don't know what to do. My brother doesn't live here so I feel alone in this. I don't want her to starve but I also don't want to just give her money for her to spend on drugs. Part of me feels like I'm enabling her but I don't know what else to do. When I say no to her, when I KNOW she has enough food to last her, she throws a tantrum and says she's going to call the police on me or kill herself.

Seriously, any insight or advice would be very much appreciated.",01Jan2020,1

Three years ago my dad broke his ankle at work after he slipped on the ice. Since then, he has been diagnosed with CRPS and has had multiple surgeries. I'm no doctor, but my best explanation of it would be that it's some kind of rare disease that develops after something traumatic has happened to a part of the body. It can cause severe pain and is known as one of the most painful diseases out their. My dad is not in constant pain, but one time he told me that sometimes it feels like someone is sticking a hot poker into his leg. Not much is really known about it and he went through a trial where he had these stimulators put in to help the pain which did work for a while. Recently, he had another surgery to help relieve pressure within his leg so I dont think he has the stimulators in at the moment, but I'm hopeful it will get better. He hasn't worked in the past three years because of all this. He wants to take a few college classes to start a new career because he can't do any of the jobs that are around. My stepmom works as a cook at a school and only works when school is in session. I also have two little siblings. I'm scared because my dad has told me on multiple occasions that his outlook on life is pretty dim and that he wants his kids to live a better life than he has. He thinks that even if he was able to get a job he'd be in the lower percent that never get hired because of his disabilities. My dad is also convinced that he will not live to age 50 (he is in his early 40s) because of how much his health has declined. He has lost almost all his hope. I'm only in high school so I can't afford to help him get some sort of therapist and he probably wouldn't accept the help if I could. They cant afford one themselves and I dont know if he would go to one because of his pride if he could. I'm thinking about calling one of his sisters about this, but I'm reluctant because one doesnt want anything to do with him and his other two sisters.  One of the two, I dont know would or could help. The one I want to reach out to the most, has just recently went through a divorce and has a lot on her plate already. I have no idea what to do.

91,"Background story:

I was invited to an NYE party with my friends and with my dad. I decided on 30th that I will go to my dad's party. At the party with my friends were two really close friends of mine, two good friends, about five classmates and two people that I didn't know. There were a few other people who at some point thought they would come, but for different reasons didn't.

What was happening:

I was scrolling through instagram stories, and one of them was a video of my friends at their party clinking glassses at midnight. And they said a toast to everyone who couldn't make it... except me. Maybe I'm giving it to much thought that's why I'm asking if I'm overreacting? What do you think?",01Jan2020,1
92,"So I guess I have to give context on this question - it's a really long story but I'll try to keep it short. The main people involved are her, me, her boyfriend, and my boyfriend. It's unfolded over a couple months so I'll list everything that happened each month.

August: 

She began reading through my DMs with her boyfriend on instagram, and no, it wasn't because I was trying to hit on him or anything. I was friends with him for a year or two before they even met (she's a grade above us), and at one point two years ago we were really close, so we still talk a little. Still, this girl scrolled through our conversations *all the way through* every time they met. To give a hint of what the future drama entails: She got upset over the fact that I talked to her boyfriend about kpop. I'm serious... I began to talk about which idols I liked a lot, which music I liked... and she got upset (i.e. ""why don't you go talk to \_\_\_ about it?"" passive aggressively). At this point I was slightly annoyed and also just bemused over this, but nothing too serious.

However, while 90% of our conversations were random jokes or sometimes just keyboard smashes (as I said we don't have constant conversations), a bit of it was actual personal issues that were happening. He told me about some of his relationship issues with her, I told him some of my relationship issues with my boyfriend. I even briefly mentioned my possible confusion over my sexuality, which I have never discussed with any person in my life. Guess what? She still read through all of that. Maybe she was jealous - but of a girl who's been in a relationship for more than a year? What?

End of August / September: 

As I said, she read through all of the conversations, and *told other people what I said about* my *life*. From what our mutual friends have told me, she said it pretty nonchalantly and didn't think it was wrong at all. She asked *my* boyfriend about his time at camp that she learned through reading the conversations. She told others about the kpop ""rants"" I went on, although I've never negatively talked about an idol? And... she told others that *I didn't like my boyfriend anymore,* and that I wouldn't break up with him even though I completely lost interest. This is when I lost it. 

What I told her boyfriend (in a private conversations, excuse me) was that sometimes I didn't feel as attracted to my boyfriend/wanted to hang out with him as much as before, although I still really liked talking to him (which I explicitly mentioned). I debated breaking up with him, but This feeling lasted for maybe 2 weeks, and I just stopped mentioning it once it went away. Honestly, I think it was a combination of normal hormones, the fact that he'd been gone for a month, and stress over school starting again. I saw it as a flux in my feelings - it's happened before, but usually just for a day or two, not this long. 

I can see how she might have translated this into I'm-not-breaking-up-with-my-boyfriend-even-though-I-don't-like-him-anymore, but evidently I have multiple issues with this. First of all, I never said it in such a cut and clear manner, so the way she summarized it cut many corners into something not true at all. Second of all, she clearly had an issue with this idea, but never came to me about it - despite the fact that the only people this information affected was *me*, and to some extent my boyfriend, as it was *my personal issue*. It *never* affected her, her boyfriend, or any of her friends. However, she told not one, not two, not three, but *four* people that I know of. Some of these people spread it to even more people, with one or two that I know of. I'm sure that there are others who I don't know about. 

So, the main talk of the grade above us (since she's a grade above us, as I mentioned) suddenly became that *I'm a bitch* for not breaking up with my boyfriend when I ""don't like him anymore."" Mind you, I have never even spoken to half of these people, and suddenly they know this twisted fact about my personal life. I respected so many of them because of how hardworking they are (the top students of their grade/our school), how smart they are, how talented they are - I still do (8 of them have gotten into t10 schools in early decision, bro). So it was really heartbreaking to realize that these role models I looked up to suddenly all hated me for something that wasn't true, and I couldn't even explain the truth since I've never interacted with them or have contact with them. 

October / November: 

At some point, we became pretty aware that we disliked each other because of mutual friends spilling information to both of us - but we never had direct contact until this happened. Please keep in mind that this is two to three months after she found out my relationship issues (which had completely resolved themselves by the end of September...) and told her entire friend group. She gave me a slew of ,,advice/suggestions"", saying that I should break up with my boyfriend if I didn't like him anymore, a whole patronizing bit of ""You shouldn't be in a relationship if you're unhappy."" Absolutely nothing about reading private conversations or telling other people my secrets.

So a few days later, I text her with *my* little essay of texts and I think I kept it quite civil / not passive aggressive. If you want to know my specific words I can send you them (verifying that I wasn't being rude or something). I explained that yes, I still loved my boyfriend, and that some conversations are meant to be private, not spread to everyone you know (because wow, it's almost like they're about a personal issue). 

So... a month later, she sent me a goddamn four-side-long letter via a mutual friend, during school. It was... a hybrid of an apology, ""explanation"", and patronization. Frankly, I was not able to take it seriously after the first or second paragraph. I quote her words verbatim: ""I think I have very different values from you, so I didn't really see anything wrong with telling other people your issues"" and ""although I really don't consider privacy important, I forget that it's important to other people."" I just... yeah, I did not ever expect to hear that from someone, *ever*, in my life. Hopefully I don't need to explain how... shocked? confused? mind blown?... I was that someone could have a mindset like that. Where the hell are her brain cells? 

Maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm crazy, but - privacy isn't some kind of ""value,"" it's basic human decency (please tell me if I'm wrong). You don't care about privacy? What about I announce to the school every issue your boyfriend's talked about with me? I guess... you wouldn't mind? 

Furthermore, she went to give me a lecture on how communication is key to a relationship. Thanks, girl, but I wasn't taking that from her. This is someone who gets upset with her boyfriend on a weekly basis (if not daily), and every time I ask him why she's mad, he says ""I have no clue. I asked her, but she won't say why."" This is someone who tells her boyfriend they need to go on a ""break"" *multiple times* without much explanation (unless you count ""I can't do this anymore, thank you, bye"") - once as he was in the middle of a vacation - and decides to get back with him the next day. This is someone who texts other guys as she and her boyfriend are on a date, who meets up alone with other guys for a photoshoot in a park, and doesn't think anything's wrong. Someone who obsessively reads through her boyfriend's private conversations, gets upset, and claims she ""doesn't get jealous."" 

Did I mention that I never talk to her? We have mutual friends and occasionally hung out a few times a year, but that's it. She's never heard anything else about my relationship, or how we deal with misunderstandings. *Where is her goddamn right to give me a lecture on relationships?*

CONCLUSION

Another thing happened recently, which is why she's at the top of my mind again. It was pretty minor so I'm not rehashing it, but basically I found out that yeah, she really does dislike me. And... I'm stumped on why. *She* practically destroyed *my* social life and mental health, so *what on earth did I do to her?*

I've talked to a friend about this, and they suggested that she's jealous of me for a couple of reasons. First, that I talk to her boyfriend, although I have a kind and loving boyfriend of my own. Second, that I outperform her academically. One of our mutual friends told me that she said ""I can't get more than 1490 sat score, meanwhile \*my name\* got a fucking 1580"" - might've messed up the exact wording/numbers but it was along those lines. Third.... no clue? Physical looks might seem like the next option, but neither of us are very attractive (although our body types are quite different).

Obviously these are the irrational types of hatred (as jealousy is pretty irrational), and I admit to feeling similarly towards other people. The thing I'm confused about is that when I have irrational hate due to jealousy, I don't tell people because I know it's irrational and I'll seem like the dumb one. I only vent when said people have actually done something to me that's objectively offensive - that is, a logical reason. 

So, this is what I'm ultimately looking for: Why on earth does this girl hate me, logically? I know she trash talks me to her friends (not me being paranoid, I've seen small screenshots and she's admitted it, but these things weren't very informing), so I want to know what she could possibly use as a logical reason for hating me. I am obviously extraordinarily irritated by her existence, but I feel that I have sufficient logical reasoning to despise her.

98,"I‚Äôve dealt with mental health issues from my early teens. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever truly felt happy. Growing up I lived with my mum, step dad and younger sister. My step dad was abusive, mentally and physically. I spent my whole entire childhood feeling like I was walking on eggshells around him. By the age of 10 it became habit for me to lock myself in the bathroom in tears trying to strangle myself. I had fantasises constantly about trying to kill myself but never properly went through with any of them because I knew it‚Äôd hurt my mum and sister too much. 

I lost all my close friends after I started high school and they were the only people who I felt I could talk to. To say this made high school difficult is an understatement. I stopped going to school at the age of 14 because my anxiety/depression got too bad. I deleted all my social media‚Äôs, stopped leaving the house and completely isolated myself from everyone. In a way I kind of resent my mum for allowing this to happen. She sat back watching me fall deeper and deeper into my depression whilst she just worried about my step dad because he‚Äôd met someone else. 

I‚Äôm now 18 and managed to get myself to college but trying to fit back into society has been difficult for me. I have no idea how to navigate social situations. I can‚Äôt relate to other teens and have nothing interesting to talk about. How can I make conversation when I just feel sad all the time? Plus I can‚Äôt focus. My mind is constantly screaming negative thoughts at me. I can‚Äôt hide my anxiousness around other people and it‚Äôs embarrassing. 

I just feel so lost. To make matters worse, my mum has started seeing my step dad again. She‚Äôs pregnant now. I feel sick. I can‚Äôt bare the thought of him being around more often now. I love my mum so much but at the same time I hate her. She can be so selfish at times, she knows how he makes me feel and she doesn‚Äôt care. He abused me for years, why would she want to be with a man who hurt her child so much? 

I‚Äôve been feeling in such a dark place recently and don‚Äôt know how to get better. I‚Äôm scared. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll ever truly get better. I feel like I‚Äôm constantly trying to stop myself from bursting into tears every second. God no wonder I can‚Äôt make friends. I‚Äôm such a mess.

Backstory:  my sister and bitchy friend fell out because bitchy friend lied to her mother, and accused my sister of bullying her.  (Bitchy friend has done this many times about many children in her school, because she knows that her family will fight her own battles for her).  Bitchy friend‚Äôs mum tells my mother that my sister ‚Äòneeds therapy‚Äô and that she is ‚Äòmanipulative‚Äô.  We fall out with that family.  Bitchy friend‚Äôs mum kept trying to compete with my mum, trying to make her jealous and etc.  Family moves onto my road and now everyone‚Äôs best friends again.  

I explained many times why I didn‚Äôt want to go over there, and that I‚Äôd rather spend New Years alone with my dog.  Once at the house, I kept texting my family asking to leave.  Wasn‚Äôt allowed to leave till 1:30 am without any of them, and basically cried in a dark room for ages after 12.  

We walk back and my dad taunts me, saying that I‚Äôm angry (when I‚Äôm reality I was upset).  I was upset because this is an EXTREMELY important year for me exam wise, and I wanted to go into the new year positive, as I have struggled with depression.  

None of my family have apologised, and none of them came to comfort me despite the fact that I was sobbing.  Dad comes in at 2:25 am and tells me that this is all my fault, as I can ‚Äòchoose to block out people‚Äô and ‚ÄòI can control how I feel‚Äô.  He repetitively reminds me that I‚Äôve brought bad vibes into this new year.  I get upset and tell him to get out of my room, and he says something along the lines of ‚Äòfine I‚Äôll just ruin your life for the next decade‚Äô

I have never been in a stable/healthy relationship, i've had 1 girl and got emotionally abused. I was 20 then and i just decided it was better to be alone. But now with the new year 2020 i see friends etc with their partner and to be honest, i'm kinda jealous. I have tried dating apps/sites, going out and meeting new people it just doesn't work for me. All the people i meet on dating sites are just boring or people i'm just not attracted to. Like i said, i think of myself as a pretty good looking guy, atleast i feel good about myself. But it seems like no girl agrees with that thought. 
I'm looking for advice on how i can actually get somewhere with girls. I'm looking for advice on how to put myself in the spotlight so they can see who i truly am.

I spent new years at hers and was tucking her into bed before going downstairs to sleep.

We start making out and over time I  very slowly began moving up her body towards her chest, I was only doing this because I thought I was reading her signals and ahe wanted it. As I get there she pulls my hand down and says to slow down. So I do and immediately move my hand away and dont even try again. We continue to make up for a couple more minutes and then I tuck her in.

I go downstairs and am filled with disgust. I immediately text her and apologise like crazy. I explain everything and I tell her I never ever wanted to do that. She says its okay and just says to slow down next time

Wake up this morning and I can tell shes uncomfortable about it. So I pack up my stuff and give her a hug goodbye. I'm feeling like shit at this point and just want to give her some space.

I drive down the street and pull over to text her again saying how sorry I am. she tells me shes okay with it now and just felt sick about it this morning. But then she asks

""I'm just wondering what would of happened if I didnt say stop?""

I legit wanted to throw up, I'm not that type of person and I would never want to make her feel the way I did.

Okay this is is kind of long so bear with me. For Christmas my aunt gifted me a pair of shoes that were $100 from Macy‚Äôs. Unfortunately they were the wrong size but I do love the shoe. Since I have the gift receipt, my plan was to return the shoe to Macy‚Äôs, and  get the $100 in store credit (that‚Äôs what they give you if it‚Äôs a gift receipt-not cash). I would then use this store credit to buy the same shoe in the correct size. Here‚Äôs where the problem is. Macy‚Äôs is sold out of the shoe in all my nearby stores and it is no longer available on their website. So now I‚Äôm conflicted because I would have $100 useless dollars for Macy‚Äôs and I would have to spend $100 out of my own pocket to get the shoes from a different store, basically a loss of $200.

I recall that when we discussed boundaries at the start of the relationship, years ago, that even games were cheating, unless you had explicit in-the-moment consent with the other party right there (ie. I let him kiss my ex bf bc we all thought itd be funny. It was.). But it was years ago

I messaged trying to brush it off, joking ""haha well doesnt that suck since half the room cant play it?"". He messaged back saying ""well we've all dome so much more than kiss each other in the past so eh"" (im assuming before we dated). This was even more upsetting given that I've been entirely open about my past, but hes never mentioned this before.

Also, It's dark outside, so it would have made it hard for me to see anyways. As soon as I saw, I panicked and hopped up onto the toilet to confront him. He pretended to be on his phone. I asked if he was spying on me (but in a joking kind of tone). He said no and that he was just looking to see where our dogs went. They were standing by him.

109,"This includes never listening to adults, never eating meals with us, and being disrespectful when asked questions.

113,"So my bf and I have been together roughly 4 years. Around NYE i always do whatever he wants as his birthday is around this time of year and so we tend to go to his friend‚Äôs house who throws a NYE party and that‚Äôs when he sees his friends for his bday too.  I‚Äôve been maybe 3 times and we went again this year.  The party is always fun and I get along well with his friends and their gfs. 

So on NYE this time, I was hanging with my bf, his group of guy friends (like 8 or so of them) and their gfs.  We were all drinking pretty heavily and so by the time the following incident occurred most people were pretty drunk (I was only a bit tipsy for the whole night). I was chatting to one of his best mates and casually asked about a scar he had on his hand, which he proceeded to tell me one of the guys in their group had caused. I made an offhand comment about my boyfriend hopefully not scarring him, at which point he lifted up his shirt and showed me a 1.5 inch scar he had on the left side of his sternum, basically where his heart would be. My bf was also here throughout this as the 3 of us were chatting.  I asked them both how it happened and was told that about 5 months ago they had been at a party together drunk and the friend and my bf had been messing with a knife and the friend told him to ‚Äúslice him a bit‚Äù, so my bf did. WTF???

Well, I was mortified.  My bf and his friends have a history of being very boisterous and ‚Äúladdish‚Äù, but tbh my bf is approaching 30 and I kinda thought he‚Äôd grown out of it. They used to do a lot of recreational drugs and get drunk quite a lot (the former of which I was adamantly against and kinda gave a bit of an ultimatum about so my bf doesn‚Äôt do that stuff anymore but I think the rest still do occasionally) and do some absolute stupid shit in their youth. But like I said, I really didn‚Äôt think this stupid shit was still going on. I‚Äôm in the medical profession and proceeded to tell them about all the accidents that could have happened while they were drunkenly playing with knives. 

I confronted my bf about it later in the night when the two of us were alone. He was very drunk and so wasn‚Äôt very understanding, so when I said it was really quite reckless and a serious accident could have happened he brushed it off and insisted he wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúplaying with knives‚Äù (well what else would you call it?????!!). I quickly realised I wasn‚Äôt going to have a reasonable discussion with him in this state but was really quite concerned that not only is he still doing some frankly dumb shit when it‚Äôs just him and his friends, but that he‚Äôs defending it when called out and isn‚Äôt seeing a problem.  I was pretty calm and almost jokey when I brought it up to him later as I didn‚Äôt want it to spoil our NYE.  But it‚Äôs been playing on my mind a bit and I was rather shocked by it. 

Anyway, I wanted some advice on whether I should even bring it up to him when he‚Äôs sober tomorrow. On the one hand, I want him to realise how bloody stupid this was so that he doesn‚Äôt do it again, but is that even gonna stop him when he‚Äôs drunk with his lads?? Plus, it‚Äôll just be a tense discussion id rather not have that‚Äôll put a downer on the day. I‚Äôm not so cut up about it that it‚Äôs going to really haunt me, so should I just let it go?",01Jan2020,1
114,"Ok so here's the deal, I'm a very introverted kid with major trust issues and anxiety. Ive known my two friends for about 3 years now or somethin like that and I'd say we are pretty close.

A few weeks ago ive noticed I've been... ignored? Although ive attempted to make contact and hang out they havent been responding to me, which I figured was them dealing with family and stuff since its the holidays and everything. But then it started to get weird, one of my friends (lets call him friend A) finally responded to me and said he would hang out, great! But he said I would have to wait a bit because he was going to try this new game he got, I told him it was fine and I went on to do some other stuff.

A few hours went by and I began to get a little worried but I brushed it off and figured he was just enjoying his game. Then even more hours went by, eventually turning into a day later. I figured maybe he just got caught up in some stuff and couldn't tell me he wouldnt make it.

Later on I decided to check on my other friend (friend B) and they responded to me as well, we got to chatting a little bit and the conversation came to friend A, they said that he was hanging out with them the day I asked him to hang out with me and he didn't tell me about it. I was heartbroken and everything went down hill from there.

I told friend B I would talk to them later and I started freaking out, why would friend A lie to me about hanging out with friend B? I could understand if he wanted to be with them more then me but why in the world would he have to lie to me about it? Since that day ive been having severe anxiety and its been affecting my daily life, ive gone on to then delete my discord account and isolate myself completely out of fear.

I don't want them to stop being my friends, they are the only real friends ive had in a long time and I cant just make more friends to substitute them, but im way too scared to try and reach out to them again because I don't know If they even like me anymore. For all I know they could have been lying to me about tons of stuff and I nevet knew about it

115,"Hi All. 

Asking for a friend (call them F).

Need advice on the help for a disabled person (Call them P). 

Location: Australia, WA.

Current situation:

\- P lives in a rental house under assistance from the government;  
\- F lives in the said house;  
\- P has a son (call them S), who also lives in the said house;  
\- Income of household: S - Full-time employment (low income), P - disabled persons government aid (Centrelink), F - Centrelink carer's assistance;  
\-  P is unable to carry out daily life (can walk/do very light-duty tasks), and requires carer's assistance (pretty much 24/7, on-demand). Some days there may be none required, some days it's a full-on something every hour;  
\- S is providing as much help as he can, but cannot be a carer due to full-time job;  
\- F is doing the carer's duty, and unable to do anything that requires a long term commitment (e.g. study, job, hobbies, etc.);  
\- F is a young adult who would love to focus on building their own life instead of taking care of another.

Options that were considered:

\- Nursing home - NOT an option (don't ask me why, sometimes you'd think people would be more reasonable);  
\- NDIA/NDIS were contacted, but they don't provide the beforementioned 24/7 assistance (so I've been told by F);  
\- Community service - due to the remote location of residence and thinly spread resources the 24/7 is not achievable.

Is there any way to achieve the following:

\- Have a carer of some sort assigned to P to provide constant assistance over the needs P isn't able to fulfil;  
\- Give a chance to F to start their life. F gets told to take days (i.e. weekends) off, but it is the weekdays they need to get a life;  
\- Any other advice to help both P and F.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. Before anyone starts saying as advice to me to leave it be because F is taking care of P and is being a good person, consider that F took that role because everyone else around is an asshole and did nothing. F wants to have a normal life of a young adult, not be bound as a home sitter, and have career, family and kids of own, rather than dedicate their life on a career of a home-sitting nurse with no prospects of family (except biological one, which is important, but still).",01Jan2020,1

129,"Well I broke up with my long distance boyfriend of 2 years. We both had problems related to sex which I suppose logically made us incompatible.

I have something called vaginimus which means when I try to have penis In vagina sex it closes up and nothing will go in. Sort of like a vagina panic attack as it's often caused by stress/trauma. I have mild trauma and a phobia of falling pregnant by accident. I'm in therapy and trying to get it fixed and I told my boyfriend from the start. We still had plenty of sex just not PIV

According to his therapist my boyfriend/ex has problems with sex addiction including porn and masturbation and a lot of shame about sex.

In August he asked for an open relationship.He felt that his libido was out of control and he wasn't sure he'd stop himself cheating but that he still loved me.

I felt conflicted as it's not fair for him not to get piv but for me sex=feelings as I only started fancying him after knowing him for a long while as a friend. Anyway I said no and we kept dating.

Anyway at Xmas he let slip that he had hired a prostitute and gave her a massage as an ""experiment"" months before bringing up open relationship idea.He also said he was having sex with people in the first few months of us dating. I gave him plenty of chances to admit if he had cheated and he lied so I broke up with him.

Logically I know that this is the right decision but I've never been this close to anyone,we were so similar in terms of interests and we fit sexually. With him I became comfortable being more of a sexual top and had my first orgasm ever. I'm 26 and want children and before this happened I was thinking of moving in with him and wanted to have kids. I've got to start all over again and I know it's partly my fault for not noticing this earlier or trying harder in therapy.

Also im not as sad as I should be. Since we are long distance I'm not used to seeing him everyday but I wonder whether I actually cared for that much. He was absolutely devastated when we broke up but I've been thinking since August that we couldn't work long term with this much difference in sexuality.

He doesn't want any contact ever again and that makes it hard. he says it's because in his last relationship He kept calling and wouldn't let go.He thinks he's a terrible person and was busy saying How much he hated himself but I know it's my fault too. I expected too much of him and had this idealised view of him and didn't pay attention to reality. I wish I could help him still and know he was ok but me being there just caused him pain even when I told him I didn't blame him.

137,"Alright, this is a long one.

As I am writing this, it is currently 2 1/2 hours until 2020, and I can honestly say that this year and decade have not been kind to me. I have had a lot of family members pass, as well as others I care about. My mental health took a plummet, and I almost ended up killing myself, but, I somehow came out on top. This year, however. Holy crap. I haven't had this bad of a year since 2011. One bad thing after another happened. 

I had a group of friends who I will call M, D, and A. I became good friends with M and D in 6th grade. We became very close, and stayed close until this year after we graduated. We added A to our friend group in 9th grade, and we did a lot together. We all kind of evolved together except for one year, but after 8th grade, we all kind of branded ourselves as emo, or depressed bitches. We listened to the same music, had the same mental illness, took the same classes. We were close knit. I didn't realize that I was in so deep until January of this year. 

Now, M and D work at a haunted house near where we went to school (it was like 45 minutes away). I had always been interested in working there and seeing what it was like, so I went to the tester weekends they did for Valentine's day. I was 17 and able to drive up there by myself legally. I immediately fell in love. Now, I should also mention that I love acting and singing, so this was right up my alley. I was pretty good at it, too. I got lots of scares, made some good memories. The next to last night during the main season from September to November, I went up to M, and I told her ""Hey, you remember how you told me I could never do this? Look at me now! I've made it through the whole main season!"" It is important to note that M and D had been working there far longer than me and A (who came when I did). M looked at me and said ""You haven't done shit. All you do is run around in a building and scream at people."" I was kind of taken aback. I have been coming here for weeks at a time, suffered an injury that still hasn't really healed, lost my voice and damaged it, and you tell me I haven't done shit? Ouch. The next night is where it all started to go downhill. M, D, A, and me, as well as a few of our other friends were sitting in a restaurant, and they were all talking about spooky stuff like ghosts and demons. Now, I know I worked in a haunted house and everything, but I don't fuck with that stuff. No siree. I asked the group over and over to stop talking about that stuff, but they wouldn't stop. I was having a full on panic attack. D calmed me down some, and I was able to make it home, but January 2019 was when it all came crashing down. 

It is important to note here that D and A practice witchcraft. In May 2018, I decided to convert, because they had that much of an influence on me, that I decided to convert. I never really got into it or anything. I just got a couple of crystals and sage and stuff. Now, on with the story. I had some pretty serious personal stuff go down the week before my birthday. Then, the week after my birthday, something went down that I'm not comfortable saying here, but I was fully convinced that the world was going to end, and that we were all going to die. I was a fucking wreck. D and A came to my bedroom and cleansed it, but I told them the day that they came over that I was **done** with witchcraft, and I went back to my previous religion of Christianity. They overall respected that, and didn't talk about the craft to me. It took me months before I was back to semi-normal, and I'm pretty much back to normal, but I still have my moments. The reason that it took me months to improve was because of them. 

Every time I would look at them, I would be taken back to that time when I thought I was gonna die. The gut-wrenching, the nausea, the imagery, the smells. I lost probably 10 or so pounds in the months immediately following because I would't eat. I didn't want to do anything. I was too scared to eat because I thought I was gonna throw up, I didn't want to go to sleep because I would have a nightmare, etc. I haven't had any contact with M or D since we graduated. A goes to the same college as me, but I'm transferring next fall.  It all just came crashing down on me that my best friends of 7 or 8 years reduced me to this point. I was scared of these people that I had once loved. I drove them places, bought them gifts, worked at the same haunted house, converted religions, and it was all just a sham to me.

So now, I'm confused. I don't know what to do. I still deeply care about them and genuinely hope they are okay. I only had contact with A twice, once when a mutual friend's father passed, and then again when I saw him in the courtyard at school. He was very hesitant and distant with me at school. He wanted to be anywhere but that conversation, and I got the same disgusting feeling. He told me that we needed to talk, and that I had his number. I'm pretty sure they all have blocked me on Snapchat, but I still have them added. I got rid of the rest of my social media as a part of my healing, and it really helped. But now, I'm lost. I don't know what to do. They think I abandoned them, and I kind of did, but I didn't (don't) know what to do. I want to tell them how I feel, but if I look at them, I'm just gonna have a panic attack, and barely be able to speak. I'm considering sending them a letter. Idk. I want to make the 2020 better than this year and to do that I feel like I need closure, but how do I get that. What do I do now?",01Jan2020,1
138,"First off, Happy New Years! Hope everything you need comes your way.

Also, sorry if I ramble a bit.

Okay, this new year (and new decade), has been an important benchmark for me and im taking it very seriously. I was born in 2000, Which means this year I will be 20. In the past year or two, the stress of real life has been really sinking in on me. Mix in bad decisions and the toll mental health issues can make on someone and it becomes sink or swim. Ive flunked out of college after one semester in fall 2018, in debt, fallen out of shape, bad experiences with drugs and continued use (I've since stopped), friends that enter and exit my life with no consistency (I may not be helping), and I could go on but in short, my life is a bit of a mess. Im back home at square one, but, after having like 10 jobs in 3 years (always quit), I have a good paying one that works for me, but ultimately it is a means to end to get back to school. Sorry let me get to my question. After work I never do anything to work on myself, I always feel like im missing out and go drink and hangout with friends. How do I just hit the grindstone and deal with FOMO (fear of missing out)?

I am not supposed to know what he/she is dealing with, and it appears that everyone in my family is against him/her and his/her feelings. I want to reach out and subtly tell him/her that I am there for him/her and will support him/her, but I don't not want to reveal that I know of his feelings (because I am not supposed to atm). How do I show my support to him/her so he can feel safe telling me and talking to me, as I am probably the only person in the family who accepts and loves him/her regardless of him/her being a trans?

I feel like I‚Äôm living a double life. Honestly, it doesn‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm living life at all. I feel incomplete lease to say. I have a side of me that I want the world to know but do they really? Most importantly my boyfriend? 
Let‚Äôs me start from the beginning. 

Honestly, it all started a random year 4 years ago when I got a random snap message from some guy that wanted me to belittle him and say humiliating things. I can‚Äôt lie it caught me off guard and I was very uncomfortable. So for a while I ignored him until I finally gave in and honestly it was the best experience I‚Äôve had. He was my slave and I loved him. I thought ‚ÄúI could do this forever.‚Äù I had him for a year and half because I then met my boyfriend. Honestly things didn‚Äôt start off great. Long story short everything was rushed. Horrible for the first year in a half but through the trials and tribulations we are making it to see year 3. I lost my slave because me thinking my boyfriend was as carefree as me I told him about my slave and things went more left than it already was. I had to cut him off and it broke my heart.

Ever since then I honestly been feeling empty.. don‚Äôt get me wrong I love my boyfriend truly but I have this side of my life that I just want him to accept. I have been active in the findom life since I‚Äôve cut off my slave but I miss it so much. I think about it almost everyday. It‚Äôs starting to feel like I‚Äôm living a double life without the double life because I can‚Äôt truly be myself without losing the I love. But I also love being a findom. I love the dominance I have, the power, THE CONTROL! I love making men feel like shit and them wanting to kiss my feet and ass! I love belittling and talking down to men. I love subs so much. It‚Äôs like I love psychologically seducing them.  Manipulating them. Mindfucking them. Twisting their reality...

It‚Äôs getting to the point where...  
I want to tell him but I‚Äôm afraid to lose him. 
Sickening right? Wanting your cake and eating it too.
But if it‚Äôs my cake, why can‚Äôt I eat it?

157,"For some background, I am a 16yo(M), and I do not always feel the way. However, these feelings are frequent (3-5 times a week, sometimes more) and I just need someone to help me out. Any advice will help.

Lately, roughly over the past few months, I‚Äôve felt down. Down is a shitty way of putting it, but I‚Äôm not really sure how else to describe it. There‚Äôs multiple factors, so for reading‚Äôs sake I‚Äôll break it up into short paragraphs.

I feel insecure sometimes. High school fucking blows. In middle school, I used to be one of the well-liked kids, so I felt good. I enjoyed going to school. High school came, and I broke away from my old group of friends. I just simply felt I had outgrown them. They didn‚Äôt really like that so they‚Äôve been douchebags to me and all of my new friends. Out of all of them, I feel least-liked. I  have heard them say things behind our backs. Long story short, I feel like I went from being well-liked to hardly liked by any. I‚Äôm generally friendly with everyone, but I usually prefer to have more acquaintances than friends if you know what I mean. It hurts me to think that being myself with my new friends gets me to be less liked. I don‚Äôt want to change to be liked.

Along with that, I almost always feel lonely. After school, I like to play games with online friends I‚Äôve met, or play guitar. This is usually just a time filler. I always wait for this one girl to text me back, who we‚Äôll call K. K has become my best friend. I love talking to her. I‚Äôve had a crush on her since my freshman year. We would talk in Spanish, and then after school almost everyday. Despite that, I could never really tell if she felt the same way back. I went back and forth inside, and talked about it with friends. No one ever really knew, until about a couple months ago. She finally texted me and said we could be nothing more than friends because she didn‚Äôt want to lose what we had. This sucked, but I had kind of seen it coming. I told her that being friends was alright, hoping that maybe some day it would grow. As of right now I‚Äôm still holding onto that hope. Recently, though, those texts have stopped coming. There‚Äôs usually very few that come through, minus a couple nights here and there. I‚Äôm hoping that she‚Äôs just busy, but sometimes I think she hears things or thinks things about me that make her not want to even be friends with me anymore. This hurts me so much. She‚Äôs one of the 3 real friends that I have, and I feel like a year and some months of my time would have been wasted on nothing. I would be devastated if she were to not even want to be friends. My other friends keep telling me to move on, because they‚Äôre all getting into relationships, but something about her feels right. I never know what to do, and I hate even thinking about it sometimes. She‚Äôs one of the people who makes me happiest, and saddest all at once.

Most of all, I just feel sad. I do not feel like I am enough for anyone. Not K, nor my friends. Sometimes I do or say things that I am not proud of, and sometimes I wish I were a better friend. But mostly because of K, I feel like I‚Äôm not enough. When we had the conversation about just being friends, she said she wasn‚Äôt allowed to date anyways. I know she has never had a boyfriend, but I was hoping to be her first. But I feel like I can‚Äôt be, because I‚Äôm not good enough. Feeling this way hurts me the most, feeling like I‚Äôm hardly good enough for anyone is something I wouldn‚Äôt wish on my worst enemy. It eats at me inside, and I hate it so much. 

I don‚Äôt know why I feel this way, and if any of you could give me advice how to not feel this way, even just baby steps. I do not think I am depressed. I have had depression before, and so have many people in my family. I have plenty of experience with it, and this is no where near as bad. I still have happy moments throughout my days. I just want to have happy moments during all of them. Any help would be much appreciated.

I have a younger brother (21) who for lack of better terms is ‚Äúenlightened‚Äù.

All the conspiracy theories, the earth is flat, big pharma is out to get us, religion is the most evil thing on this planet, nobody understands how truly deep and wise his inner thoughts are, he‚Äôs seen through the matrix - him in a nutshell. I realize it‚Äôs NYE but he is visiting for the holidays and I‚Äôve been trying to avoid arguing with him but we just had a big fight about vaping and I was just left so dumbfounded that I just want some insight from other people who might understand where he is coming from. Basically he was ranting about how mad he was that our parents confiscated his vape (while I agree he is an adult I stand by my parents, their roof, their rules, but that‚Äôs not the point) and then he went off on me when I said he shouldn‚Äôt be vaping in the first place. Before you come for me, I just watched the documentary ‚Äúbroken‚Äù on Netflix about the vaping epidemic and have seen countless news headlines about teens in the hospital from it. While I understand the extreme vaping illnesses are often from counterfeit products, our grandpa was a lifelong smoker and died from lung cancer so in my eyes none of the reward is worth the risk, cigarettes or vapes, it‚Äôs the same category for me. Anyway that‚Äôs just how I feel as his older sister, I don‚Äôt think he should be using anything that might compromise his health. The reason I am posting this is his rebuttal was that I shouldn‚Äôt be taking my Levothyroxine (diagnosed with Hashimotos at age 14, been on it ever since), and that basically vaping is the same thing as taking my medicine. That I‚Äôm so addicted to my medicine and same with my morning cup of coffee and that makes me the biggest hypocrite. That all the news is fake, how dumb I am for believing the media that is lying about how dangerous vaping is and how I‚Äôm so brainwashed. 
Ugh. I don‚Äôt know what to do or say to him anymore. This is just the tip of the iceberg with him, but my main confusion came from his claim that my medicine is the same thing as him vaping. 
Ummm no it isn‚Äôt?!!! Right?? If I‚Äôm wrong somebody please let me know, but if I don‚Äôt take my medicine, over time my metabolism will slow down extremely putting me at risk for heart and kidney disease, infertility, damaged nerves, cognitive issues and severe depression. I don‚Äôt think not vaping will result in the same thing as that?!!

Wife is in military so her schedule is often unpredictable so I have to work from home at night. I can work on weekends as well.

I‚Äôm looking for any ideas that are legit, flexible, realistic, and hopefully long term. Ideally, something that I can do from my car and/or coffee shop near bus yard (my commute to home is 30 min) with a laptop and wifi. But I am open to anything (physical labor, dirty jobs, etc).

I am highly motivated, focused, and productive. I am computer literate, learn quickly, and have many years of people and property management experience.

Thank you in advance for any suggestions!!!",01Jan2020,1

175,"So I've been best friends with a guy that's 6 years older than me ever since I was 7, because of sports, and until recently I viewed it as nothing more than friendship. Currently I'm 15 and he's 21. It was new year's eve and we both got a bit more than tipsy, so my parents decided to drive him home. Then while sitting in the back of the car he suddenly started slightly touching my leg, teasing me about how I had holes in it. He started subtly rubbing my thigh then intertwining his fingers with mine, squeezing my hand. After that we kind of acted like nothing happened, even over app it was just casual app. So as a 15 year old girl with no experience on love whatsoever, I got confused. Does this mean he likes me?

Her birthday is in less than two months, and I was thinking of buying her a gift for 60$, as well as include  something like a letter, where I tell her how much I appreciate her, how ambitious she is, how smart she is, and stuff like that. I also wanted to include something like ""I couldn't have asked for a better cousin and therefore I love you"". I'm afraid however she will be weirded out (this is a first cousin by the way) as I've never said I love her before. She hasn't said she loves me either before.

The issue arises in that I feel like he deserves so much better. He's never been anything but loving and wonderful and supportive through all my tough times over the time we've known each other. I just feel like he doesn't need my dumbass in his life. I feel manipulative sometimes. Maybe it's the mean thoughts in my head telling me I'm awful (mental illness is a bitch) but I honestly feel like if I hurt him now by leaving him then it would be better for him in the long run.

187,"I‚Äôm a female 17 and I was talking to a male 17

So let‚Äôs call him daddy‚Äôs boy. We through online which I know how to deal with people online I have a set of my own rules I follow like not to meet up with them, not to share too much, and not to trust them too much.

Anyway so we met and instantly he started to become kinda weird he would talk a lot about his sex life which kinda through me off. For example I told him an embarrassing story about how I went to school wearing my pj‚Äôs and no one else did. When he told me story‚Äôs he would always tell me something sexual like some girl grabbing his intimate parts.

So a few weeks passed and he told me he loved me. I felt uncomfortable with this because it was the 4th week and it was too early and I promised myself to never e-date which I don‚Äôt have a problem without her people but personally I don‚Äôt like the idea of myself dating online just gives me the creeps.

He had trouble with his ex and one day someone brought his ex up and he called me but before he called me he texted me saying that he doesn‚Äôt feel well and wants to talk to me. I explained but he should talk to someone he‚Äôs known for more than 4 weeks who truly knew him and his struggles because I barley knew who he was. He said he didn‚Äôt want to the only person he wants to talk to was me and I say that I have trouble with expressing my feelings and i made him aware of that.

Some minutes pass and he calls me multiple times so I answer and he proceeded to fill me in with his problems at the time I forgot he was sad he sounded sleepy. So I then ask ‚Äúare you tired‚Äù he said no just sad and then I say oh okay. Then he says that him and his ex gf wanted to kill themselves together at the same time so at that point I decide to record our convo on my iPad and in the recording you can see me make very uncomfortable faces because I was creeped out.

After that whole convo he says ‚Äúwould you end my misery and kill me when we meet‚Äù I was so shocked I said ‚Äúno I don‚Äôt want blood on my hands tf‚Äù I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a reasonable answer to that question because it was so weird and creepy. When I said that he said that I was a bitch and I have in recording my uncomfortable laugh and I said ‚Äúme never that‚Äù because I thought he was joking apparently he wasn‚Äôt and said I‚Äôm serious I‚Äôm not joking your selfish and didn‚Äôt think for anyone but themselves.

Anyway he hung up after telling me that his gf wasn‚Äôt selfish and she helped him. And the day after he decided to text me as if nothing happened. My momma thought me better than that and I decided to be the ‚Äúselfish bitch‚Äù and tell me off. So when ever he tells me something like ‚Äúwhat are you doing‚Äù I would respond with ‚Äúoh you know just being a selfish bitch‚Äù so on and so fourth. 

After that whole conversation I ignored him like the sliding bitch I am. So I ignored him for at least three months and then he kept bugging me so I decided to forgive him because why not so I kept being distant no really interested in having a conversation so out convos would be short and boring.

During The time off of school my brother invited me and my sister to six flags and I was excited because me and my sister went with my half brother and his baby momma. So we went and he asked where I was which I told him because at the time i thought he was somewhere else because that‚Äôs what he said.

Oop never mind just blocked him LAMO Ramey‚Äôs he said he was dying and how his last wish was to get nudes and how I‚Äôd someone really cared for him they would send nudes and stuff like just because your dying doesn‚Äôt mean people owe you anything lol but anyway I‚Äôm glad because he was kinda toxic but if you read all of this yikes.",01Jan2020,1

189,"I just got into an semi argument with a friend. I feel kinda bad for noticing the slightest shift in a friendship and voicing out my opinion right away. Since my break up from a highly toxic and emotional abusive relationship 3 months ago, I got trouble forming friendships. I feel like I became highly sensitive, strict and put up too many boundaries. I feel like I don't tolerate any shit anymore.
So this guy and me were having a good relationship for 3 weeks. Just a friend. But he started acting off 3 days ago and continued kinda avoiding me? It's really subtle but it's it's still there. For many it would be minor, but it bothered me. So I called him out on it and asked in a polite way if something is wrong and if I did do something?
He was beating around the bush, but his overall message was that me asking for how to order food through this app, and also asking him to help me out for finding an language exchange partner in exchange for money, felt like I was a shallow person and only using him in this relationship. I felt so hurt.
I am currently in another country, and trying to figure out many things on my own, without any family etc. So in my western culture it's normal to rely on each other for help, it means a person is reliable and trusting. But he is from eastern culture, they are non confrontial and very avoidant, so for him me asking for help felt like a nuisance and that I might use him.
So he admitted he was treating me avoidant for 3 days.
I told him that's shitty and that it hurts, that if I wouldn't have asked, he would have continued this until unhealthy levels.
He apologized and said it's due to trauma and fear of being used.
I couldn't be understanding and continue to feel hurt until now.
Am I too highly sensitive? Is this a good friend? Should I just ignore my feelings and apologize?

I live in Canada so it is legal if we ever became a thing. It's just a moral thought in my mind. I'm really afraid that if we get together everyone would be judging me.

193,"So, this has been on my mind for a long, long time, and I really don't know what to do about it. I'm sorry if this is going to be a really long post, but it is a long story. Sorry for any typos or anything. It's also a repost from another sub, I tried posting there and got no interaction and I really need the advice. 

I had been friends with someone I'll refer to as A for around 2 years, we'd met online and just immediately gotten along. She was always super sweet to me, and I grew up having a lot of issues with my family, so we'd always joked that she was pretty much my 'adoptive mother'. And honestly, it was really accurate. I felt closer to her than I did to my own family. I loved talking to her, spending time with her, she was the first person I ever went to when I had any sort of problems. I trusted her with everything I was.

A bit later, through a mutual server we both were in on discord, I met B, who turned out to now be one of my closest friends. B and I started talking a lot, and eventually dated for around 1 month before deciding it was best to stay as friends. Anyway, then B and A began talking, and all 3 of us formed this friendship that was really, really special to me. We'd originally started talking through a RP server for a fandom, but then decided to make a new one with our OCs, because we'd been talking about them a lot, along with our other friend, C.

We loved interacting with our OCs, building a world with them, having fun, making storylines and shipping them together. We grew attached to each other's characters majorly, and this server was honestly one of the most fun experiences I had ever had, and it became almost a creative outlet for me when I was feeling down.

The problem started slightly when A and B began shipping their characters together. I thought it was absolutely adorable and was fine with it, but they just...started going more off onto their own. They wouldn't interact with the rest of us in the server, and when they did it was to do with their relationship between their characters, they made the chats between them private, talked to me less and less. And the more the days went on, the more I felt like I was in the background. Both of them started talking to me less, stopped replying to our private servers as often, made seperate chats and servers by themselves and were active in them all the time.

B stopped talking to me about their issues, despite me continuously always going to them when something was bothering me and trusting them with my life. They stopped telling me anything, just saying 'I'll talk to A about it'.

I eventually got a little upset, because it was to the point where I felt that I had to beg for any sort of interaction, and no matter what I would do or try, I would never be as close to them as they were to me anymore. It wasn't the three of us, it was A &amp; B. Eventually, I opened up to A about it, asking whether I should talk to B about it. They basically said that A has had a lot of things going on, and that it wasn't fair of me to be upset because I didn't know what they were feeling. I just got upset and said I felt like I wasn't even apart of this friendship anymore, but using what A said, I didn't tell B.

B got upset that I wasn't telling them what was going on, and then when I eventually did, nothing really changed. I still felt left out.

Anyway, a new server was created, one that I was really excited for. A and I had been talking about the idea for a while, and decided to do a ship between our characters, which *never* happens, as usually A &amp; B would do one with theirs and I just had whatever leftover OCs there were, and even then there was never as much effort put into it. So Lee joined the server, and when we said we were doing the ship, they went 'Well, there goes both of my options'. And then they said that they felt disconnected from the server because they were so used to doing the ship between their ship with A.

Then A DMed me basically asking if we could do a ship with B because they wanted to ship their character with A and that they had a lot of chemistry, etc. It took me a lot of guts, but I said no, simply because with the way my character is written, he doesn't work well in polyamorous relationships, and I knew if I said yes, I would just be left out again. That was fine for the time being, or at least, I thought it was.

I was in class at this point, and I had asked A to help me with the permissions of the server because I needed to go. When I opened my laptop next, I had messages from both A and B, asking if I had purposely kicked B from the server. B sounded just a little bit concerned and confused, but A was full-on accusatory, the shift in tone was extremely obvious. I was really confused and just was trying to figure out what was going on, and it turned out to be one role that affected *everyone,* at it wasn't my fault. But they both immediately jumped onto me and accused me, and assumed I was trying to hurt B. Which I wasn't, I never would.

Then they started apologising and asking if I was upset (which I obviously was), and then B just said 'we're OTP so A was just trying to protect me', which just...really hurt. Really, really, hurt, and made me feel even more left out, and made me realise even more that despite talking to them about what I was feeling, nothing was changing. I was immediately the one to blame, whether I did anything or not, and when I talked to them about what happened it didn't do anything.

At this point, I was just tired and upset. I had exams coming up at school, I was going through a lot in terms of my mental health, my friends, my awful household, and they knew all of this. The thing that was supposed to be my creative outlet ended up stressing me out too much to handle.

I just decided in the end to take a break. I messaged A explaining that what was happening in the past week had really hurt me, especially with A, and I have exams and I can't handle the stress mentally. I said that I'm going to take a break from them, and A said it's okay, and to please take care of myself. I then told B, and said I would contact them when I was ready.

I went completely offline, then, I left every server and groupchat we had together. I focused on studying for the 7 exams I had, focused on my mental health. Around a month passed, and I still didn't know whether to reach out to A or not, because they had particularly hurt me. But then B sent me a message, basically apologising for everything and saying they miss me and they love me and that they never meant to make me upset or anything, they finally told me what was going on and why they had acted the way they did. It took me a lot of courage, but I decided to respond, and thank them for reaching out, and slowly, slowly we started talking again.

Days went on, and I still didn't know how to approach talking to A. I was hurt by what they did the most, mostly because of the trust I had put in them and I didn't think I was mentally in the right spot to try to reach out to them. I told B this, and said I needed time to heal, and I would reach out to them when ready.

Around 3 months later, I started badly missing A, and the fun we would have together. B was feeling the same way, as they were still talking to A this entire time, and wanted us to be friends again. But then again, B and I hadn't really talked about what had happened, it was just this problem hanging above our heads.

So I asked B what I should do about the whole situation, and asked if A was mad at me at if it was worth trying to reach out. B said that A didn't know how I felt about her, since I was the one who left in the first place and decided I needed a break, and then she waited for me to say something for 2 months and gave up. B said they were in a weird position between the both of us and I needed to talk to A because they don't know what she's thinking.

Through all of this I was confiding in my other friend, E, about it. I love E so, so much for so many reasons, we just clicked and have so much fun and I trust them so much. But one of the reasons I love them so much is because they're just as enthusiastic as I am, and their communication was always so, so great. But with A &amp; B, whenever something happened, I would never be told, if they were upset and that was affecting how they were acting, I would never be told. And I just couldn't get over that feeling.

Eventually, with B &amp; E's advice, I decided to reach out. I wanted to make it clear that I miss them, but what happened hurt me, and I don't want to be hurt again. I don't want more stress mentally, and if that's what's going to happen I can't handle that.

Then, when I went to message A, it turned out that they had blocked me. Which I should've already seen as a red flag of it's own. When I told B, they said they'd tell A to friend me again so we could talk. B really, really wanted me to message them, and continued encouraging me to do so.

It went awfully.

She basically said that not talking was selfish, and she was the one who had to deal with comforting B because they were worried that they hurt me, and said that they didn't leave me out, I left myself out and then took it out on them. And then when they were told that I was talking to B again, it broke their heart, and when the silence kept going it made them sick to their stomach. They ended it by saying they forgive me, but don't want to be friends with me anymore. I explained that while everything that was happening, I had put my feelings aside because *she* told me that what I feeling wasn't fair, and even when I did speak up, nothing changed and it just stressed me out even more. And I said truthfully, that if B hadn't messaged me first, I probably wouldn't have reached out either.

I said that I understand why she feels the way she does, but she didn't know how much it hurt me and the fact that she wants to cut off our friendship is worse than everything, and that I don't want to sit there and beg for her forgiveness. Everything just escalated, she started attacking me, calling me selfish, telling me to back off. I don't want to type it all out because I think I'll start crying again. But that hurt more than anything else, my close friend, someone who was my mother figure and I trusted with my life, throwing this all away.

I went through a huge pit of guilt, hating myself and crying and having panic attacks, and I ended up reaching out to my friends about it. E said that they think that A was being extremely immature, that real, valid friendships fall out all the time, that they have people they talk to every 3 months and that friendship is still extremely strong, and for someone who's supposed to be an adult, they're not acting like it.

I talked to another one of my friends, and they brought up the following points:

\-I do not need to apologise for my mental health. It effects you just as much as physical health, if you break a bone it needs time to heal, and the same thing applies. Taking a step back was necessary for my healing, and needed a lot of strength to do so.

\-I don't 'owe' anyone a conversation, it's fine to take my time to prepare myself mentally, as long as it will take.

\-The guilt tripping on their part is overwhelming, and completely unfair.

\-And again, real friendship never 'dies' if it's not continuously consistent. This is honestly true with the friend I'm talking to, because we *rarely* talk, but we're still as close.

She ended it by saying that she understands why A was upset, but the opportunity to work through it and fix it was right there, but their stubbornness pushed that away, and that I was trying my best to fix it.

Since then, things have been a little tense. Obviously, mentioning A or any of A's characters is a really big sore spot, and for a while B and I didn't talk about it, at all. We'd change the subject. We wouldn't mention A at all. We just tried to pretend it never happened. It hurt so much, though, because it was upsetting me so much but when I tried to talk to B about it, they said they don't like talking about it and to please not mention it because they're still just as close with A.

This just strained our friendship so much, because this was bothering me so much and I felt like I couldn't talk about it. I would talk to E about it, or my other friend, just find some way to get it out of my system. I would write songs, make vent art, talk to my IRL friends about it, and I went with my word and didn't mention it to B.

Not only that, but I was pretty much replaced by the third friend, C, and I lost my friendship with everyone else in the original server because of it. Everyone except for B.

But some good things did happen!! The original problem, that my character and B's character didn't go well together was erased, and we ended up shipping them together. We'd discuss new plots and new characters on our own, and despite not having the big server, the private one we had was just as fun tbh.

But the problems started when B's feelings for me returned, I guess. They started telling people that we were together, despite knowing that I wasn't interested in an online relationship. Honestly? If we knew each other IRL, we'd be together. But right now, I have a girlfriend, and I'm happy with her (and I liked her and would tell B about this while everything was happening--to clarify, I had no idea that B felt this way). But then I guess the more I pulled away and distant I felt because of the eggshells I was walking on and the hurt of losing my close friend, I don't know. I'm trying to find some reasoning.

But they would start to mention A. While we on voice calls, mentioning her character's name in our private server, when I'd bring up E they'd bring up A. It just killed me. It would ruin my entire day, I would think I'm recovering then just spiral down again. I told them to *please* not mention A to me or me to A when everything first originally went down. They admitted to knowing that A didn't want to be friends with me and hated me now, but told me to message her anyway because they wanted to solve things. Despite knowing it would hurt me.

It would get to the point where I'd be upset, they'd ask why, I'd say it was because of what happened with Al but I know they don't like talking about it so I won't mention it. They'd say 'oh my god thank you for taking into consideration my feelings in this i love you so much' and then the topic would drop. Both of us could feel the weight hanging over us, and it had always been a problem with B, that they were shit at communicating with me. And now, I wasn't allowed to mention A because it made them uncomfortable, but they were fine to do it to me.

It was almost like, even talking to B was a reminder of what happened with A. It stung. A lot.

I had some really bad problems happening with my family and was getting help to try to put a case together and gather evidence to get me out of my home (I scrapped this eventually, but it was a big deal), and when I told B, they said they can get A to help. That she'd asked about me and they'd talked about how things were going with my mum. I firmly said that if she has any screenshots or anything that could help, that's fine, but I don't want her involved. And the fact that B had gone against my wishes and mentioned me to A, not only that, mentioned my really, *really* personal problems to her? It fucking stung.

I wanted to feel closer to them, though, so I decided to do something nice that was a bit of a tradition of ours. I drew us matching pfps, and send it to them. Before, we'd change the pfps and then match usernames. I changed my pfp, they changed theirs, I changed my name to \[name of my char\] loves \[name of B's char\], and they'd usually match with \[name of their char\] loves \[name of my char\]. We'd done this countless times. But this time, they just refused to change anything, and started making excuses. I realised the true reason why they didn't want to match with me, and I just got upset. They couldn't just tell me anything, apparently.

I talked to E about it, really frustrated, and E decided to help and messaged B to ask what was wrong. That's when I finally got a semi-answer. B had a crush on me, a big one, and was pulling away from me because of that. We talked a lot and they said they don't want me to feel like I can't talk to them about anything anymore, and we both recognised that we need to work on communication, and everything's ok again.

But, I don't know. The constant reminder of what happened with A is still hanging over me, and it seems like as much as I love B, it's just making it worse. I don't know how to get over it. I don't know what to do. I don't want B and I's friendship to end because I'm an idiot who can't get over losing a friend, because it's not B's fault for what happened between A and I.

This was really long, I'm sorry. I guess I'm just trying to ask, how do I get over what happened between A and I, and how do I stop associating B with her and repair our friendship and relationship to what it was before everything happened?",01Jan2020,1

219,"Hi! So I live in New Zealand in a small flat underneath a main house, with separate entry and all self contained. When I moved in there were 3 flatmates that lived above me, and barely saw.
We had an agreement with the rubbish and recycling bins that we shared, I would take up the rubbish once a month.
The recycling is collected every 2 weeks. Which they handled on their weeks with the rubbish. Because 3 of them and only one of me.
And we live down the bottom of a long shared drive down a hill. 
About 9months ago they moved out and a family moved in, a mother and her two teenage daughters.
I chatted with her, let her know about the schedule with the rubbish (as I have my turn in my phone calendar for the next year).
All was going well. 
About a month ago I missed my turn because the bin was only half full, which she has done before and I‚Äôve had to take an extra full bin up.
I let her know when I saw her outside a couple days later. And she seemed a bit annoyed, and said it really needs to go up each week no matter what as she runs a home daycare and fills it with nappies. I‚Äôm like okay all good, noted.
A week ago she messaged saying that moving forward in the new year she‚Äôd like me to start taking up the recycling too. And that she would be away this week and I‚Äôll have to do it.
I hadn‚Äôt replied because it‚Äôs not quite sitting right with me. There‚Äôs 3 of them and one of me, I maybe throw out one bag of rubbish and one of recycling each week, if that. Plus it‚Äôs filled with nappies and rubbish from her business as well as home life?
I thought about it and was like ok I could do it every 2 months and just take up the recycling bin the 8th week following my already existing rubbish only schedule, so I‚Äôm not lugging up two bins by myself. 
I happened to see her yesterday in the driveway and was surprised as she had said she was away, so I called out, and she said she‚Äôs back, so I‚Äôm thinking cool, won‚Äôt need to worry about the bins then since my week is next week anyway. 
And I suggested about my plan with the recycling and she didn‚Äôt really get it, and couldn‚Äôt understand why I wouldn‚Äôt do both bins at the same time once a month and change up the whole schedule. I explained it was set up the way it was because there‚Äôs 3 people upstairs and just me in the flat downstairs. And she seemed annoyed as she takes them up on her own.

I don‚Äôt know, if we were 2x single people then yeah split everything by half‚Äôs, but it seems weird to me. I don‚Äôt mind helping. But I should be doing 1/4 of the lot? It just feels like she‚Äôs telling me what to do when I‚Äôm not her child and I was here first.

231,"I (27F) left my husband (29M) of almost 6 years last night. He is verbally abusive and most likely narcissistic.

Where do I even begin? When I first met him I thought he was gay. This was purely based on stereotypes, and many of the people I have encountered since the start of our relationship 7 years ago think the same. About 4 years ago I had this weird suspicion that he was hiding something from me. In the middle of the night I checked his phone and found a hookup app where he was asking guys for dick pics. When I confronted him about it, he said that since we weren't having as much sex as he would've liked, I made him feel unattractive so he was reaching out for attention. He said the reason he was asking guys for photos is because it's easier than asking girls. 

A year after the dick pic incident, a piece of trash woman that both my husband and I had met years ago before we had even met each other came back into our lives. My husband apparently had sex with her back when he was 16, and when he brought it up to her, she had no memory of it. He spent the latter part of the evening saying things like ""you don't remember? It was in the back of my car!"" In front of my face. She continued to come to my house and I noticed a lot of flirtation between the two. He even accidentally called her baby in front of me. Twice I woke up after a night of drinking with him not in bed. The first time I found him on the couch in the living room, and she was on the other couch. The second time they were both asleep in our guest bed. He claims they didn't have sex. His reasoning? He still had clothes on when I found him in there, so there's no way. He was also so drunk that even if he did have sex with her, how could he have been smart enough to put his clothes back on? One time, she showed up unannounced on our anniversary. I went to my bathroom and cried on the floor. When he came and found me, I told him to make her leave and he said he wouldn't. 

About a year ago this girl told my best friend that they slept together. Unfortunately, she is such a drunk and homewrecker that I'm not even sure if she would've even remembered the sex if it actually happened, so she's not a credible source.

Around that same time he picked up a job where he did networking events. A lot of them were at night and held at restaurants and bars. One night he just never came home and he never texted or called me. I contacted my mother in law first thing the next morning and she immediately started checking county jails and hospitals. Around 10 am while I was at work he finally contacted me and said his phone died, he got really drunk and ended up sleeping at a guy's house he met that night. He made it seem like it was not a big deal. 

During this time, I was extremely paranoid for obvious reasons. I was constantly checking Verizon to see who he was texting. I started noticing him texting the same number constantly. One night he was coming home from work and he said his phone was dying and that we should stop texting. Several minutes later I checked his text history online and he was still texting this number after he told me his phone was about to die. Fucking heartbreaking. I never dared mention this to him because he would accuse me of snooping or lying or whatever.

Lots of crazy things between then and now (including odd text messages and inappropriate back massages while laying on a sofa - both with guys) but I recently found out from a good friend that my husband does coke - and has been doing it for years. He told me that my husband mentioned to him one time that I found a baggy in the dryer and then he laughed about it because I had no idea it was once filled with cocaine. I wasn't ready to confront him about it yet until one night when he left our house around 4 am. Our security camera cut off, and when it cut back on his car was gone. An hour and a half later the camera cuts off again and when it comes back on, his car is back. I noticed this disappearing act the next morning and my first thought was that he was going out and doing coke. He told me he went to a gas station and ate a fig newton and drank a soda in his car because I bitch at him so much about spending money.

My friend who alerted me about my husband's coke usage told me that two of our male acquaintances told my friend at two separate occasions that my husband had first given them coke, then asked to suck their dicks, or offered to masturbate in front of them. When I confronted my husband about this, he acted surprised and wanted to reach out to these two guys and find out exactly what was said. He says this never happened and he acted extremely surprised and concerned. Of course, he never reached out to them.

I decided to look through his emails on his computer the day after the fig newton incident and noticed under the folder ""important"" he had requested access to his keepsafe photo vault the night before. I decided to download the app and use the access code emailed to him and BAM - pictures of his penis everywhere. One picture was of him naked in front of the bathroom mirror, holding his dick, and sucking a dildo attached to the wall. I was horrified. The pictures were from about 2 years ago and he says he didn't send them to anyone, but I just don't believe him. 

Another shot at therapy and it came out that he had been struggling with his sexuality and that I was the one who made him question whether or not he was gay. So he experimented and as a result felt ""embarrassed and disgusted"" at his actions. Except, why keep them in your photo stash two years later if that is the case? The therapist asked if he is gay or bi and he said no. I admitted in therapy that while it would be an adjustment and a shock, I would not leave him if he were to come out as bi, but that we had originally agreed on a closed relationship and therefore I would leave him if he was acting on his fantasies. 

My husband talked down to me a LOT. He's one of those assholes that gives you the biggest look of disgust and the most dramatic eye roll when you haven't heard of something before. Like... ""Wow... You didn't know that?"" *Eye roll, look of disgust.* He also gets super angry when we are in a fight, which causes me to shut down and not respond. I also start crying which he absolutely HATES. His reasoning is: why cry when we can just fix it? I've never apologized to someone so much for my tears.

I decided enough is enough. I left. Though he's never hit me, he threatened to burn down the house, murder-suicide, etc. I quickly took one of my dogs to my mom's house. When I returned to the house to get more of my things, he had already taken my work laptop and let the air out of one of my tires. He told me to return our dog or he would damage my laptop. Since I knew he was somehow going to get my dog anyway, I gave in. He guilt tripped me and said ""it really shows how you care more about your work stuff than our dog."" I'm currently staying at my mom's, and his texts are absolutely insane. From anger to desperation to love and kindness and back to anger. He keeps blaming me for leaving him with all the home responsibilities (e.g. our pets, the laundry, no groceries for him... I lol-ed at the last one.) I keep wanting to go back to the house and just take care of everything so I don't feel shamed for ""abandoning"" everything, but I know he's just trying to reel me in.

While I am lucky to not have any children with him, we do own a house as well as a business. Our business is his primary ""job"" although it is at the very start and we have not made enough money to even pay him, so he works a side gig making a whopping $600 a month. I make the money in the house so I wouldn't even know how to split it with him or if I should just take the money and run. I'm terrified he will take all the money out of our account and I won't have enough to pay the mortgage. I have an appointment with my therapist next Wednesday but I just don't know what to do until then besides ignoring his texts and not giving in to his manipulation. Advice please?


TL;DR: Left my verbally abusive and manipulative husband. Need advice on next steps financially. Take the money and run or hope he doesn't drain our account before the bills come out?",01Jan2020,1
232,"In 2012 I left CO to go to school in IN.
Graduated in 2017 and moved to IL for a job. Didn't know anybody in IL.
I'm single. I have a cat.

Living in my current apartment I still dont feel like I've moved in. Been here 2 years. My fridge sits basically empty. My kitchen cabinets are all basically empty. My kitchen counter basically has a two year pile of bills (paid online) and junk mail. I have boxes in the corner of my living room from when I moved in, still packed. Nothing hanging on the walls or on any shelves that might be considered decorations. My clothes I basically live out of my hamper. Dont have a dresser. With my job I wear basically the same 2 pairs of Jeans and 5 shirts switching off, with enough clean socks and underwear, a jacket for winter. When one goes bad I trash it and buy another. Dirty clothes go in the hamper. I clean them. They basically stay in the laundry basket until I need them then repeat. My desk for my computer is one of those 5' white folding tables. My chair is one of those white plastic folding chairs. 

I go to work at 5:30 am each morning mon-fri. I get home at 5:30 PM. Live 50 miles from work as I live on the edge of town and work in the middle of farmland country. Takes me an hour to get to and from work.  I do this hoping that living around more people I'll develop some kind of social life but hasn't happened yet.  Also the quality of rental housing near work is considerably worse. Im afraid to buy a place close to work because i'm worried if I buy a place near work then my work will close and I'll be out of a job and stuck with a house in an area that now nobody wants to buy. I also have no idea about all the terminology and intricacies that goes with buying a house. It confuses me and I have no desire to learn. Downside of where I live is there's only a couple hours between getting home and having to go to bed, so once I'm home I dont have the energy to do anything else. From 2008 to 2017, over 9 years I moved about 15 times. I think I haven't made this home because I'm just waiting to have to move again, so I figure what's the point of unpacking and buying stuff.

I typically order delivery or pickup fast food on my way home. I eat. I watch netflix or prime video and lay on the couch until 9. Then I go to bed. On the weekend I sleep in till 10am. Then lay on the couch watching netflix/youtube or playing merge dragons on my tablet, literally all day. I argue with random people on reddit a lot. Order delivery food or eat some food if I've gone to the store, which is usually basic stuff; cheese/salami, or bagels w cream cheese, or bagel bites. Never anything that must be cooked or would create leftovers that could spoil and attract fruit flies, which are a constant problem. Then I go to bed at 10pm and repeat the next day. Then Monday go back to work. I basically spend my weekend waiting on the couch to go back to work. My social life is virtually non-existant. Would not say I have any friends here. Occassionally I get invited to social events with co-workers, which are fun. But that's maybe once a month, if that.

As far as hobbies. I've tried learning an instrument. I've tried video games. I've tried arduino/electronics. Tried just reading to learn more about my job. All of it I find I just get bored very quickly, or lose focus and get distracted by something else. As far as outdoor stuff, coming from CO has been hard. I feel like IL has nothing to offer. Doing stuff outside alone I feel like I'm being judged or thought of as creepy so I mostly just stay home. If I do go out it's usually to the movie theater.

I'm 31. I have never been in a relationship. I've been on only a handful of dates which all did not go well. It's difficult for me to connect with people. This is an area I've pretty much given up on entirely as I dont think I'm deserving of any happy relationship. My relationship with my family is terrible. I hardly ever talk to any of them. Now I only see them once or twice a year and it pretty much always involves yelling/arguing. It's the only time I use vacation time from work and it's never a vacation, just nothing but more stress. Usually takes me a couple weeks at work to recover from the built up stress from my holiday vacation to see family.

I've seen a therapist a few times the past few months but didnt get much out of it and it's hard to keep going at $100 per session when I dont even know what I'm looking for. My job pays well but most goes to my massive student loan debt and the rest to my bills/terrible spending habits.

I feel like I'm just wasting my life and I'm just one bad situation away from being totally screwed and my desire to fix it and improve things is just pinned to the floor by a mountain of crap that never goes away. Occassionally I'll get spurts of motivation. A few good things will happen all in a row which motivates me to clean, or cook a meal, or go to the gym. But then when I clean something it gets dirty again, or when I cook a meal I put the leftovers in the fridge and come back two days later to find it already covered in mold, or I'll go to the gym and end up getting hurt. Something always happens and the motivation dries up and I'm back to doing nothing.

I am currently quite overweight 5'9"", 310 lbs and take levothyroxine for hypothyroidism. 9 years ago I was a power lifter, weighed 208 lbs, could run a &lt;7 min mile, could bench 250 lbs, squat 450, dead lift 500 lbs. Going back to school I went all into it both mentally and physically to get my degree. I put aside everything; social life, diet, exercise, hobbies. Focused only on one thing and I think I cracked. Now that I'm done with my degree I dont know how to get back any of the stuff I gave up.

I dont know what I'm looking to get by posting this. Think I'm mostly just writing this to sort out my thought. Feel free to judge me. Comment what you want. Dont comment at all.

Of course it's New Years and we're all making resolutions. Mine is to get back into art and learn a more realistic art style.

The burning sensation to pick a pencil and start drawing again is very strong these pasts few months, and I feel I've grown out of wanting to draw in a cartoon style. 

I want to study realism. The biggest advice I've seen so far to others is to begin drawing what I see, but specifically for myself, I'm looking for instructional books that show the basics. If anyone has any suggestions, it would be greatly appreciated!

Another thing -- I'm vegan, and I feel tense talking about it with her or food in general 'cause she doesn't agree with it.

So as a preface I‚Äôll have you all know that my stepfather is a functioning alcoholic. He drinks a 6 pack of Budlight Premium a night and gets kinda of annoying but still tolerable. However, he gets super problematic every time we go out for something for example a Christmas Party at somebody at a family friend‚Äôs house. The man has a machista inferiority complex which makes him paranoid and when drunk he comes to believe that everybody is staring at him and judging him and thinking less of him. This causes him to become angry and lash out, making a scene, which causes people to take notice and look at him reinforcing his paranoia and insecurity. The situation always ends up with us leaving the event to prevent him from socking somebody in the face and then a big fight always emerges on the way home. My mom tells him he has a problem with alcohol, he fails to realize any of his problems and the culpability of his actions, we get home, they fight some more, we all go to sleep and awake as if nothing had happened. I‚Äôve realized this pattern has been going on for a couple of years now and have grown to harbor a strong resentment and impatience with my stepdad, though I have always kept my feelings secret as to avoid possibly pissing him off even more. However, yesterday, New Year‚Äôs Eve, my mom prepared a beautiful dinner and wanted all of us to sit together and be a happy family and watch the Times Square Rocking Eve Show. However, he came home, drunk as always and refused to eat, talking to my mother with attitude. I got drunk off of some Black Label my mom gave me and while I could register the passive aggressive tone in everybody‚Äôs voice and the slight sadness in my mom‚Äôs demeanor as she realized that my stepfather had gotten drunk and ruined the celebration (again), I could not walk and could not react. They started fighting right in front of me, but I was too drunk to care until my stepfather, in his drunken delirium, demanded to know ‚Äúmy opinion‚Äù in the matter as he thought my mom was merely overreacting. I first asked him ‚ÄúSir, are you sure you want my opinion?‚Äù, my mom told me to hush as she already knew my opinion and thought it would infuriate him even further. Yet, he kept asking and I was way too drunk to lie so I finally said something along the lines of, ‚ÄúLook, the only reason why this marriage is still a thing is because this woman still loves you. I however have lost all faith and confidence in you and I have advised my mother on various instances that the best option would be to throw you out the house and be done with it. You have a problem and you refuse to solve it. I love my mother above all things and you keep making ny mother cry‚Äù.  He froze as that was not the answer he expected. Then he approached me and told me that he appreciated my opinion as a man and that he wanted to talk to me tomorrow about the issue but that I should stop being a ‚Äúlittle bitch‚Äù. My mom got mad that he called me a little bitch and then she ordered me to go to sleep and stopped talking. I paced around the bathroom drunkingly, barely able to walk, and managed to take a shower. Now I‚Äôm a bit sobered up and I‚Äôm so confused as to what happened. I love my stepdad, he‚Äôs a genuinely good man and the closest thing I‚Äôve ever had to an actual dad. But he is also an alcoholic and we cannot go out anywhere nor be a family because we all fear he‚Äôll be a drunken embarrassment in public.

272,"I've been waiting for each day to pass recently. I don't look forward to anything and I have no motivation. It's not like I don't have stuff to do. I was worried this would happen so I registered for a winter course, planned a bunch of meetings with friends, am learning a new language, and indulge in my hobbies. So, it's not like I don't have anything to do it's just I feel like I have nothing to look forward to. I end of sleeping half the day, complete my tasks when I'm up and then just count the hours until I sleep again. Even when I'm out with friends I don't seem to enjoy it too much. I laugh and converse because it would be rude to sulk around but I just want to enjoy my time instead of waiting for it to pass by.",01Jan2020,1

I have nobody that I can truly call a close friend. I have never once had another person call me or text me just to see how I'm doing. I have nobody to rely on other than my parents.

I'm planning to move out in the next few years, and I'm terrified. Everything I do in my time is either work or a solo hobby. I go days without leaving the house unless forced to, or for classes. I have nowhere to even go. Nobody to meet. I'm not even an introvert; I get along well with others and I don't have any form of social anxiety. I just don't ever seem to stick with people.

278,"Loaded question, but that is it.
Basically, I don‚Äôt always get along with my mom (and no one does), but part of it is because I grew up sometimes seeing my father and they had this really nasty custody battle that had to do with him basically not treating me right; long story short, and details aside, she got full custody. But the meantime was really difficult on us in addition to her getting in a car accident and going through surgery upon surgery as well as my (biological) sibling having a severe mental illness that manifested and revealed itself over time. I‚Äôm 20F from the US. So yeah, when we disagree, I tend to feel like she doesn‚Äôt listen to me or overlooks my feelings. She will always feel like I‚Äôm trying to win the conversation.
She met a man at some point‚Äînot really sure when they started dating‚Äîaround two years ago. She wanted to bring him overseas to my college and after telling me that he existed wanted to bring him along, but I had been lonely and isolated and just wanted to see her. I was actually offended she didn‚Äôt want to wait one week to introduce him to me (when I would be back home) and didn‚Äôt want to see me after so long of not seeing each other. She had already had him book tickets. First world problem, I know‚Äîor really I don‚Äôt; is either one of us unreasonable?
The last two years has been filled with my childhood dog dying right as I got back to my home (and having her suffocate me with his presence right after having met him), her complaining to me about their relationship, her worry about getting cancer (she doesn‚Äôt thankfully), her worry about having nerve damage from the car accident (she does), being denied disability insurance, so much more. My sibling hasn‚Äôt been doing well because of their condition and has truly taken a toll. In many ways. These have usually been the points of conversation.
Last summer (2019), they were getting married. The day before the wedding, a friend of mine was admitted to the hospital for trying to attempt suicide. I made the decision‚Äîwhether it was wrong or right‚Äîto not go to the wedding and support my friend since they felt they couldn‚Äôt tell anyone else and have a similar condition to my sibling. Originally, my mom understood because we have been in a similar place. Then, all of a sudden, she wasn‚Äôt ok with it. Later on, I learned it‚Äôs because her new husband felt it was a slight because I didn‚Äôt support their marriage.
They moved in together this fall, into his house. Again, many complaints and he has been yelling (at everyone and in general) for all of my winter break, yelling about installing a fan (and not accepting any woman‚Äôs help) for literally two days, yelling at my mom for the kitchen being disorganized, yelling, yelling, yelling. Twice he yelled at me. With having developed depression this semester, this made me mad at him, but also took me from a mostly bad place to a very, very bad place. I haven‚Äôt been happy.
Now, it‚Äôs New Years and I‚Äôm out of the US again. We were visiting his family and I slept an extra hour and told my mom to go to New Years celebration (long story) without me, I would come later. They came into my room yelling at me, and he said I couldn‚Äôt go to this event or any following ones because I always call attention to myself by looking sad and only thinking I‚Äôm important, which then ‚Äúfucks it up for everyone else‚Äù. I went later anyways since I knew my mom wanted me to. No idea how they‚Äôre taking that. I think he‚Äôll want me to move out based on how he basically forced my brother out a week ago for my mom expressing difficulties with his mental health. Long story, no good explanation.

TLDR: mom‚Äôs husband doesn‚Äôt like me and thinks I‚Äôm calling attention to myself by looking sad (even though he knows I‚Äôm depressed) and this ‚Äúfucking it up for everyone else.‚Äù He yells a lot and just doesn‚Äôt like me. I still have 1.5 years left of college.",01Jan2020,1

On the other hand, it feels weird because all this other crap has occurred before that I haven't ever discussed with him, and that I haven't fully dealt with myself. All of this becomes brushed under the rug. On one hand, I really want to share things with him, as I do with other family members. Like talking about where I went and how work was today.

I am really hoping this dosent get buried but here goes- 
I was hit by a bus two years ago, extremely lucky to have had little to no lasting injuries, the accident was entirely the bus drivers fault (I won‚Äôt get into it nor do I have any bad blood against the man who hit me) 

However, I was given a quite hefty cash payout for an 18 year old, I had no job, was on an extremely destructive path, (heavy, heavy drug abuse, extremely heavy drinking issues, I spent all of my money, ($40,000 I know it‚Äôs not the most money in the world but it is a significant figure) , I bought watches, I bought expensive shoes, all of these little things that just added up to insane amounts, spent thousands of dollars on hotel rooms for parties, one night I spend $4,500 on a single night stay in a penthouse in Brisbane, Australia. 
Now, I have fixed my ways, living an extremely healthy lifestyle, no drugs, no alcohol, no cigarettes. I have a job that I get paid decent for my age, ($45,000, again not the biggest figure but still) 

But I am struggling to come to terms with the fact I spent all of my savings, my girlfriend of 1 year wants to go to Europe this summer and I don‚Äôt have the heart to tell her I can‚Äôt afford it. I haven‚Äôt told anyone my issue and I am so scared of what people will think about me. 
I am extremely depressed and extremely unhappy with myself, I‚Äôm not Suicidal however the thought is something I can‚Äôt get out of the back of my mind.

I'm a 19 year old dude, and the level of emotions I was experiencing was unlike anything ever before. Whenever I told some members of my family, they just said I need to stop being so negative, fix my attitude and read my Bible - never in my whole life have I felt that advice was so useless.

I went up to them in the living room and screamed ""Please just help me"" while being in tears all the way - the answer was a cold ""you should pray"". Honestly, yesterday I understood why people commit suicide. I went to my room, crying, and no one came to check up on me. Is this what a family should do? 

Later they told me they didn't want to enable me to be so sensitive, which I find to be complete bullshit. I'm pretty sure that I might be a highly sensitive person, and I didn't think a family could be so negligent of one's emotions.

I couldn't escape. My mom banned me from using the car to get some air. I felt hopeless and alone. This morning everyone acts as if nothings happened. I have never been like this before, and it baffles me how little it seems they care.

I had plans to meet up with a girl at 12 so I made to leave at 11 20. I tried to make it down to her but couldn't get through the traffic so I turned around and went back to the party. I got there at like 11 45 and yelled up (I dont have a sim card.) Someone saw me immediately and I asked for him to come let me in. I over heard him asking the host what the gates code was, so at least 2 people knew I was there. Then 5 minutes passed and I yelled up again, then 10 minutes passed and I yelled up again, then they had the countdown and I cracked a beer and sat down on the sidewalk, eventually just going home. It was super humiliating but I really dont understand why they excluded me, i had good what I thought were good interactions with everyone  when I was there earlier, and they're all less then 2 week old acquaintances so I can't see anyone knowing me enough to hate me yet. 

I had a similar experience with another expat group that I had spent some time with, where they created another group chat so nobody had to remove me.

My girlfriend recently told me she smokes weed, and will drink on occasion. (Neither in any large excess as far as I know) also, I don't think she does it when she's alone, or I havent heard about her doing it.

With drugs (marajuana), there is a good chance that you are permanently altering your body for the worse, even if they are safer than cigarettes. I do not see why you would do bad things like this to your body while paying for it, and only for a relatively short term ""happiness"". Also, it just smells really bad, I dont want to deal with that, there are better ways to be happy without smelling terribly and endangering your freedom by taking an illegal risk.

With alcohol, it is relatively safe as a substance, but can be overused, especially by minors who are still developing their minds and bodies. Also, any sort of good tasting liqueur or alcoholic beverage can cost you large amounts of money, there is a reason people avoid alcoholic partners, they spend all the family's money on booze and false happiness.

My question is really, what can I do, I should probably talk to her, but should I stand unmoving in my views, should I try to stop her, or should I just deal with it and let her smoke and drink.

So long story short. My gf recently broke up with me and that was kinda sad but yeah after that another good female friend of mine asked me if I wanted to come over. I did go over and we talked for a while and also talked a bit it in her bed as we were laying next to eachother. After that she put her arms around me and wanted to cuddle a bit. I agreed cause I could use some homan contact. A bit of time passed and we changed in that spooning cuddle position and of course I got an awkward boner during that time (I find her quite attractive) and decided to pull my hips a bit away from her ass so she does not feel it. She on the other hand put her ass further back aswell so she was clearly feeling my boner pressing against her ass and she even wiggled her butt angainst it from time to time.

So I'm a bit inexperienced in things like this cause I'm 18 right now and was 15 when I started the relationship with my exgirlflriend. 

So here I ask. Does this mean she wants sex or do some girls just enjoy a boner on their ass. I hope somebody can help me.

317,"TLDR: i dislike religion but want to go to church to be around nice people and participate in events but I‚Äôm afraid that doing so would be disrespectful. ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî 
Sorry for posting on mobile. ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
Sorry if this is a lame problem but I‚Äôm a pretty lonely person and I grew up going to church with my mom because she was very religious, and I just wanted to be around people. I eventually stopped going sometime mid-high school because I became lazy and also because I was a closeted member of the LGBT community and had been present for too many comments by other fellow church goers to feel comfortable there anymore.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
Now it‚Äôs many years later and I found myself alone for Christmas for the first time. I know churches have Christmas service and my mom recommended a church she thought I‚Äôd like. I went and it was really awesome. There was a gay pride flag flying outside the church, and another one hanging inside right up on the front wall somewhat near the altar. The pastor would on purposely address members of the LGBT community in a way that was inclusive and full of understanding and love. My biggest memories of church were always of feeling uncomfortable and unsafe due to my sexuality, and this was the first time I felt accepted in a religious setting. I nearly cried the whole time. ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
I‚Äôm a lonely person. I‚Äôm a socially awkward person. A big part of me wants to attend this church so I can make friends with people who like that sense of community and so I can continue to be in a place where I feel loved and accepted. ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
But I have a moral dilemma. I‚Äôm an optimistic nihilist. I‚Äôm not even remotely agnostic and my current ‚Äúspiritual‚Äù views have lead me to be a happier person than I was before so I‚Äôm very comfortable with the way I think. In fact, I very strongly dislike the idea of a universal morality. I find religions that use this concept to be suffocating for me, a darkness rather than a light, especially when not following that moral code leads to eternal punishment. Plus some other opinions I have on religion. I really don‚Äôt think even feeling accepted will make me a convert and I feel like it‚Äôd be wrong to put myself in a religious place and try to be a part of their community if I feel negatively about their religion. I still respect that it‚Äôs a big and important part of their lives. I‚Äôd never treat religious people rudely for their religion, and I feel strongly that suggesting to a religious person that their religion is wrong is a taboo, but attending church feels like I‚Äôm lying to everyone and manipulating them. Like I‚Äôm treating their religion as if it were a game. My mom already thinks I‚Äôm on some borderline to convert to Christianity and has a lot of high hopes for me. She would be super annoyed at best if she learned how I really felt.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
I know the church, or at least most of them, would welcome me even if I said I wasn‚Äôt Christian and still attended bc they‚Äôd see me as prime convert material. I don‚Äôt really want to be seen that way though. I just want to be amicable with them and their culture and them the same to me. I just want to be around people in a nice setting. I live in an area away from cities so churches are the only real ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù thing there is.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

321,So my boyfriend and I have had a lot of issues over the last year and a half. Its too much to go into but I have a question for somewhat of an isolated incident. So last New Year‚Äôs Eve (2018) it was agreed upon between the both of us that we would just stay home. Well last minute he got guilted into going to a party that his friend were at. We parted ways at around 11:40 and I went to my place and he went to the party. Didn‚Äôt hear from him again that night. The next morning I went to his house to check on him and found him in his bed with another woman (We had been dating 7 months and were exchanging ‚ÄúI love yous‚Äù). We worked through that and the next New Years eve (2019) he wanted to make sure we did what I wanted to do. I had a tough time deciding (indecisive) but we ended up at a bar with some of his friends. SO. A guy I went to college with (we have no history other than somewhat friends) asked if I still lived in the area and what I was doing that night. I said I was at a bar with my boyfriend and his friends and he‚Äôs welcome if he wants. So he showed up. We talked for about 20 minutes before a girl I went I college with also came to hang out. I hadn‚Äôt seen these people in years. It was good go to catch up. So on the way back home (with our friend in the car) my boyfriend decides to ask why I felt the need to flirt with the guy from college even though the entire time we we‚Äôre talking I was rubbing my boyfriends leg and back and made it clear we were together. I got pissed that he had the audacity to ask me that after what happened the year prior and now we‚Äôre in a huge fight. Another new years ruined. Was I wrong? Or am I crazy to still be giving this guy a chance?,01Jan2020,1

But lately its like a switch flipped she won't even say hi i tried talking to her about it but she just ignores me or tells me she is busy i don't mind the not going places i can understand not having time but even when we close the store together the best i get is yelled at on how to do my job or an angry glare. Its heart breaking as I've tried soo hard to be a good friend and be there for her any time she asked. Admittedly i have abandonment issues and she is my only real friend but now she doesn't even treat me like a person. Its been 2-3 weeks of this and I've degraded myself to crying to sleep as pathetic as it is i just want my best friend back or at least to know why she gave up on me so i dont lose more people like this.

With other friends, I can say no easily, but with her, I hate seeing that slightly disappointed look on her face...like when she asks to hang out, go to a party, or smoke weed, drink etc.

Another thing -- I'm vegan, and I feel tense talking about it with her or food in general 'cause she doesn't agree with it. She says she supports me, but I can tell she looks down on it (she'd never tell me that directly tho), so I avoid discussing it with her. But with other people, I don't mind talking about it at all.

She's not manipulative or abusive; she's actually very, very nice but she does have a strong personality and she's super extroverted. She's that ""wild"" friend that's experimented with a few drugs, gets super drunk at parties, dyes her hair ""crazy"" colours, etc. She's the opposite of me -- I'm introverted and meek. I don't like to party but I attend them anyway 'cause I don't want to seem ""lame"" to her. She pressures me to do things I don't wanna do, even though she doesn't know she's doing it.

He simply doesn‚Äôt understand the concept of consequence and just lacks common sense. If my parents try to take away his phone, playstation, TV, he would take the wifi cord so no one else could go on the internet.

He‚Äôs skipped the past 3 weeks of school and has now failed all his classes due to his absences. A few months ago, my dad disallowed him from going over his friend‚Äôs house because his uncle is a registered sex offender and accordingly slammed his body through our glass front door while calling my dad a racist.

I‚Äôve decided that relationships aren‚Äôt for me, but I can‚Äôt stand the idea of living without her. I‚Äôve thought about maybe seeing a therapist but I have no idea if a therapist can help with this kind of thing. I have very serious trust issues, and it‚Äôs not just with her, it would be with any girl. I‚Äôm always constantly thinking that if we‚Äôre not talking, she‚Äôs probably out flirting with other guys, or fucking around with other guys. I‚Äôve noticed that I don‚Äôt want to be around other people, or
talk to my friends unless she‚Äôs in a call with me. If we‚Äôre not in a call and there‚Äôs people over, I tend to be very quiet, and don‚Äôt really care what they‚Äôre saying because I‚Äôm only thinking about her.

However I‚Äôve recently found out that during the time we didn‚Äôt talk she did so many things with other guys, such as doing things in calls with other people, and apparently she called a lot of guys daddy and such, And other sexual things she‚Äôs done with guys. and I know it shouldn‚Äôt bother me but it‚Äôs been driving me mad lately thinking about it. I wish I was different, any normal person could brush something like that off but I just can‚Äôt. It loops in my head on repeat, and if we‚Äôre in a call I‚Äôll just end up going silent, and not really talking or even paying attention to her cuz I‚Äôm too busy getting myself upset over it. She told me that those times don‚Äôt mean anything to her, and that she doesn‚Äôt do any of that anymore. This information is important. Fast forward to today, here I am on New Years. Me and her talked in a call but I was with friends and so was she, and she was drinking, and when she drinks her filter kind of goes away, now everything she says is a joke but once again, me being the person I am I start to get upset when she says some things. Her and her friends started playing this card game, which just so happens to be the game where I learned about all this stuff she‚Äôs done with other guys. (It‚Äôs like truth or dare but very sexual and such). And so I left because I didn‚Äôt wanna be in a call while they were playing. I do not want to know any more information because I‚Äôm gonna go insane thinking about more things that she did. She said she‚Äôd call me back when she finished playing the game cuz she wants to talk to me but I found out that she finished the game but never called me back, and when I said something she told me she was going to bed. Honestly, that‚Äôs fair, that‚Äôs fine. She‚Äôs been drinking, it‚Äôs 3am, she probably just really wants to sleep. BUT WHY DO I GET SO UPSET OVER THAT. I‚Äôve been avoiding my friends and sitting in another room crying because I wanted to talk to her so much.

They weren't technically screwing but they were heading there.



My mom told me to get my brother for dinner. I opened his door and saw him with his girlfriend (who we had no idea was even here in the house) under. They were basically humping while he had his shirt on. My brother begged me to keep quiet and not say anything. I had countless times where I brought a guy over (never did anything this bad though) and he always helped me hide him when I got caught. That's why I feel bad for ratting him out. I said no and instantly told my mom and dad. They were really mad and kicked his girlfriend out (which I also feel bad about because she has been a total sweetheart to everyone). Now he cant leave his door closed and they took away his laptop. He wont talk to me anymore and keeps calling me a hypocrite. I know I am okay with responsibility and everything as a daughter but I don't know if I am in the right as a sister too?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------


This happened a few days ago. I know what I did was wrong and not okay. My brother is a mellow guy and when we have issues like this, it passes and everything is okay again but now his girlfriend is involved and I am getting worried. She is a really nice and very understanding, I know she'll forgive me without a second thought. Here's the problem:



My brother is a gifted student (As in Diff classes) but his girlfriend doesnt do so well (Ds and even Fs in diff and regular classes. My dad think she is a troubled teen). My brother gets stressed about this fact about her and tries to help her out when he can. They had plans to study and get her a head start during winter break but she doesn't want to come over at all anymore. My parents love her and are willing to let her visit my brother (only stay in the living room though) but not let him go over to her house instead. My brother has been extra salty and even screamed at me for this. He keeps telling me how I ruined everything and should have kept quiet. This is new from him. He told them my mom how she is too scared to come over which I am sure hurts my mom. His girlfriend is introverted and guarded, she was just starting to warm up and be open so this setback sucks for everyone. My brother and I were really close and now he doesnt even want to look at me anymore.

343,"Hey,

So I (22/F) live on campus right now. I have a good job on campus and am living the typical uni student life with 2 other roommates in a tiny room. I am paying so much for rent. 80% of my aid goes towards housing, up to $1600 a month. I am in $7000 debt in my credit cards. Why? Because I have lived off credit for the past 2 years because I was not eligible for school aid and still had rent and bills. My parents live about an hour away (60 miles/95 kilometers). I can live there and not pay rent, just gas for transportation up, twice a week for my classes. The money I save will go 100% towards my credit, where I could start my new life with my degree with no credit debt (I'll then have to pay school loans). I am afraid I will regret it for some reason. Or that I am not making the right decision for choosing to be less involved in my school and not prioritizing rent/a place to live. My parents are worried about the commute, like most parents, nervous about me driving far and saying that it would be tiresome and dangerous. But ... it's worth it. Right? Or should I just keep focused 100% uni on-campus life and deal with this later? My credit card debt has taken away my peace of mind. And where I live, credit is everything. 

Is my plan reasonable? It seems to me but everyone around me is making me doubt myself.

My dad has anger problems, and my mom always talked about getting her own apartment. 

but now that it‚Äôs actually happening, there‚Äôs a lot that‚Äôs sinking in as i‚Äôm alone. After she broke the news she said, ‚Äúwe‚Äôll move out, but somewhere close so that you can graduate at the same school you started.‚Äù I really thought that was a given.

349," He is 17, (not)preparing for his university exams. My mom and him constantly arguing loudly, i hate that. He is like, whenever you say something correctional(like ''Its 3 am, when are you going to sleep?'') or something about his future, he takes this unnecessary aggressive stance, starts yelling, wreaks total havoc in the house. You either have to talk positively with him all the time, or its WW 3 in our house, everyday.

I am someone with social anxiety, and honestly dont know how this family stuff works(not having a proper one to begin with might be the issue), even with that i tried to ''bond'' with him i guess, over something we both love. *Then* tried correcting him about stuff that he does which makes me like him less, he answered back with the same aggressive stance. I dont know what to do. I know that he has some sort of simmering artistic bit inside, i kind of not want him to waste that. But if he keep being like this, im afraid its gonna be too late for that as well.

He has friends, and really good and calm with them, so i guess he just hates us for some reason? I dont know really. Any way to revert this? I read in the Jordan Peterson's 12 Rule for life book, which explains that, this kind of behaviour, similar to little babies crying for attention, is nothing but an amateurish act of social defense, and he says something along the line; ''You just have to push through till the end, no matter how loud, chaotic it gets. You will think that what you are doing is harsh, but so does leaving him/her stay like this just because you got scared of disturbing your neighboors with your loud arguing and cause him/her to struggle in his/her social give&amp;takes in the future.''.

351,"Looking back on this decade, it presents itself as 10 years of failure. My awareness of this isn‚Äôt some sort of imminent revelation; I‚Äôve felt this deeply for years; and felt it particularly acutely this year. I don‚Äôt know how to move forward. It feels too late to be honest. I‚Äôm unemployed right now, and what I should do next is completely opaque to me. The shame and sense of loss and missing out on life and recognition that I‚Äôve missed out on spending my 20‚Äôs and 30‚Äôs as someone in control of their life and discovering themselves as they engage with the world is crippling and insurmountable. I feel a sense of despair that is all-encompassing and it seems genuinely impossible that I would ever be able to overcome this. And if I‚Äôm unable to overcome this, I‚Äôm unable to enjoy the present or look forward to the future. And if I‚Äôm unable to enjoy the present or look forward to the future, that doesn‚Äôt leave a lot of options going forward. I just want to escape the feelings of disappointment, shame, and sense of loss.

So I thought I would at least ask this question here. I‚Äôm undecided whether there is a viable path forward or if perhaps this experiment that is my existence should be drawn to a close. The thing is, there is still so much I want to see and do and experience, and I can feel things like happiness in petting a cat or seeing a good movie or reading a beautiful passage in a book. But this overwhelming sense of shame and self-worthlessness and self-hatred and feeling that my worthless work history and shit resume and period of unemployment will lead to more of the same - all this destroys any sense of hope I might feel that I could possibly turn my life around.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So, in 2017 I got into K-Pop. I loved the music, and it was a great alternative to the American and English music industries which were going downhill (and have plummted further since in my opinion). However, maybe it was too good of an alternative...

I started off with a group which I instantly got hooked on and still love them to this day (only listen to their old releases though, will get to why in a minute), and I'll admit, they helped me and still do to this day with my mental health. Then I expanded my horizon to tons of K-Pop groups and I liked them, although I was just a casual fan of them.

But the problem with asian culture is that their beauty standards are quite high and, well, they are especially pushy about celebrities completing horrible diets to lose necessary weight. I had always been raised to be against this type of stuff when I was little because two of my aunties did it too (one of them has stopped thankfully), and so when it started spreading especially in July 2017 it affected my mental health. See, the thing is, I'm quite sensitive to people suffering, and it really hurts when I can't do anything about it, especially when, with my favourite group, it was people that I loved.

So, with my favourite group I stopped listening to their new releases and stuck to their old ones to prove that I'll only support healthy idols. Meanwhile, with the other groups, I continued listening to their songs since it didn't affect me as much until around May 2018 when I stopped listening to other K-Pop groups completley. I decided to give them all up because I was scared because with people with issues you don't know how long it'll last, and with people who haven't had any issues yet in K-Pop it just seems like a ticking time bomb until either the company forces them to do it or until one of them becomes so insecure thanks to parental pressure and idiots online that they diet by their own will. I also tried to give up my favourite group in July 2018, but couldn't do it and finally gave up trying May last year.

Now, I've had cravings about getting back into other K-Pop groups since the moment I gave them up (heck, I kept on delaying the date at first), but I kept on telling myself that it's the right thing to do and that ""cmon, 2019, first year since 2016 without any other K-Pop groups"", and that kept me going. But now in 2020, I just don't have that motivation for some reason.

I was thinking of getting back into K-Pop groups who aren't dieting. Even if the ticking time bomb of diets goes off, I haven't gotten attached to anyone like my favourite group, so it thankfully won't affect me too much and I can just leave their new releases be until they're all healthy again. But, at the same time, I'm worried about how I'll spend my time. I used to spend hours on end listening to K-Pop, but then I was able to do a whole lot more once I gave it up. What if I go back down that road again?

I tried asking my family, and they all said to just do what I want, that it's my life and if I want to listen to them I should, but I feel like they're just supporting whatever I think. After all, they did support me giving up both K-Pop in general and my favourite group, then supported me accepting I love said group, and then now support me on this. I don't know what to do so I turned to random strangers for help online.

Should I listen to K-Pop again? Why/why not? If so should I control how much I listen to them or just let my cravings be like my family thinks? Thanks in advance, also sorry for the long post.",01Jan2020,1

367,"So my (24f) friend (23f) has been seeing this guy for just over 6 months. I got a kind of weird feeling about him for some reason, he seemed a little intense but didn't want to think much of it and he had flipped at her over things which really didn't warrant it and would block her sometimes. Recently over the course of a week he had showed up to her workplace shouting at her and sent messages saying that she was a liar and other horrible things about her behaviour. Then one day I received messages from her in the early hours  saying that he was threatening to kill himself or threatening to go round to hers if she didn't answer the phone to him which went on for days. I kept on telling her that it wasn't her issue to sort out for him and he needed professional help (trying to be constructive about the situation). 

There's also another dimension to this. Whenever I'm with her we usually end up making out and one time she said she'd date me during a conversation which she sounded quite serious about, but she didn't recall this because later on we got quite drunk. I haven't fully addressed this with her but I think deep down I'm a bit confused over how I feel about her. 

She had made it clear that it was over with this guy, but then I saw a photo of the two of them on social media when I was drunk. I won't lie I burst into tears and went on a downward spiral feeling like I had been used and ignored. 

I fully realise that it's none of my business to interfere with her dating life, but I'm not sure how to come across that I'm both hurt and concerned about this whole situation. I don't know whether to address my own feelings too, but most of this is coming from genuine concern over a friend and I don't really want to hear about him again.",01Jan2020,1
368,"I dated Greg for a year back in 2016, broke up and found ourselves back together in 2018. 

I thought everything was going good the second time until about 5 months into our relationship, I found out he was in a whole other relationship with another person. When I found out, I was mostly upset with myself because I should have saw it coming, I mean, there were ginormous signs that I just ignored. 

*A week before I found out,  I had taken one pregnancy test that came out positive. *

We broke up, two days later I went to his house to drop his stuff off, and pick up my house key. I also mentioned to him that I might be pregnant and that I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd want to keep the baby. He immediately got excited and started saying things that at first made me upset but then made me feel excited. I told him (even through the excitement) that we are in no position, mentally,emotionally, and financially, to become parents. But he kept saying that it‚Äôs our baby and that we should make it work, he‚Äôll marry me and all that. It was very overwhelming and confusing for me, since all of that extra stuff happened and I didn‚Äôt know what to do. Ended up finding out that It was a false pregnancy and he still wouldn‚Äôt let up about giving him another shot. I was head over heels with this guy so it wasn‚Äôt easy for me to just leave.  We ended up trying it out and within three months got engaged. Set a wedding date and everything. But within those three months, up until today, it has been very bipolar. We‚Äôll have amazing moments, terrible moments. We have trust issues, he made me give up my friends, He doesn‚Äôt go out with his friends anymore because of me, he stopped going to the gym, I stopped doing my make up or anything that made me feel good about myself. I can see very well that it is a toxic relationship and I‚Äôve tried so hard to break up with him because I love him and I don‚Äôt want him to be unhappy and I don‚Äôt want to hurt him anymore either. I tell him every little thing that I do or he does that isn‚Äôt healthy for us and he refuses to let me go. He‚Äôll cry and freak out and hyperventilate and it makes me feel bad so I just hold him and tell him I won‚Äôt go anywhere. Tonight he got drunk and told me how he lost himself and he doesn‚Äôt know who he is and that he‚Äôs fat and he doesn‚Äôt take care of himself anymore. I told him that we‚Äôd find a solution together and that I‚Äôd help him get back in gear but I know he let himself go because of me. I know I‚Äôm way too clingy and I want all of his time 24/7. So the only thing I see is just breaking up and hoping that he can find himself again and find someone who can make him happy and be healthier for him. I explain to him that we aren‚Äôt mentally or emotionally prepared to get married and that we never gave ourselves time to heal properly after the whole breakup and baby. But he insists that he‚Äôs ready. One time it got so bad that he began to hit himself and he almost picked up a knife. 

I have no idea what to do. I want to leave the relationship for the sake of our mental health. But he doesn‚Äôt understand that. So every time I try to walk away, I can‚Äôt. I know I‚Äôm not innocent, I know I‚Äôm toxic too. It‚Äôs why I want to walk away before I hurt him anymore. But I‚Äôm scared he‚Äôll hurt himself.",01Jan2020,1

373,"I'm in my mid 20's and ever since I can remember myself, I can't really relate nor feel exceptionally bad for sick/ ill people. I think of it as ""whatever"". 

For example, my mom got  cancer when I was a teenager and even though I hated that she suffered and seeing her so sick, I wasn't the type of person to go and sit next to her and caress her hand and tell her everything is going to be ok. I just closed myself off and avoided spending time with her, consoling her or taking care of her. Luckily, she survived and is well now. I think I remember some relatives of mine even pointing out how ""distant"" I was at that time. 

Another example is when my mom or dad or sibling or another relative gets sick (with the flu or  something like that), I exhibit the same behavior. I stay away and I don't feel that bad for them because I know it will go away soon. 

I'm the complete opposite of my mom who gets extremely sad, worried and melancholic when someone who she cares about gets sick. 

I'm not sure if this matters but I grew up with parents who weren't very affectionate with me. Some times it's awkward even when we hug during birthdays, events etc.  We never say I love you either.

376,"My cat is very ill and I don‚Äôt know whether to euthanise him.

My cat Richie is very ill. He has kidney damage of unknown origin (probably long standing but with no acute symptoms until suddenly). We have taken him to the vet and specialists and without an IV drip and surgery the prognosis is very bad.  He also has a hernia involving his bladder which is likely related (or the cause). He doesn‚Äôt appear in pain, just likely feeling a general malaise. 

Treatment may work, but it will be a long, uncomfortable road for him with an uncertain outcome - surgery is a chance but it‚Äôs a 50/50 chance at best. 

The IV is $1000 per day  (7-10 days required) and the surgery $3000 to $5000. Pet insurance might cover $2.6k. This total cost of this will be a significant struggle for my family. 

We have to decide whether or not to euthanise him this week, balancing out his quality of life and the cost.

381,"hi. I've never done drugs except cannabis very rarely. Last night I drank and there was someone passing around a joint and i had some, i guess to celebrate the new year and all. Unfortunately I completely forgot I had a drug test in 2 days for a job (live in Canada, so it's legal, but it's Air Canada which prohibits usage even off-work in some positions). I really don't plan on taking cannabis anytime soon but I think I ruined my chances by doing this. How long does cannabis last in your system? Should I even show up? If I do, should I just be honest?

I finished studying in the US came home for the winter break. My original  plan was to go back before on a visitor visa and pack my stuff then leave for good. 

The problem is I totally forgot that my country has a militry draft for people who finish college.  Its 2 years and I got drafted(its random)... I can ask my friends to pack my stuff for me and my sponsor said they will ship it buuuut me and my gf have an open box filled with sex toys next to the bed. I am not sure if I should ask them to pack it or extend my rent for 2 year (ridiculous) until I can come back to get it.

Most of my friends have packed and left. Only 2 are left. A dude and a girl. I am closer to the guy by my gf barely knows him and feels super awkward asking either to go.... any advice?

I can't travel back because my student visa expired and applying for a visitor visa takes ~3weeks. After a week I will be locked in until I finish my training and my gf is from the counties trump banned from the US :)",01Jan2020,1
383,"Around 13 weeks ago I told my mom that I needed help with my social anxiety because I was  getting into severe depression which I have had throughout my childhood but never quite as badly as these last few months. 

Since then I have had 3 appointments being referred from one service to the next and have been on a waiting list since mid october so around 10 weeks after they told me that they try to see you within 6 weeks and have not hear anything in all that time.

The impression i got is that if you're not suicidal, you don't get help but I'm increasingly struggling with daily tasks and sleep and have no one to talk to about it. 

Also, since speaking out they told everyone at school so i am even more self conscious and anxious than before. In short, asking for help is the worst thing I could have done, the only thing that keeps me sane is my addictions, which my parents have gone back to complaining about. After i spoke out, my mom didn't know how to help but was more understanding but that's all stopped now.

I don't really know what to do about getting help now because apparently private care is very expensive and i can't afford it. I am feeling very alone at the moment which is amplified by my isolation.",01Jan2020,1

390,"As a kid, I never really had much friends. In high school I had some, but after I had a ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù curse me out and backstab me junior year, I haven‚Äôt had much friends since. I‚Äôm now in college with about two not-so-close friends who both attend schools far away that I don‚Äôt talk to often. I don‚Äôt have any friends as a freshman at a community college, anyone nearby, or close friends. I also consider myself a tad boring - I like reading, writing, and don‚Äôt really party. I am an introvert and I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs necessary to mention this, but only had one small relationship back in high school. 

The issue is, I don‚Äôt have a problem not having any friends- I think. I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm in denial or I really don‚Äôt. Without friends, I can just focus on my studies (I don‚Äôt do well studying with people) and I can spend quality time with my mom (I live at home). I kind of like it, the single life alone. It helps me think and it‚Äôs quiet. It‚Äôs nice.

I haven‚Äôt really expressed any concern until recently, when I realize everyone in my family has a more active social life than me and the last few times I asked my mom to do something with me, she‚Äôs said no. My grandfather went on a trip with friends, my brother almost always go out, my mom and dad is often out with friends, etc. I‚Äôve also noticed the longer I don‚Äôt talk to people outside my family, I have a hard time talking to people ( like stuttering, repeating words, being unnecessarily self-conscious, not being able to make conversation). When I feel lonely and need someone to talk that‚Äôs not my parent, I don‚Äôt have anyone to talk to- I usually just end up writing and self reflect to myself, which usually helps. 

    As I‚Äôm browse through social media and binge watch t.v. shows, I‚Äôve noticed there‚Äôs secretly a part of me that do long for friends. Like, a big group of friends where I can travel the world, sit around campfires with, do the New Year‚Äôs countdown, or at least have someone to talk/hang with. I think there‚Äôs more to life that I should experience at this age. I don‚Äôt want to not have any friends when I‚Äôm older or remember my youth as uneventful. I think I crave for adventure and a little thrill- I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve possibly lived life when I haven‚Äôt done anything. Starting the new year, I want to improve a bit of myself in this aspect. I‚Äôm just not sure how to do it though because I don‚Äôt have many opportunities to meet people. The community college I attend to doesn‚Äôt have many people my age (most people are 25+ and I‚Äôm 18) and I managed to get into harder classes which makes it all the more difficult meeting people similar to my age. There isn‚Äôt any clubs and I live at home, so I kind of see community college not an option (I‚Äôm also not transferring for a good while because I‚Äôm in a special program for my major that prolongs my stay). I don‚Äôt have any connections with friends from high school (save for the two) and I rarely see them (busy with college). What do I have to do, change, think about, etc.? I apologize if this all seems pathetic but I‚Äôd appreciate any advice. Thank you.",01Jan2020,1

394,"(F 19) Just some background info, I've been struggling to find the point of everything for ages, I suffer from really low moods sometimes, some might call it depression but I've never been diagnosed do idk. I decided to take on the goal of going to university last year, I want to be an author and publish books. I am also single after going through 3 breakups last year (1 of which was my first relationship).

So I spent the new years with a guy from work, let's call him Jimmy, me and Jimmy have went on some dates, and decided to spend the new years together in a hotel, so we did, it was really nice we had a lot of fun, the midnight kiss etc. Thing is, throughout the 2 days I was kinda waiting for a moment to ask Jimmy where he sees this going, but the problem I get is I overthink, and I was overthinking how to say/ask him this. So I ended up not asking, and driving home feeling a bit sick because I'm worried I caught feelings in a situation that could've been avoided.

So I get home, I sit down, and I'm currently just having an existential crisis as I'm having an overthinking spiral. I dont know what Jimmy  is looking for, I'm worried I'm not something he wants, otherwise he would've cleared it up by now, I'm also worried that I find it hard to open up to other people the second they start to get close (whether that's family or not), before then I'm totally fine. And I'm also just looking at my uni work, feeling overwhelmed, I mean c'mon what even is an author as a career goal, what is the point of that? I have a constant feeling that I'm behind, not good enough, not doing enough, in practically anything I do. I'm questioning my life in general, I just feel so alone, even though there are plenty of people who would be happy to help. Since it is new years it is a time of reflection and redirection but, I'm really struggling to see the point I guess, (not really because of Jimmy, sure a broken heart will hurt but it doesn't make me question my life just putting it out there, it obviously just doesn't help), and it's really hitting me now. I just think it would be much easier, and perhaps better, if I stopped trying at all.

I guess the general question here really is, what do I do, do I keep going? How? How do I find the will to live that has been coming and going for years?

So I recently saw a post and people were quick to judge a person in their late 20s living at home. In my classes at university, I‚Äôve learned that people are beginning to live at home with their parents for a longer period of time and moving out later, and I‚Äôve also seen news articles posted about this. It seems okay to me since it‚Äôs becoming harder to find well paying jobs and homes are expensive in the area (a small 2 bedroom home costs on average $600,000 and a nice house being sold for nearly $2 million in my area). Renting an apartment can range anywhere between $1000-$2500 around my university. Minimum wage is $15/hour if that helps. As someone who has a good job and saving up for a house, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs horrible that late 20s even early 30s are still living with parents.

401,"I'm 29 years old. I've known in my mind for years that something has felt odd but Ive a been ignored by friends, family, and doctor's when I shared my concerns. I've always taken a lot of pride in being not only a good person but an unproblematic one to boot, and so I've busted my ass my entire life to fit in and not make noise. I've always struggled pretending to be and feel normal. I thought it was maybe a phase or a personality trait but no, I'm autistic. That is perhaps why I have crippling anxiety and depression. I've been fighting a disorder I haven't understood or known I had for 3 decades. I'm not fucking crazy, I'm tired...

It took me about 5 whole seconds to come to term with today's results because it's honestly freeing as fuck not having to wonder if I'm just losing my mind or not. 

I plan to and feel the need to be open about this but i have absolutely no idea how to bring this up in my personal life. Like, when the hell and how the hell do I tell my family and friends that ""suddenly"" I'm autistic? Sure most of them won't care, but that doesn't make it any less intimidating. How about my boss? I've fucked myself up mentally by trying to be a personable person  but it's been difficult and not without issue and a lot of people have mistaken my social anxiety and social fuck ups as something far more sinister. While I in no way want to use this as a crutch or an excuse, far from it, I think it's an important part of who I am and for and might help others better understand who I am and why I am that way. 

Is it unreasonable of me to feel relieved to know this and want to tell others? I mean fuck, it's been something I've dealt with forever and I've never got to tell a soul about it, how could I.  I just want advice because I know one of my problems is being a little too overzealous with just about everything and I can already hear/see people's reactions and it makes me want to pre-emptively want to crawl into a hole and say nothing.

409,"Hey everyone,

Just posted this in a sextherapy sub but figured I‚Äôd repost here as well. 

I‚Äôm a 22 year old man who just got engaged and lost my normal scheduled therapy due to graduating college. Figured I‚Äôd turn to Reddit! Additionally, I am a survivor of sexual abuse as a child, and someone deeply struggling with my sexual relationship. The short of it is, I‚Äôm unsure if I should change my fantasies to try and fit my fianc√© / if it‚Äôs abusive to impose my own fetishes upon her.

Quick backstory; was repeatedly sexually abused at 8 by my older brother, hit puberty early at the tail end of age 9, found porn as soon as puberty began, developed a pornography problem in middle and high school, was overly into sex in grade school thus leaving me outcast for some developmental years, and landed in a severely severely abusive HS relationship with a diagnosed sociopath (who transactionally encouraged anything I was into sexually and used the rarity of someone compatible to keep me around). After the break up I had a single year, screwed around a lot, and wound up falling in love with my future wife. 

The issue we‚Äôre having is that I have a lot of kinks and a very high sex drive. Her sex drive doesn‚Äôt match mine, and even though she‚Äôs shown some interest in a great number of my kinks, she‚Äôs begun to draw lines in the sand and it‚Äôs caused me to feel a disconnection sexually. 

I have always felt like a freak, and now the person closest and most accepting is rejecting parts of my biggest insecurity. It‚Äôs tough. And, I have this issue where if I don‚Äôt get what I want in the bedroom I‚Äôm totally unaroused or unsatisfied. It‚Äôs not fair to my partner. I‚Äôm not sure, but it feels like a control thing. Like, if I‚Äôm told no they have obvious control of the situation (they do anyway - it takes consent with 2 to tango) and it completely turns me off. My ex did anything I wanted and it sort of spoiled me, even if our relationship had no emotional depth and was fake. 

I‚Äôm just not sure what to do. I can tell her it‚Äôs important to me and push on the subject, and I know she‚Äôll do what she has to to satisfy me. Of course though, I don‚Äôt want to be abusive and put her in a situation she doesn‚Äôt enjoy and could resent me for. Maybe we‚Äôre not compatible enough sexually? It‚Äôs a lot to take in. I just want to be satisfied and validated by my one partner. For some reason sexually, it feels very ‚Äúmy way or the highway‚Äù and I don‚Äôt know how to manage that.

*the fantasy I‚Äôm stuck on is incest btw. I say this because I feel like it‚Äôs mainstream and commonplace, but it has the risk of messing with family-dynamics. I‚Äôve got a close knit family and despite getting off on the idea of my parents hooking up with her and I, there‚Äôs ZERO reality in it. Outside of masturbating and sex I literally never consider them in a sexual context. I go right back to gross! mode.

He also didn‚Äôt invite me to a wedding where all his friends were invited and were bringing their gf as plus ones.

I'm a girl with a bit of a mustache sadly, it's only visible when you look closely during the winter and only the ends.

420,"Hello, first post ever actually. After getting a temp job from a staffing agency for warehouse work(14.25/HR, full time) I got a second job, part time(12.20/HR). My temp job just turned permanent, but the shift is changing to a time that would making working the part time impossible unless they magically let me work just 2 days a week. 

The issue being: if I quit the lower paying job, ALL I have is a job that brings in more money. The 2nd job is at Ralphs, and after 6 months they help pay for schooling. There's room to move up. People who work there have stayed a decade plus. The little money it makes me compared to the other would have me struggling financially to the point I wont be able to save much either. Taking the higher paying job though just makes me feel like I'll be a warehouse picker forever with no opportunity to advance. But for some reason I can't make a damn decision. Thanks!",01Jan2020,1

424,"So this is kind of a weird situation. I won't go all the way into it but here's a quick breakdown.

We were co-dependant addicts. I wound up going to prison for 3 years. While I was in, she turned her life around, moved to a new town and got a new man. I really wasn't even mad. We still actually talked until I told her that I'd stop calling cuz it's not fair to her new man. 

I just got out in the beginning of December and she stopped by to see me. Nothing happened, we just got caught up. We talked on the phone and texted for a couple weeks until about 2 weeks ago. She said it hurt too much and talking to me made her miss me too much. She has a really good thing going on in her new town so I get it. I've respected her wishes and stayed away.

Here's where I need advice. While we were using we had a really good friend pass away. He lived on the same street as her and they grew up together. She took it really hard and the anniversary (which is in like 15 days) always hits her pretty bad. She has a history of depression and suicide attempts and this time of the year gets to her. Also there's always the fact that she might go out and use which might kill her too. I just wanted to send a quick text or call just to say ""you got this, everything's gonna be okay"" or something but also don't want to go against her wishes ya know. Plus, I don't want to fuck shit up with her man if they're together when she gets it. Idk. What should I do?

429,"So basically, I have a best friend who I have known for years and our friendship has survived me moving twice, she is now in the same country as me and has been for about a year and a half. We talk about everything but I dont have the courage to ask her about something because I cant tell if i am being reasonable or if I'm being sensitive and should just let it go. 


Basically when she moved here I began seeing one of her close friends who she lived with briefly before finding a new place that suited her more. In this stage of time she was having trouble with her long distance boyfriend and cheated on him with the friend I was seeing (before I met him though). She never told me about this, I learned from multiple other people in the group of friends, including the guy I was seeing. At first I thought she was embarrassed and I didnt say anything because we tell each other everything and I figured she would tell me in her own time. She never did, which was weird because it was relevant to me and everyone else had told me about it. 


 About 3 months ago that person broke it off with me after avoiding me for a few weeks and then texting me that they had already begun to see someone else. This really sucked because the someone else was a girl who had moved into their place and had become close to the group of friends. 


To be clear, I'm upset about the situation because of the lack of respect, consideration, and shitty handling of it. 


ADVICE: they are in a close group of friends, I think my best friend knew about all of this and chose not to tell me. I think this because when I told her what had happened her immediate response was ""you didnt havent feelings though did you?"" And ""this girl just got out of a seven year relationship."" (Which I'm guessing she found out by knowing about the whole thing and not saying anything because she never said anything about it all until he broke it off with me and I told her what happened). And because she never told me about her history with the guy I was seeing the entire time. Recently I saw him at her birthday, I told her I could respect they were friends but I would not be interacting with him. At the end of the night she defended him to me saying he felt bad which I quickly shut down. 


I am asking whether I should just ask if she knew about the other girl and didnt tell me (and potentially why she never told me about their history). I trust her and after this weird situation I feel off and very guarded. I've always been honest with her about everything and have always been clear to her that I expected the same. I want to know because it would determine whether i trusted her in the future and I feel like everytime we hang out that these thoughts are in the back of my head. 


On the other hand, I cant tell if I'm being over sensitive. Maybe I need to let it go and move on? She has recently gome through a bad break up and is currently trying to do better, I dont want to drag up things in the past and I'm worried she will judge me for this. she is close with him and the group and I guess I dont want to be seen as stuck in the past (which maybe I am). 


Thank you in advance for any advice. I cant tell if I'm crazy or not but I dont know if i can fully trust it or even have a conversation without looking irrational if thats what i should do. Feel free to ask any questions for clarification.",01Jan2020,1

432,"I got a new phone around 3 months ago, and I decided that after some down time, it's time to put myself out there again, so I downloaded tinder, set up a nice tinder profile, and the matches started coming in. I'm for europe, but for some reason tinder decided that I'm located in Thailand, and decided to show me only thai girls. I was like sure, whatever, and matched with like 50+ girls there. I didn't really talk with any of them, since most of them didn't know english. A couple of days passed and I'm matched with this thai girl, who studies english, she starts texting me, asking how my day was and so on, we really hit it off. She used to text me after work, asking how my work was and stuff, she seemed really interested in me. Of course to show my interest I replied and asked back and all that. After a couple of weeks of course we start talking about things like exes and relationships, she tells me she never had a boyfriend, thai guys don't find her attractive (she's a solid 8/10 btw)  and how she is very lonely and other very personal things. We used to talk very late into the night, like once we talked until sunrise, talking about our feelings and life experiences. I really felt like we had a connection, she was unique, she was different. Of course I knew that I must keep it a friendship because relationships are not possible at these distances, but I was very fond of her. I used to tell her how she's beautiful and how she's an amazing person all the time to try and boost her self confidence so maybe she would put herself out there and get a boyfriend. But for the last 2 weeks, she stopped texting me, started replying very late and sometimes not even reply at all. But on the other hand sometimes she texts me first. I tried talking to her about it but she doesn't see the problem. I told her how I missed our late night talks and how we barely talk anymore and she says that she is busy with university and all. I tried giving her space, so I didn't text her for a week, and you guessed it, she didn't text me, not even a ""hey whats up"". When I ask her how her day was she hits me with the ""good"", no explanation, no ""good, and you?"" nothing. We used to send each other goofy pictures of each other during the day, but I realised that for the last 2 weeks, only I've been sending pics to her.

I'm 15 and I love my life but there are just certain things that I'm just not confident about. For example, as you know, today was new years eve and one of my friends parents held a huge party. Unlike me, all my friends did not hesitate to dance in front of all the people that were there. At that point, I was just feeling somewhat left out, like an emptiness inside of me. I dont know exactly what it is but I guess I'm just not a social kid. I can get intimidated when it comes to big parties such as today. I am really not used to talking to people I don't know so it just made it more awkward for me. I really was sad. I wished that I could be more social or maybe have some kind of interesting characteristic like my Friends do. All my friends are funny in some way or at least interesting. But for me, I just don't feel like special. I'm not suicidal or anything like that btw, but it's just I don't really like to do a lot of things that have to do with socializing with people.

437,"For many years I had had headache and sinus pain from strong irritants like perfume (I mean REALLY strong pain), which has not responded to antihistamine or steroid. Recently it got worse - every morning I would have mucus with blood from right nostril + weak rotting smell. So my doctor have me a CT scan.   


The CT scan shows infected right maxillary sinus with pus, and surrounding infected bone. The ENT suggested removal of bone near the opening of the sinus to grant himself access, and to drain the fluid. However, I am concerned about a complication called Empty Nose Syndrome (who a previous ENT warned me about), where air flow through the nose is altered due to removal of too much mucosal tissue, leading to permanent breathing problems. I am also worried that he may shrink my turbinates without my permission during surgery. This ENT also warned me there is a small risk the surgery will damage the eye.

And I could keep going like this, but what's gonna happen when I'm in my 30s? Will I still be by myself then?

442,"5 months ago I met a guy and we connected instantly. It‚Äôs difficult for me to form meaningful connections with people so I was really excited/happy. Things were really intense. We spent every single day/night together. It quickly felt like we had known each other our whole lives within a very short time. But almost 3 weeks in I discovered that he was in a relationship with a girl who moved back to Australia before we met. I was heartbroken and devastated. I packed his stuff and told him to leave. After hours of pleading with me, he left, only to return early the next morning. He apologized for everything and maintained that they had been on &amp; off. He begged me for another chance &amp; convinced me that he was going to leave her. I shouldn‚Äôt have taken him back, but I did... things got extremely bad since then. Here‚Äôs a list of some examples: 

- lied about not being involved w his ex anymore when he never stopped being involved w her.
- Called me a slut, whore, nasty, disgusting, ugly, etc.
- Made me feel bad about my body
- Forced me to watch sex videos of his girlfriend
- Hit me, punched me, choked me, slammed my head against the wall so hard it gave me a concussion, kicked me, body slammed me, etc. 
- Put me down every time he was in a bad mood
- Threw my depression in my face
- Threatened to kill me... multiple times
- Extremely emotionally manipulative 
- Broke my things 
- Showed a blatant disregard for my safety and well-being 
- Went through my phone routinely and even deleted things/blocked his gf without my knowledge or consent 
- Made me feel guilty if I couldn‚Äôt have sex with him
- Purposely provoked me, antagonized me, and pushed me to react
- Refused to leave my house or car unless it was on his terms 
- Talked about how much he wanted to fuck my best friend and called me the less attractive friend.
- Told me he was in love with me while continuing to be in a relationship with someone else
- Drank copious amounts of alcohol every single day after telling me he was going to quit. Lied about not drinking when he had been drinking  
- Crashed my rental car after he begged to take it &amp; never paid for the damages after promising he would when I was in a bad spot financially
-  Overpowered me multiple times by either forcing himself on me or taking my phone.
- Beat off to sex videos of his ex in my bathroom bc he was ‚Äúmad at me.‚Äù
- Isolated me from friends/family by making me feel guilty or anxious when I would spend time with them
- Robbed me of my self-worth &amp; destroyed my self-love.
- Started an intense, 5 month relationship with me, lived with me, spent every single day/night with me knowing he was 1) still in a relationship with someone overseas 2) never going to be able to fully commit to me 3) expected me to fully commit to him and 4) used me for everything I had to offer until I sometimes had genuinely nothing left.
 
It‚Äôs important to note that without context, it probably feels very dumb that I stayed with him. But he is an extremely emotionally manipulative person and I have a hard time letting go of people I love. As bad as things were, things were also the exact inverse. He could choose to be the most amazing person to me. It‚Äôs just always on his terms.

445,"I'll post a short summary of my problem first and then a longer back story for anyone who is interested.

I am currently doing a masters degree in computational neuroscience. I am thinking of dropping out because I want to work in quantitative finance. My current degree will go a long way to giving me the programming skills I need for quant finance, but I could equally well pick up those skills on my own - there are tons of resources.

I could continue with the degree, finish in October, do some interview prep and begin the job hunt. Alternatively, I could drop out now and start all the prep I need to do immediately. I estimate that dropping out will allow me to finish all the job prep about 4 months earlier.

So will gaining a few months be worth it? Should I stick with the degree and finish it?

I'm not short of money at the moment so that doesn't need to be considered.

I'm looking for input on this because I'm not in the best place mentally right now and it's going to impair my decision making.

BACKSTORY:

I have an undergraduate degree in physics and maths and a masters by research in physics from a lowly-ranked university. While doing the masters I got involved in financial trading, both manual trading and algorithmic trading. I convinced a friend of mine to do all the programming while I did the strategy design. We only had mild success but it definitely counts as hands-on work experience. I wrapped the project up when my friend decided to get a new job and my old graduate supervisor convinced me that I have a future in physics and should pursue it further.

I then went to do a taught masters degree in theoretical physics at a very prestigious university in the UK. The job market for physics is so rough you kinda have to go somewhere prestigious to improve your chances. I started doing the degree and... all hell broke loose. I have mental health problems and holy shit did they get ugly. It was like the stars aligned. It got so bad I had to take a year off. Things were better when I came back, but they still weren't great and it reflected in my grades. I passed everything but I didn't graduate with distinction. This matters a hell of a lot for doing a PhD but less so for getting a job in industry.

At this point I said fuck it, I hate living in the UK and moved to Portugal. I knew literally nobody and had no work or study plans. Sometimes I suspect my behaviour was mania. I lived in Portugal for about a year (this was in 2018) until I started having panic attacks that got so bad I had to leave since I didn't have access to proper mental health care where I was.

Once I left Portugal at the beginning of 2019 I started to suffer from depression again. It was too severe for me to work and I eventually ended up in a mental hospital. By the end of my stay in hospital I was desperate to do something again. I was convinced that not working/studying was a major contributor to my problems so I looked for something to do. I gotta be honest, I did not pursue all of my options diligently. I said yes to the neuroscience degree because they responded to my application quickly. It was definitely an impulsive decision to pursue a 3rd masters degree.

Don't get me wrong, it's interesting stuff but I don't think that's justification enough. It could turn into a PhD but I don't think it's a good idea to spend years doing that when there is no way I will be an academic and it won't help me for the job I want.

So please reddit, save me from making more stupid decisions.",01Jan2020,1

448,"Ever since i was young my parents would always criticize me for alot of things i would do, from telling me my hobbies were a waste of time and money, the way i wanna dress, my grades at school (have an elder sister that is a straight A‚Äôs student in school so i get compared to her for everything study related). Basically i was critiqued for almost everything i did since young. What makes it worse is that my sister would also add on to what they say making me feel worse about myself so i grew up with a anxiety, low self-esteem and confidence, bottling up all my feelings not telling them anything about my personal life fearing what might happen when they find out. But now, after spending so much time hiding everything from them i want to tell them that i have been dating my girlfriend i really really love for the past 2+ years. I‚Äôve tried mustering up the courage to tell them but for some reason i just can‚Äôt, i get so anxious and scared and in the end i would just pussy out. Over the past 2 weeks I‚Äôve been trying so hard to tell them but i really can‚Äôt bring myself to. There was a day i spend 4 fucking hours sitting on the couch in the living room trying to tell them but i ended up pussying out.

What can I do? I want to go away for 6 months to a year by myself, I want to meet new people and explore. I‚Äôm in my 20s, study part time and work part time. In dire need of a headspace adjustment. Where should I go and what should I do?",01Jan2020,1
450,"I need help. I'm entirely out of ideas. I'm gonna give some background, to make this make sense. When I grew up, I was an angry child. Genuine anger issues, blackouts, rage, terrorizing my siblings. I got into martial arts and it helped me immensely, Tai chi got added in and now I have no trouble staying calm, in fact I almost never feel angry anymore.

Problem is, my Dad now does. Without getting into specifics, my household has a lot of issues between people. My sister and her son and boyfriend live with us, me, my fiancee, and my dad for various reasons. Naturally, there are some clashes. But I can't bring them up with my parents, particularly my dad.

He snaps and gets loud, and if I don't drop it he either yells or gets extremely passive aggressive. Last night I told him I wouldn't be staying up for new year's, something I had said to him and gotten a nod for in response. When it got brought back up, he started putting things away and saying ""Well, I thought the whole point of new year's was to stay up and start the new year with your family"", only to accuse me of trying to start a fight when I left the room.

When there's a disagreement, he says he has a perfect memory and uses that to devalue anything I say, but when it's convenient for him he's growing older and becoming forgetful. He's given three different reasons why he spends less time with me (after I pulled away and spent more time alone of my own accord so as to lessen the exposure to this behavior), which have been: 1. I'm becoming selfish and pulling away from the family. 2. I moved my entertainment items into my room and it caused distance. 3. (during a fight about how unfairly he treats me) He *chose* to spend less time with me because I'm turning into a dick and I think I'm a martyr.

That last bit digs at me because it's rather common to hear from him the things he's sacrificed and continues to sacrifice for everyone else. He's not a narcissist, but he definitely isn't happy with the position he's chosen. But he has chosen it. Whenever I offer to take some of the stress off by doing the errands or other things myself so he can relax, he insists that he chose it and is happy doing all of it, but my mom has told me several times that he'll get angry about it all and talk about how he never gets a break.

I can't talk to him. He just gets angry, and if I bring that up he brings up my childhood issues and tells me ""I can tell when you're getting like that, and when you start picking a fight, I know. And I give it to you so you can be angry and then calm down"". Others in the house have even told him the last several times that I hadn't yelled until he yelled at me, and he still acts like I picked a fight. If anyone tries to say anything other than agreeing with him, suddenly it isn't their business and they need to be quiet, yet it's perfectly okay for him to bring one of them into it l, and if he does and they disagree with him he storms off. Any apology for having fought seems to be taken as admitting he's right, and after the last big fight, when I apologized he told me he was going to apologize to my fiancee for yelling, only to try to twist around what happened so that my childhood issues were the problem. When she stood up for me, he got angry and stormed out, and he still doesn't talk to her much. That was over a month and a half ago.

Then there's his issues with my sister and her baby. He'll constantly tell her what rules she needs to set for her son, and then turn around and break them in front of her. She's supposed to just be okay with it because he's the grandpa, and under normal circumstances she and I would agree, grandparents get to spoil their grandkids a little bit, it's good for both of them in small amounts. But we all live together, so it isn't a now and then, when they visit thing. It's a near daily occurrence. And if he chastises her and she gets upset, suddenly he was joking (in the form of a 3 minute rant), or she's ""holding the family emotionally hostage"".

It is getting to be oppressive, but I don't want to leave because it's only due to all of us pitching in that he and Mom still have a place to live. I really want to try to fix this before it gets to be so much that I lose my shit and just leave them to figure out the near 1000 dollar hole in their finances without the help my fiancee and I give...but it needs to be done without turning into a doormat. Have any of you been in a similar situation and found a good way to sit down and talk things out, without a fight breaking out?",01Jan2020,1

453,"So, I got two friends Ive known since high school and since I moved away for college, they tend to hang out with each other, which is fair. But lately it's to the point where even when I'm in town, they'd hang out without me, and even call me when hanging out with each other... so that really confuses me. If they are calling me while they are together, couldn't they just have invited me as well? Last night was the camel that broke the straws back. We were planning to go out to the club but as poor student fashion goes, I didnt have money and wasn't going to any time soon to cover my charge. They arent students and they live at home, so I try and give them the benefit of the doubt if they keep asking me why Im broke
They said we should do something free. So they found a New Years Eve party they got invited to and as per usual one of our friends (lets say B) wasnt replying. Keep in mind, A is also telling me this when they decided to meet up without me at one of their houses. So they proceed to tell me in this call they'll talk to me when they're ""inside"" and would call me back, they leave me with an apartment building address. The party is at the other side of the city, and ofc I cant uber, so I thought we would take the subway together. When they said they'd back, they were already inside from what I could tell, it was a very windy day yesterday, and my friends phone picks that up well, not to mention I heard other voices. So half an hour goes by and I didn't hear anything. So I just call them, no reply, then I text them that I dont really feel like going out anymore bc I dont have much go wear or look glamorous with. Time goes on, nobody calls or texts confirming, nobody even pushes me to come. Not offering to help me get ready at my friends house like they were doing together. So I just gave up and put my PJs back on. An hour or two goes by, then a couple, and by quarter to one is when they wish me a happy new year. I get it. Youre having fun. But, why would they send snapchats of the same party to our group chat when Im the only one who didn't go? If its on your story, sure I get it. But to the gc? Both of you were there, it didnt make sense
I found out later they extended my invite to someone else without a heart beat, which is common for them to do. If I say I have no money to hang out, usually they'd move on to someone else. Also, its interesting to note that they don't really hang out with me alone but A and B hang out alone all the time. Whenever they do call me, its mainly to talk about themselves and if I try and open up, they don't really care or hang up after a few minutes. There are many more instances like this, but I just feel really rejected, like a third wheel. None of my other friends treat me this way. Am I overexaggerating? 

TL;DR my friends are going out w/o me, calling me as theyre out tg, and dont ask me to hang out when im in town",01Jan2020,1

455,"I was en route to a university class as I was running late and this Nigerian geezer was in his car in the taxi rank. I took it and he started explaining how I ""looked smart"" and should go to his church. He was using some psychological techniques to try and get into his faith like ""oh you look 'intelligent' - so are you spreading the Lord's word?"" and ""Do you think we all have a Godly purpose?""

This all happened for ten minutes, and it was obvious he was on some game. I hadn't done anything to him - so fuck him. So I told him - ""look, mate, I don't give a fuck about your religion. And fuck your church, I don't care about it. I guess with all the carnage in Nigeria you need that fucking solace in your shithole!"" I said this before I went out of the car, and just gave him a ¬£10 note (which was above the fee but I didn't care, I wanted to go out). And he gave me this hard look - and for what? for trying to draw some random stranger to his church and faith? Didn't Jesus say that force isn't required to draw people in? So what kind of Christian is he to go against the Lord's word??

There's not much he can do - call the police? Scorn me (another anti-Christlike thing...)? I just went in and studied my module, and I got amongst the highest in my cohort for that actually.

I dunno why I was posting this - I guess it's just a random thought between making clearing the garbage out of my flat. It's the geezer's fault for him trying to convert a stranger. I guess he'll tell his taxi buddies I was an ""ass"" to him. Yeah, an ""ass"" defending myself against his Biblical tirade and manipulation.",01Jan2020,1

on one of the phone calls i told him that i liked the pace we were moving at. but then i had sometime to think about us and what we were doing and it just didn‚Äôt sit tight with me. i called him up and i told him that i needed a break and i wanted to work on myself before i got into anything. he said he was okay with it. 

i unfollowed him on all social media and i blocked his number so that i can truly feel like i didn‚Äôt have to turn back to him and get distracted when i actually had to get on with my life. i didn‚Äôt want him just to find out out of the blue so i called him and i told him that i unfollowed him and things like that. he just didn‚Äôt want me to continue. he told me he was alright (he wasn‚Äôt obviously) and then we just ended it right there and then. 

that‚Äôs supposed to be the end of it right? but the thing that worries me is that he can‚Äôt handle himself when he gets upset or angry. he has ‚Äúborderline personality disorder‚Äù and that sometimes gets the better of him. he‚Äôs told me some of the things it‚Äôs lead up to and it wasn‚Äôt okay.

A current example was during a family gathering today. My boyfriend made a comment (in jest) in front of my dad insinuating that I had thrown up one time because of drinking. I was pretty pissed about this because I am very careful with what I share with my dad since he is very critical and judgemental of everything I do, but normally that comment would have been funny.

He‚Äôs the kind of person that will take this information and assume that I have no self control and just like to get drunk with other girls to be cool etc. when I hardly ever get drunk.

I was annoyed after this and was making comments to my other family members and they were all telling me I needed to chill because I was making too big of a deal out of it.

474,"Hi!

I wasn‚Äôt sure what the most appropriate subreddit to post this was so I apologise if this isn‚Äôt the correct place to ask but I am looking for some advice regarding the issues I‚Äôve been having. 

I don‚Äôt know when this began but I have these urges to squeeze any glass I‚Äôm holding which will inevitably result in the glass smashing.

Last night I squeezed a wine glass and it smashed. I cut my hand in three different places. I‚Äôve only ever squeeze a wine glass and have it smash once so this frightened the life out of me. 

I also have urges (and will usually act on these urges) to touch hot objects like the hair straightener, a boiling kettle or an iron. I will touch them but not enough to burn myself or for it to hurt longer than a literal millisecond.

I don‚Äôt know what to do about this. I‚Äôm too afraid to hold glasses anymore. What could this be? Any advice is greatly appreciated.",01Jan2020,1

477,"Hello there advisors,

I've been wanting to get into art again after a very long time and have stated practicing again.

However, I find that if I don't get results immediately, I feel like I can't do it and I'm never going to get better.

I've always been good at learning things. It never took me more than a few tries to be acceptable at something, so I've never had to deal with this.

Sometimes it goes well and I'm really proud of the end result but often I just sketch and it looks like utter shit and I'm shattered..

Does anyone have advice for this other than ""just continue""? Is there a way to learn to accept that I can get better if I just keep at it and not all is lost if I'm not good at it right now? Cause just telling myself that seems to only be a temporary fix..

Thanks in advance! &lt;3",01Jan2020,1
478,"I(22M) recently dropped out of a college during my senior year after academic issues and mental health concerns. I am currently staying with my parents in New York City for Winter break.

Initially, the plan was for me to fly back to college in Chicago on Monday and return home with my stuff from my dorm but after many many fights this past week, they told me this morning that they won't allow me to come back. 

So I am now about to be effectively jobless, homeless, degreeless, friendless, and with $0 in my bank account. I can try to get a minimum wage job in Chicago but I'm not sure where I could afford rent off that income and since I have no money now I don't know how I can afford food for that week. I also don't know the first thing about real estate or finding a place to live.

Does anyone know something that I can do to find a place to live or a job to get while I build up money? Or really any advice for this situation?",01Jan2020,1
479,"Bit of background. Basically my father raped me for around 13 years starting when I was about 5 and stopped a couple of months after I turned 18. That was almost 6 years ago now. I didn't know how to deal with it all so I kinda pushed it away for several years and thought I was coping fine until early last year where I began to notice signs of depression and anxiety. I've since been seeing a psychologist to help with everything. 

I don't think my mother knows what happened. I remember telling her that he touched me when I was around 8 and that they fought afterwards but nothing happened and it kept happening. I'm not sure she even remembers this or whether he managed to convince her I was lying. 

Another reason that I think she doesn't know is that we migrated to a different country a few years after but my mum stayed in our home country to work. My dad has always been the one staying home and doing all the household stuff while she worked even in our home country. She visited around once a year but was basically never around to actually notice anything.

Now my father has moved back to our home country to live permanently with my mum and I still live in the new country.

Here's why I conflicted. Since starting the psych sessions, my psych has brought up telling my mum several times as she thinks it may help in my healing process. I'm extremely hesitant to tell my mum because of several reasons:
1. I'm afraid that maybe she'll blame me for it all.
2. I'm afraid that maybe she has known all this time and has just allowed it to happen.
3. I'm afraid she'll just tell me to get over it and call me a shame to the family.
4. When she was working alone she fell into depression as well and struggle to look after herself. Now that my father is back there, she is much happier and has someone to take care of her. She sucks at cooking and now has someone to cook and clean so she can just relax at home. I'm afraid that if I tell her and they separate, she won't have anyone to take care of her. 

My plan was to only tell her when my father dies. However, I've recently been thinking that it is unfair for my mum to not be told about all this. She won't be given the opportunity to get angry or to ask him why and I'll make his death even more difficult for her. I feel that I'm robbing her of information she deserves to know. 

Putting myself in her shoes, I wouldn't want to lay next to a rapist every night not knowing what he did to our daughter. I feel that this outweighs all my reasons for not telling her. But I still can't bring myself to and want to wait until he dies.

I've asked my closest friends whom I've confided in about this and they're all very conflicted but are leaning on telling her. I'm just at a loss at what to do.",01Jan2020,1
480,"(Sorry if my English is bad) 
The title is basically sums it up. So I'm in highschool and there is this group of guys that I sometimes hangout with and they treat each other like friends, while myself just don't think I bekong to them so I try to distance myself from them. But some of them approaches me and act all friendly on me. They really seem no harm and I'm really not part of their group and maybe I'm just an over reacting retard. They approach me only when they need me or need something from me, I just agreed with them because they aren't really bad people. I wanted advice about this because I think made a mistake. So there's this game (yes I know I might just be bitching about it but atleast hear me out) that me and the group of guys play. We always play together for some time. Then we got a new member for our squad in the game. Lots of time passed. Then they all started to ignore me and I always see their chats (we had a group chat) that they call each other to play and I left the group chat to see if they're gonna react and they just ignored it(My cousin is also in the groupchat so I had him checked. Now it seems like I want attention and maybe I am retarded but the times I have helped them and the fact that they didn't consider what I might think or possibly feel. What I think is that they became somewhat selfish due to the game so what I did is left the group chat and left the squad. I also deleted the game. I didn't want anymore of that treatment so I did what I could.

So we met up and all was well, we talked about a bunch of things, walked around etc, eventually we got to this secluded place and just had a deep conversation and then things got pretty intimate pretty fast and the next thing you know we were having sex. 

Afterwards i walked him back to the bus stop and as we where going through where i lived he commented about how it looked like a military base, he then talked about how he was going to Uni and then going to join the military or something.

494,"Hi there, r/Advice. Long time reader, first time poster.

TL;DR: the vast majority of people I interact with end up hating me to a weirdly intense degree, and many of them end up doing really weird, line-crossing, sometimes even illegal stuff as a result of it. This is not just paranoia or low self-esteem or anything; I have verified with my partner that all the info here comports to their objective experience and knowledge of the situations talked about. I know the old adage ""if you come across one asshole in a day, they're the asshole; if all you come across is assholes, *you're* the asshole"" is usually true and therefor this is likely something I'm doing, but for the life of me, I can't work out what I'm doing exactly and would appreciate an outside perspective.

Note: I am using gender neutral pronouns in this post for the people involved, not because of any preference the people referenced have, but in hopes of the tiniest bit of anonymity, as things are so bad so often that I'm worried they'll literally find this post somehow and use it to mock, harass, insult, etc. me further.

Long version (apologies for the length and I appreciate your patience): 

First, a bit about me and my history. I've always been shy and introverted; I've also got some history of emotional and physical abuse being inflicted on me by my parents, so I'm not sure if the shyness/introversion is just my natural personality or somewhat of a learned behavior from coping with abuse. I also have some pretty serious chronic medical problems that have always made it hard to socialize e.g. it's hard to go out and do things and make friends if you're sick all the time. As a result, much of my socializing from even a young age, was online. While that may have been ""weird"" in the late 90's/early 2000's, with everyone pretty much constantly on Facebook and Twitter and etc., I think it's less weird and honestly, helps with socializing insomuch as it's easier for me to interact with people and not have my shyness or introversion be as problematic (like, I can choose my words carefully and am not 'put on the spot' as often as I would be in person, so my shyness and awkwardness is more or less mitigated), though I also socialize in person and the problems I face persist there.

I consider my strengths to be: I think I'm pretty smart, funny (though my sense of humor is dry and somewhat sarcastic (but not mean, nasty or cruel by any means), and I fully understand that this could rub some people the wrong way), friendly, creative, open-minded, have a broad range of interests, love to help people and like to think I'm well-spoken and articulate.

I consider my weaknesses to be: shy, introverted, somewhat awkward, not physically attractive, somewhat wordy when typing (as you'll soon see, haha), not great with eye contact (I'm not on the spectrum or anything; I've worked out that it's a result of the abuse I've mentioned and have worked to get better at it, and am much better than I used to be), sensitive (but I don't feel I lash out or anything when my feelings are hurt; rather, mine just get hurt probably somewhat easier than average and I go cry about it rather than lash out), some moderate self-esteem issues (I'm always apologizing, even when I've done nothing wrong vis a vis the person I'm apologizing to saying so -- this is absolutely a coping mechanism learned from the abuse I suffered, and I'm working on fixing it).  

Rather than give you a running list of every instance I can remember of people hating me to weirdly disproportionate degrees with little supporting info, I'll instead give a few choice examples with as much relevant info as I can provide. All of these come from my adult, post-high school, post-college life -- the problem I'm posting about existed then too, but I'm posting later examples to mitigate any ""kids are kinda mean and cruel to people who don't fit in"" explanation. 

CASE A -- I play music. A band I was in's bassist had stopped coming to shows and practices and was causing problems with several of the other members, who threatened to quit if they weren't replaced. I found a replacement, our singer informed the bassist we were moving forward without them. This was a group decision. Rather than being angry at the entire band, the bassist singularly focused on me, 'calling me out' on social media and using what I would consider to be extremely loaded language carefully chosen to cause as much outrage as possible.

e.g. I was called ""predatory"" for having answered their 'bassist looking for a band' ad and 'abusive' for finding a replacement for them which hurt their feelings. These are their own explanations as to why they chose those words; I am not ascribing motive to them, nor am I leaving any information out as to why they chose those terms.

Everyone leaped at the chance to attack me, including some people I had literally been very close friends with up to that very point. One very close friend, who I had done a LOT for (I am not going to post a self-aggrandizing list, as it's not relevant anyway) and hadn't had a single cross word with in the entire time we were friends immediately called me ""trash"" and said they had always thought I was a piece of shit since they first ever met me and blocked me. Other of their friends attempted to dox me, attempted to figure out where I'd be so they could assault me, text harassed me so much that I had to change my number, etc. The other bandmates, for what it was worth, sided with me 100% but refused to do so publicly. I assume out of fear they'd be targeted for harassment.

Subsequently, I quit the band due to completely founded fears of being assaulted -- at the very first show they played with out me, a group of 3 or 4 of their friends came, asked if I was there, said they were going to beat the shit out of me and left when they found out I wasn't. 

A year and a half later, the ex-bassist is still railing against me on the internet. They've also done things like breaking into my now ex-band's email account and contacted all the shows they were playing to try to get them kicked off because they  ""aren't convinced I'm really out of the band"". Their friends applauded them for this and again took the opportunity to call me trash, garbage, etc.

CASE B -- I sometimes post stuff about how I'm feeling down or whatever on social media. I limit the audience to a small list of close friends, since I try not to overshare or bug people with my problems. I would post things about my health, feeling sad/lonely, etc. One day, after having posted a thing on mother's day to said limited audience about how the holiday always gives me conflicted feelings due to wanting to love my mother and be close to her, but finding that hard due to the abuse I had inflicted on me when I was younger, I started getting *really* weird messages from clearly fake accounts, mocking me for having been abused by my parents. 

More messages from fake accounts followed. Long story short, I eventually narrowed down who on my limited list had been harassing me, and baited them into outing themselves by posting a personal story that I'd figured they'd jump on to harass me about, but set so that (unbeknownst to them) only they could see it. They took the bait and I got weird, harass-y messages about it from a fake account.

I made a post saying that I had worked out who had been harassing me, how I had done it (so as to be absolutely sure) and had subsequently unfriended them. I did not name them publicly, nor privately. The person in question either noticed they were unfriended or heard about the post saying I'd outed the person harassing me (despite not being named) and posted a thing all but admitting they were behind the harassment, but that I had been ""manipulative"" in how I'd baited them into exposing themselves.

Everyone sided with them. I was called trash, garbage, etc.

One lone friend of mine waded into the mess and tried to tell the crowd that they were being weirdly okay with harassment and abuse. They were shouted down. They have subsequently also stopped being my friend, as I am being yelled about so hard and so constantly that they feel ""where there's smoke, there must be fire"" -- though they admit that in each individual case, I have evidence that makes it clear I'm being victimized; I suppose they're just following the ""one asshole is an asshole, everyone's an asshole, you're the asshole"" adage. I don't blame them.

CASE C -- I minored in music production in college and have worked as an engineer for several well-regarded regional indie albums. A fellow audio engineer in my area would constantly come to my bands shows and, for lack of a better term, ""neg"" me over everything; my engineering technique was a common topic. It wasn't just, y'know, ""hey, have you tried doing X to make the guitar beefier sounding"" or whatever -- I love to talk shop with engineers that way! -- it was stuff like ""jesus dude, the drums on your new recording sound like trash, what the fuck"" (for added irony, they and I have pretty similar production techniques!). They'd also neg my band's gear, our songwriting, just everything. 

Finally, after weeks of this, they DM'd me about a post I'd made offering the free recording of a single song to the first 2 or 3 new bands/artists who hit me up for it -- just trying to do something nice for people just starting out who may not have a ton of money to book a studio. In said post, I also mentioned that I have a ton of experience, linked several of the albums I'd engineered on, and said I consider myself to be 'pretty good' and would help them make a cool record. They immediately tore into me, said that they ""and 7 of [their] friends were all laughing at what a piece of trash I was for saying that I considered myself pretty good"". I responded, sarcastically (as I was well passed tired of this dude's nonsense at this point) saying ""oh gosh, I'm sorry for saying I'm reasonably good at the thing I went to school for; I will make sure to ask permission from you and your 7 friends before self-assessing the skills I've used for over a decade in the future"". Bad move, I guess, because they and their friends have harassed me to this day about it and I get messages on a weekly basis warning me that they're still posting about me and calling me ""trash"", ""garbage"" etc. and of course, they jump on any instance of other people yelling about me to dogpile on me further. Note: this person also routinely self-assesses as good at what he does (and they are!) and mentions the bands they've recorded as a way to promote their engineering services.

CASE D -- I shared a slightly spicy, but mostly innocuous post from another friend that was mildly, humorously critical of the whole ""let people enjoy things"" platitude that gets posted anytime anyone critically discusses anything (Star Wars in this case) -- basically the post said ""Let people enjoy things? Well, I enjoy curmudgeonly critiquing pop culture!"" or something. Someone I'd been pretty okay and friendly with decided this was directed at them. I assume, from context, that they had just posted 'let people enjoy things' and assumed my post was directed at them. I understand how someone might come to that conclusion do to the coincidental timing. I deleted the post and attempted to message them to explain and apologize and assure them it was a coincidence and that I had deleted the post regardless, but they immediately blocked my messages (but not my account). The next two days saw them @ me in a series of increasingly passive-aggressive posts from both their primary account and their old account I was still friends with and set to only me as an audience. Any attempt to engage with them would see them deleting the posts immediately, only to repost an even more passive-aggressive one several hours later. They escalated to the point that they got pretty nasty.

Finally, and I'll admit beyond frustrated, I'd had enough and posted a response, set to only be viewable to the two accounts they'd been using to bug me saying, in short, ""Imagine thinking that a post I shared that someone else made, about a thing literally hundreds of people are saying in response to people talking about Star Wars, is about you specifically. Not everything is about you. Knock it off."" 

30 minutes go by, then I see that I'm tagged in yet another post from them, only this one is set to public. I'm 'called out' for being 'antagonistic' for having posted the original status, which they said was ""clearly about them"" and for having responded to their passive-aggressive posts by posting the thing limited to just them seeing it, telling them to knock it off. 

I was called trash, garbage, etc. yet again. I responded with screen shots of several of the weird posts they'd been making about me over the past couple of days, and was blocked a few minutes later, but not before seeing a couple people characterizing it as ""creepy"" that I'd posted screenshots of posts they'd made that only I could see because they had deleted them and thus I was creepy for posting things they'd deleted. 

So, to summarize, everyone ends up hating me, and to a disturbingly intense degree -- both in person and online; either targeting me directly for what I'd characterize as abuse, harassment, character assassination, etc., or believing uncritically what others say about me (and *despite* evidence to the contrary; in fact, providing any evidence I have that counters the narrative makes things even worse for me). 

I understand that I don't get out much due to my health, so obviously as a general rule, people are going to default to believing their friends over some person they only peripherally know, and I understand I'm shy and awkward and this could make people more apt to view me in a negative light, but for the life of me, I can't help but feel that the things I'm attacked with are all bizarre, huge stretches, worded manipulatively, etc. ('predatory' for answering a band ad? 'creepy' for demonstrating that I'd been being harassed for a couple days over a misunderstanding?) and that the subsequent responses are way, way, way beyond reasonable (called trash, garbage, told to kill myself, gaslit, armchair diagnosed with every mental illness imaginable, attempted doxing, phone harassment, threats, etc.)

I have done my very best to be honest and introspective about all of this -- both in my personal life and in this post. In case A, I recognize that getting removed from a band is upsetting; in case C, I realize it was rude to be snarky to them, even if they'd been exponentially more nasty to me; in case D, I understand how the coincidental timing of things could lead to someone being upset. Case B puzzles and troubles me, since it was literally someone getting caught doing something really awful, yet people still attacked me (so I guess I could use some perspective on that instance, since I find it impossible to empathize with any part of the other side). I think that, while I do ""clap back"" if pushed to an extreme degree, that my responses are appropriate; neither ""letting people treat me like a doormat"" nor ""becoming a raging asshole at the slightest provocation""; I am more than happy to change my view here if I am wrong.

I should also note, the people treating me this way are all (for the most part), late 20's-early 30's and seem to otherwise have normal, healthy adult relationships and lives.

Does anyone have any insight into this situation? Is it just a matter of running into a handful of assholes and people believing them about me due to not knowing me? Am I doing something off-putting or awful that I don't have the perspective to notice? Is it the dichotomy between being shy/awkward in person, but more assertive in standing up for myself online? I can give more examples if these three scenarios I've detailed aren't enough. The constant bullying, harassment, getting yelled at constantly over seemingly minor/insignificant things, etc. is really starting to effect me. I am increasingly anxious, terrified to talk to anyone, feel extremely isolated and lonely, etc. I want it to stop, but don't know how to make it stop, as at this point, everyone in my town has extremely negative feelings about me. Moving is a feasible thing for me; would that be a good thing to look into? If so, what is some advice I could take with me to a new city so as to make sure this current mess doesn't repeat itself with a new cast of characters?

495,"I think this is something I have.  Ever since I was a kid, I would pace around in circles and fantasize about different realities and scenarios in vivid detail.  Most of the time, I did this while listening to music, and I could do this for hours.  I didn‚Äôt neglect things I had to do and didn‚Äôt necessarily get absorbed into false realities.  It was more like an outlet for my creativity.  But, I recently learned about maladaptive dreaming, which is what this sounds like.  Most of what I read characterizes it as a mental disorder associated with anxiety, depression, ADHD, or OCD that needs to be treated and stopped completely.  It seems to be associated with past trauma (I have suffered from abuse).  

I always thought it was just a quirky thing that only I did.  But I think I do have a compulsion for it.  I stopped because of increasing responsibilities and lack of alone time (I got married recently).  Not doing it makes me depressed, and I have gained about 30 lbs (I was a lot more active when I was daydreaming a lot and would distract myself from binge eating).  Now I‚Äôm fat and binge eating all the time because I‚Äôm depressed.  But, I feel like my relationship with my husband has improved significantly since I‚Äôm striving to do more things together.  I see colors more vividly and actually stop to notice my surroundings (I think I felt numb to everything for a while).

496,"My two cats normally dont get a long but yesterday was worse than usual. I had to break up a fight manually by getting between them and pulling them apart. I dont hit them. One of them absolutely hates me now.

He will hiss growl and yowl every time he sees me. Its 3am and i cant sleep. This year is off to a very bad start.

My plan is to give him his favourite wet food in the morning (i ran out and have to buy more) and try to sit beside him while he eats. I have my two cats separated and am just hanging out with the cat that doesnt hate me. The weather wont permit me to keep them separated for too long (will be be very hot tomorrow, poor airflow in one room)

497,"I don‚Äôt necessarily mean a place specifically with licensed dogs or anything. Just a place where I could pet dogs and spend time with them. 

I got a dog about a year ago, and he has, unexpectedly, helped me a lot with my mental health issues. If I have a flashback or panic attack I‚Äôll cuddle him, and he‚Äôll give me with kisses. Sometimes I‚Äôll just cry while holding him. He makes me feel safe. I love him so much. 

Dang. I just love dogs in general. I‚Äôm sometimes on the verge of tears with strangers‚Äô dogs. (I cry a lot if you couldn‚Äôt tell lol). I‚Äôve been looking for a place to just pet dogs.

501,"Hi, I am not sure what sub fits this best but I‚Äôve struggled with abandon anxiety all my adult life. The root comes (I believe) from having my father walk away from my and my siblings when I was 11. I always thought it didn‚Äôt affect me but have realized just very recently it has.

The main symptom is me pushing people out and acting incredibly jerky as soon as I feel neglected/abandoned. Be it physical or emotionally if someone I love makes me feel neglected I immediately and abruptly cut ties. I then regret it, they accept me back and the circle continues.

I ended my marriage partly because of that (and other things) and ended a beautiful relationship 3 yrs ago because my SO wasn‚Äôt ready to spend every night with me and so I felt neglected. Yesterday I ‚Äúbroke up‚Äù with my current GF because she didn‚Äôt text me to wish me a happy New Year (she is on vacation outside the country). She texted me later and we talked things off but that‚Äôs me.... feeling neglected and pushing ppl away so abruptly.

502,"An international student from my college asked to sublease my room, we‚Äôve been in contact the entire month, she filled out the application but my landlord agreed that she didn‚Äôt have to pay the deposit until she got to america because it was easier that way.

She moves in the day she planned and literally packs up everything and leaves the next day and says she found somewhere closer to campus.

504,"I (F16) love my family to bits, more then they could ever imagine. 
They've done so much for me, and I couldn't be more grateful, and I do try to express my gratitude 9 times out of 10.
I'm always upbeat and positive, and always smiling, I never complain, and I try my best to do a lot around the house, to say the least. 

The situation sort of begins when my Papa (M58) buys himself a new Xbox, and he gave my sister (F15) and I back the one that my Uncle had bought for the both of us last Christmas. 

My sister B-lines to her room with it, and I block the entrance, and ask her what does she think she's doing. 
She says that my Grandma (F59) said that she could have our Xbox in my sisters room. 
I went and tried to explain to Grandma that that was our Xbox, so I think that it should go into the den. 

She proceeds to tell me that I don't really like videos games, and since my sister got a new video game for Christmas, she can play it in her room, and that if I wanted to play, I could just go in there, and play. 

I tried to say how silly that sounds. 
Next thing I know my sister is upset, and throws the Xbox in the den, and makes a snarky remark that I could go and set it up if I'm going to be that way. 

My Grandma then tells my sister to go ahead, and put it in her room, since she ""sees her playing on it more"". 
Of course, I was at aw. 
I hate getting upset over it, considering it's a first world problem. 
I tried really hard to explain why they're misunderstanding the situation. 

They're response was to tell me that I just want everything my way. 
Which isn't true, considering I rarely get my way on a day to day basis, but nobody notices, until I do get upset over something, then they use that as an excuse. 

I tried to explain that, but then my Mama (F49) proceeds to yell at me as if she were telling the dogs to be quiet. 
My sister has this smug look on her face, as if she never got mad in her life. Which she is the type of person to get mad if you breathe the wrong way. 

If anything, she's more pretentious with getting her way. 

At this point, I'm not so much as mad at the Xbox, as mad as I am at them, and their reactions, and how they were treating me. 
I get that cry voice, and I can't speak, so I go into the bathroom, and begin to cry. 
I then overhear my Mama, sister, and Grandma laugh about me. 

They said that I was going to pout in my room, because I didn't get my way. 
I eventually clean myself up, and then they have this condescending happy voice, as if they never got upset in their life.
I proceeded to clean the house, as I normally do, and I hear them whispering about me, 
Instead of actually trying to talk to me like a person. 

I eventually go to bed, and then I overhear my Grandma talking on the phone, and explaining the situation from her view, painting me as this spoilt whiny brat who didn't get their way. 

A little bit after that, I hear my sister complain how I'm making the biggest deal out such a small thing, and how I was quick to rush all my stuff into the den once my sister got her room back.
Which isn't really much of an argument, but if she brought that up with me, then I'd be happy to fix it. 

I mean, my sewing table is in the den, because my room is small, and it couldn't fit in there after I got a dresser, if that's what she's talking about. 
At this point, the issue isn't the Xbox, it's my family talking about me behind my back, when they could've easily confronted me about it. 

I can change and learn from my mistakes, but how am I supposed to know when you're talking bad about me behind my back? 
I love my family, but that was the straw that broke the camels back in a way. 

You just don't do that to your loved ones. 
I'm barely exchanging words to them, until they can confront me like a person.",01Jan2020,1

510,"In September 2019 my salary increased from $33,000 to $35,000. Someone in my department left the previous month and I was now taking on new responsibilities (mainly those of the employee who left plus a large chunk of my previous duties). 

Flash forward to December when a company memo explains the new federal salary requirements and that the minimum salary would increase to $35,568. Affected employees (myself included) sign the paperwork confirming the increase.

While I should have questioned it in the moment, it wasn‚Äôt until later that the issue dawned on me. Am I wrong to think my new salary should be $37,568?

Often, when I make my needs know I am always disregarded and this really frustrates me.  I do know that I need to be more assertive, which I am currently working on. The times that I am assertive I keep getting pushed aside.  I feel like often, I am looked down upon and I am not sure what I did wrong.

522,"These is all gold nuggets for any dood that comes up against this especially a younger guy like in his early 20's.

Don't be a shy quiet type of guy especially if your a dood, never I mean ever fall into that trap force yourself out of it, it may lead to fucking lonely ass life and you will regret that for sure.

If you get a job and you feel like someone there needs there ass kicked for some fucking reason and you feel that not kicking that guys ass, I mean not getting thrown in Jail over it but at least picking a fight with him because your afraid to use your job, fuck that job, punch that mother fucker or something don't let him drive you crazy.  

Here is a big one don't fucking do these lonely ass gig jobs unless you absolutely have too. That just good advice period, they are not cool because they are all lonely jobs when it comes down to it, they are fucking lonely ass jobs, they fucking suck because you don't get to know the people around you at all even, fuck that for sure!!! 

Also get a fucking job, don't run your own business or some shit like that even though you could because you don't want to work anymore for whatever reason, get a fucking job and get around some fucking women and co-workers too. Unless your some type of big shot entrepreneur or some shit like that, even then think that shit thru because it is probably lonely too.

Don't get on social security disability payments even though you can.  Here is why because your better off getting a job and feeling like a part of society not some dood on fucking disability payments.  That is only if you absolute need it, you'll fuck yourself so bad you'll regret in time, fuck that few thousand dollars they give you too, it may seem a lot at the time but it will go quick,, yea it may help you down the road and  life may be harder at times because you didn't get on it but you will regret it worse because you can't get a fucking regular job like normal people and may feel like a outcast 

Here a a big one overall, get a regular job 8 -5 something like that probably 8-5 like most others because that is what almost everyone does. Who cares what the job is hopefully a good one but still get something cool on the side like a gig job is perfect to supplement an 8 to 5. Anybody that is doing a gig job full time you are making a mistake.

Never hurt the lesser people. If you think about it that is really the only people you can hurt with your words.  Because someone more then you will end up hurting you maybe and you won't like that but mostly because that is just not cool to do.  I've done that recently and I am a asshole and not correct for the move and it was uncalled for.

Life can get shittier then you ever imagined but don't just give up, keep on living as best as you can regardless, because that is what you do with life because that is all you have is the time you get in this world or your given or whatever you believe.

Keep living your life,  keep fighting , not necessarily to the very end but you do your best to keep yourself alive you know what I mean. Don't let depression or physical illness just make you give in.  Especially depression that is a bad mistake for A LOT of people.  Depression  can be bad for some people for sure I know it's not that simple. What I am saying is don't let just a few depressive times in your life overtake you and even don't give it that much time to get over it get anti-depressants they work good. Hurt feelings are different and worse to deal with those aren't worth killing yourself either it will eventually pass it may take a long time like a loss of a girlfriend will. Luckily I've never been that hurt where I really wanted to kill myself but I've been thru some very depressing times and those are just mental things, its physical things that will most certainly end up killing you.

This is the last thing for sure.  

If your ever in a really bad situation or  having really bad depressing feeling or worse about where you are at or something that bothered you in your life, do whatever you can to get out of that feeling or situation.. 

The feeling your having or situation your in can overtake you if you don't get out of it somehow don't let yourself suffer like that if you can do something about it.

That all I have for you.  I had something else that was good it was so good if I remember it I will post it here.  

I hope this helps somebody I know it will eventually and even helping one person with their life will make me feel about mine.",01Jan2020,1

I bought my house last year. 

I live with my boyfriend and his best friend. My boyfriends sister started dating my boyfriends best friend. 

Now me, my boyfriend, and his best friend all pay rent and utilities, but now my boyfriends sister is here everyday. She sleeps here everyday, showers, puts food in the fridge, uses common areas, throws away trash. 

Although I don‚Äôt think she should pay rent, I think she should pay utilities. 

Hard part is, when I brought it up last year I was the bad guy. I feel like she lives here for free (minus her stuff) and we all have to pay. 

Another part of me wants to say nothing at all because I know this will not be forever, but it just does not seem fair. 

On top of it sometimes she comes into the house in awful moods and her and her bf will fight sometimes. 

This has been going on for about a year now and not sure what to do and would love advice. 

Should I just let it be or should I sit everyone down and talk about it? Or is there something I‚Äôm not even thinking of.

534,"     I feel as though my brain is wired wrong. I can think the logical thoughts and realise when I'm spiraling, but it's as though the two sides of my brain are constantly at war with each other. I constantly overthink about things that I know the truth of, but I cant help but to think that some how it's bad. I just wish my thoughts would stop. I trust my girlfriend with my life, so why is it that I think she could be cheating when I know that that's not true at all. I know it to be true, but I cant stop thinking about it when I cant talk to her. It's like I need the reassurance from her constantly, and I hate that. I do love her, but I want to be able to be independent in the relationship as well. 
     What the hell is wrong with my head? Why dont the thoughts ever stop or at least slow down? Does it ever stop? I've been diagnosed with anxiety and PTSD, and tried medication for a while but it felt like I had no control over my own life while I was on them. Help me, please.",01Jan2020,1

I became besties with a friend there proceeded to end up dating broke up. Now~ I had this other friend in this group we would play catch up every now and then but again nothing super close just nice to eachother. I felt like I was the one mostly reaching out. Anyway blocked the ex left the group moving on however this friend* texted me. I dont want my ex to know how I am etc. Just kinda want to dissapear from his life. Sooo...mmmm I've seen them do this shit tho reach out to ppl to try to get them back around but they would leave eventually or they do it out of curiosity.

But he also said sinse I'm insecure about stuff he wanted to see what I was insecure about so he could point out all the good things and help me through my insecurities 
I told him that It made me uncomfortable  and he said too share with him whatever I was comfortable sharing and that he would stop asking for pics

I'm 27yo, never had a girlfriend, I didn't even kiss anyone, virgin ofc, depressed for almost 10 years (in ""treatment"" for the last 4), never had a job, with very bad vision (15% in the left eye -I had a corneal transplant last year, my mom paid for everything with a lot of effort, 10% in the right eye -I'm waiting for transplant in that too.), left my studies, living with my mom (she 63yo and almost blind), no friends, nothing!

I live in a third world country (An almost rural region of Brasil) but at least offer free treatment for depression. Since I decided to start my treatment I also decided that I would only focus on the good side of life, to see life with good eyes. Irony aside, now I'm better but I don't know where to start with my life, I became very comfortable with the situation, I think the human being gets used to everything, even living in extreme poverty/conditions, but at the same time I finally realized that I can't live like this anymore. I have been trying to get a job but it has not been easy as I have studied very little and do not see very well (My vision problem is called keratoconus and because it's a treatable disease I can't be framed as disabled for job openings, or similar)

I really need advice, even to change my mentality, to feel the need for get a better life for me and my family, no longer wasting time procrastinating without fighting.

544,"I live in an apartment complex. I‚Äôve only been here since September. Every morning I wake up at 6 AM to my neighbors son stomping in his room above mine. I work at a school so I get up early anyways during the week, but on weekends when I‚Äôd like to sleep in this drives me nuts. I haven‚Äôt done anything about it, because he‚Äôs a really young kid and I don‚Äôt think our leasing people would have much sympathy for me. However, the noise disturbance has made me more aware of other sounds coming from the apartment.

Often times when I wake up from the stomping, it‚Äôs followed by the mother yelling. It‚Äôs often hard to make out what she says, but I started hearing her say things like ‚ÄúOh, look what you‚Äôve done!‚Äù ‚ÄúGet over here!‚Äù ‚ÄúSit down, Now!‚Äù and other abrupt things presumably when he would make a mess. I didn‚Äôt assume it was abusive yet, but the way she would yell seemed aggressive. 

Then on one occasion when I wasn‚Äôt home, my roommate heard a big fight. The mom was berating her son for some behavior, the father was joining in, and her other son who is a baby started crying. ‚ÄúLook what you made your brother do!‚Äù ‚Äúchrist!‚Äù is what she said to the kid son. It left my roommate feeling uneasy for sure. 

We both started noticing the baby hyperventilating for long periods of time, with no one going in to help. I know that some parents will let their kids cry without going to them every time to teach them to cry less or whatever, but this would be an hour of straight up hyperventilating sounds. This has happened probably 3 times for a straight hour, and a few other times closer to 30 minutes. It‚Äôs very unsettling to hear, and has made us both worry.

Things came to a head about 2 weeks ago. I had my boyfriend over and we heard what we thought was someone banging on my front door. He goes over to see if someone‚Äôs there and hears it again. It‚Äôs someone stomping with clearly all of their might in the doorway above my apartment. It was the loudest stomping I‚Äôve heard. The kid probably had his hands on the wall, and was slamming both of his feet into the floor. That‚Äôs the only explanation for how loud it was. I wanted to give them a gentle ceiling knock, but i worried about what the mom might do (to us sure, but mostly him). 

After about the 3rd or 4th crazy stomp session, my boyfriend went ahead and knocked on the ceiling. Then I hear ‚ÄúSTOP STOMPING YOUR FUCKING FEET!‚Äù followed by a loud cry. An hour later, the cops were at MY door because ‚Äúa neighbor‚Äù complained about the noise, saying it was from my apartment. I suspect that the mom is the one who called them honestly, because she didn‚Äôt like that we knocked. If it was someone else though, that‚Äôs pretty telling in itself just how loud she (and her son) were being. 

Lastly, last night I head the dad yelling at their son at 1 am in his room, then yelling at the mom in the living room right after. It was new year‚Äôs eve so it‚Äôs not too weird that there were up late, but it still felt off. Everything about it feels off honestly. 

I‚Äôm not sure what to do. If my suspicion is correct and those kids really aren‚Äôt safe up there, i want to do something about it. At the same time, I don‚Äôt really know what to do! I‚Äôm not sure if just calling the cops is a good idea, or If i should contact the leasing office? Has anyone reported a situation like this before on here?",01Jan2020,1
545,"This is difficult to write because I‚Äôm just trying to move on from this but I need someone to tell me I‚Äôm not going insane and I‚Äôll be alright. I feel like I‚Äôm going to fall into depression. My husband and I have been together 7 years. A few years ago he cheated and I decided to try to work it out because of our kids. Well we‚Äôve moved on from this completely and about 3 months ago our marriage has been the best it‚Äôs ever been. He stopped going out, he started acting like a better more loving husband, he‚Äôs changed almost completely. He wants this family, this marriage and everything in between he‚Äôs become a family man and I‚Äôve seen it and felt it completely. I had no reason not to trust him or anything like that. Well a few days ago for some reason I checked my message requests on Facebook and I saw a message from a girl. She wrote me in November and I didn‚Äôt see it till now. Well she claimed her friend has been having sex and has been talking to my husband on and off since 2011. We met in 2012. First off, I know who this girl was because when we were going through some shit she tried calling my husband on Facebook and I saw it was an incoming call from her. He told her he was working things out with his wife so back off. And I thought that was that. He also had told me that she was always the ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù type. Well anyway she was showing me screen shots of my husband messaging her saying he still thinks about her and just being desperate to talk to her. Then screen shots of Snapchat conversations and him asking to come over and to hang out. The account was also not the Snapchat account he uses regularly it was a different account. Well he was trying to talk to her and she was basically saying no she doesn‚Äôt want to talk to him because she‚Äôs done fucking with married men and go have sex with your wife and he was telling her that‚Äôs none of your business and going back and forth. She also sent me screen shots of a tinder account he was using. I couldn‚Äôt believe my eyes. My heart was pounding out of my chest. Once again cheating... I confronted him and he got defensive. Then I said you know what we need to talk this out like adults what the hell is going you need to tell me the truth. He says he did message her on Facebook but he doesn‚Äôt remember the conversations they had on Snapchat and he never made a tinder account. He again pleaded that she was crazy and she could‚Äôve easily made a tinder account with his name and pictures. I should also mention in the past he said she was trying to get in between us. Which I never even knew about. I didn‚Äôt know what to think because literally before this we were 100% ok. He was showing me MAJOR change and that he wanted this family to work and grow old together. I believed him. I should mention this girl said  she hasn‚Äôt ‚Äúfucked‚Äù around with him since before March. And I do remember after March our marriage was getting better. But in September he messaged her happy birthday and that was all. He said nothing has changed but that message I received. I told him look I‚Äôm done with shit we have 2 kids, I‚Äôm newly pregnant, a house, and a new car I can‚Äôt go through this shit again I‚Äôm done. You need to leave I‚Äôm done with this marriage. He was pacing back and forth and came to me begging me not to divorce him. He loves me and wants this family more than anything. He‚Äôs made many mistakes but these past few months have been then best they have ever been and he‚Äôs feeling like a new man and changed man. He was bawling his eyes out and on his knees. He really couldn‚Äôt phantom life without me. Nothing has changed please he will do whatever he needs to do to make this work and he went on and on. He also claims he NEVER slept with her. He was swearing up and down hes never touched another woman since the last incident. He looked me dead in the eye and told me he never touched her. I just sat there speechless while he was crying and begging and I walked away. He left the house and called me that he‚Äôll been home soon. When he came back home, he again said he will do anything anything to make this work. He doesn‚Äôt want to lose me. He also said he doesn‚Äôt remember doing that stuff because he wasn‚Äôt in his right mind. He doesn‚Äôt know who that person is. He didn‚Äôt say the words but basically saying he‚Äôs mentally ill. He hears voices and he blacks out and doesn‚Äôt really remember his actions when he‚Äôs in this state. He‚Äôs said this before. He does have family with metal illness. He said he needs help and he needs me more than ever to help him get help. I should mention once he spanked our child when I was out at the gym (we believe in spanking please don‚Äôt give me shit for this) and I came back home he told me what happened and our daughter had a bruise on her butt. Growing up my mom spanked my 3 brothers and I and we would have bruises on our butts as well so this wasn‚Äôt alarming to me. Anyway he brought this up and used it as an example that he blacks out and doesn‚Äôt remember doing things because he doesn‚Äôt remember spanking her hard. He said he needs help, he knows there‚Äôs something wrong with him. I honestly believe this because I know mental illness is a real thing and my father has schizophrenia so I understand this completely. I‚Äôm sorry this is so long but I don‚Äôt want to tell anyone at all about this. It‚Äôs embarrassing. I needed to let it out and if you guys want to judge then so be it.. I chose to try to work this out because I love my husband and our growing family. I know you all will think I‚Äôm stupid for giving him another chance but I think with professional help, he can get better. In my own way I‚Äôm trying to heal from this but it‚Äôs hard. I have my moments when I think about this when I‚Äôm looking at him and I can‚Äôt help but feel anger. He said he doesn‚Äôt want me resenting him and I told him I wouldn‚Äôt. But I‚Äôm starting to feel like I am... maybe with time this will change but right now I feel resentment. He claims nothing like this will ever happen again he swears it. He said he‚Äôll do anything to gain my trust again anything I want. And I told what I need from him in order to make this marriage work and for me to trust him again. (Seeing his phone, answering my phone calls and texts always. He‚Äôs the one that started sharing his location with me indefinitely so I can see where he is, I didn‚Äôt ask for this but ok. He doesn‚Äôt want to lose me and the girls. I believe him. I feel stupid for believing him. I‚Äôm crying right now realizing this...  I just want my husband back, the man that loves me and only me. We‚Äôre high school sweethearts and only 24 years old.. I know because we‚Äôre going we‚Äôre going to go through a lot of shit because we‚Äôre trying to find our selves I mean we‚Äôre only 24 years old. I know he‚Äôs trying hard to make me realize he‚Äôs not going to do that again that he really wants this to work. I honestly don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm writing this and what I expect you guys to say. I know I‚Äôm gonna hear a lot of bad shit but hey, in the end it‚Äôs my decision... thanks for listening...",01Jan2020,1
546,"hey y‚Äôall this might be a long one

I‚Äôm 21 (f) I met this girl in uni, from the get go it was very intense. She would always be touching me; stroking my arms, hugging me, putting her arm round my waist. Something heartbreaking happened to her and she became I believe a little co-dependent on me. confiding in me things she hadn‚Äôt told her own family or friends, asking me what she should do. Once she came into uni just to sit and talk to me outside of a lesson. One day I didn‚Äôt see her in uni and she messaged me the next morning asking if I was okay multiple times. At this point I hadn‚Äôt even known her a month. 

She was very interested in getting to know me, and spending time with me and left her friends on occasion to come and hang with me. She would be proper caring over messages for example asking me how work was going and telling me to drive home safe,etc.

She was a really sweet girl and I thought she really cared about me but my instincts were just screaming at me that something was off or that she may have had feelings for me.

Until one day when we were in together and we were hanging out as per after the lesson and she was being very intense again, earlier she had been bickering at me about what i was wearing, for example, telling me she doesn‚Äôt want to see me come into uni wearing inappropriate clothes for the weather. I was in a big coat and jeans. 
We were sat in the cafe and She had moved from opposite me to sat next to me on the couch, with her arm round the back of me and sat so close that I was starting to feel a little uncomfortable. 
Next thing she talking about a lad that she said she doesn‚Äôt know whether she fancies him or not. Then she‚Äôs saying she‚Äôs late for her train and gets up to leave. When hugging her goodbye she starts giggling and says ‚Äòare you annoyed at me?‚Äô To which I‚Äôm very confused and I just reply  with a confused no. We split off and whilst I‚Äôm waiting at the bus stop she messages me 10 mins later asking ‚Äòwere you mad at me then lol‚Äô to which I just don‚Äôt read as I‚Äôm proper confused at this point.
An hour later having not read her previous message she sends me 5 other messages with just emojis obviously just trying to get my attention. At this point my gut is screaming at me that this isn‚Äôt normal aha. 

So i reply just saying ‚Äòwhat for?‚Äô And she replies saying ‚Äòyou just seemed a little upset then‚Äô. And I‚Äôm sat there thinking wtf I was perfectly fine aha. So it feels abit weird now so I try and lighten things up and tell her to send me a pic of that lad to try and carry on where we left off on the conversation.
She replies ‚Äòha that‚Äôs what annoyed you, don‚Äôt lie to me woman üëÖ, just admit it and I‚Äôll send you a pic‚Äô
I‚Äôm sat there now putting 2 and 2 together thinking wtf, admit what? But i know she was trying to get a reaction out of me and the only thing I can place it on was she was trying to get to admit I was annoyed over her talking about this lad, which is incredibly weird and I still think to this day she was trying to get me to admit I was jealous. 
Anyway so at that point I just felt I needed to ask her if she liked me in that way, to which she said no and appeared very confused. So I was a little confused as she just must have been being a real weirdo then but I was cool with her.

A few days pass and I know it‚Äôs going to be a little awkward but she‚Äôs still going through a hard time and so I message her just asking if she‚Äôs in uni, she replies no and tells me she‚Äôs feeling shit. So I try and take her mind off it and ask her how her weekend was and she just reads it and ignores it. 
The next day I message her trying to be funny but kinda calling her out for ignoring me (my mistake) and she just blows up at me throwing everything I did for her back in my face and telling me to use my common sense, being really really defensive and very harsh. she basically said sometimes she just doesn‚Äôt feel like replying to me to which I took the hint and didn‚Äôt carry on the convo. She comes back at me half an hour later with an essay telling me that I was accusing her of liking me and she doesn‚Äôt know where I‚Äôve got that from and that she‚Äôs very confused. I reply saying i just needed to clear things up as something was off and I‚Äôm actually dating someone so couldn‚Äôt have something like that at uni. 
She tells me that she thinks i do have feelings for her and that she thinks that I think she‚Äôs playing a game and playing hard to get. So i tell her again I‚Äôm dating someone and so I don‚Äôt have feelings for her and she replies again basically saying the same thing: ‚ÄòI think you do have feelings for me though‚Äô. I tell her again that I was only trying to be there for her and she tells me again she thinks i have feelings for her. 

I haven‚Äôt spoken to her properly in a month, only one little conversation about what date we are back at uni, I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm not very worried about seeing her again as she‚Äôs just so intense and so set on me having feelings for her whilst she told me she‚Äôs straight (and I respected that). I also can‚Äôt ignore my instincts which were telling me very strongly that she had feelings for me. I see her again late this month when uni starts again. 

I guess I just wanted to get it out of my system and am looking for some advice as quite honestly the whole situation is beyond me and the way she‚Äôs twisted it has made me feel like I‚Äôm in the wrong and very uncomfortable with seeing her again. 

Any insight would be appreciated! Thankyou.",01Jan2020,1
547," My teenaged son has a friend who is about 17 1/2. He is basically homeless and tries to find friends houses to crash at each night. He has a sibling in the area (who is a young adult) but his parents live far away and apparently living with them is not an option. He asked me to take him in and my heart aches for him but i don't know what to do. He has some mental health issues (bipolar, odd, depression, anxiety) and smokes pot and vapes. I have younger children living in the house who adore him, and my older teen has some similar issues. So far he has been respectful when he's here and better behaved than my son, tbh.

When I talked with him I got mixed messages. He really wants a family and a mom, but he also doesn't want to give up his lifestyle of hanging out with friends all day and smoking pot. He is almost 18 so I realize I can't exert as much control as I would with a younger child. I told him my criteria for him staying here would be that he'd have to be in counseling for his mental health issues and he'd have to be either employed or in school. (In addition to following house rules.) I don't think he's able to abide by that. My daughter is making me feel bad for setting these boundaries because the effect is him probably being on the street. She thinks I should just let him crash here and live his life as long as he is staying out of trouble (which he does) and follows my house rules while he's here (which he also has so far.) He does want to get a job and has asked for help with that, and I would definitely never give him money directly but I would be giving him food and shelter.

Meanwhile other adults think I'm crazy for even considering taking him in. I feel sad that it is so easy for everyone to turn their backs and justify it in one way or another.

I know the boundaries I've set are reasonable, but they also seem elitist. How is a kid who has never had guidance or support supposed to suddenly jump through hoops?  Especially when he is just coming to terms with his mental health issues (recently diagnosed.) He has no support and no stability.

How do I help him without enabling him? I also worry about my ability as a caregiver. I've had some life events this year and my own kids have needs that I am struggling with.

Even just writing this out has helped me so thank you already, just for providing this forum.",01Jan2020,1

549,About half a month ago I was going through an exstreamly hard time and had shut myself out as I usually do. So my beat friend texted me to ask if I was alright and I responded of course cause I always fall for peer pressure to respond to people. I've helped this friend numerous times mind you and God the worst of em too. But I was getting super low and they asked me to open up and well I did cause I felt like I didnt have a choice so I talked about my dark thoughts what I've been feeling and they got mad even though they wanted me to open up? In the past aswell they had been very obsessive almost acting like we were dating (we are both the same gender and I am straight but she kept also trying to push the fact I was something else? Even though they know I'm not????) So about a week later of not responding to them because I was honestly hurt deeply by them doing that to me I was always kind of weighed down by them  I finally responded and said it would be best to go separate ways and that I needed to recover and they like wouldnt stop clinging onto me? Even though they saw I was done? So now I am much happier without them but did I make the right choice? Or have I made a mistake? Cause they were nice and all but I'm not sure from the obbsessiveness to the anger to how they acted. Like did I REALLY make the right choice on letting them go? Or am I just an asshole for doing that to them? (They were a nice person and did a lot of good things for me but I'm just not sure and need advice I guess?),01Jan2020,1

Shes always been a kind of sensitive person, very quiet and relaxed all the time. 

She recently went on a 10 day cruise with some of her friends to celebrate one of there birthdays. 

She haven't specifically said anything to me but I suspect something may have happened to her during this time. 

To explain... since she has been home she's been very jumpy like anxious jumpy always being frightened when she sees me saying I 'snuck up on her' when I havent.  

The biggest thing was 2 nights ago we're having sex and just out of nowhere she begins sobbing? I freak out and we immediately stop having sex then she begins to get angry and try pushing my chest and swatting me away. I move away and ask her what's wrong. She says ""I want to stop now I'm allowed to stop now"" she says this quite angrily before she starts crying again. I hug her and tell her everything is ok. After she's cried for a while she keeps saying ""sorry"" and ""it's not my fault"" and then the worst she says ""I promise i said no"" 

That to me sounds really bad like she was assaulted or something ? And I'm led to believe it happened while she was on the cruise because she dident act like this before she left and I've basically been with her the entire time since she got home. 

I asked her what she meant but she refused to tell me. I even asked her again the following morning and she just goes ""nothing don't worry about it"". 

My question is what should I do now ? Should I continue trying to pry information out of her or just leave her be and she'll say whatever she needs to when she's ready? 

What if she never says anything? I really am not sure what to do 

I've tried to ask one of the girls she went with if anything had happened to her and she had no clue what I was talking about and said she seemed fine on the trip. 

What is the best thing I can do here ? I want her to know she can talk to me and I don't want to force her to say anything but at the same time if she was assaulted or something serious like that I'd really really like to know ... 

Help?",01Jan2020,1

How can I ever measure up with that? I love learning and I'm a competitive person but I just don't have the brain power to do anything useful.

554,"Long story short, basically, at the NYE party we were playing a game where someone asks other person question silently, he answers the question loudly by telling someones name, and then they flip the coin if they have to tell the question out loud. By that I got to know that the girl I like for about 2 years out of 6 of us (4F and 2M) would choose me to never talk to ever again. Later on I got voted as the person who most likely would end up in jail or cheat on sb when I have NEVER EVER even fucking drank or smoked in my life, like what? That, actually, hit me really hard, but I always try to hide my negative emotions,so I did. The rest of the party wasn't fun at all for me, so in the morning, me and my friend (M)  went home in our ways, we didnt sleep at all, came back home, slept for like 4 hours, ate a little bit,now Im home alone and suddenly a few times in a 2 hour span I just suddenly start going crazy, crying, I cant stand in one place, I feel anxious about something. I try to sleep, because something just doesnt feel right, I dont know what it is, maybe something hurts in my chest, maybe its my brain going crazy, I just basically dont know what is going on. Can someone help, the hell is going on with me, what should I do?",01Jan2020,1
555,"I've always been a bit sad every time the year ends but it might just be my brain tricking me so I don't know.

Every year I spend NYE with my family, watching the Twilight Zone, drinking sparkling cider, and watching the fireworks whenever midnight hits. I don't have any problems with this, but when I check my Instagram or Snapchat the next day, I see that most (if not all) of my friends had been at some sort of gathering that all look like a lot of fun. However, I've never been invited to one, and my mother (being more traditional I guess? It's hard to tell with her) would probably be upset if asked to go to one.

I don't want to force my way into one, and I don't want my family to be upset. Any tips for next year?",01Jan2020,1

558,"Longish story shortish:

I went to college in nyc last year, and within the first 2 weeks found myself an interesting group of people on the roof of a music venue I liked, and this one girl, let's call her Fran, was running house shows out of her apt as a youth arts collective. I went to a lot of their shows and got to know them and their crowd. Definitely the highlight of last year as it's inspiring me to start my own culture and arts stuff at the college I'm going to now.

But to trace back, at the time of going to the shows I didn't like her necessarily but knew I appreciated what she was doing and yeah, she cute. But to open up a personal door here for just a a second, the same year I started my journey with psychoactives and psychedelics, and one thing I noticed was that on some trips I ""psyched myself out"" on the journey, where I'd connect or sync up more with some of my friends but this would only be happening in my head uncorrelated to social reality.

Last night I went to a NYE rave function that a lot of that crew was headed to, and I haven't seen that crowd in about 6 months. I buy my ticket and head in and catch up with those friends, and moral of the story is I found myself crushing on Fran. I was going to dance with her at one point for fun but got nervous and didn't. I didn't want to ""shoot my shot"" because she took molly. I was able to talk to her earlier in the night though and it was fun. I was able to say goodbye and give her a hug before she left.

The thing is that I kind of found closure tonight in thinking about her, and I can go on and do my own thing now because logistically even though we live 30 min apart our timelines just are very asynchronous and have only crossed paths by chance. 

If I were to tell her I like her, idek what I'd be getting out of it. The unlikely chance she'd reciprocate? Just letting her know? I feel as though there is nothing wrong with at least vocalizing it and seeing what happens from there. Unfortunately I don't see her in person much so it'd have to mention it in a concise dm :///

560,"I have worked in an adventure park as an adventure guide, a sales advisor in a store, a marketing intern in a renewable energy initiative, an administrator at a community centre and completed a work placement in content management systems. 

I get the impression that most managers see little good in me. This is partly because I am quirky and struggle with details. For example I would occasionally forget to scan items and get in bother and I have been told off for being too personal with customers or going off topic and talking for too long. I am under the impression that I get into more bother than other people at work. 

Despite my difficulties with work I am actually very educated. I have an Ma in Philosophy from a top ten university, and enough other qualifications to metaphorically sink a ship. I can understand abstract verbal ideas much easier than other people and often find it easy to write content that people find engaging, easy to understand and interesting. I can also generate ideas and link concepts together very quickly. Unfortunately I haven't been able to find a job that matches these abilities.

562,"My apologies for this lengthy post, but I don't know where I can seek out advice elsewhere anonymously.

&amp;#x200B;

I think it's best if I provide a little background.

I'm a 20 year-old male, I come from a lovely family and a good economical and social situation as a whole, completed an education in vehicle diagnostics and specialization, and currently studying to become an Automotive Engineer, I can't complain and I really shouldn't, but I've ran myself aground in the field of love and relationships, up to this point that it affects my grades and worse, my social skills.

Up until puberty I never was interested in girls or relationships, it just didn't appeal to me and I did whatever I liked, such as playing games and various sports such as volleyball and judo, until my friends suddenly became interested in girls, and had girlfriends, encouraging eachother to do the same, and so I tried, I never was a good speaker and regularly locked up during small talk or conversations, I just couldn't help it, the responses of course were negative, bullies saw an opportunity to degrade me and the girls would be far from interested, I once was even used as a ""punishment"" when a girl lost a bet and had to ask if she wanted to be my girlfriend, it was a shameful experience and I felt that I wasn't taken seriously, so I casted myself out for 2 years with the exception of a couple of good friends, became a dork and that was how it went until I graduated from high school and began college for the specialization of vehicle diagnostics.

I began to develop physically when I was 16, growing unusually tall (6'9"" or 2,06m to this day), but my width more or less stayed the same, which became a second insecurity later on in life, somehow college wasn't that bad, the people were friendly and the education itself was fun to do, but that feeling for affection, love, that someone cherishes you the way you are began to infest and soon would, little to my knowledge, play a big part of my personal life for years to come, I didn't have any girls in class, nor was the wing I was situated in, so with a negative impact about girls from previous experiences and being alienated from them 4 years more didn't help one bit.

I'd lost the ability to speak to girls out of fear of what they would think of me, I was scared to death and even would try to make no eye contact with them whatsoever, the only woman I'd speak to was my younger sister, whom I love dearly, my mother, and a couple of teachers, although the latter one was achieved with great difficulty, after 4 years of zoning myself out and missing an important experience, I graduated.

It's now that I regret the choices I've made and that I didn't do anything about it, I feel like I've missed the boat on many things and that it's a lost opportunity that I'll never get to experience again, I can't stop thinking about it, the desires every man wants to experience (I'm not gonna lie, most of us have been through it, we all want to know this ""heavenly"" thing called sex), it's driving me nuts but I can't bring myself to face a woman and strike a conversation, because of sheer anxiety and fear of rejection, bringing myself to repeatedly reflect upon myself and mistakenly comparing to other, more successful peers, with muscular bodies, shining confidence and appealing aesthetics, it was the final straw for my self-esteem and I became a hermit, I don't go out to party, I'm still a virgin and worse, my social skills are nothing short of utterly disgusting.

It's been half a year this way and I want to get out of it, I don't want to end up hating the world, becoming a sad envious man with nothing to do but study and surf the internet all day, there have been times that I parked my car during my travel to school, looked at the building and just broke down emotionally, I don't want to end up like Elliot Rodger 2.0, having read his manifesto that his way of thinking was (and still is) absolutely terrifying.

I've tried and I'm still trying to better myself, getting fit and doing regular exercise, reading books and finding topics to talk about that might be interesting, hell, I even started making a Tinder and Badoo account, but everytime a message comes through and I realize that this is very much a real woman chatting with me, I get nauseous, up to the point of getting sick and throwing up, too afraid to message back after the first initial try, stopping periodically until the unhealthy desire for sex awakens again and disrupts my entire thinking, I can't focus on my study, I can't focus on long-term goals, pornographic material is no longer interesting because I know it's fake and deluding, yet I want to experience it so badly.

Even so my ask for advice sounds more like a cry for help, I don't want to live like this anymore, I can't, it'll be the death of me, in the worst scenario a premature one with all the consequences involved, how do I start climbing out of this hole I've dug myself?",01Jan2020,1
563,"Sorry if it's too hard to understand what I'm trying to say, English isn't my first language.

My dad has a problem with alcohol since I was born (I'm 14 now), and this made me suffer for many years.
My life in his house was a nightmare, my mom getting beated (me too, sometimes) by my dad, and the smell of alcohol and cigarettes... It was horrible.
I don't live with him anymore, I live with my mom, my grandma and my grandpa, but my dad goes to see me sometimes.
In holidays I go to my other grandma's house (my father's mom) because she misses me.
I was happy, because even if we had problems on the past, now everything was good, or so I thought.
Yesterday, my dad texted me that he wanted me to go to his girlfriend's house, and to sleep there.
I didn't want to, I love my dad but I don't trust him, and his girlfriend drinks too so...
He called me, but it wasn't his number, it was my grandma's, so I knew he lost his phone (it means he was at some dangerous place), again...
He called me and said I needed to go out and enjoy life (I don't go out of my bed because I don't like people to see me, not even my mom, I think I'm ugly, but I don't say anything to my mom or my dad, I just say I sleep too much), but I know that my mom wouldn't let me go, so I say ""did you ask mom?"" He said ""no, I can't call her, she blocked me"" (it's because everytime he's drunk he would text her and call her names) so I say that I will text her and see if she let me go.

So I text her and she gets crazy, she said to not open the door if it's him, call the police if something happens. But the thing that scared me the most was that she called me and said to me to pass the phone to my grandma, I passed, but I hear her saying that my dad still has a problem with alcohol, drugs and has friends with the same problems. I start to cry.

I thought he already stopped with this, I thought everything was over, but now I can't even stand up, this Is a trauma, it's scaring me. Please help, how can I get my dad out of this, what can I do for him??

After reading a letter of a hearing she had, she admitted to stealing an iPhone, 2 sets of airpods, and an Apple watch. Another phone has been stolen but there was insufficient evidence to put against her.

She gave her mum a new phone for Christmas, she then told me her dad had given her a apple watch and airpods, which she then said she had sold because she didn't need them.

We've been together for nearly 9 months. She had been accused of theft in the workplace prior to this, where we met, but I didn't believe it.

569,"Exactly the title. And yes, a throwaway.

I might be being too harsh, but some of the stuff he says about my friends and I, then showing how toxic he can be sometimes just scares me. I get really nervous hanging out with him (even with our group chats on Discord) and I'm worried about the things that he might say. For instance, my friend called him a p\*\*o as a joke for something he'd said earlier, which he then responds with ""only the gays are p\*\*os."" Obviously, it was a joke but it made my other friend really uncomfortable, especially since he's only outed himself to a limited number of people. Or even if he's won a game or beat us in an exam, he'd go on about it. ""What's that? All I hear are bad grades."" ""Sis really said 'irrelevant.'"" and whenever I brought up the subject to him: ""Shut up no one asked you!"" These are some of the things that he loves to say regularly.

He tends to say that I never listen to him when he has a problem and brings me down for it. If he's mad at me and giving his side of the story, then I'll listen. But if i even dare to disprove to anything he's saying, no matter how true it is, he just insults and fires back at me saying I didn't get his point/fighting against me with insults. Its either that or he just leaves. For instance, when I was once mad at him a year before, and refused to speak to him, he went up to me and said ""(my name), holding a grudge against someone is stupid and weak and you shouldn't do it."" Since then, I've found myself so pressured to keep in a state of mind where I can't be mad at him for a long period of time, no matter what he's said. Now, as of recent, we recently got into a fight and he said: ""I don't like it when people do something to annoy someone and then expect them to be nice to them."" At that point, I was just speechless. He started discussing that every time I'm nice to him after an argument and he's ""forced to be nice to me back"" (his words), it negatively impacts him. I'm so anxious to talk to him and it's up to the point where I'm scared to fight against him for the year he's just going to patronize me or use my words against me. I'm giving up. 

I'd never say any of this to his face. I hate to confront anyone about anything negative, but especially if it's something along the lines of ""I don't want to be friends with you because the things you say make me uncomfortable."" I could never muster the courage to do it. Not even just that, but who knows what drama this could get me in. I know that I could lose a lot of friends from unfriending this person and the only person I've told about this prefers that everyone remain civil without any fighting. Another reason I'm worried about doing it is because this person was raised in a partially racist and extremely strict family and i dont want to impact his mental health for than it already is. Due to this, I've just been excusing his behaviour as just expressing his anger at us, but I genuinely don't know what the case is anymore. I'm just at a loss for everything and it's starting to really impact me. Reddit, can you help me out?",01Jan2020,1
570,"So this might be kind of a smaller problem, but I‚Äòd like to hear your opinion on this, maybe I get an idea how to solve this in the future. I‚Äòll provide a bit of information first.

Every year around Christmas, my family visits my grandparents. Sometimes it is for a few days all over the holidays (like this year), but every year it is at least the 25th of December. 
My grandparents have three children. One of them is my mum. My aunt is also important for this, my uncle just visits occasionally as he lives right next to my grandparents and thus doesn‚Äôt need any space in their house.

There are 7 grandchildren, while 5 sleep in my grandparents house. My uncle‚Äòs two children tend not to visit and aren‚Äôt important for this story. The house has enough space for all of the core family and due to habits in the past the rooms are mostly distributed as they are every year. Actually this doesn‚Äôt really fit anymore, but that is another thing. 

My grandfather is almost 90 and has dementia and incontinence. My grandmother fosters him, but as she is 84 this gets harder each year. So basically she as a lot of work with him, which is why the rest of us should mostly care for themselves. She does a great job with him but nevertheless it affects her quite a lot. 

My cousin is 33 and phoned my grandmother before Christmas whether she can bring her boyfriend over the holidays. She said yes, which of course is her right as it is her house. But as he is not the core family this brings problems towards the room situation as well as more effort from her side. My cousin ‚Äúforgot‚Äú about my brother and me, which is ridiculous as we are there each year. After a lot of discussion the room problem was solved, but shouldn‚Äôt be the last. 

Those five grandchildren I mentioned are my brother (25) and me (28) as well as my cousin (F33) and her brothers (27&amp;30). As we are all adults we can care for ourselves and don‚Äôt have to bother my grandmother. My mom and her husband came a few days later, my freshly divorced aunt who is a bit of a stressful person was also sleeping in the house. 

Of course there are discussions and hecticness when so many people are around, but most of us act quite reasonable due to the situation with my grandfather. Except my cousin!

She is friendly and happy as long as she gets her will. If this is not the case, she gets angry. This also applies to my aunt, but not at all as much as to my cousin. 

In the past we mostly tried to please her to keep the harmony and to keep away stress from my grandmother. But as the state of my grandfather gets worse my mother and I cannot accept this anymore. 

Some examples: she occupies the kitchen with her boyfriend to make food only half of the family wants. This takes ages, they argue loudly while cooking, listening to music loudly. When my aunt didn‚Äôt want to close a window due to my cousin asking to she got wild and started screaming at my aunt. She leaves her waste behind and drinks my grandparents‚Äò expensive wine bottles without asking (while most of the bottles were gifts from my mum‚Äôs husband). Her boyfriend occupies space which has to be given up by other family members while none of the rest of the grandchildren brought a partner. Because of him the biggest guest room gets occupied by them, leaving my brother an me with the worst beds. My girlfriend as well as my cousin‚Äòs brothers‚Äò girlfriends didn‚Äôt visit. 

My mum asked my aunt to step in as it is her child which causes most of the problems. But my aunt refuses to do so. In her opinion my cousin is an adult herself and she isn‚Äôt responsible for her anymore. Also due to my cousin‚Äôs character my aunt doesn‚Äôt want to argue with her anymore as she fears the confrontation.

The main problem is the situation of my grandparents. We don‚Äôt want to start a fight because this would be unfair towards them as our visit is a highlight for them and harmony should be the aim. 

But I figured this cannot be the solution. When we try to keep the harmony by don‚Äôt facing my cousins temper we somehow accept this and she keeps doing things with her selfish behavior. This bothers the rest of us too much. I don‚Äôt see why we should tidy up her waste, listen to her loud music or accepting other wishes just so she doesn‚Äôt start screaming around. She can do all of this at her home when nobody is around, but when a lot of people come together thoughtless has no room. 

Communication is difficult. My cousin doesn‚Äôt see herself as the problem. She doesn‚Äôt reflect the situation thus nothing improves. When anyone tries to do something against her will it will lead to fights.

About a year and a half ago I (19f) worked with a guy (23m) and we started txting lots on Snapchat after I stopped working with him. 

Chats got pretty sexual and he asked me to hook up with him. He would invite me to come over all the time and I always made up excuses because I was shy and scared. We talked for months only on Snapchat though and I really liked him.

I later found out that he was telling his friends sexual stuff I was saying to him and he even told them that I was the one asking to hook up with him even though he was the one asking me. I was told that he was acting like he didn‚Äôt want to do anything with me and he acted like it was all me trying to sleep with him. 

I think he was just trying to brag about how girls liked him but he didn‚Äôt want to admit that he was trying to hook up with me bc he was ashamed or something. I‚Äôm pretty sure he was only talking to me because he was bored and lonely and desperate. There were so many signs while it was happening but I ignored all of them. 

Which broke my heart and really messed up my self-esteem. I blocked him and hand not talked to him in months. 

But since then I‚Äôve lost over 100 pounds, got my braces off, moved out on my own and stopped drinking. Somewhat have my life together now. I started working for the same place we used to work at and he‚Äôs working there too he‚Äôs been really sweet and I really like talking to him and he asked me to come over and chill sometime.

583,"So my friend \[24F\] has not gotten her license. She has anxiety issues, and gave up trying to learn how to drive. Thus she doesn't have a car, and has to uber to work every day. I personally struggled with the fear of driving, though probably not as big of a fear, six years ago when I was learning. I successfully got my license, and have never been pulled over, gotten a ticket, in an accident, etc.  I'm not trying to brag I'm just stating my qualifications haha. I would love to help her, because I feel like driving yourself saves a lot of money, and it's just more reliable than uber. 

Her boyfriend has tried to teach her how to drive, but he doesn't seem like the best teacher. He gets easily frustrated so I think she just decided to give up on his lessons. She doesn't really have any family members around who would teach her, so I thought since I'm around like every day I'd try and help. I just don't know how to approach such a touchy subject. We've been friends for about  eight months, but I'm really nervous because I don't want to offend her or make her upset. What is the best way to ask my friend if she would like to learn to drive with my help? I feel like bringing it up out of the blue is weird, but that could be just me.

TLDR: Is it better to live with 3 random girls in a very nice apartment or 3 girls that I know but aren‚Äôt great friends with in less nice of apt. 

Two options, more details. 

1. I could live in the apartment I am in now. It‚Äôs a very nice 4 bedroom, two bath, furnished apartment that I like a lot. I live there now with one friend from high school but we can‚Äôt live together next year. So if I stay here I will likely live with 3 random girls. The apartment is about two minutes away from the house I describe below. 

2. I play on a club college rugby team. I joined late in the semester so while I get along with the girls I am by no means best friends with any of them. Actually I feel like the odd man out. But they have been making more of an effort in inviting me out. We have a rugby house where many of my teammates live. I‚Äôve been invited to live there next year. I‚Äôm pretty sure they just invited me because someone backed out and they need someone. I know I‚Äôd likely get stuck with the smaller room and I would have to share one bathroom with 3 people. The house is also a bit older and is not furnished. The house is also where we have a lot of parties (doesn‚Äôt bother me) so I would be in the center of the action. I just don‚Äôt know if living with them will help me become more included or will the three girls group together and I become more of the odd man out? Two of the girls are practically best friends the other I like and get along with pretty well.",01Jan2020,1

586,"Hi! Recently I've been having problems with this and I just need reassurance weather I'm truly just being too sensitive or are the ugly emotions that I'm feeling are valid. During first years of high school I had many friends and went out a lot. My parents were fine with it, although they often made me feel like shit for going out and not spending time with them. I was always afraid to ask them if I can go out not because they wouldn't let me (because I knew they would), but because I didn't want them to give me /that/ disappointed look. Later on my friend circle started to narrow, but I wasn't upset because of that. I'm an introvert, I don't like being surrounded by many people, some people I called friends I didn't even honestly like. I don't even like going out, I'd way rather spend my time at home by myself, watching a movie or something. I had a few friends that we would hang out at the times, I also spent more time with my family and everything seemed to be great (if we ignore my dad constantly muttering that I never go out anymore).

But here we are now. I'm 19 years old, finished high school and decided to take a gap year. I took a gap year because first of all I need to figure out what I truly want to do with my life and I needed a huge break from school before continuing any further education. My parents were perfectly fine with that, they supported my decisions and were honestly happy for me. For 3 months I worked abroad with my dad and earned a fair amount of money. I came back home for a break during winter (since my workplace didn't need me during winter) and I might go back to working during spring, although I'm not sure yet. The problem is. As I said I didn't have many friends during the last years of high school. After high school I still stayed in touch with 2 of my best friends and I talk with a few more from time to time, but we're not that close. Since both of my friends are in universities in different towns across the country, we don't meet that often (maybe 1 or 2 time every two weeks). And my family (especially my father) thinks I'm a fucking loser. 

They always complain about me not going out and shame me for just being the way that I am. Just a few hours ago I overheard their conversation with their friends (people I hardly know). They were talking about me. How I never go out, hardly have any friends, they were making fun of my driving, how I never want to drive, telling specific examples of when my car went off in the intersection (while fully knowing I'm super insecure about my driving, driving makes me anxious and causes my panic attacks, I'm just not a good driver no matter how much I wish I was). Their friends now think I'm a complete idiot. Not only they confirm my fear of them thinking of me as a loser, but also share it all with people that I don't even know. 

I know I'm a loser. I know I suck at driving. I know I don't have friends. I know that I fucking suck. So why am I so mad? Is it wrong of me to feel so upset over it? I can't stop crying and I feel so stupid because it's not like they did anything wrong.

I‚Äôm currently feeling extremely guilty, I am an 18 year old boy, about to head to college.
I met up with my 17 year old cousin ( 16 is the age of consent in my area )who my mother had breastfed, technically making her my sister.
I met up with her 3 days ago and something had come over me. I was feeling a little too horny that day, so when she arrived at our house I was just sitting down with her and looking through old family photos when, I suddenly just felt the urge to do something. I grabbed her thighs gently, slowly making my way up her legs; she wasn‚Äôt saying anything. I started grabbing her behind and her breasts slowly as to not scare her I guess? But then I started feeling as if I should stop. I apologized a lot and asked her not to mention it to anyone, then I said that I was sorry. She said that to calm me down we should get some fresh air and go outside to take a walk. I was feeling very bad and dirty, I still do. She left later in the day and I once again reassured her that I was sorry and reminded her not to mention it to anyone. She said she did not want to talk about it and that she wouldn‚Äôt mention it to anyone. Even though she said this, I still feel very guilty.
I have 2 questions:
1) can you guys please give some advice?
2) does this count as sexual harassment? She did not fight me in any way and I stopped myself, also she was above the age of consent, so can I get in legal trouble?
Thank you

We take care of the cats outside our house and they're basically our pets, there were three kittens outside and two of them have gone missing, they don't have collars or anything. I suspect that they've gone outside, nobody ever takes enough care to not let them outside the gate so I'm not suprised they slipped away, There's a road outside the gate and we see people walking their dogs around, I've seen other strays as well so I don't think they'll be able to survive.

I've tried calling for them but I didn't hear any meows, I also made them comfortable with cars accidently by letting them cuddle in one with me since it was cold and they tried to get in the car next day while it was moving.

Is there any way I can get them back, I can't go outside myself because I recently had a surgery and my parents are being overprotective and won't let me go outside.

It's also FREEZING outside, I'm inside covered up and I'm cold, it's terrible outside, and I've never seen my kitten hunt prey once even though they played a lot, so there's no way for them to get food, not to mention they've been gone since yesterday and i stupidly believed my parents when they told me they've seen the kitten go outside many times, my parents aren't also worried and they never liked the kittens because my mom's allergic and the kittens made a mess when they came inside, they're also super religious and think my kittens won't die unless it's their time and if they are dead, they'll tihnk we probably couldn't do anything anyways to save them, basically they don't believe my kittens will die no matter what if it's simply not god's will",01Jan2020,1

She said she‚Äôs not gonna come after me or anything like that, and that she plans to stay with the current boyfriend for the foreseeable future, they have a house together and are doing well.

Now despite this being my first time our older sister made me out to be a creep and wanted me no where close to our younger sister was actually wanting to hang around me.

And the only reason our older sibling was mad was because the younger is very shy. Before this happened we would barely see her because she‚Äôd always be in her room. She‚Äôd get eat in there and really half ass conversation. After we had sex she was the opposite always trying to sit next to me or talk to me. Yet our older assumed I was persuading her so she got me kicked out.

Now my parents let me back in and said I should do better for a new year. I don‚Äôt know what that means or what she told them. My older sis does look pissed I am back still and doesn‚Äôt want to be around me. I don‚Äôt know if she‚Äôll snitch on me if I even try talking to my little sister again but the damage is probably done.

I don‚Äôt know I really need texting tips with flirting or general conversation pointers... I mean I literally lost my virginity to my sister... either way we haven‚Äôt spoke much since I came back and I really don‚Äôt know what I should do now.

I really wasn‚Äôt trying to sex her again, I really just liked how she came out of her shell. She actually interested me and seemed like she could be a cool person.

606," So, three semesters ago i was put on academic probation for failing one of my core chem E classes, (I got two Cs, and a A that semester too, so my semester gpa was below the cutoff, even know my cumulative was a 2.95. This happened because my mom has stage four cancer and my best friend of four years who i loved decided to ghost me, and i was deeply depressed over it, and truly struggled to get out of bed. I ended up getting an incomplete that year in physics too, since i could cite medical reasons, but i was still on probation.

Well, i went to counseling and tried to put more time into studies, got out of probation, got a internship at my dream job(sandia national labs, making algae biofuels) and while i was out in california working, i slowly started to get to the point where I wasn't suicidal anymore.

I came back to school the semester after the internship actually happy, and ready to work. I felt that since i felt better now i could sign up for all the hard classes and do well in them. This was my mistake.I signed up for 18 credit hours. of almost entirely math. Physics 2, calc3 the hardest C++ wipeout class in my school+ lab, Chemical engineering thermodynamics, and then 4 credit hours of explosive engineering just for fun.

Well I tried to study hard for them all but boy did I learn that that was too much math for me to handle. I ended up dropping calc 3 and C++, but really late in the semester because i didn't want to give up. By this time, trying to juggle them all had given me really bad inital test scores in physics and thermo, and i set down to try to ace the finals, to pass. I studied for 16 hours everyday in study groups, and alone,for two weeks for those tests. I understood them better than I ever have before, but for physics it wasn't enough, and I got a D. For Chem E thermo i got a 69. (I got a A in my 4 credits of explosives tho)This was because the professor gave us a 9 page exam, 5 of those pages really difficult short answer questions. I spent about a hour and 10 minutes of our two hours giving really well written answers to them, since i assumed they would be worth a decent amount(they weren't labeled point wise, and were only worth like, 30/120 pts) and then focused on the last three word problems. I got one done and half of another. and walking out realized i had plugged in the wrong value for one of the fractions that is carried through the page long problem for the whole one. The last time that happened on his test( i switched a bound on a page long problem) he gave me 20/40 points. and when i went to him about it, he gave me 5 points back.

Now I talked to him. and a 69 is a D to him. But if i can get even 4 points back on that problem on my final, I will pass the class and not be on probation again! He agreed to meet with me to go over the test.

But as of right now, I am on academic deficiency. My department is deciding if they should kick me out of the school and I am so terrified. All i want to do is work in engineering on algae and materials. I know i fucked up, and took 4 credits of winter classes that are done now, with As to raise my gpa to 3.0 again, but if my professor doesn't help me...

About a month ago we got a new house and moved about an hour away from where we used to live. To save some money we decided not to go with a moving company and move all our stuff ourselves.

I mentioned it today after it happening again while telling her a story about my ex husband. It was just a silly story about a bad Christmas gift I had received many years ago and how when I see this home appliance it reminds me f this story, to which I am met with ‚Äúthats why you‚Äôre divorced, so you don‚Äôt have to talk about it anymore‚Äù  my Lord, I was telling a story about my life and past! Nothing traumatic nothing intense. Just a sister to sister story. 

When I tried to confront it gently she lost her mind and then starts saying I‚Äôm ‚Äútaking it too far, being too sensitive‚Äù etc etc...

This woman tells me my kids (who are two teen girls in the midst of being emo teens, but aside from that are truly lovely people, who get very good grades and are wonderful very functional people) that they need therapy. Meanwhile she is dropping ‚Äúmicro doses‚Äù of acid more regularly than one would think for a 41 year old woman, drinks heavily regularly, barks at her two children and literally puts everyone down around her. 

I see her kids suffering as a result of her behavior and her husband has already had multiple affairs since they got together.

And although divorced, own my own home, live very independently in a rugged area, and have been in a successful happy relationship for 4 years with a great guy. 

Just really bums me out that when she wants to vent about ANYTHING I always take the time to be compassionate and empathic of my sisters personal struggles or an ear when she needs to vent. But if I say ANYTHING, it‚Äôs treated dismissively, without any interest or regard and she denies that she does this. I am NOT an over sensitive person and try to see both sides of things.

I'm 21years old, and honestly don't have a single close friend. I have always struggled with building good friendships, but lately it's been really bothering me. Especially seeing how happy everyone was for New year's spending it with friends, getting all dolled up, and going out to parties.. meanwhile I'm on the couch in my pyjamas with my boyfriend, asleep by 10pm. 

Not to say that I don't enjoy his company, because I surely do. But my boyfriend is my boyfriend, and he can't be my best girlfriend. He just can't relate to me on that level which I feel I'm missing in my life. 

I've had a couple friends from past workplaces, and those friendships have always been either 1) one sided, me always reaching out trying to connect, or 2) turns out there is romantic interest from the other party.. I recently had a ""friend"" booty call me at 11:30pm asking me to come to her hotel room, after having an issue with her husband.

How do adults make friends? Is the question that has been on my mind for quite some time. I don't even work with people my age, therefore making it much harder for someone like me to get to know people. If anyone has advice or a simikar story, I'd be very open to hearing it.

612,"I (24F) have a non-existent sex life with my (25M) fianc√©. We‚Äôve been together for 2 years now and never really ever have sex. The first few months of our relationship we did, maybe once every couple weeks. My fianc√© and myself both have low sex drives. I blame mine on having too many relationships where it seemed like sex was the main focus and was expected from me, so I‚Äôve always had kind of a bad point of view when it comes to sex. But with my fianc√©, I love him so much and our relationship is great. Suddenly I want to have sex a lot more because I feel comfortable with him. 

The problem is that he never initiates or asks if I want to have sex. Or when he does, maybe once a month, he says he wants to ‚Äútry‚Äù to have sex or says he has to do it before eating because he feels gross after eating. (He also has a problem with finishing too soon which probably makes him feel worse.) It‚Äôs the same kind of response when I ask as well. It always feels like it‚Äôs a chore. This puts me out of the mood in the first place and because he doesn‚Äôt act sexual or like he‚Äôs really into it, it all feels awkward. He‚Äôs also just not good at sex. I‚Äôve thought for a long time he might be gay but he assures me he‚Äôs not...We have had good sex at least a few times but I think we had to be drunk or something for that to happen. 

A big part of his low sex drive might have to do with his stressful job as a psych tech. But I just never feel like he really thinks of me as attractive in a sexual way. I‚Äôve had previous boyfriends who would get turned on just seeing me naked. My fianc√© never seems to care to see me naked or not, ever since the beginning. It‚Äôs almost like he just feels awkward and childish about it all.. leading to me also feeling awkward and childish. 

My fianc√© is definitely not the only problem. We‚Äôve both questioned if we‚Äôre asexual but I realized I‚Äôm not because there are times when I really want sex with him and I just feel rejected. Sometimes I wish I was completely asexual to make things easier. I honestly wish we could be more sexual together and not act shy about our sexuality, but I just don‚Äôt know how to make that happen. 

Any advice is appreciated.

614,"TLDR: My family is emotionally and slightly sexually abusive, although I have been oblivious to it my entire life. I recently asked on r/teenagers if my situation was normal as my family always told me it was and I got a few responses saying that it wasn't. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/ehwzfn/i_dont_know_what_to_think_of_my_family_anymore/) is the post, although I would say it is a bit melodramatic, if you want specific details. I am still not sure what to do about this or if I can/need to do anything about this at all. Any and all help will be appreciated!

Long version from [my post](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/ehwzfn/i_dont_know_what_to_think_of_my_family_anymore/):

*First off, I haven't always been able to defend myself my entire life. I am the smallest person in my family and I have a moderate vision disability, both of which my family has taken advantage of. I can clearly remember several times in the last year where my siblings would touch or hug me when I didn't want them to and they would often restrain me in some way, shape or form to keep me from running away. My Dad also makes comments on how I look and occasionally threatens me whenever I make a mistake.*

*Second, I realized that I witnessed a lot of overly sexual or creepy things as a kid. My brother and sister used to twerk and do other sexually oriented dances when they were way to young, which makes me cringe to even think about. My sister and father also on separate occasions have exposed themselves in front of me. On a less important note, my brother, sister, and father also have made comments on my body that were very much not... right. These things were all deliberate and not accidents, but I have no idea why they happened.*

*Third, my mom has been manipulating and lying to me for my entire life. She always sheltered me as a kid and made no attempt to find things for me to do with others, despite putting my brother through soccer and my sister through dance classes. However, she keeps trying to deny this by telling me that I'm the most fit person in our house and exaggerating every minor social thing that I do, despite the fact that I never leave the house and can barely bring myself to exercise on my own. She also constantly complains about my father not contributing to the family or doing something stupid with our money even though she refuses to take him to counseling or something. Once, she told me that she thinks that he's a sociopath, yet next tells me not to worry about him (she probably doesn't know what ""sociopath"" means anyway). The worst thing she does, though, is pretend to cry during an argument and tell me to HIT her if I am so mad at her. She constantly insists on this or just stares at me until I walk away from her. She pretends that she is nothing like everyone else in my family but she does most of the same stuff as them, especially commenting on my body.*

*Fourth, everyone around me denies all of the above. My family just rationalizes the sexual stuff as being ""funny"" and just passes off the unwanted touching as ""messing around"" or something to that effect. As for my mom, she just starts trying to guilt me into feeling sorry for her having to take care of four children (including my father) and tells me that everything is fine. Everyone tries to include me in whatever terrible things they do and tell me that I will never leave them. Plus, they would always say something to the effect that I am ruining the family and that it's all my fault.*

Again, any and all advice would be appreciated.",01Jan2020,1
615,"
Background info is that I used to be a loner due to HEAVY social anxiety. Meanwhile my best friend M had ton of friends, a boyfriend and a job. I just had school and her. It meant she often chose other activities over me, especially her boyfriend. I sort of just accepted it, but we did have a falling out, and she lost several friends since she only spend time with him. I ended up pulling away since she had plans with him every for a year (I'm not kidding).

I had a super toxic ex during some of this, so when we finally broke up I took a year to work on myself. I got a job, a lot of self worth and beat my anxiety. I also made new friends, whom she tried to befriend too after having lost quite a few of her own. She would always get super angry because I ended up being better friends with the new people than her, which honestly broke my heart because I was finally happy. The tables turned, and I ended up super busy while she ended up kind of shy and more alone. I tried my best to hype her up and I think she made some other friends herself, which was really good for our friendship. We even travelled together and had blast. 

Well I met a guy, N. I actually knew who he was and had a crush on him when we were a little younger, but we were never friends. Turns out we are a great match and have dated since end november, but been official since the 21th december. Initially best friend was happy, but with her coming out of the honey moon phase (her words), and me jumping head first into it, we've had a small falling out. I often slept at his place since he lives right next to both my work and school. Also I'm learning what a healthy relationship is and I'm blown away by how great it is. So I'll admit, I spend all my time with him and ignore her. Although she would go MIA for days when at her boyfriend's place, I still respond to messages the best I can. We went out shopping, out for dinner and partied like 3 times too, so I don't completely ignore her.

It really annoys me though, that she will roll her eyes at me whenever I say something in a group. She'll act dismissive or annoyed when we hang out, giving me mixed signals and taking every opportunity to yell at me. This pushes me right into N's arms, since he does the opposite. She even says I only take his side, when in reality this happened once. We were trying to decide which bar to go to, an expensive one or a cheap one. I said ''We should go to the cheap one because N is broke right now.'' I also knew she only wanted to go to the expensive one because it's ''fancy''. Whenever I mention him, she visibly gets annoyed, but expects me to listen to her endless complaining about how her mom and brother dont get along. She really complained about this every day for a week. I want to add that the last time I got a boyfriend, she had a smaller mental break down, and often stormed out of every conversation. She had also just broken up with her previous ex, but it all just seems like she can't handle when I hang out with others than her and that hurts.

It feels super childish to me, and with her past of choosing her boyfriend over me, I don't feel like I'm the asshole at all for taking a break from her, by hanging out with him. Should I change or is her behaviour justified?",01Jan2020,1

617,"I've deleted more or less all social media. 

I'm locked out of Facebook, and I've disabled IG on my phone to prevent me from browsing through it. 

Here's the problem: I've no friends. I've no money, either, so I feel I can't go out and socialise. I've been job searching since mid-November after having had to resign from my previous employer due to bereavement, but there's hardly anything going‚Äîor anything I'd be able to tolerate. Last time I tried to work in a factory/call centre, I broke down, feeling like I was worthless and inept.

I've sabotaged all volunteer opportunities, too. Am generally unreliable. Sucks to say, but it's the truth. I'm currently undergoing short-term counselling that'll soon end (three sessions remaining), have tried over five anti-depressants with no improvements in either thoughts/moods, etc. 

Feel like a disappointment of a daughter. I've absolutely no joy or desire for anything. GP generally treats me badly due to my mental health. Can't speak to family as they either don't understand/disapprove. 

Overall I'm incredibly bored and have nothing to prevent myself from ruminating. Every activity I used to enjoy, I no longer do. 

Lord, just reading this over makes me feel pathetic. 

TL;DR: Jobless, friendless, broke, and seemingly stuck with TRD (Treatment Resistant Depression). Am currently hating life. 

Any advice as to what other avenues I can explore?

619,"This has happened to my girlfriend and me twice this year. We order a couple of drinks at the bar and then decided to get up and dance a little bit. Our cocktails were still about half full so we covered them with beer mats and we left my girlfriend‚Äôs purse on the bar sitting between the cocktails.  My understanding is that covered drinks is the universal sign for ‚Äúwe‚Äôre on the dance floor and we will be back soon.‚Äù 

About halfway through one song a couple ignored our drinks and my girlfriend‚Äôs purse and sat down in our seats at the bar. I immediately went over and instead of confronting them I just passive-aggressively said ‚Äúexcuse us, let me get our things out of your way‚Äù and picked up our drinks and her purse. 

I didn‚Äôt want to cause a scene and I understand the beer mat seat holder thing is an unwritten rule and doesn‚Äôt guarantee us a seat. However I feel like ignoring our things and taking our seats is bad form. When people are at a club they like to have drinks and also dance and they shouldn‚Äôt lose their seats just because they wanted to dance for a song or two.

How could I have handled the situation better?",01Jan2020,1
620,"So let me start from the beginning. My parents are from another country. They decided to come to America for a better opportunity. They worked for years. My father has become a very reputable contractor and my mother has often worked two jobs. I‚Äôm the oldest of 4 children. ( I‚Äôm 22) Through my whole life I‚Äôve never dealt with hunger or ever needed anything beyond what is required. Food, shelter ect. We aren‚Äôt rich at all but my parents both worked very hard to have the things they have now. So this began shortly after they came to America. My parents decided that they wanted properties in their home country so they managed to buy a few homes through the years. They sent money for maintenance and remodeling in some homes. But since they couldn‚Äôt physically be there they decided that my uncle would be the best choice to be responsible for making that happen. He would be responsible for receiving rent and managing all the money that my parents sent. And most importantly he was responsible for saving it in a account that my parents couldn‚Äôt access outside the country but they trusted him. So years pass. And everything seems to be going good. I was never close to my uncle but I knew of him. And he seemed like a good person. But everything changed one day when my parents decided to check the homes they had. So they sent another family member to take pictures of said homes so that they could be inspected. And to their great surprise all of these homes had no renovations. In fact they where in a worst state than when my parents bought them. So let me remind y‚Äôall my parents fully trusted my uncle. And when he was confronted about this he made excuse after excuse as to why he hadn‚Äôt had the time to do it. Now let me emphasize it has been over 10 years since he was responsible for these properties. Now where my parents are from rent isn‚Äôt expensive. In US currency a house they rented over there would make them about 30$ a month. Not great. But still decent since they had multiple homes. So after that situation with my uncle they decided to check how much money they had in savings. So they sent another family member to check their accounts and they literally had no money. No money at all. 0$. This completely hurt my mother to such a degree she cried for days and wouldn‚Äôt leave the bed. Not only had my uncle(her brother) not use the money that they sent to remodel the homes. He also had not been saving any of it for the last 10 plus years. I believe in total the amount what around 60,000$ plus. Because they would never really talk to me about it. My parents have a home in America and they have money saved here too but that money in their home country was for them to return one day and live their old age there. When I heard what my uncle did I was upset. I‚Äôve always been good about controlling my emotions so my family never saw it. But I promised my self after seeing my mother crying all those nights that I would make sure my uncle would pay for what he did. So now let me fast forward a year from when they found out about what my uncle did. Which is present day. My parents where having an argument. Which is very common and I‚Äôll probably have to go to therapy later in life for it but that‚Äôs another story. So with in this argument and with every one they‚Äôve had since I was able to articulate a decent sentence I‚Äôve been used as a sorta therapist for them. Which of course put a deal lot of pressure on me as a child . Not so much now since I‚Äôve gotten used to it. Or numb to it. But my dad made a comment that made my mother cry hysterically. Long story short I found out my uncle had molested my mom ever since she was 8 years old. He is older than her by years not sure how many. So when I heard this. Once again I was numb to it. But Trust me I felt so much hate  for him. I can‚Äôt really even call him my uncle. I‚Äôm just using that term for the sake of reddit. Let me say this tho my mother hasn‚Äôt legally attacked my uncle. Or flooded him with lawyers simply because of my grandmother. She‚Äôs older and this would completely destroy her. But me on the other hand. I could care less. But I respect my mother‚Äôs wishes tho so I will not seek to do anything until my grandmother passes. But once she does it‚Äôs all fair game. I don‚Äôt know to what extent I would hurt him. In my parents country it‚Äôs very easy to hire to kill someone. And yes it has crossed my mind but no I wouldn‚Äôt do it. Because it would be an easy way out for him. I want him to suffer. I want to destroy him. Not physically . But I want to ruin him financially. Take everything from him. All of it. And then more. I want to kill his spirit and make sure he knows it was me that did it. I know my other uncles would probably hate me If I did anything but honestly I could care less. I‚Äôm just waiting and plotting until the day comes. I will flood him with lawyers once it‚Äôs time. And if that doesn‚Äôt work. I‚Äôll personally cease his assets and make sure he pays for everything he took from my parents. And not only that I want to make sure everyone knows why I‚Äôm doing what I‚Äôm doing. I have way worse planned for him but I‚Äôll keep working on the details. But for now I‚Äôm just waiting. I don‚Äôt know what advice I need. Maybe I just needed to let people know. But at the end of the day understand this. Don‚Äôt trust your family simply because y‚Äôall share blood. Trust is earned. Not just given.",01Jan2020,1
622,"Happy new year readers! So, my boyfriend and I have been together for a little over a year. He was my friend for many years and my roommate before we started dating so we have a close bond. Prior to dating me, he only had one girlfriend that he was with for 6 or so years. They seemed like ‚Äúsoulmates‚Äù to everyone. Their relationship went south, she left him but still used him as emotional and financial support for a whole year after their breakup. He struggled to cut things off because he still cared for her but also felt like her caregiver almost since she was so dependent on him. 

When we were roommates, they were still friends but he started having feelings towards me. I told him I wanted to explore things with him, but I wouldn‚Äôt be comfortable with him being friends with her because of the way their relationship was. He agreed, told her we were together and she lost it. She threatened suicide, called him endless amounts of times, posted on the internet how she wanted to die and how he just left her to play house with me. She threw shade at me all over the Internet. And I just sat and tried to be understanding. 

Four or five months into our relationship, I started to wonder if they were talking. Just knew it in my gut and he wasn‚Äôt very good at hiding it. He told me over and over that no I was crazy and no he wasn‚Äôt. Well, I found out that I wasn‚Äôt crazy lol. He was basically holding up an emotional relationship with her (texting her often loving things) for about two months. She lived in a different state and I saw the texts so it wasn‚Äôt physical. But emotional is just as devastating. She would even tweet about him saying how much she loved him and how she couldn‚Äôt wait for him to move in with her. I lost it and made him leave. She constantly went on the internet saying how much she missed him and loved him and he was moving from where we lived just to be with her ‚Äúany day now.‚Äù He owned up to gaslighting me and emotionally cheating and he stated that even though he had no real excuse, the reason he did it was because she attempted suicide (which was true, she did have an attempt after she heard the news of us being together) and he was filled with guilt with leaving someone with so much sadness and he felt like he was responsible for her feeling like her life was ruined since she didn‚Äôt really have anything going for her and he was her main source of income. He struggles severely with his mental health and his depression was declining because of the guilt. 

It took me awhile, but I tried to understand where he was coming from. He cut her off and she‚Äôs happy in her own relationship. Because of this, he was wary about being open about our relationship. If I even tweeted the word ‚Äúboyfriend‚Äù she would air his dirty laundry and he was mortified. But this is where my advice is needed-

In his previous relationship he posted about her like she hung the moon and stars. Every birthday, anniversary, just randomly. He would post how much he loved her and how lucky he was to have her. When we were just friends, he boasted about how he opened her doors, picked her flowers, wrote her long love texts when she was asleep next to him just so she could wake up to them, just doted on her. He did say that sometimes he felt like he had to do these things because she was so dependent on him, like he was a caregiver. He even had to book her doctors appointments and make phone calls for her because she didn‚Äôt like to. 

Now, in the past couple of years, even in their relationship, he kinda stopped using social media as frequently. His depression set in and didn‚Äôt really want to be on the grid. But this is where I feel torn. He tells me endlessly how much he loves me and how he adores me. I‚Äôm a VERY independent person. And he says that‚Äôs what he adores most about me. That I don‚Äôt need anyone to take care of me, that I‚Äôm strong. But he doesn‚Äôt do nearly the same things. Doesn‚Äôt open my car door, has never posted about me despite me being in tears at time, no long loving texts. Is it silly to expect these things? I know every relationship is different. But, I can‚Äôt help but feel like he doesn‚Äôt post about me because he lives in fear of his ex even though I was destroyed from being gaslighted and lied to. I told him even his ex got to post all over the internet about him when they weren‚Äôt even together, she dragged me all over the internet when I was so unaware of everything. I know it also comes from a place of jealousy and anger, that the person he lied to me about got to post about him, earn sympathy from random people about how ‚Äúshitty‚Äù him and I were for moving on and wanting to start a relationship, the person who said awful things about me oh the internet and said horrible things to me. And now he avoids posting because he‚Äôs embarrassed by his own actions he made because of guilt, manipulation, and depression. 

I know I‚Äôm strong and independent, but I still want to feel special. He makes me feel silly for wanting a simple post. Maybe I am asking for too much?",01Jan2020,1

624,"Hey all,

My boyfriend (27M) and I (23F) went to a NYE party with some of his friends. We were all very drunk by the end and things were all good. 

My boyfriend and I have chatted before and he‚Äôs told me he would find it really hot if he saw me kissing another girl. At this party, me and another girl who we both didn‚Äôt know had started chatting and she‚Äôd complimented me in pretty forwards ways (about my body etc) so I‚Äôd assumed she was either interested or gay, I‚Äôm not sure. It was obvious I was with my boyfriend but she still did this. 

At the end of the night we were all laying together and I was beside the girl. My boyfriend made eyebrows at me so he was obviously thinking the same thing. I asked her if she wanted to kiss because it would ‚Äúmake my boyfriend‚Äôs new year‚Äù, to which she said no and she was dating someone. Now that I‚Äôm sober and it‚Äôs the next day, I am cringing soooo hard about this. I don‚Äôt know if she thought I wanted anything more than just to make out in the moment, I was also obviously dating my boyfriend!

My boyfriend thinks it was extremely hot and not at all embarrassing, but I really just wish I hadn‚Äôt tried haha. Essentially, my brain is making me want to die about this and I‚Äôm looking for some words of comfort that I‚Äôve not done something super strange. 

TL;DR: went to a NYE party with my bf who has previously mentioned that it would be hot if I made out with a girl in front of him. Got the vibe and asked a girl if she wanted to kiss, she said no. Help me get over this strong cringe.",01Jan2020,1
625,"I (23F) have two girl friends who I've been close with since the beginning of undergraduate school, even before then. We all used to be single and would hang around a lot, enjoy each other's company, and talk about all sorts of interesting things. We used to travel together too. Now I happen to be the only single one between them. Which is fine, I'm happy that my closest friends are happy with their partners. But man, the changes....

I wonder if this tends to happen particularly so with women, but I've noticed that my friends have changed \*dramatically\* once they entered into their relationships. They become more bashful, speak less, and giggle at everything their SO's say. They are attached to their partners at the hip as well. I hardly ever get to spend time alone with any one of them because they bring their partners around everywhere. And the few times that I do spend time alone with one of them, all they talk about is their SO's and their relationships. Nothing interesting. And we don't travel together anymore as they choose to travel with their SO's too.

Maybe this is just common for adulthood. I don't know and I'd like some advice on how to approach all of this. I just miss my friends. And I feel forgotten, if I'm being honest. But maybe this is just quite normal?",01Jan2020,1

629,"My best friend[15M] reassures me that I'm not but I always pick up on things that I do that abusive friends do. 

For example when we fight I get extremely emotional, I feel like it's the end of the world. It sometimes even comes to me begging him not to leave. I apologize an insane amount just to satisfy him even if I genuinely feel like I did nothing wrong, which I did. I know I did something wrong but it's like there's a war in my head. I tell myself ""YOU messed up, it's your fault"" but I've got this tiny thought that never goes away that doubts that and I can never admit to myself that I did something wrong. He talked me out of killing myself in October and I want to believe I was going to do it but another part of me thinks it was just to manipulate him into telling me what I wanted to hear. We had been in a huge fight and he threatened to leave. What I want to have happened was that I genuinely wanted to kill myself because we've been friends for so long, and we've been through so much together. We swore to each other that if it ever came to it we'd tell each other before going through with it. So I told him. And he begged me not to. I wanted to hear him say he didn't want me to die and he loved me. And he did. 

I want to believe I was going to do it. I'd rather think he talked me out of it and that's that. But I also don't think I'd ever be brave enough to do it and if he didn't talk me out of it I wouldn't have done it anyway. I feel like I threatened him with my life and I've trapped him.",01Jan2020,1

635,"When I was 12 and my sister was 15 who has an intellectual disability was home one day trying to skip school my moms boyfriend was home as well. She told him she would do anything to stay home without him telling on her. I am 100% certain she didn‚Äôt mean anything sexual she just didn‚Äôt want to go to school. 

He told her to do sexual things for him. She wouldn‚Äôt do it. He went to my mom to tell her what happened because he ‚Äúfelt bad‚Äù and he said that he was making a joke. She believed him and no one ever told me this had happened. 
She kept him in the house with us. I had always hated him and thought he was really fucking weird. I didn‚Äôt find out until a couple years later and she kicked him out when I did find out. (I honestly don‚Äôt remember why she kicked him a lot of this is a little blurry but out but it was probably because I said I would tell people or something)

He never went to another family gathering again I never saw him again but I knew they were still seeing each other in secret because my mother is terrible at hiding things. 

I‚Äôm 19 now an. This year at Christmas at the family gathering my extended family had gifts for him and I found out they actually see him sometimes. 

Turns out my mother never told them about what happened but she made an excuse as to why he wasn‚Äôt around us. Most likely blaming us. Which is probably why I‚Äôve always felt like her family treated me like I was a brat and my poor mother had to deal with me. Which no one who knows me seems to think this except for my mothers Co workers...  

I don‚Äôt know what to do my mother told me she wouldn‚Äôt see him again after I threatened to never talk to her again but I am so hurt and I just don‚Äôt understand. I would never let someone in the house again with my children after that or see them again. What should I do? Should I forgive her or stop talking to her or what? I literally have no idea what to do or how to deal with this",01Jan2020,1
636,"I went to a New Years party last night and the couple who hosted had an intolerable disrespectful child that did not behave at all. They sit there passively asking him age 8-10 to behave and occasionally he might listen but rarely. I do not believe in doing their job for them, out of respect, as they are the masters of their home and I respect their sovereignty in parenting as they please. However, this child and others (it seems to be a trend these days) have no respect for adults and act out constantly. I am frankly tired experiencing other people‚Äôs children act like self entitled monsters that have no respect for their elders and the parents doing nothing. However, before I go all in on correcting such behavior as I experience it (instead of passively dealing with it and looking at the parents waiting for them to do something) I would love to hear any other advice before I commit to such a disposition for dealing with this in the future.

A big issue for me is that I would not allow someone to correct my children in my home. So I have been serious about not doing it to others. However, my children are also incredibly well behaved. Has anyone else had issues with this? I am at my wits end.",01Jan2020,1
637,"To beggin with: I am aware that this sounds incedibly stupid but, to be honest, I really beed advice on the matter.

Also, english is my second language and I'm on mobile so please bare with any mistakes.

So, I(f15)have had a crush on this guy(m16) for quite a while now. We have only talked twice(me being the one who started the convo and him not making any effort to talk, so I know he is not interested), so we really don't have any kind of connection. His little sister(12) has been best friends with my sister for almost six years now. That means I have met her and her parents multiple times. Her sister is a great girl with whom I have developped a friendship over the years and his parents adore me, to the point where his mother constantly tells me how she wishes her son would find someone like me. 

Long story short, his family adores me and he barely remembers my name.

Our parents have been friends for years and my parents decided that they want to invite the whole family for dinner, alongside an another couple with three kids, that are very close to my family. All the children are pretty close friends but much younger than me, which means that I will have to be the one to entertain them. That wouldn't be a problem because I love them all dearly, but there is high chance my crush will also come over.

I am absolutely terrible at small talk, I have awful communicating skills and absolutely no idea how I will react around him. We go to the same school and I know I get extremely awkward around him even if we don't talk, so I really need help on what I'm going to do. I obviously want to impress him in a way but I know he won't be thrilled to come over and will only do so if his mother makes him. So yeah, what the he do I do for almost 4 hours at my house with my crush, 5 kids aged 5-12 and absolutely no communicating skills???

They are invited to come in two days and I have been freaking out for the past week. I know it might sound stupid but I really need advice. Any ideas??

Tl;dr: My crush with whom I have no connection is forced to come to my house and I'm freaking out.",01Jan2020,1
638,"Hi, Im a 17 yrs. f and i have a 16 yrs. sister who I absolutely despise. She manipulates my mom to the point where my mom beats me for something she did. She turned my own dad, the one person in my family who I love, against me and he now doesn‚Äôt trust me and threatens to cut me off financially. My sister has hit me many times while I‚Äôd be driving, broke my things, and calls me fat in front of my friends. She also makes fun of the fact that I voluntarily committed myself to an inpatient program because I tried killing myself in 2017. My mom has also pulled me out of therapy because she thinks im faking my depression and anxiety. Both my parents think my sister is the perfect kid. My mom has even witnessed her abuse and told me not to call the police on her to protect her. I HATE MY LIFE AND I CANT LIVE LIKE THIS. I fucking cry myself to sleep almost every night because my family hates me now. I have asked many people for help, but they all tell me to call DCFS and be removed from the home, but the truth is I still care about my family a little bit and I cant imagine being torn apart from them and living with complete strangers or in a group home. Im almost 18, so I keep telling myself to stick it out but I genuinely think I will lose my mind if I continue on like this. I dont know what to do anymore. Please help. Also im writing this after she kicked my door down and tore it off of the hinges, so now guess who doesn‚Äôt have a door.

639,"Honestly, I‚Äôve suspected he‚Äôs been spying on the wifi traffic before, but I wasn‚Äôt sure because he‚Äôs such a snoop in the first place, I thought he found out things about me some other way, I guess. 

Now, my brother is invasive like the rest of my family members, and I thought I could keep a handle on all of it; but now it‚Äôs getting creepy. There‚Äôs a history of uncomfortable behavior from him toward me in the past, and truthfully, my family is super controlling in the first place, so it‚Äôs become normalized. I always have my guard up at home (and it‚Äôs the holidays, so everyone is home right now), or so I thought. He mostly talks to me to make comments criticizing all aspects of what I‚Äôm doing and wearing, what I‚Äôm watching, what I‚Äôm cooking, etc. I have boundary issues in the first place from the way I grew up, and I feel myself get upset when I‚Äôm around him because he‚Äôs so prying. I generally don‚Äôt talk to him unless we see each other on holidays, because I don‚Äôt like him, and it‚Äôs clear he doesn‚Äôt think well of me. 

I always just assumed he was trying to mess with me by criticizing so much. But then, I became aware that he is definitely spying on what I do on the internet, which is a new low‚Äî I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm naive, but I never thought anyone in my family would do this, especially because they‚Äôre not good with technology. I use my computer a lot for school and hobby stuff in general, and given my invasive family, they constantly beg for my time and claim I‚Äôm ‚Äúaddicted to my computer,‚Äù so naturally they‚Äôre dying to know what I‚Äôm doing. So, I at first wondered if they put him up to it, since he is more computer savvy than them. The really uncomfortable part is- I only know he‚Äôs spying because he‚Äôs only referenced the porn I‚Äôve searched on personal devices. Not even any of the other hobby stuff he could have and definitely would love to mock me for. I first heard him reference that he knows what I search in passing, which was shocking. I was really confused at first, and obviously embarrassed. At first, I didn‚Äôt know what to do, or was even sure if it meant what I thought it meant, so I put off doing anything. Then, the other night, I sat down at the table with some food while he was there, and was on my phone, not engaging with him. It was just the two of us in the kitchen. He suddenly starts making this sound, and I assume he‚Äôs trying to be funny in reference to whatever he was doing on his computer or his phone, and ignored him. But he ends up speaking to me, making an explicit sexual comment about ‚Äúwhat I like‚Äù related to this sound, and when I was too shocked to even look at him, and he does it again. I didn‚Äôt say anything, I just left. 

From the history I said above, I know he has malicious intent. In response, I got a VPN for myself based on some basic research, because I think that‚Äôs all it‚Äôs going to take if he‚Äôs just monitoring the wifi traffic. I‚Äôm almost positive there‚Äôs nothing installed on my phone or computer because we don‚Äôt share them. 

I don‚Äôt even really care if he told my whole family that I was watching porn or anything, I just want my privacy, ironically for my hobbies mostly; it really hurts to get continually mocked for things I take actual joy in, and I just want to be left alone until I can move out for good. I wonder if there are other reasons why he would do this, if he‚Äôs trying to steal sensitive information? And the other issue is, I‚Äôm closeted bisexual and it‚Äôs something I don‚Äôt really care to share with my family, it‚Äôs none of their business, but I‚Äôm worried he‚Äôs going to do something with whatever information he gained through spying. I guess I also worry about what could happen if they found out, since my family is conservative and it would put me under a lot of pressure. I feel even more paranoid than usual around my family and am worried that I‚Äôm overreacting. He‚Äôll be leaving after the holidays are over to go back to school, so maybe that‚Äôs all I have to wait for. But, I feel like I can‚Äôt let this go, I feel so gross about it, I can‚Äôt believe he‚Äôd go this far to try to hurt me without a reason. Do you think I should confront him? How should I react? Do you think there any other ways I could figure out how he‚Äôs monitoring what I‚Äôm doing on my devices? 

(I‚Äôm female btw and we‚Äôre both in our early twenties) 

tl:dr I‚Äôm in a tricky situation with my brother spying on and trying to manipulate me with personal information I‚Äôd prefer to keep private, it has uncomfortable sexual undertones. Looking for advice on how I should react to this, if you could skim for the details.",01Jan2020,1

641,27 M here. I have a small family wife son and two dogs. Ive been working this job for 5 years. Its a bs general labor job refurbishing steel drums. Ima highschool dropout what can i say ? I make $14.90 a hour. My wife isnt working at the moment because we working on making her a legal citizen. But anyways heres the story. I got this job thru my wifes uncle. The job was all illegal immigrants. The company got brought out by a bigger company and got rid of the illegals. So now its full of lazy american employees. The first 3 years i busted my ass putting in all kinds of overtime learning all kinds of positions. I pretty much know every thing in this company. Its supposed to go by seniority but it doesnt. Theres alot of favortism from the supervisors. The only raise we get is from the union. Which is 45 cents a year. You can pretty much get away with anything aswell. No call no show. Come in late as fuck. Take extra time on your breaks. Thats the only reason im still working here. The only thing is there isnt enough money to provide for my family and I. Should i stay here and get a part time or should i just look for another job completely?? Sorry this post is all over the place im still faded  lol,01Jan2020,1

645,"Ok, so I'm a 30 year old man. I ended a 6 year long relationship about 6 months ago and literally lost everything in the process. She took the house and car that I had been paying for. She took the dog and cat and even has some of my personal property that her and her family refuse to give back. (Like my dead grandmothers ring I gave to this girl as an engagement ring.)
I lost a lot of friends and I can no longer go to one of the only local game shops in town because the guy she cheated on me with works there and the owners who I thought were my friends took my ex's side.
I got fat during the relationship due to my ex's refusal to cook anything aside from instant pasta and frozen pizzas. I had to neglect my dental health due to her spending all of my money on things she wanted so now my teeth look like shit and cause me immense pain daily.
Now that we are separated I had to move back in with my parents. I've been trying to get back into the dating scene but dating apps are completely garbage. I get ghosted regularly, matched then ignored, or we talk for a while before they just seem disinterested. Meeting people locally has been impossible as I am complete shit at starting conversations and I just go from home, to the gym, to walmart for that days prepackaged salad, lunch meat, fruit, and protien drink, work, then back home.
During new years a friend talked me into going to a local bar to celebrate. We went with another friend who we all agree is pretty bad at picking up women.
Long story short, he walked away with a couple girls numbers and I walked away feeling awkward, embarrassed, and like a worthless sack of shit.

So now I'm sitting in the parking lot of work an hour before I have to go in because I have no life, typing out my problems on a reddit post, hoping that maybe something someone says will help me get my shit together. It's just feeling really hard to find a point in going forward.
Maybe my ex was right to cheat on me, maybe I really am only good for being used and left. I know it sounds like self pity, and maybe it is, but damn, when your whole world is the one person you love and they stab you in the back and leave you a broken mess, it is hard to not fall into that self pity.",01Jan2020,1

She caught me texting them one night, and the following morning she woke up early, took my phone, and read our conversations. (she does not allow passwords)
She didn't like a lot of things about them, nor did she like the conversations which we had (to be fair, we did use a bit of profanity) Next thing I know, I'm cutting every single contact I have with them. I wasn't even able to tell them what happened, she just wanted them gone and out of my life. 
It's been a while since then, but I've been very sad. They helped me through a lot of stuff in the past, and I had plans to meet them in a few years as well, so it's been very hard to let go. 

Should I continue to let go of them, or should I convince my mom that they're both nice people? I really want to talk to them again, since they were basically there when I had nobody else.

651,"TL:DR - I don't feel like I'm enjoying my Master's course but am not sure whether that this is a case of not liking that specific module or the course  as a whole. I feel like I'm a thousand years behind everyone else I know professionally and personally and the idea of earning a decent wage is attractive to me, but I'm not sure if it's attractive in and of itself or because I'm discontent with one module. 

I (22F) started my Master's degree in September of last year as a full time student - meaning that it'd be done in a year. For all intents and purposes (minus the incredibly convoluted and difficult application that my university has), I was really excited to continue my studies. I enjoyed my seminars and discussions with my peers but due to my mother's ill health, I transferred to part time status instead to be able to help with her care and obviously to spend time with her. This meant attending university once a week for two hours - usually less as the session would end early. This, I feel, was when I started to get discontent. It felt - and still feels somewhat pointless to go for an hour or two, have no real connection with the peers that had bonded together due to longer and more frequent time spent together, and to be honest, I just hate reading now, which breaks my heart. My mother's health took a rapid decline in October after my birthday and she passed away. I had taken time away from university to be with her and my family, and took time after her passing. I missed maybe 2-3 sessions. My university lecturer immediately went on (unrelated) strike action. All in all, I had been to a seminar maybe 4-5 times. I did my first assignment, got a good grade in it, but it didn't feel as rewarding as I wanted it to. I don't find the content more difficult at all, I just feel like the quantity of expectation is higher, which is a little disappointing as I like to be challenged. Alternatively, it could be just this module - it's only been a semester - and I could be being overly sensitive as everything in my life has been a bit of a mess for a while. 

At the same time, I work part time and have a partner (22M) of 1.5 years. He and I are ready to have our own space but unfortunately at the moment, without my rent contribution, my family couldn't keep the house. I have barely any savings as it is - part time work just about covers my rent, car expenses and other necessary bills like my phone and books for school.  He too has very little savings, but due to his full time job, could afford to rent with a partner. He spend a lot of time at my house and is very welcome - has his own key, toothbrush, and more shirts here than I even own lmao - but it isn't our own space. I know it's silly to compare but all of our friends are moving in with their SO's, getting engaged, beginning careers, going on holidays etc, none of which I have or could have with my current situation. I am so frustrated at my lack of progression. I hate this feeling of stagnation. Realisitically, my part time job offers no progression and is a place-holder for when I leave uni - whether that be now, or in two years when my course is complete.

I've been thinking about dropping out of my Master's and I've been applying for full-time jobs in my area, just to put feelers out and broaden any options I might have. I was offered an interview for tomorrow morning. The commute is 45 minutes, the salary base level, but if I'm offered it, I'll be in a career that can produde a decent wage, with a company that \*claim\* to want to support my professional development. I feel like it's a job I can be good at, for sure, but I'm so conflicted about dropping out. I've never quit anything in my whole life - one of the big things I was always taught was to persevere and work through and in large, I do feel like this has been to my benefit. I don't want to just throw away all the work I've put in thus far toward my academic career because I'm being malcontent. At the same time, I don't want my mental health to suffer like is has and is, trying to juggle the school workload, part time work, home politics and my relationship. I don't see myself going into academia, and my course isn't vocational; it would however, provide some excellent skills that some employers find attractive such as research, proof-reading, editing, etc. 

I suppose my question really is; what should I do? Do I attend the interview, or focus on my studies? I have no idea what I'm doing anymore.",01Jan2020,1
652,"There has been a lot of stuff bothering me lately. I've been posting about things like this a lot. I'll try to keep this short. 

I worry  about a lot of things. I only have one more semester before I graduate college and I am scared by that. I also have no social life and I'm worried I'll be lonely for a long time, maybe forever. The thing that has been bothering me the most though is my sexuality. I just seem to be scared of it or something. I don't even know what my sexual orientation is.

Ria Ciuffo Alexandra Cooper Sofia Franklyn Kayce Smith i want to attract women at that level but everyone tells me ""never gonna happen""


Where I grew up in Colorado all the girls thought I was a loser and when I hung out with my friends my friends girlfriends think I'm a loser and it is because I'm ugly looking and fat

I now live in Massachusetts and I'm practically invisible to good looking women and I also don't have any friends here and I've lived here for six years I only have friends because I keep tabs and visit my once in Colorado but my family can't help me with attractive good looking women because they're all overweight and married overweight women so they settled so they're not the ones to get advice from.

If i lose weight and still can't attract a good looking woman then i wasted my time I don't want to lose a hundred pounds just to have to end up dating an unattractive woman still or a woman who is hardly plain looking or average and its like all i am gonna hear is this. 
""if you lose weight and don't get a hot girlfriend then I'm sorry but you gotta date the ugly ones and get use to it""

here's a list of every woman who treated me badly or who rejected me and friend zoned me now you know how bad I've got it

ASHLEY:
Girl i can't get over got married and she's in love with him and it depresses me beyond comprehension that she loves him and she will never love me. I'm absolutely fucking depressed.

i fucking hate him he ruined my life. I asked girls online if he's better looking than me and they all said yes he was and theyd rather date him than me. Can anybody give me advice thats beneficial for me? if you say ""If you really love her youd be happy for her"" or ""move on"", that has no benefits for me it only benefits her POS husband.

I don't get a bright side or a silver lining or happy ending just fucked over.

I TOLD HER MY FEELINGS SHE REJECTED ME AND SHE TRIED SETTING ME UP WITH A FAT UGLY GIRL AFTER REJECTING ME. FUCK MY LIFE. I HAVE THE WORST LIFE POSSIBLE


ALEX:
My prom date who I had a crush on for years made out with another dude in front of me and ran off to Fuck him in his car and because she was from out of town she stayed over my place and the next morning after she invited him over so she can make out with him and in his car on my driveway amd people found out and I got humiliated all the way to graduation

SARA: 
The girl i had feelings for in high school but who friendzoned me is getting married  to a guy who is cheated on her with a teacher She started dating him when me and her were seniors and he was a freshman. Hes an absolute scumbag. I truly hate him. He was caught sexting a teacher caught on the news and has been caught texting other girls with intent to cheat multiple times. and now the girl I want is marrying him and **A TEACHER HERSELF**
She would use me as the shoulder to cry on and then when she was done crying to me she would have me go away and then she would go back to him after I'm not saying it wasn't my own fault but to some degree I was used emotionally

and now everybody is happy that they're getting married it's like I'm living in the Twilight Zone that people forget that he cheated on her with the teacher and got caught on the news. 
Then five years ago when my mom passed away everybody I knew gave me their condolences even people I didn't like but they still were decent enough to tell me their condolences **EXCEPT HER** She didn't even give me a my condolences at the minimum despite her feeding me lies saying how me and her were such close good friends.  She couldn't even text me ""My condolences"" or ""Sorry for your loss"" not even 2 to 4 fucking words in a text. I go to therapy **BECAUSE** of this experience. 

I then messaged her saying how it hurt me that she didn't say anything I told her how I felt about her I told her that her boyfriend now fiance is a scumbag I told her she's dumb for staying with a scumbag like that and the last thing she ever told me was
""F**k you loser sorry you're so mad at the world"" 

**THE WEEK MY MOM DIED!!!**

 last thing I ever said to her was ""how is that possible? I'm not a scumbag who cheats on you. Isn't that what you prefer to f**k?"" That was five years ago and we haven't spoken since. The wedding was in July

All my life women I've liked rejected me or ignored me. The only time women liked me they were morbidly obese and extremely unattractive but then I would be told to ""give them a chance that's your league anyways at least they're nice girls"" üòí being told to take an L with a smile isn't a great life. Especially if you compare her to the women who rejected me. Their husbands and boyfriends (WHO I LOATHE) see that I'm with a woman much less unattractive after being rejected by them gives them a whole lot of leverage over me and that's absolutely humiliating for me like ""Haha my girl rejected you and you're stuck with an ugly woman. sucks to suck loser"". That is HUMILIATION defined, and everybody wants me to embrace this happening and it's NOT FAIR.",01Jan2020,1
655,I use Discord a lot. One time I joined a Discord Server and became friends with a lot of the people. I'm MTF but I pretended to not be Transgender and be a biological female. One time one of the people asked for a face reveal and I'm 14 so like the idiot I am I did. Now one of them messaged me to find out and he's threatening me to tell everyone and stop being my friend. I wanna tell them I'm actually Transgender but I don't know how to tell him. If anyone has any advice I would really appreciate it.,01Jan2020,1

i should probably also mention i have depression and anxiety so i always get really negative thoughts all the time and i hate it.

i should also mention this friendship is not an irl friendship, but it‚Äôs the closest friendship i‚Äôve been in and she feels like a soulmate, and according to her I‚Äôm the furthest she‚Äôs been with a guy and she doesn‚Äôt want to lose the friendship.

i haven‚Äôt talked about this to her and also this isn‚Äôt something like a relationship or anything like that.

659,"Hello everyone. First post here. On mobile, I apologize. 

So, almost two years ago my mom and dad got divorced. My dad stayed in Pennsylvania where I have lived for almost 10 years and my mom moved to Georgia. I stayed in PA and currently live with my Dad. 

Recently I have been considering moving to Georgia with my mom. But, I am having issues justifying the move. Everything I know and everyone I know is in PA aside from my mom. I miss my mom like crazy, but I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm able to justify moving down there to be closer to her.

661,"This is not something I have experience in so I thought I would get some advice.

Yesterday my son and I had a long talk about the things he's been worried about. Predictably a lot of it was about his father and how he's still messed up over how his father just disappeared after our divorce and the subsequent pain involved in the events leading up to it.

Not to worry, I've scheduled an appointment for my son with his therapist this week so we can go over some of this.

However, after we had a good cry and we're about to head to bed he revealed to me that one of his friends has been self harming. He asked for my advice on what to do and I told him honestly that I wasn't sure but I would look into it and if not we could talk to his therapist.

I bring up my son's own trauma because I really don't want to encourage him to be this child's sole support as my son has enough shit going on on his own. I also can't get him to tell me what friend altho I suspect it might be his best girl friend. 

Any suggestions here? I don't want to leave this child on her own.",01Jan2020,1
662,"I‚Äôll give a quick overview of what i‚Äôm going through. I have been close friends with this girl (we‚Äôll call her Kim) for almost four years. Out of those four years we lived together for three of them. This past May I moved into an apartment with my fianc√©. Kim and I still see each other just not as often, which we‚Äôre both completely okay with. Our friendship picks up right where it left off, it was a similar situation when we lived together. Although we saw each other every day it was very low maintenance and we got along really well. She has been my closest friend for these past four years, until recently. 

We got into an argument where the majority of it was her attempting to push me away and give me the spiel of how, ‚ÄúI would be better off without her‚Äù and ‚Äúshe‚Äôs a terrible person,‚Äù because she can‚Äôt move on from a toxic ex. I let her say what she needed to say but just kept trying to tell her that regardless of what she thinks I want her in my life. When I went home it ended on a pretty awkward note. She‚Äôs apologized for that night but has basically said she‚Äôs unable to be a friend because of what she‚Äôs going through right now. 

You might be asking, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the issue?‚Äù Well I‚Äôm getting there. I have been giving her space, but I‚Äôm not entirely sure where our friendship stands, so I‚Äôve been casually checking in or responding to things she posts. Most of the time I either don‚Äôt get a response or she says something along the lines of ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt have friends right now because all I do is talk about (blank) and I‚Äôm sure everyone is tired of hearing about it.‚Äù 

THIS is where I‚Äôm questioning if I bother continue trying. The day after she says this to me she posts multiple pictures with other friends of hers with a couple simple captions of ‚Äútons of friends, lots of pals, PALS‚Äù seeing that shit just really kind of hurt me considering she didn‚Äôt bother to respond to my last message of ‚Äúthinking of you. happy new year.‚Äù 

This whole situation is just really kind of fucking me up. Am I overreacting and just need to let her do what she needs to do to get better? Or is that a shitty thing of Kim to do? I feel like she‚Äôs just willing to throw away our friendship.",01Jan2020,1
664,"    So yesterday I went to my best friend‚Äôs house. Let‚Äôs call him Jerry, and let‚Äôs call his neighbor (who is also a close friend of mine) Danny. So I went over to Jerry‚Äôs house and Danny was there as usual, I had already told Jerry that I‚Äôd kiss him, and here‚Äôs the context, Jerry had never kissed anyone before, and he wanted to ‚Äúget his first kiss out of the way before the end of the decade‚Äù so as the nice friend I am, I told him I‚Äôd do it. So we played truth or dare, and I got dared to do it, and I just couldn‚Äôt, it was too gross, I‚Äôm not gonna say why, it‚Äôs just, the idea of it made me sick to my stomach, but I‚Äôm a good friend, so I just said that we‚Äôd do it later. Later that day we played spin the bottle, again, I felt sick to my stomach, but I did it anyway, I didn‚Äôt even really kiss him, I brushed my lips against his for like half a second and I wanted to go home, and like never talk to him or see him again. I don‚Äôt know why, but I find him completely revolting now. I can‚Äôt even talk to him without wanting to throw up, this sounds really harsh, and I know you must be thinking, ‚Äúit couldn‚Äôt have been THAT bad.‚Äù But really, it was THAT bad. I just wish I could forget it, what do I do? I can‚Äôt cut him off for something that stupid, I feel like a terrible person.",01Jan2020,1

So as the title says, I'm going out for dinner with my ex girlfriend. We had a falling out over miscommunication and her mother. Both of us had strong feelings in our relationship. And we both felt something special. 

A mutual friend of ours is trying to make this work for us and he is coming with to, I guess, moderate and make sure our thoughts are understood. Mainly because I tend to think too fast for my mouth and have to repeat things to focus on what I am saying.

667,"Hi. Im new to this page and specifically looked for it because im just lost and i need advice. 

So a bit of a background:

I come from a mixed race household. My father is Chinese who moved to the Philippines, settled, and got married here. 

He is a traditional. So he raised us in a very partriarchal way where every word he say is law. He is strict. It's his way or no way.

We aren't rich. Growing up, my father sacrificed a lot for our family, and he nearly single handedly raised us out of poverty. Considering he didn't even finish a high school education, it is quite an accomplishment.

He was able to send all 4 of us siblings to top notch universities, and sent me, and my two youngest siblings to study in china (my sister went to medical school instead), and send me to get my masters in the US. Suffice to say, he did incredibly supporting us financially.

The main story:

I came back to the Philippines two years ago to help out in our family business. Our business revolves around auto parts sales and repair (my dad's really good at this stuff). And as for me, I don't really know much about it, nor do i have much of an interest in it. So i usually just help out with bookkeeping, sales, banking--logistical stuff. 

Working with him in the beginning was fine, but as the weeks progress, his attitude has turned to shit. He keeps on shouting, berating me for every single mistake i make, beratting and blaming me for his mistakes, calling me an idiot, etc. It became such a toxic environment for me. It's to the point that even at home he brings that kind of toxicity. 

He is angry that I sleep a lot, which is because im tired emotionally and mentally, not physically. He is angry that i don't have a proper job and earning money, when im helping out in our business with zero salary for two years now (i live with my parents, because it doesn't make sense for me to get my own place).  He is just angry with me all the time. He nitpicks every thing i do and keeps on calling me an idiot like im the worst most disgusting piece of shit he ever laid eyes on. Even when i try to do everything he tells me to. 

I mentioned before that we were raised in partriarchal system typical of a Chinese family. My father is the first born son, and is the patriarch of my family. And im his first born son, which he deems me to be the next family patriarch. So he expects me tk be responsible for my entire family and his family (he only considers his side of the family as part of the clan because women are married out of tbe family, and therefore my mother's side is not part of the clan).

My father brooks no argument and is unreasonable. Even when he's wrong, he won't admit it. When you make a reasonable argument he shuts you down by blatantly choosing to ignore your reasons, or shouting you down. He selectively chooses that which is works in his favor, and everything else be damned. 

Basically, 
He is always right. 
His wrongs are your wrongs. 
His mistakes are your mistakes. 
Fuck logic, my word/opinion is the correct one. 

I'm just so sick and tired of him. But I'm also torn. I'm torn because I love him and owe him everything I have, despite his attitude. And the responsibility i feel for my family and clan which has been ingrained into me. 

If I stay, i risk my emotional and mental health. Im always stressed and always getting sick because of the stress. 

But if i go, who will take care of my parents? Our business? Should I just dump everything to my little brother? But I also don't want him to experience the same kind of torture I'm experiencing now with my dad. 

I want to just leave everything behind and just be free. But I can't,because of my sense of responsibility for my family.

671,"First of all, Happy New Year y'all.
So yesterday I was at my cousin's for NYE and her husband told me that he found a large snail and wants to give them to me. I have been wanting a snail since almost 5 years ago and would beg my parents constantly.

My dad always refused and got flatout angry when I even mentioned it. So I told my cousin's husband this and he actually works with my dad/for the same company so I didn't want there to be tension between them. He told me that I should see it as a Christmas gift and he will handle my dad. I also said because its my choice to accept the gift I will handle it also.

He also had an old terrarium he is lending to me so atleast thats covered for now. I have no problem at all to care for the snails (two of them are Giant African Land snails and one garden snail) and I am going to buy more substrate and supplies tomorrow because today in a public holiday in my country.

Anyway, when I got home I asked him to carry the tank inside the house cause its really heavy. When he saw it he was really angry and upset. I told him it was a gift and I will care for the snails while bursting out in tears. I was so excited because its literally a dream come true for me.

I also told him that there is a possibility that they will lay eggs and I will either sell them or dispose of them. I will clean the tank/change the substrate weekly etc. I feel that he thibks I am not capable of doing it but I really feel I am ready for the responsibility. I finished my studies two months ago and is going to look for work ASAP. Snails are such low maintenance pets and even if I am working full time it is not difficult to make time to care for them. The tank is currently standing in the living room just until I make space for them in my roim tomorrow.

I don't know what to do about my dad. I have tried talking to him to convince him that I am responsible enough and I will move them to my room ASAP.",01Jan2020,1
673,"Well, I'm studying abroad for a degree, and luckily have made some friends.
The class and major is very small, so not a lot options for friends in the same course sadly.


Well, a friend in a group of mine seems to be homophobic.
 They once asked me about a lesbian couple on the news like ""do you support it? Its such a waste, I don't really like it"" and continued to ask every other friend in our group about it too..which I thought was strange.


So, problem is that I'm LGBT myself, and scared for my safety. Knowing the country I'm in, even if I'm a foreigner. Even if it's all my fault that I even came  here.
So I just gave a non committal reply, which I know is probably cowardly of me. In truth I was pretty upset/hurt about it and not great at confrontation.


Should I just drop the friend? They're really nice outside of this whole....homophobia thing. But it's a topic that really hits too close to home to not care.


 I'm really ashamed of myself to even ask for help on this but there really is nobody else I can turn to, not even my family knows about that side of me and all.
So any advice is appreciated!

674,"Well I've never posted here before so please go easy if I'm doing it wrong.   
This is gonna be a long post but, background info, when I was about 14 I was sent to the school psychologist after a teacher saw that I had cut my wrists. The therapist was nice and she helped me cope with anxiety better for about a year, but the real trouble started when my then ex-girlfriend began to abuse me sexually, as part of her trying to control me she also decided to see the very same therapist I was despite the fact she had an outside therapist.   
So I'm not really sure what exactly my ex told said therapist but instead of helping me the therapist decided to try and play relationship coach saying that I just needed to work on the relationship and she was constantly playing devil's advocate. Now because of the abuse I did cheat with my current boyfriend, who is such a kind, loving, beautiful person the therapist suggested I break up with him, repeatedly. I guess she told my ex and well, she raped me that day.   
At the same time the therapist decided to see me less and less even as I got worse and worse, she would also transfer me to her the students working under her, who were just eugh.   
Junior year, when I was 17 I finally broke up with my ex and stayed with my boyfriend. I fell deeper into depression after my ex spread rumors that I was the one hurting her, it tore our friends apart and they were divided on who to believe. One last time I went to the therapist and asked for help, she gave in and as I tried to hint at my ex hurting me, she told me that my ex was too nice to do something so horrible and I wouldn't want to destroy her life (ha!). She then looked at my grades, which were improving and decided that I didn't need therapy anymore.  
Now for the advice, I'm going to college now and the college offers mental health services, including therapists. It doesn't take a genius to figure I have ptsd (the former therapist however refused to diagnose me at 18, stating I was too young to have it) and a myriad of other problems. Most notably my anger issues have been coming back and I will end up lashing out at my boyfriend (usually just being too stubborn or silent treatment) and it is very difficult for me to talk about things with him because I prefer to pretend everything is fine even when I know it's not. Should I try out therapy and risk trauma I've tried to suppress come spilling out or worse, have a therapist who was just equally as bad, should I try to self medicate with weed as I've heard it helps people or should I just try and fix my problems myself?",01Jan2020,1
676,"When you see other people in pain or being sad people tend to emphathise and also feel a bit of the emotions.
I often feel nothing,sometimes I feel a bit but simply ignore it and when I realy know someone or something is being hurt or sad, depressed and you should take it serious I don't care or make jokes about it.
(I know I could get shit for it but it includes things as: Holocaust, Worldhunger, Cancer patients, Realy Sick people, Third World, Deathly Ill children and the list goes on and on and is expanding)

I know that it's completly inacceptable for the most part to the degree I got called a Sadist and Masochist, I don't feel joy seeing people or animals suffer, I just find it more appealing to make jokes, I hate people being sad about shit that doesn't affect them.

He kept his drink and started kissing me, i was like wait... what? He asked me if he should stop, about 2 times, he asked me if he has my consent, honestly i was looking at him blankly and I asked him like i‚Äôm not sure wait, were we vibing outside? 
He started kissing me again and he was very forceful, i kissed back but i was really drunk and I don‚Äôt know. When he started to unbutton my pants, I stopped him and he asked why? I lied and just wanted to get out at this point, he again started to make out with me, i gave it a final try. He was again very forceful and was just mauling me. I pushed him back and asked him to leave. 

He wasn‚Äôt leaving and then I calmly started to fix myself with him in the washroom. He asked me if i liked being ‚Äúpricey‚Äù and to get rid of him i said ‚Äúyes i‚Äôm pricey, yes yes i‚Äôm a tease and i like it this way.‚Äù 

There was a little more conversation but that‚Äôs about it. While leaving the washroom he was being very forceful again and chanting it was my loss but i still left. Anyway when i came out, it felt like he told most people that he was gonna try and do me? Also i kissed him on the way out of the washroom to calm him...?

679,"This might be long. TLDR at the end.

I graduated with my MA in English with an emphasis on creative writing in May 2019. I didn't really know what I wanted to do, but I thought I would figure it out by now and I haven't. The only 'safe' option I've landed on is teaching, but I don't think it is right for me. I have worked as a substitute teacher for the past year and I genuinely like it, but so many of the teachers I know are exhausted and burnt out and have little to no time for other things. Some have to stay at school until 9:00 P.M almost every day. If teaching was the only thing I wanted to do, this might be okay for me, but it isn't. 

I genuinely love writing. I have several stories I want to get published in magazines/journals someday and, eventually, in my own collection. I am NOT under any delusion that I'll make a living off my writing; it is simply a hobby and a passion of mine that I don't want to live without. I really feel like if I become a teacher, I'll probably never write again. I'm only a sub now and I haven't written anything or tried to publish anything since July. I always feel busy and tired.

My mom keeps pressuring me to become a teacher ""for the retirement and the benefits."" I'm about to age out of my father's insurance this year, so I know I need to find something stable, full-time, with benefits. But I think becoming a teacher mainly for the money is a terrible reason and will definitely cause me to leave the profession after only a few years, if that. The only other thing I can think to do is administrative assistant work. I think I would actually like it--I'm organized, and even though it's not a super flashy job, it's always interested me. I don't want a flashy job. I don't want to be rich. I just want to find something that will allow me to live on my own and pay my bills.

The problem with finding an administrative assistant/clerical position is that I have no direct experience, and every job I apply for requires it. I applied to those kinds of jobs all summer and despite my education, never got a call back, let alone an interview. I don't know how to get the experience in order to get the job. I don't know what to do. I've been crying and having panic attacks for the last three days because I have absolutely no idea what to do with my future and time is running out. People tell me I'm young, but I don't feel young. I feel trapped in a profession I don't necessarily thing is right for me because I have no idea what else to do.

In order to apply for the teacher credential program in August, I first have to take a prerequisite class starting later this month. It is a lot of money and will last the whole semester. If I AM going to be a teacher, I need to take this class now so I can start the program as soon as possible and begin my career. But if I'm not going to be a teacher, I don't want to waste the time and money on taking the class. My mom thinks at the very least, I should take the class as a back-up option. I'm leaning toward doing that, although I really don't want to. I love writing and I just want to make sure I can always do that. Even just writing in summer when I'm not teaching doesn't feel likely (If I'm not writing all year, I know how easy it will be to get in that habit and not write in the summer, either).

I have to decide what to do before the class starts. I have 26 days to decide. I feel like my only options are teaching or administrative assistant work. One job, I don't really want to do. The other job, I can't break into the profession because of lack of experience. What do I do? Do I suck it up and become a teacher? What else can I do with this degree? 

TL;DR: Despite having a Master's degree in English, I can't find an administrative assistant job because of lack of experience. Writing is a passion of mine. I was leaning toward becoming a teacher, but with how overworked teachers are today, I know if I become one, I won't be able to pursue my writing even as a hobby, and I don't know if I want to be a teacher anyway, but I don't know what else to do for a career.",01Jan2020,1

681,"This could be very long, so I‚Äôm going to make it as straightforward as possible. 

I (20F) am a sophomore in college. I took the first semester off to begin therapy for lifelong health + generalized anxiety disorder that was beginning to severely impact my life. Semester comes to a close, I decide to take a gap year. I will not be returning until next August. During this time, I developed mono. That really zapped my energy. Between managing bad anxiety, having energy depleted from mono, and also mental exhaustion from the anxiety, I‚Äôve been doing close to nothing and have been pretty introverted / isolated these past few months. Social circle is a bit small since I‚Äôm not in school. I basically only hangout with my boyfriend (whom I have a great relationship with thankfully) but when school is in session (Christmas break right now) I go out on the weekends with some girls. My best friend goes to school a few hours away. I have one close girl friend here. I need more friends but first and foremost I‚Äôm concerned with bettering my own mental and physical health. 

I miss my energy so much. I took it for granted. I‚Äôve not only had my energy zapped from being sick and managing my mental health, but throughout these few months I‚Äôve become accustomed to being lazy. I have a bad sleep schedule and hardly see daylight. I do have depressive thoughts but I‚Äôm not diagnosed with depression. Once I‚Äôm out and doing things I have energy but it‚Äôs so hard to get started. 

My therapist and I have been working on creating a better sleep schedule, and a new daily schedule that allows for some down time if my body needs it but having more to do. 

But I‚Äôm having trouble getting started. My brain keeps telling me to sit around. 

I miss my energetic self so much. I do have hobbies and things I love but no energy to do them. 

I refuse to succumb to this forever. I know how I was before all this. I need that back. But it‚Äôs hard. I need a more positive outlook.",01Jan2020,1
682,"So my sisters ex talked to me about dating my crush of 7 months. In secret. This was last year when they did it. But him bringing it up upset me because my crush ‚Äúdated‚Äù me basically while texting my sister. He played me. And things have been going on between him and I and I‚Äôm hating him. I keep crying. We aren‚Äôt talking anymore and I want to stop talking to him and confront him in his player-ness. He‚Äôs been sexting me while texting my sister too. This feels so nasty. I don‚Äôt know how to react to him once he starts talkin to me. Idk if I should confront him about long ago, or on the other recent things we are doing like sexting. Because I feel that he is using me. I know I have to let him go. But I know he will eventually text me.",01Jan2020,1
683,"I‚Äôm an 18 year old guy, let‚Äôs get that out of the way. When I was in high school I never really thought a lot about my future. I planned on being a stand-up comedian, getting married in my early 20s to a girl I love and having a kid in my mid 20s.

When I graduated high school my family and I moved across the United States (From the pacific north west to the east coast). We sold my car and moved into a town house. So I went from having a bunch of friends, a car and living in a small town to living in a big town with nothing.

Now I‚Äôm just working as a grocery clerk and that‚Äôs it. I have no plan whatsoever and have no idea what I want to do. I‚Äôm going to break up the problems I have into paragraphs.

I would like to do something I like for a living, even if the pay isn‚Äôt all that great. My parents are pressuring me to do air conditioning since it pays well but I don‚Äôt want to do that. I like to make stories, draw, make jokes, review films and games and to take photos but I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs a career for any of that.

I hate the town I live in and want to go back to living in a smallish town back in the North West. Not the town I lived in originally, but somewhere around there.

I‚Äôve never dated before, I‚Äôve been rejected a few times but that‚Äôs all I know about girls. I would like to start dating but I don‚Äôt have a car, don‚Äôt know anywhere to go in this town and I don‚Äôt want to continue living here so I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll be wasting a girls time.

I would like to go to college but I don‚Äôt know which colleges to go to or what to study in. My parents are nice enough to pay for it, even rent. They won‚Äôt pay for tuition however, and I don‚Äôt want to make my parents waste thousands of dollars on something I won‚Äôt use. They want me to take community college but I don‚Äôt know what community college is like nor what classes to take.

My biggest fear is being that old, lonely guy that lives in an apartment and didn‚Äôt do anything with his life. They say follow your dreams and I‚Äôd love to do that but I am scared that I will fail and waste a few years doing it. I also don‚Äôt know where to start. 

I want 2020 to be a good decade and hopefully my life will change in a good way. What can/should I do?

684,"So basically I've decided to get all of my close friends together for my 21st birthday for the first time. The thing is that most of them have never met each other in person (two are my classmates - on good terms, but not close, (one of them is my roommate), one is my former classmate from another city and two are my close friends from the third city - they are friendly with each other but not that close)

The question is: how to make this work out fine so no one would get bored or feel alone? Should I get more people to come or are there any ideas to make this fun as is? I've never really hosted a party before, so... 

Additional info: my apartment is pretty small.

692,"I'm contemplating going to Saskatchewan University (u of s) in Canada for computer science and I'm from the states, I can't stay with my parent after I graduate because they're kicking me out. 

My reason for this is because I already have a limited choice on colleges to begin with because my GPA is 3.0 and my ACT is below 20. I don't like any colleges in my state and to go out of state you have to pay out of your ass unless you establish residency which I'm also contemplating as well.

693,Recently I‚Äôve noticed that I‚Äôve become more easily irritable and it‚Äôs been resulting in me acting rudely towards people I care about. It can be over menial things such as a question I might  find pointless or someone walking too slowly but I still get disproportionately frustrated with them.

697,"When I feel very depressed or even suicidal, I can still hold onto the knowledge that I‚Äôve pulled myself out of similar slumps so I know that it is temporary and things will get better. And logically I know that I have a professional future ahead: I‚Äôm 21 and about to graduate a year early with a high-brow bartending job in the interim. But now I don‚Äôt really feel anything. A twinge of sadness and a knot of anxiety in my chest pop every once in a while but I can‚Äôt even cry.

It started to develop about five months ago. Originally, classes, social life, and work were all good. But by October-ish, I was super depressed because some of my friends that I live with kind of turned on me when I said that I would be graduating (and moving out) early. I was working every day open to close so I wouldn‚Äôt have to go home. I used my work schedule as an excuse to ignore my romantic life and just have a bunch of sex. But now I feel like I can‚Äôt even make a connection with anyone. I‚Äôm good at faking emotion but I can just feel my heart shut down.  I feel soiled, tarnished, impure for some reason and I can‚Äôt even imagine someone truly being romantic with and caring about me.

The worst part was the winter break. I‚Äôm very close with my family and I love love love Christmas. But no matter how hard I tried, I couldn‚Äôt feel that much. A little bit here and there but I wanted festivities to be over which is extremely out of character for me.

During my depressed phase, I was drowning and no one noticed. I was screaming into a void. Or maybe people did notice and it was more like a 2-way mirror. But now I‚Äôm just going through the motions. I‚Äôm completing most tasks relatively well with the exception of daily cleaning.

703,"I (33F) have been a live in caregiver for my maternal grandparents (both 85+) for more than a year. The two years prior to that I usually spent one full day a week at their home visiting them and helping with household tasks. 

I moved in last year because my grandfather was falling a lot after several light strokes and my grandmothers physical and mental health was suffering from being his caregiver. My grandfather is a long term diabetic and blind and hard of hearing. His legs are also extremely weak and he has diabetic peripheral neuropathy so needed constant assistance when using his walker (wheelchair was not an option as the home is not accessible). He also had to pee every 15 minutes and refused to use a urinal so we would have to take him to the bathroom constantly through the day. 

After living here a while i saw first hand what an abusive person my grandfather is. My mom (she passed on a few years back) had spoken of this in addition to sexual abuse but I didn‚Äôt see it until I was living there because he was good at hiding it. He has zero patience and would fly into a tantrum at the slightest issue. He was cruel and manipulative with my grandmother, constantly yelling for her and asking her to do make work tasks, accusing her of not loving him and not taking care of him, I even heard him threaten to call the police and have her arrested once. She would bend over backward doting on him and taking care of him but as soon as one thing didn‚Äôt go his way it was like none told the other things mattered, all the focus would be on what went wrong and he would just go at her about it constantly, sometimes for hours. 

The yelling was the worst part though, he didn‚Äôt want to be alone so every five minutes he would call her or ask where she was and if she didn‚Äôt answer right away he would keep yelling and yelling and eventually start swearing and verbally abusing her. It was oppressive for me just being there and I can‚Äôt imagine what it was like for her. He‚Äôs so loud and you could hear him everywhere in the house so it was like being trapped. She is not one to show emotion, so I knew it was seriously affecting her when his yelling caused her to cry more than once, not just tears but full sobs. One time she came to me crying and begged me not to leave her there alone. She‚Äôs also very patient but sometimes I would hear her yelling for him to just shut up and let her have some peace. Again, I haven‚Äôt seen her raise her voice or lose her patience like that often at all so it was concerning. 

After I had been there a while he started being mean about me behind my back because I would stand up to him sometimes when he was being really cruel to grandma. I would hear him saying things about me when He thought I wasn‚Äôt around like I‚Äôm not right, not a normal person, quirky in the head and accusing me of stealing his debit card and throwing it in the ditch by his bank, toiletries or food and of loosening screws around the house. He almost never said anything to my face though and the one time I confronted him and provided an example to counter what he was accusing me of he got really quiet and then when he thought I was out of earshot I could hear him saying that I was a sneak hiding behind doors to listen. I was admittedly not the best at hiding my feelings so I continued assisted him but withdrew emotionally and tried to engage minimally in conversation.

He finally got a placement in a long term care home at the beginning of December and I remember not even feeling relieved at the time because the potential move in date was still so far away and I was scared he would refuse to go. He did go after a lot of convincing by his remaining children. 

It took me three weeks to even start feeling like myself again. Since he has been there I have realized that I never want to see him again. They brought him home for a few days at Christmas and it completely changed the feel of the house.  I realized how surveilled and uneasy I feel in his presence. My mental health also spiralled when he was here and rather than doing the things I had planned I spent most of my time in my room sleeping I didnt go into common areas because I didn‚Äôt want him looking at me or talking to me and I didn‚Äôt want to look at talk to or assist/touch him. The thought of it just made my skin crawl and my stomach knot. 

I love my grandmother and I like taking care of her (she is relatively independent but forgets meals/meds and is quite unsteady on her feet) but she is so attached to him and will always choose him over anyone else despite everything he‚Äôs done. I don‚Äôt know how to navigate this going forward because if she gets even the slightest wind of my feelings about him, our relationship will be very damaged if not over entirely. But if I continue living here and caring for her I don‚Äôt know how I can avoid it coming out, especially because she wants to bring him home to stay overnight again. I also disagree with this because It‚Äôs dangerous for both of them To stay alone together with the level of assistance he needs, but none of my relatives seem willing to accept the reality of aging. I don‚Äôt have any say in this as a grandchild, all I can do is refuse to care for him if they bring him home but that a) puts them both at risk because no one else wants to stay 24/7 and b) exposes my feelings to my grandma and potentially damages the relationship leaving her without support and a caregiver. 

Any advice on how to maintain my relationship with grandma while protecting myself and my mental health from my grandfather is welcomed.",01Jan2020,1

711,"My husband (32) and I (F 29) both grew up in different religions that we have now separated ourselves from for various reasons, none serious, we just don't enjoy the concept of organized religion and handle our spirituality privately. My husband and I like to focus on being overall good people, generous and giving when we can, instead of centering ourselves in an organized religion. We have NOTHING against religion or those who choose to be involved in organized religion. We do not define ourselves as any single religion or any lack of religion such as atheism or agnosticism. 

We have two young children, one is 8 and one is 4. They regularly visit with my husband's family, who live a couple of hours away. Their visits are usually a few days long as we don't see them often due to distance and my husband and I do not stay with them during these visits. My husband's family is still very involved in their church and we don't mind if they take the kids to church with them during their stay. Our kids know that people believe in God and Jesus and know somewhat the stories of them. Nothing in depth, just stuff that's come up in conversation or children's books. Our children have not been baptized. 

My husband's family have never said much about our lack of religion, since, as I said, we aren't against it, just not involved. We simply don't have a desire to become involved with a church. This week, we picked our kids up from a visit with them and my husband's grandmother asked to speak to him privately. I did not join their conversation as I was busy with the kids. When we left, my husband sat in the back of our van with the kids, so we did not talk about their discussion. When we got home, I was unpacking their bags and found two informational textbooks about their religion. I called my husband into the room and asked why they were in there and he told me that's what their conversation was about. They are anxious and disappointed that the kids aren't baptized or involved with church. My husband brushed it off with little more than an eye roll, but I'm feeling bothered and offended by it. When I walked into the end of their conversation, his grandma said, ""You guys are good parents, though"" and now that I know the context, I'm wondering if she was implying that ""good parents"" should take their kids to church. 

How do I proceed? Do I do as my husband and give it an eye roll and brush it off? I really love his family, especially his grandparents.

He has a weird way of saying things and jokes a lot so at first I wasn't super worried but then the messages got worse and weirder and I could tell he was drunk this morning. I came home from my GFs house to find him passed out on his bed drinking God knows what but it was at least alcohol and robitussin. I tried to wake him up, checked his pulse, got him to throw up, drink water, and fed him. He's stable but I dont know what to do now. He asked for his notepad that he keeps in his room as he was throwing up and i gave it to him without even thinking of looking at it. He tore a page out and flushed it down the toilet and he wouldn't tell me what it was but I'm thinking it was a suicide note and I'm scared for him. This dude is like my brother. I know a lot about him including that he struggles with depression and had a terrible time this holiday season cause his dad is kind of an asshole to him and basically didn't want him home for Christmas so he's been in a rather dark place What do I do now? I'm planning on talking to him tomorrow when hes not drunk and suggesting a therapist. I don't know if I should even bring up the piece of paper he flushed or not. What do I even say? Anything helps.",01Jan2020,1
713,"My partner and I, both 20 years old, had a disagreement in a specific scenario, here's the rundown:

We hang out sometimes late at night, at my house. She told me recently that when she goes back to her place, I make her explain why she is doing it. She said I say ""Why do you want to go back?"" Really caught me off guard because that's not how I think at all, so why would I say it? I don't even remember saying anything like that. I pushed back (calmly, assertively) that we remember that differently, and I'm pretty sure I didn't say that or anything close.

Eventually, she tells me that when I say ""Okay, well you don't have to leave if you don't want, I enjoy your company!"" She feels obligated to explain, which I understand, so I stopped saying that. She got kinda passive aggressive and told me ""great, I'm glad you finally believe something I'm telling you"". I told her that what I actually said and what she says I did are pretty significantly different, one is manipulating and controlling, and the other is a simple miscommunication. She says I'm too specific and difficult for saying there's a difference, because they both are the same thing. I disagree. So while I apologized for my behavior and how it can impact her/stopped saying that, and I understand that it means something different to her, I told her I can't really in good faith apologize for telling her to explain herself, because that's not what I did. She says I'm not being accountable at all for my behavior. It feels pretty significant to me that she wants me to apologize for saying ""Why do you want to go back"" versus me saying what I actually said.

For me, I feel like she's trying to hold me responsible for things I didn't do, which doesn't really sit well. For her, she sees no difference between me having told her to explain herself vs. what I actually said. How can I navigate this, is there a term for this kind of miscommunication?",01Jan2020,1

717,"so story time:

I literally just got off the phone with this person.

I answered a phone call from a strange number because i work for both hospitals in my town and even though I'm not on call today you just never know, so I answered.

It was an old friend wishing me a happy new year. When i asked about the new number he said he didn't have a cell phone anymore because they don't let you have them at the psych hospital.

I had know for a long time that he has issues and they were intense but i hadn't heard of him going to a hospital for it before. I asked him what prompted the visit thinking maybe had checked himself in because he has made efforts to help himself in the past.

He made some dodgy noises which i knew meant he was dancing around telling me straight up what happened even though he wanted to.

It didn't take long to figure out he had tried to hurt himself. Pills.

He said he'd been in the hospital for the past 5 weeks. Before Thanksgiving.

I had spent a long time distancing myself from this person because he was very toxic friend for me when we were in college and when i finally figured that out and tried to adjust the friendship and make him understand things just....wouldn't change.

We have hung out once in a while since the college days and while he has improved over all as a person I could still see old patterns between the two of us so I distanced myself from him a lot. I only really communicate with him when he calls me and it had lead to large time skips where very bad things have happened to him but I still kept my distance because the toxic patterns were so strong and I just couldn't deal with it.

In the past few years since we were in college together he has:

Worked as a translator for francophone immigrants and refugees (hes had to help them get medical help and he's had to listen tot heir stories of war and being child soldiers etc.)

Come out to his family and dealt with the ongoing insanity of their old world attitudes

Been raped...twice

Tried to get his masters degrees in several languages only to have his mental health severely get in the way of school work

Been hired and fired from several jobs (some with family)

taken on almost full responsibility for his severely handicap brother who is legally blind and autistic

Been in several failed relationships

And can't seem to keep or have any friends

&amp;#x200B;

NOW we have attempted suicide to add to the list.

&amp;#x200B;

I've agreed to meet up with him next week if let let him out of the hospital after his diagnoses.

The toxic stuff I've had to deal with this friend is being treated like I'm his personal assistant/keeper/maid/simple minded friend, not having my schedule or wants respected, overall being several self centered and unhelpful when needed, and just..... wanting to change and be happier but not wanting to follow my advice or try things my way. I can try to give specifics but over all that's the same general pattern. 

I've never felt like an equal to him. And when I tried to establish equality in the relationship he subconciously puts me back down. Part of how our ""friendship"" started was him tutoring me in french...which he would do almost ruthlessly for hours and then we would just sit around at his (messy) apartment when we weren't in school. And he kept offering me ideas of being his personal assistant in the future when we were out of college and trying to bribe me with food to clean up his dishes and apartment and just.... in retrospect i realize i should have just left his apartment when things were done and hung out with other fucking people but i was such a ride or die kind of girl back then.

While he has made some improvements over the years, when we hung out a few times, I still felt like I was always following his lead or just being his care taker.

this suicide thing is new though and I can't just.... cut him off. I don't feel like that's the right response here. but I would love advice on how I should handle our meeting if it happens. please advise.",01Jan2020,1
718,"This is a mobile post so apologies ahead of time lol.

I am 17f, soon to be 18 later this month. I‚Äôm planning for college, applying, thinking about a career etc. My mother has always been loving and I appreciate her so much for all of the hard work she did when we were extremely poor. She‚Äôs not a bad person at all, however she isn‚Äôt always the best parent. She has always disregarded my diagnosed anxiety and my possible depression (this is undiagnosed, but I hated my therapist too much to keep going to find out). She also has always loved to invade my privacy by tracking my every move and sometimes even demanding to read my text messages. I‚Äôm not a partier, I don‚Äôt like staying out late, I never enjoyed that stuff so I usually stay home and play games or read etc etc, so I always felt the tracking and snooping super unnecessary. She‚Äôs relaxed on the phone tracking now but she can still be invasive about my privacy at times. 

Basically what I‚Äôm saying is I don‚Äôt hate my mom and she‚Äôs a pretty good one but I don‚Äôt really get my own space. College has always seemed like an opportunity for me to finally branch off on my own and be more independent. I want to go somewhere other than my home state but she is extremely unsupportive of that. She even threatened to try to force me to stay. This is ironic because she has admitted that as of age 18 I legally get to make all of my own decisions AND I am the one who‚Äôll be paying off my student loans for years, not her. Ultimately I am going to decide where I go to college and I‚Äôve made that clear to her. She thinks that, or she‚Äôs pretending to think this to make me feel guilty, I want to get away from her and I hate her, which is so far from the truth. I just need to go experience things and make my own decisions. She also talks to her friends and our family about how I want to go far away and manipulates it to sound like I‚Äôm completely unaware that travel expenses are a thing. (Ive been working two jobs along with high school to save up for this exact reason.)

Also, the place I want to go is ~3,000 from where we live currently but it is the state that has most of the opportunities for the two careers I‚Äôm thinking of going into. 

When the time comes for me to choose a college, and if it happens to be far away, how do I tell her without her freaking out on me and trying to force me to stay?",01Jan2020,1

I‚Äôm currently a senior in high school and in the process of applying to college. I‚Äôve lost all my motivation, everything just seems like too much for me.

720,"Was at a NYE party and got trashed. Was talking to my friend's girlfriend--can't remember most of the details--and started touching her arm, making deep eye contact like I was seducing her.

Nobody else noticed or remembered, haven't seen the girl since, but she was drunk as well. I'm fucking embarrassed to say the least.  

I'm going to put this in the least braggadocios manner possible: I'm a handsome guy and my friend is quite jealous by nature, especially about his girlfriend (who is extremely loyal and would NEVER think about cheating). I've never once made a pass or so much as checked this girl out, even though she hangs around with the guys a lot. Always cordial and distant like a friend. I'm worried that she'll bring it up, even casually, and it'll fuck up the relationship between me and my bro. I'd prefer if nobody ever spoke about this and it was erased from our collective memory, but if she does tell him, what's the best way to respond?

Since this is a new year I'm deciding whether this is the year I will finally make this happen. I often feel shorted by my appearance and that the process of meeting new people (and definitely my dating life) would be improved if I'd rolled the genetics dice better.

We haven't talked at all for the past few months, I tried getting things to somehow work out by asking to talk to her in private, but she told me that there was no way our relationship was going to work out and said some hurtful things, after which I gave up on the idea.

I've been slowly making progress on getting over the breakup, but I still care about her. I'm mad at her for being awful to me but I don't want anything bad to happen to her. 

Recently I learned that she's been suicidal for a while, and this kind of crushed me inside. I don't want her to hurt herself in any way shape or form, and I don't know how to help her. 
Do I contact her directly? I know she sometimes relied on relationship to keep herself happy but at the same time I feel like these same relationships might've hurt her a LOT, and me persuading her to talk to me about her problems might help her in the short run but be even more hurtful overall, as she tends to worry a lot about imperfections in relationships and mistakes she may have made (like ""I know heckaroo666 cares about me, but what if I'm hurting him by letting him care for me?"", which would make her more depressed because she doesn't want to hurt anyone else). 
Should I ask her friends to check up on her? I'm afraid that she will break down if she realizes that her friends know about this, and her friends are not capable of making her happy without her realizing that they're aware of her suicidal thoughts.

730," I posted this to [r/legaladvice](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/) last night but haven't heard much. Have any of y'all been in a similar situation and how did you get out of it?

Location: AL

A little while ago my roommate got back together with an ex and became engaged with a month. Now she has informed me that she will be moving out and in with her fiance. Additionally, she has be struggling to hold down a job and previously asked if she could delay paying me for utilities, I agreed thinking I was being a good friend. But she now owes me more than $700. I told her that I can no longer support her financially. She has not been at the apartment in about two weeks, I believed that she was spending time with family for the holidays but found out she is now living with her fiance. She told me Monday that she is moving out and is starting a new job. She told me that once she was settled she would pay me back and continue to pay rent but will no longer pay utilities, but I do not believe that she will to pay or that she will hold down this job.

I have a new roommate lined up that I would like to take over the lease but her current lease is not over from another month.

I have skimmed through the lease and I did not see a buy-out clause and it stated that I am not allowed to sublease.

My goals:

1. Remove current roommate from the lease and my life
2. get new roommate on the lease
3. reclaim some of the money that my current roommate owes me (although I am not hopeful)

Additionally, I currently have renter's insurance and my current roommate does not. Renter's insurance is required on the lease.

How to I achieve my goals, do I need a lawyer, and what will this cost me (beside this expensive life lesson)?",01Jan2020,1
731,"So...

I slept with my ex and got knocked up. I found out fairly quick and even though I didn't plan on having an abortion i did explore the route. I went in for the intake, and last friday i've decided that bringing a child in to this world wirh this man wasn't going to do me or the child any favours.
(He told me to abort or do it alone, he didn't want to have anything to do with it. Ghosted and blocked me shortly after).

So. Since i was only a few weeks along all it took was some medication. There was one pill I had to take under supervision and two were given to me to insert 'up there' to initiate the bleeding. Last sundaynight i did just that, cuddled up in bed and waited for it to start. I somehow managed to fall asleep and didn't wake up again until wednesday morning, at the hospital.

Due to some older injuries something went wrong and i bled way more than I should have, causing me to essentially ""pass out"" leaving my 7yr old to find me. Luckily he handled it like a fucking champ and I ended up in the hospital.

Now, according to the doctor i went in to a shock of sorts causing a heart attack, something he called ""flatlining"" and eventually damage to my kidneys. I woke up on wednesdaymorning, saw my kids for a few minutes and slept the rest of the day.

Wednesday evening I woke up and decided that enough was enough. I have been beaten down before, i've been left alone to handle the shittiest of situations and I have taken it all with a smile.

So, with me heavily medicated, unable to leave this bed (now and for the forseeable future) and constantly in and out of sleep i decided to write a post on r/foreveralonedating in an attempt to make some friends, meet some cool people and start the new year off feeling less lonely.

Now, during all of the above my dad, brother and friend all tried reaching out to my ex to figure out what exactly happened (His biggest concern was someone finding out about his decision to nope out of potential fatherhood, he was worried they'd think he's a coward, so I didn't tell anyone). He never replied. He never reached out, he never cared. He didn't check in with me either. He didn't care. That's his right, i guess.

So, my post ""showed up"" on his redditfeed (sure buddy, my post on an obscure sub that got a 140 upvotes somehow showed up on your feed) and he reached out to my friend attacking her, accusing her of lying about the whole thing, claiming he ""didn't know why he let himself get worked up"" over it, that none of it is true because ""i'm trying to date"". Like, really?

I tried contacting him directly, i'm not too sure about why I did that, but you guessed it, no response.

Here is why i am livid.
1) He slept with me, to only claim he was ""trying to do something nice"" for me once things went south
2) I gave him an out while i had every right to biologically, morally and legally hold him to his obligations. I didn't even blink when he took it.
3) He didn't offer to accompany me to have the abortion done, he never once checked in.
4) his main concern was his reputation. His main worry was people knowing what he did. He was fine doing it, he just didn't want anyone to know AND I RESPECTED IT.
5) He didn't have the guts or the common decency to reply to my brother or father with what he knew leaving them wondering. Had I not made it, they would have been left wondering.

I am regretting aborting an innocent child like nobody's business, the physical damage to my heart and kidneys is permanent and might cause me to not be able to go back to my job, a job I love with everything I have.
In general, I feel like shit and i am fuming about the fact that me trying to stand up and dust myself off, make new friends and to not let any of this completely defeat me is being taken as a stick to beat me with by a man who claimed he didn't want anything to do with me, but is clearly still keeping an eye on me so he could find sticks to further beat me down with.

I am hurt and angry, and I feel stupid. I am not thinking straight and I don't know how to handle this situation. All I can think of is lashing out and hitting him where it hurts, but the tiny bit of logic that isn't being drowned by anger tells me to think things trough. So what I need advice on. What do I do here? How do I handle this? He's not going to have a mature conversation about it and he's not going to respond. I want to move on, leave this shitstorm behind me and just feel safe and happy. It's been enough. What the fuck do I do?",01Jan2020,1
732,"I (f21) recently have been thinking a lot about my future as I‚Äôm in the last year of uni and need to get all my ducks in a row. 

I said to my boyfriend (m25) what does your 5 year plan look like, and he literally had no answer, in the past he said he was ya to go travelling with me and then also about getting a mortgage with his sister. He wants to get on the property ladder, and doesn‚Äôt want to rent (we both live at our dads after I moved out of my student house after two years where he lived with me for a year and a bit. 

Our futures just do not look compatible. I said I‚Äôll be 26, I want to be in probation or youth offending hopefully god willing qualified, I want to be looking at getting a mortgage or already having one. Be engaged/married, thinking about kids, I want to be settled down. 

I mentioned the idea of moving out of London renting so we can save and have lower living costs, I have lived 2 hours from my family since I was just 18, however he didn‚Äôt like this idea and said he could commute to London for work but I know it‚Äôs a disguise because he doesn‚Äôt want to move away from his hometown. 

He always scoots around having children when we talk about them because I love babies but I have no intention to babytrap him but he seems to think I can‚Äôt control it. I also believe he thinks my mental state isn‚Äôt good which is fine but again I want to talk about the future because it excites me not because I want to have children straight away. 

Now the main issue I have, the mortgage with his sister. Realistically a mortgage is 20-30 years long something I‚Äôm not willing to wait around for, he is under the impression it won‚Äôt be that long and he will be able to get around that. However, I said I won‚Äôt be waiting 15 years for him to pay off a mortgage and then get one with me it‚Äôs ridiculous.  

He said ‚Äò Like so what for
Example , if we rent for the next 5 ! Then for some reason we break up , then I‚Äôm 30
With nothing . And like my dad said like you should get on it early as possible cos like you don‚Äôt want to be working still when your old and that! Doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm writing you out but like you have to think about these things unfortunately‚Äô 

It makes me think I‚Äôm not apart of his future Because he keeps writing me out of it.",01Jan2020,1

Over the years, I have gone through more mental abuse and torment than I‚Äôd like to admit. They have physically abused me a few times as well. They verbally assault one another at least twice a day. Sometimes even resulting in physical fights.The screaming is one of my worst triggers for my anxiety. It‚Äôs so physically exhausting living at home, and I genuinely fear for my own safety here.

741,"The parents (we'll call them A&amp;B) own an apartment building in Boston, MA and, as of last year, it is worth about $1 million. (They remortgaged about 5 years ago, for repairs.) My girlfriend lives in one of the apartments. (She pays rent.) A&amp;B both have health issues. (Severe breathing and heart related problems.)

&amp;#x200B;

A few Christmases ago, my gf's sister (we'll call her C) paid for a couple of wills on one of those sites like legalzoom or whatever, and tried to gift them to A&amp;B. World War 3 erupted and A&amp;B refused to speak to C for more than a year. (A&amp;B claimed that C was trying to coerce them into leaving the apartment to C, or some such nonsense.)

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is, without at least one will, if A&amp;B die, the house will belong to the bank. A&amp;B claim they want to leave the house to my gf, but they still don't have a will...

&amp;#x200B;

How can I, as an outsider, convince A&amp;B that, regardless of who they leave the house to, they should really have a will? I don't want my opinions to be taken out on my gf, even though she feels the same way, but would never bring it up for fear of pissing off A&amp;B.

&amp;#x200B;

(FTR - I'm fairly certain that A&amp;B are afraid of dying, and THAT is the reason they don't want to discuss having a will. It's frustrating, but I don't know what any of us can do to even start this conversation with A&amp;B.)",01Jan2020,1

To stop this akward moment I said we can schedule this conversation (it was late and we both were tired). After 2 weeks and multiple requests she said no but wanted to stay as friends. And I agreed. Afterwise I knew this was a bad decision, why I quitted the friendship. I really thought I would get over her and everything would stay the same.
Now, 3 months later without any contact to her, nothing changed. Neither, I can barely sleep nor focus on anything. She's always in my mind. I feel so doomed.

I suffer with anxiety and depression so that could play a part in it. It‚Äôs got to the point of which I feel so isolated because I only really have one long term friend. I get along with these people I meet so well and I‚Äôd really like to be in touch I just don‚Äôt know what steps to take to make friendships more then just adding someone on social media. For example we message maybe once or twice then never again. 

Not really sure if this is the right sub, just wanted to know if anyone struggles with this and knows any ways to ‚Äòget out there‚Äô in terms of making friends and stuff.
Maybe I‚Äôm just overthinking this.",01Jan2020,1
752,"I really hope I can post this here since I would appreciate the advice and hope someone can help me.   
 

A little about me first. I‚Äôm a 25 year old male. I grew up an orphan and don‚Äôt know my parents. I‚Äôve grew up with a couple of different foster parents and have been abused by one of them. I have no friends, no SO, no people I can talk to and spend most of my time  at home feeling incredibly lonely. On top of that I hate my job so both my work life as well as my free time is spent feeling worthless. I am incredibly ugly (this is not self-warped image, the foster parents i stayed with the longest have told me this repeatedly and also my previous friends and one of my exes have told me this). Furthermore I have incredibly bad social skills, depression and social anxiety so making new friends is not really something that i can just do. I take drugs to cope but they don‚Äôt really work and make me feel empty and useless. Besides this I view the world, as well as life as quite negative in its all and think a lot of people are massive dickheads and life isn‚Äôt worth living. Or at least not for me.  
 

So, I‚Äôm in a really bad spot at the moment and have actively rationalized me killing myself. I think suicide is the most logical option for me and there is no way around it. The way I view it you could have a good life if the ‚Äò‚Äôgood‚Äô‚Äô (and what this means is different for everybody) in your life outweighs the bad, and you have a bad life if the ‚Äò‚Äôbad‚Äô‚Äô in your life (and what bad means is different for everybody) outweighs the good. Death seems to be the absolute middlepoint between those two since its the absence of both. Is it then not more logical for me to kill myself then to keep on living? I understand that this is a gamble, it can better. But then again, it might not get better, so its a gamble either way. With my past in the back of my mind I think it‚Äôs safer gambling on dying and let everything end then to gamble on keeping on living and hoping that things will change. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I used to have hope, lots of it! But I feel like keeping on hoping is just denying reality and setting myself up for dissapointment I just got off the phone with a suicide hotline and she basically told me that I‚Äôm philosophising too much and that she couldn‚Äôt help me in that way. So i really hope some people have some advice for me, I want to think differently, I don‚Äôt know why, maybe its just the survival bias in me. But everytime I think about it I feel like there is no reason to think differently and thinking that suicide is the most logical option.   
 

Some advice that I think won‚Äôt help in my case:  
 ‚Äò‚ÄôGo and travel‚Äô‚Äô: I did this already, three times. I‚Äôve never felt more lonely then those times.  
 ‚ÄúWhat about your loved ones‚Äù: Besides the fact that I think this is bad advice because it just tells someone to live for others,  I don‚Äôt have them. Literally. I have some collegues who might be a bit saddened but nothing so bad that it would convince me to keep on living.  
 ‚Äúmaybe there is an afterlive and who says that isn‚Äôt worse then this life‚Äù: If thats the case then keeping on living is just procrastinating and I will end up there eventually regardless. I‚Äôll gladly take that gamble.   
 ‚ÄúHave you talked to a professional about your problems‚Äù: Yes, I‚Äôm with my 4th psychologist. It doesn‚Äôt help sadly.  
 ‚ÄúTry to get hobbies‚Äù: I have them, I enjoy them to a point. But they don‚Äôt outweigh the bad.

So, I reached out to my previous employer. They said no problem. We have av position opening up if your interested.

Here is the thing. I feel in letting my family down. The new job has paid professional training, 6% matching 401k, paid vacation and is about 10,000 more per year in salary.

My previous employer is 3% matching 401k. No other benefits and I loose any money if I take days off.......but they have a great culture and my Boss was a wonderful person.

I need to make this decision tomorrow. I'm 42 and have been contacting for about 10 years.

I don't know if I need to just suck it up and focus on the benefits of the new job or cut my losses and go back where I feel I'll be happier.

Can someone please give me advice? Have you been in this position before?",01Jan2020,1
757,"So my boyfriend and I have been dating 1 year and 5 months. When we started dating, things were kinda up in the air because he asked me out before he was over his ex. I broke things off with him after a month and a half amicably. I told him to take as much time as he needed to decide what he wanted because I don't play games and wasn't gonna be second choice if/when things with her didn't work out. I told him to contact me only when he was sure.

6 days later, he texted me and we restarted dating. I thought we were cool. He went to his sister's elopey wedding the following day. His ex was a witness. He told me that nothing happened. I believed him.

Then his ex started texting him nonstop, and I told him to block her or get lost. He blocked her.

A few months ago, over a year into our relationship, we talked about the wedding. He said that he and his ex talked only small talk. I asked him if anything else ever happened, and he said no. I believed him. End of story, right?

Fast forward to last night.

We saw his ex through a mutual friend on our way to dinner. When we went back to his place after eating, we started talking about the wedding, which at this point was over a year ago. He nonchalantly dropped into the conversation that they kissed at the end of the party. WHAT?!

I thought he was joking, but he wasn't. I called him out for lying, but he said ""I thought you knew. I thought I told you,"" repeatedly, then changed his story to ""Well maybe I was just trying to block it out of my head."" Like, wtf, why would I know unless he told me? He said he was sorry. I wasn't rude or nasty to him. I very politely said, ""I'm not sure how I'm feeling right now. I'd like to leave."" Then I left. Haven't heard from him since

He kissed her (more than a peck, but not make-out), the night after he told me that he was done with her and wanted to pursue me. And then lied to my face on multiple occasions.

I know for a fact that he has not seen her since the wedding or talked to her since he blocked her. He's not a cheater, but now I don't know what to think. He has been so kind, supportive, and loyal. Was it real? Was it all an act? I have no clue what to believe anymore.

The kiss bothers me, but it was at a weird time for him emotionally (she was very mentally and emotionally abusive). I don't know how to feel about that. But lying to my face hurts me the most. I feel so confused.

What do you guys think and what would you do?

767,"The story is this. I'm 20 years old. I started going out more just in the past maybe 6 months. In this time I've gone to house party's, gay bars, hanging out with people I don't know very well in the hopes of making friends, and got a new job where people are really nice, sociable and friendly. This has all culminated into me getting far out of my comfort zone and meeting so many new people. I'm proud of myself and I feel like I'm really livin' bein' 20, and bein' more myself.

So, that's the backstory. This is about one of those party's. It was actually Christmas party. Annually thrown by a coworker of mine, who has a lavish house and wife and kids. Most people I work with were there and also a bunch of other people who used to, or know someone who does work there. So I got to meet a lot of new people.

Now, one of these people was a much older man... you probably know where this is going. This guy is the brother of a woman I work with who I've been extremely captivated by. She chain smokes, calls herself an ""ol' broad"", and wears a fur coat given to her by her ""mother out-law"", she's hilarious, kind, and an enigma. And apparently has a gay younger brother who is extremely similar to her. Immediately I was so enthralled by the two of them. Although he is 8 years younger than she is, he is still definitely in his 50's.

I had noticed him earlier that night and thought, he's a very handsome older man, then when I saw him with his sister and there back-and-forth I thought they were so fascinating and hilarious. I didn't pay him too much thought as I was talking to other people. Eventually, I ventured out to the patio, where a small group of people were hanging out. He was one of them and very quickly started making eyes at me. We introduced ourselves and he continued to give me looks. Later we ended up talking in the house, in the kitchen, where most everyone else is. He asks me about myself and I do the same. I learn he's a realtor and lives in a town an hour away that I frequent, cause that's where all the gay bars are and I have friends there. While were talking my coworker jokingly says to him ""he's too young for you"". I was not interested in him in that way and I don't think he was either, I think we were both genuinely fascinated by one another. We both do the party act where you meander into tons of different conversations with different people. But come back to each other a few times. All the while he keeps repetitively telling me ""your so interesting"" and ""there's something interesting about you"" and looked at me with this expression like the way you'd study a painting in a museum, this is also why he stood out to me so much. Its hard not to like someone who keeps telling you your so interesting. When it came time for me to leave, he gave me this long thoughtful goodbye as if we would run into each other again. Then I said ""if I'm ever in (the city he lives in), would you wanna hangout?"". He says yes with a somewhat surprised demeanor, I ask for his number, he opens his wallet to give me his business card but is flustered that he doesn't have one, so I enter it into my phone. I feel really good about this, as this is new for me. I leave feeling good and excited.

But a day or two later I started feeling, not regretful, but unsure. Unsure if I should contact him, unsure of what we would do if I did, or what the dynamic would be, as I've never had an older friend before, but I also don't want to put him in a label. This all occurred a few days before Christmas, now its new years day. I haven't reached out to him at all, but I don't feel pressure to as I got his number with the understanding i'd contact him at some grey point in the future when I'd happen to be in town. I thought this was a good idea at the time, but now I'm second guessing myself, and I'm not sure if I should contact him at all. I have plans in the near future to go to this city, completely independent of him. But I'm surprisingly leaning towards not contacting him. But I would like the adventure to see what its like, but it would be horribly awkward. Especially meeting at a party, then seeing each other one on one is totally different. And especially what would we do together?

I hope you were at least entertained by this story, I'd love to hear if you have any advice or comments. Happy New year.",01Jan2020,1

770,"So, I am going to give a little backstory.

My family has literally moved around the country since I was little. We get bored of places and just pack up and move and for the most part its really exciting. But about 9 years ago we moved to Ohio and I fell in love. I was there for 6 years and in that 6 years I met my now husband. After the 6 years we moved to Arizona, then back to Ohio, then my family wanted to go back to our hometown of Chicago and my husband and I stayed in Ohio. Then after like 6 months we started missing them so we came up to Chicago for about 6 months and then we went back to Ohio after found a really nice house. This was January of 2019. Around May 2019 I started having extreme anxiety and DP and I struggled, like A LOT. We got married in August and in Oct we found out we were expecting. Now, I do not have family in OH so I really liked the idea of raising our child in CHI with my family. So, we moved around thanksgiving. We found out we lost the baby about a week later. Which obviously did not at all help my anxiety.

NOW

This is my problem. We moved to CHI so that I could be closer to family for the baby. I love my family and we are very close but my mom made a good point about a week ago. She said ""I'm surprised you haven't moved back to Ohio by now."" And something just clicked. I was like, yeah why haven't we? My husband had a really awesome job in OH that he LOVES. And his boss literally told him to come back whenever we wanted, that it would always be there for him. And like I said, as much as I love my family, I am much happier in OH. I have lots of friends, and I have my own space. Right now, my husband and I are living in the basement of a house with SEVEN people in it. We don't even have our own bed, we take turns with my dad sleeping in a bed, and then switched to an air mattress. I am losing my fucking mind in this house. We literally can't do anything with someone always badgering us about money, where were going, this and that. I cant take it. I really want to tell my dad that I want to move back but I am so scared and I don't even know why. I am so anxious about the whole situation. I know that I need to do whats best for me and my husband as well as my mental health, but I am just scared that I will disappoint him bc this would be the second time I am telling him I want to move back to OH. The first time he was so supportive, but for some reason, I just feel like he is going to flip out. My anxiety is just telling me not to say anything, but my husband called his former boss, and his boss said he needed someone by the beginning of FEB and that the pay would be double than last time.

I planned on starting again this month and just went homeless so i've just been planning on moving to iraq for a while to relax and spend some time with my family and childhood friends and start in the next school year but i'm overthinking how i'm going to be a 20 year old in highschool who will start college in his 20s and how pathetic it seems compared to others and keep thinking how i failed everyone that cares for me if they even still do
I just thought i could find a helpful opinion or some advice here

Does anyone see why i would be so hurt by her comment or should i let it go.... this women has also told me she hated me. Im so lost and hurt. Yes we argue but its about things she lies about or when she hurts my feelingss. Im older now i should be able to speak up for someone else when someone tells me to shut the fuck up.

775,"I know, it‚Äôs a tale as old as time, I should grow up, be happy for her etc. I‚Äôm trying. But still am very confused and upset by change. 

Me and, I‚Äôll call her C, have been best friends since we were 9 years old. Our friendship has been through a lot, and we‚Äôve been so close through the years that we‚Äôd refer to our friendship as a marriage, jokingly. We know each other better than ourselves, or at least we did. We considered one another soul mates. It‚Äôs like we were linked and I always knew how she was feeling, what she was thinking and vice versa. 

We spent most of our lives living 5 mins away from each other. We‚Äôd always be having sleepovers, if not we‚Äôd be on the phone or on a road trip somewhere together. Her house was my second home. I moved away in 2017 to go to uni, about 200 miles away. She‚Äôs visit me in my first year and I‚Äôd go back to visit her. We‚Äôd speak often when we weren‚Äôt together, usually on FaceTime. 

We both got into serious relationships round about the same time. I met my bf at uni September 2018 and then she met her bf on tinder January 2019. She had a lot of doubts about their relationship at first; she‚Äôs a very insecure and anxious person, but she was telling me her boyfriend still spoke to his ex etc so I didn‚Äôt want to invest in this guy too much in case he was bad. 

Fast forward 8 months or so, and they‚Äôve sorted everything out, she trusts him more than ever and by September 2019, me and C don‚Äôt speak as much anymore. I guess she‚Äôs happy at this point and doesn‚Äôt need me for advice anymore. But I start to realise I miss her. 

I try to organise meet up events halfway between where we both live but she‚Äôs always too busy. C works part time as a cleaner. I‚Äôd see snapchats,  instagrams etc of her with other friends and admittedly, I‚Äôd feel jealous. 

But I don‚Äôt think anything makes me more jealous than her and her boyfriend. Now this isn‚Äôt some Freudian thing, I‚Äôm not in love with her. I love her like she were a part of me, but that‚Äôs just the way we‚Äôve always been. It‚Äôs weird. I see posts of her and her boyfriend, and they‚Äôre literally exactly the same as ones she‚Äôd post of me. She calls him the same names as a joke, films him doing stupid things in the same way we‚Äôd do. I look at it and it‚Äôs like looking at her friendship only with someone who isn‚Äôt me. 

Now I‚Äôm happy with my partner, but I miss my best friend. When I see them doing the same things we did, her literally referring to him in the same ways (and they‚Äôre pretty niche ways, not things everyone uses), it hurts and I don‚Äôt get it. 

When I see her nowadays, there‚Äôs a distance between us. She greets me in the most underwhelming manner, as if we haven‚Äôt known each other for the best part of a decade. Obviously I could go into much, much more depth but I wouldn‚Äôt know where to start and where to end. 

I thought to myself , maybe I was distant when first in  a relationship and she‚Äôs going through the same stage, but it‚Äôs been a year now. I missed her a year into my relationship, but she doesn‚Äôt need me anymore.",01Jan2020,1
776,"I'm a college student who is very involved in both my church and my campus ministry. In my church I serve as an acolyte and nursery worker, as well as a regular congregation member who just tries to help out whenever. Basically, working / acolyting or not, church is an ordeal. Between getting ready, work prep, taking my coworker to work, etc. actually being at church, and socializing after, church is roughly from 9:00 AM - 12:00 / 12:30 PM. AKA Most of my morning. I love that however and wouldn't change anything about it for the world.  
  
That being said, I'm on the executive board for my campus ministry (a separate / unrelated organization) as well as a Bible study leader. Every other Sunday we have an hour long board meeting, and then a two hour Bible study leader meeting.  
  
The board meetings are good. We plan potlucks and game nights and other events, work on things like posters or t-shirts, get quotes for things, etc.  
  
The leadership meetings however are the worst. We all ""sit in fellowship"" for about an hour. Talking and being friends, but mostly discussing how God moved in our lives over the past two weeks and then conducting a brief scripture study.  Then we have some kind of unhelpful lesson for the second hour.
  
Now before you judge me, I love scripture study, and I love all of the people in leadership meetings. However, these are the people I go to church with on Sundays, these are some of the people at board meetings, these are the people I go to worship / scripture study nights with every Tuesday, these are the people in all my group chats, these are my friends I see every other day. I read the Bible all the time. I pray constantly. I know what is going on in these people's lives. I don't need to ""be in (forced) fellowship"" with my FRIENDS for an hour, when I can be doing other things, and see them probably the following day and catch up with them organically and at a deeper level.
  
These meetings feel like a waste. I already go to church, I know these people, I read scripture, I pray. Every other Sunday I spend 3 hours at church, have a 4 hour gap, then I have to go to 3 hours worth of meetings. If you include carpool / travel time, set up, and clean up, it's most of my day. We don't discuss anything that's ever been helpful at these meetings, and I honestly feel like it's a huge waste that every other Sunday after going to church and board meetings I have to go to a pointless meeting for two hours where I can do nothing but sit there.  
  
Is it wrong for me to wish I didn't have to be a Bible study leader solely because of these meetings? I understand that at times such as in working a job or career you HAVE to go to meetings that suck, and it's a non negotiable or you lose your job. But, I don't HAVE to be a Bible study leader. I can step down. After 4 semesters of these meetings I'm honest fed up.",01Jan2020,1

781,"Been in a long distance relationship for two and a half years. When I met her online I was in a bad mental state. Didn't have any goal in life and was suicidal. I was upfront about it but she still fell in love with me. Decided I'd do something with my life because I wanted to be with her (she didn't pressure me to do anything). She's been a year in my country (erasmus), near my city and we've spent a lot of time together. Decided that I want to make it as a musician. She said she would support me. Recorded an album with a friend and released it not too long ago. During those 2 years I've worked part time jobs and tried uni again but quit because I hated it. Also during that time we'd see each other regularly. She studied medicine and worked in hospitals during summer breaks. The relationship seemed perfect to me, we weren't just lovers but also best friends. We have similar interests. Neither one of us is a very social person. I loved her and have always been loyal, honest and trusted her. She's been the same with me. The issue was never the love, trust, nor the distance since she's finishing uni this summer and moving to my country in autumn/winter. 

The problem for her was my education/occupation. About two months ago she sent me a message and wrote in a way that she's never texted me before. It didn't even feel like her when I read it. She basically wanted me to think about getting a full time job since she believes I will never really find success with music and in a way be a ""burden"" to her. I felt a bit betrayed since in all the time that we've been together she always said the opposite. I replied in an unwise manner and said something along the lines of ""maybe you should find another guy then"". I didn't mean it obviously, I wanted to grow old with her and for some reason hoped she'd reply with something like ""don't be silly"". She obviously didn't. She got hurt that I wouldn't even think about it and just tell her to leave me. She said that she can't rely on me, although I had been nothing but realiable for the two years that she's been in my country. I had even helped her financially because her parents couldn't fully support her. In retrospect I realize that she didn't value all the things I had done for her but back then I thought she was right. Apologized and begged for forgiveness. At first she wanted a break. It was hard to accept but I said okay. After just one day of not texting, she texts me. Says she is ready to move on from that situation. We text but it felt like she didn't really want to engage in any conversation, didn't want to be in a call with me either. After a few days she tells me she wants a break again. I told her it's fine if we don't have contact for a month or so but again, after 2 days, she texts me. Says she misses me and wants to forgive me. We started getting to the bottom of our issue and concluded that we need to communicate better. After that we kinda went back to normal for 2 weeks or so. 

One day she started being passive in texts again and I had a weird feeling. Thought maybe she's just having a bad day and didn't pry. On the same day in the evening she suddenly texts me that she wants to end it. Apparently she felt this ""pain"" that wouldn't go away and she thinks she'd be happier without me etc. I felt awful, couldn't breath, felt dizzy, my heart ached. I got desperate and tried to say anything that could make her stay (pro tip fellas, when somebody breaks up with you, the worst thing you can do is get desperate and try to hold on to them, it just pushes them away even more). She was kinda ignoring me but I begged her to tell me why exactly she broke up with me. She eventually gave me a long text in which she detailed the things that led to her decision. I agreed with some of the things she had written but also disagree with others. At the time I was a love addict who was losing his drug, so I couldn't give a level headed response (apparently heartbreak can be compared to withdrawal from cocaine or heroine). She decided to block me which felt even worse. I couldn't understand how she could break up with me and not work this out when 2 weeks prior we talked about communicating better with each other. We've never faced a serious issue in our relationship and when a difficult time arose, she just gave up.

I'm lucky to have great, supportive parents and friends who I could talk to. It's been almost a month since she blocked me and I had time to think about it all and accept it. I believe everything happens for a reason and that I've learned a lesson or two. She has helped me in certain ways as well. I'm grateful for the experience but I also can't help but feel used in a way. She never asked me to help her financially or anything like that. She paid for me too when I was visiting her in her country. It's not like she was after the money but I had helped her with a lot of other things here as well. I've put her on her two feet so she can live and work in this country. To me it seemed like an obvious thing to do for someone you love. I know I said I've accepted that it's over but at the same time there is still something inside me that hopes she will change her mind.

Is there anyone who has been in a similar situation? Also any females here who have gotten together with a guy they've broken up with after some time? Or guys who got together with a girlfriend that broke up with them? What's the longest they haven't contacted you? I reckon it wouldn't be smart to get together with her as she might leave me again when there is an issue in the relationship.",01Jan2020,1

My client decided that he is paying them too much and hired me as a solo developer instead. I‚Äôm really doing my best and working 12-14 hours a day to achieve the best results but it‚Äôs simply not possible for a single man to compete with the work done by a whole teams for years. The new version was developed in solo by me and of course it misses some features that are on the roadmap. Now when old app is removed, we rolled out my version of an app (with less features and different design) and it‚Äôs reviews are mostly negative with main message being something like ‚ÄúPrevious app was better and with more features‚Äù.

Everything was fine and I was happy about it till the salesman starting telling me about the must have insurances (mostly, 3000 policy for wheels and tires). I just could not justify paying close to 46700 for 3 years and then on top of it, worry about stupid repair shop bills (he said in a bragging way that the car I was getting was so cool, just the brakes cost 8000 which translated to my mind as - oh shit, if the brakes go out, I am paying 8 grand!). I was there with my family (wife and kids who are less then 10 years old). The excuse I made was my kids were hungry (they were) and we will come back tomr. I feel pretty embarrassed but I thought it was better to just walk way then go with the deal and regret later. I really liked the car and even test drove it but feel for the salesman.

So as the title suggests, he just kissed the girl I‚Äôm seeing. They were both pretty drunk last night on New Years. She is incredibly friendly and was laughing and having a good time.

791,"Lately at work there's been a person in another department giving me dirty looks. Let's call her Yolanda. I ignored it and just smiled at her. Well, after a couple months of this, my boss told me that Yolanda sent him a nasty text about me. It was the pettiest shit ever. I don't want to give away identifying details but it was in the same category of ""LDawg618 picked up two forks by accident and when she returned one of the forks she put it back with the SPOONS! I think she might have done this on purpose!"" She also told my boss something like ""LDawg618 needs to be reprimanded immediately by you because this type of behavior is not okay."" Thankfully my boss isn't out of his fucking mind and defended me. 

Well, Yolanda is now watching me more than she should be because I guess she doesn't have enough to do at work. I simply smile and greet her but she continues to give me the stink eye and not respond. I know I'm not doing anything wrong, but she's making me so nervous that I'm afraid I will do something wrong. Then earlier this week at work, Yolanda's friend was just standing in the hallway (for no apparent reason)  and when I said hi to her she ignored me. I then noticed Yolanda's friend was secretly watching me from the hallway whenever I came into her view, and of course now that's making me nervous. I guess her job isn't keeping her busy enough either. I'm just waiting to hear from my boss that she also told him that I did something ""awful.""

At one point I walked down the hallway with my shoe slightly untied and couldn't fix it right away because my hands were full, so I'm waiting for my boss to find that out from Yolanda after she tells him how I was jeopardizing my safety and the safety of those around me or some bullshit. Anyway, yes, my boss is on my side (for now anyway) which is great, but the point is that these two fools are making my anxiety skyrocket and I don't need that. I'm worried it's going to get bad enough that I'll need to quit, but I really need the money. As you can tell, Yolanda and her friend are not rational people so I can't imagine that talking to them would solve anything. Is there anything I can do to make work non-toxic again?

797,"Hi Reddit. My new years resolution is to get rid of the issue which bothered me for the last year. I'll be very glad if you can help me.

In 2018, after high school, I went through military service. Nothing special, felt lonely, then found a place and worked there day by day till the end. Returned, found a job, quit, found another one for twice the pay, met a girlfriend, moved out to rented flat, planned a marriage, visited a foreign country. All well and good, except for just one thing:

I keep thinking that everybody, even innocent-looking strangers on the street, want to do something bad for me. So I defend, look out for anything suspicious and try not to stand out in any way possible. Basically I try not to be in anybody's way, so they don't have a reason and a chance to interact with me.

799,"I need some help. 6 mo ago I got a job that pays +50% above minimum wage which I was practically making as a dirty car salesman for 9mo. Year before becoming that I was in college for 6mo. The 3-4 months prior to college I was on unemployment after getting fired from a job-which at that time I had no idea how good I had it both financially and the work itself-that provided a decent living. Two years before getting this job I was active duty Navy for 6yrs. To conclude this paragraph, prior to joining the Navy I was a two-time community college dropout and had worked various jobs for the 3years beforehand. Roughly 14yrs of work history. 

Between 2009 and 2017 I was experiencing prosperity. As I climbed the tanks in the Navy and for being married, my income between 2013 and 2015 was good. I was 90% liquid let's say. Had no bills with very few exceptions. 

After getting out of the Navy in 2015 i was lucky and got a job offer from a friend of mine from the Navy. I took it. I continued the path of maintaining an income level and had the highest grossing year of my life in 2016. Now the taxman certainly tooketh his portion. The following year at that company in 2017 contracts, overtime, and bonuses dried up. Resulting in a 33% loss of income compared to year prior.

Then I got fired in November 2017 one week before the Christmas Party, which is also when the year end bonuses would be released. Which was several thousand dollars. 

I didn't receive the bonus and the following year I virtually made minimum wage. The credit card debts have already began to mount. 

In 2018 I quit school and got into car sales. Made minimum wage for a year. Then I quit and my current job which pays +50% more than minimum wage and allows me to finally breathe again and pay the bills. Before I had more money going out than I had coming in and it was incredibly stressful. I began to experience severe anxiety for the first time for several months. Realizing that my attempts at getting a decent job had failed. Such as joining the reserves in 2018 and getting into a shit contract. 

I joined the reserves at the same time I got into car sales. I wanted to become a recruiter and get back on that salary. After two years I never became a recruiter and the reserves was making my situation worse financially as there were military delay of pay issues. Shit job I signed up for and it put my life on hold for two years. 

During this time at the end of 2018 I was working an electrician apprenticeship program and got in after 3 months of the application process. Month 1 is application, if accepted month two you're invited to take the exam, if exam requirements are met you advance to month 3 which is the 6+ person panel interview board. Once you pass the board you're hired and begin.

January 28th, 2019 I am.sitting in the training classroom for the two+ week ""bootcamp."" What was supposed to be a 5yr apprenticeship program was a 10yr commitment. They wanted 10yrs out of you. First 5 is school then the second five is to work off all the debt you owe them from sending you to school. Over 5yrs it was a 36k commitment and if you left before the 10 years you'd owe the remaining balance with interest. They brought out the contracts to sign before lunch. 

It just didn't feel right. And at the time my life was crazy. On the verge of a heated emotionally exhausting divorce. I was facing a possible deployment to Africa that summer of 2019. And I had been smoking a bit of weed and couldn't pass the piss test that was being conducted that afternoon after lunch. 

I race to the pharmacy and grab a dyi pee test kit for THC and take it in their restroom. I fail. I go to the car and weep and never returned to the class because it's better to leave than to fail the test. 

That career path came to a halt and that was my exit strategy. Second was a recruiter and that failed. Selling cars and the reserves got me into more debt over 2018 and 2019. 

So now I'm in 28k credit card debt. And just looking for a way back into a living. And to be free from debt. Never again. 

I also live with my wife and 2 children at her parents house which in Grand total has 12 residents. In a two story 2,000sqft house. It's crazy here.

The depression of my prosperous past haunts me and my anxiety has decreased as I finally make enough to cover the expenses. Which omg I can't tell u how stressful financial woes can be.",01Jan2020,1

Or, I can do it just to be friends with him but I hate being pushy with people and if he doesn't do streaks, i'll feel stupid and rejected.",01Jan2020,1

So this is my situation; I just graduated from a bachelor's degree in computer science from a fairly well-ranked university in a middle-eastern country who is in a dire economical situation and whose future is uncertain and this is why I've been thinking of leaving the country. 

One option would be to apply for a master's degree in Canada where I have the best chance of getting permanent residency, especially considering the fact that I speak both French and English fluently. However, I'd be going from living with my parents and having a amazing support  system to living alone on the other side of the globe in a country where the climate is a lot colder than what I'm used to and where I don't know anyone, pursuing a master's degree without any work experience, I'm just not sure if I'm ready for that kind of change.

Another option would be to get a bit of work experience before going for my master's degree, but the issue with that is that I'm scared that by the time I finally decide I'm ready, the Canadian immigration policies would change against my favour. 

So here I am pondering, on this decision while the deadlines for applying are approaching at a fast pace. So any advice would be very helpful.

Thanks!",01Jan2020,1
813,"My indian father is 70 years old, my norwegian mom is 54. I'm 24 and my older sister is 27. I currently live at home because I'm finished with my studies and looking for a place to live. I'm currently working nearby. I also want to be near my mom. My sister does not have a good relationship with my father, they barely speak and it's always been like this. She lives far away and has stated multiple times that she wants little to do with my father as he ruined her childhood and teen years (he was horrible to her). My sister is the only logical one in the family, she's not emotionally invested in anything and did not think twice about leaving as soon as she could. 

For as long as I can remember my dad has somewhat been abusive, but over the last decade it's increased. Worst thing is that only me, my mom and sister knows about his behaviour, as he behaves himself outside the home. He's gone mad a couple of times out on the street, but never in front of anyone we know. Everyone we know loves him and talk very highly of him, as he is quite funny and charming, even sometimes very sweet. The worst thing about this whole situation is that he actually is a good person when he wants to be. It makes you love him, then hate him, then love him and then hate him again. It has given me and my sister major trust issues, neither of us have ever been in a relationship.   


My father is verbally, emotionally, physically and sexually abusive. As a child he sexually abused me (something I learned through therapy two years ago). And growing up he was physically abusive towards my sister (threw stuff at her, grabbed her, one time even broke down her door as she had locked it to get away from him). He's also been physically abusive towards me, four times as I recall while growing up. One time he slammed me into the oven and my head got injured. He's also verbally and emotionally abusive towards everyone, especially my mom. He calls her mean things, says she's worthless, never lets her do what she wants in peace (like if she wants to watch a movie or buy what she wants at the store, he'll sometimes explode and lash out on her and call her horrible things. He also says she'll never manage without him and the worst part about that last statement is that it's kinda true.. I love my mom with all my heart, but she has no education (not even high school), no goals, not as much money as him as he's a retired engineer and she's works minimum wage in a kindergarten. She also has anxiety, social anxiety especially. She never leaves the house, exept for work and shopping. She would never leave her home as it would be too far from her comfort zone. She's talked about leaving for 15 years..She keeps defending his behaviour and it's impossible to talk to her about it. She already feels like her life is a failure and I think bringing up my father just makes that worse.

I'm really lost, I don't know how I can help her. Both me and my sister have talked to her, but she won't listen. Everytime my parents have a fight (which is almost every day, it's always been this way) she says she'll leave, but she always stays. Even when my dad tells her to leave, which he has done a few times. She's extremely miserable now, I've heard her cry a million times in her room and she's just really broken. When we were younger she managed to hide it better, but now both me and my sister can see it clearly. Asking for help has proved to be very difficult by the way, as I tried that a few times when I was younger, but my mom kept defending my dad and told people I was lying. I should also mention that my dad has bipolar disorder,  


Here's what I've done so far: 

\- Tried talking to my mother about this probably over a 100 times. My sister has also tried.    
\- Tried talking to my grandparents, but my mom defended my father and told them I was lying.   
\- Asked my mom to consider sending my father to therapy. My father is bipolar, but undiagnosed. He has all the symptoms and I'm quite sure about this because I'm bipolar too and have been both diagnosed and in therapy. It's genetic and there's no way it's coming from anyone else. Problem is that he's never going to agree to do therapy because he's Indian (in Asia mental illness is not a thing, especially for the older generation) and doesn't  
even acknowledge that there's something wrong with his behaviour.   
\- Tried talking to my dad personally. This works for a little while, but he always goes back to the same behaviour.   
\- Tried talking to my therapist, but she couldn't really do much about it as it's not really up to her to press charges or anything. She told me the solution would be to make my mother leave, but then again...how do I do that when she won't.

She‚Äôs extremely pretty but besides that, she‚Äôs mature for someone in high school. She knows what she wants to do in her future. She‚Äôs ambitious. She‚Äôs loyal. All things I want in a girl

But here‚Äôs where the issue lies..... I can‚Äôt see her that often because her mother expects her to be home by 7pm. It‚Äôs difficult because I work too.

I am able to see both sides of my own story but I just really need an outsider perspective on whether I am being irrational or not.

So my (25F) alleged best friend (29M) have been close for a good 18 months.  We spend a lot of time together and have a lot of the same interests - watching sports mainly.  We are each other's confidant and general go to person for advice.  We usually talk every single day.  

He is in a long distance relationship and they don't see each other often.  

Over the festive period I have hardly heard a peep (very limited replies to messages and no happy new year).  His girlfriend is here and I 100% get that she takes priority over friends but I feel quite aggrieved as I feel like I make a lot of effort with this friend and don't really receive a lot in return.  This has been a running theme for a while as well.

832,"Hi all.

Before I write this, I fully acknowledge the fact that what I and my friend have done is a bad thing, and is inexcusable, but I've come here for help rather than to be reminded what a bad thing this is.

So, my friend, I'll call her Anna, and I are inseparable. We spend almost every day together in my house or in work as we work in the same place. When we are in my house, we are very physically close, cuddling etc. I previously had feelings for Anna before we became friends, but they faded until recently.

Almost two weeks ago, Anna and I were in my house and began fooling around, but it didnt go further than hands. This has been a recurring thing almost every day since, still only hands, and we havent kissed either, although we discussed it and both agreed it would make things feel too real.

After the first time, we had a long talk about it all and agreed to just never speak of it again, as Anna has a boyfriend who she supposedly cares about. Then it happened again and again etc, and now it is just a regular thing, but I feel really really terrible for her boyfriend. 

Everyone thinks Anna has feelings for me based on how she acts around me, and I've begun to develop feelings again too. I asked her does she have feelings and she said its complicated because some days are amazing and others arent, but she said this is the same with everyone, which I believe as I know her very well.

From what I've said I realise it sounds like Anna is just a bad person. Trust me, she is a genuinely great person, but weve both just made this mistake and I'm trying to sort it out.

What I'm coming here to ask is how do I handle this situation. I want the cheating to stop, but I want to be with Anna. I dont know how to bring this all up, or even how to phrase it all.

 Her BF is completely oblivious to all of this.

I would ask them once or twice a week when they could hang out and they would usually say something like ""ooh yeah we can hang out in a week or two"". It's not like they're busy. Both of them go out almost every day.

I asked them if they could maybe celebrate New Years Eve with me as I am alone, and both said they couldn't because they're with their family. Understandable. Today I saw that they posted something in their Instagram story and it was them both and a couple of other people from my class chilling outside, near my house. 

I asked them why they didn't invite me and they said that they were already with other people. This is the second time that this has happened now. 
The first time they actually cancelled plans with me and told me that they were busy when they actually went alone without me again.

If someone else asks them if they can hang out they always immediately say yes and hang out with that person. But when I ask them they always say ""maybe next week"". 

They just told me today that they could go out tomorrow with me but I was actually so angry and sad that I told them that I won't go. I feel like they just asked me because they felt bad for me.

It's not only hanging out but they also don't write anything in our groupchat we have together,but just text each other in private. When I tell them that I don't feel validated they just say:"" noo we still care about you what are you talking about"".

I want to just cut them off but I wouldn't have anyone to talk to in school and they're my only friends. But it also stresses me out so much being with them. What do I do?

839,"We met in one of our classes and hit it off pretty quickly. We walked together after class a few times and I asked him out for coffee once I'd realized I had a crush on him. We flirted a lot on this first date and we kissed a few times. We proceed to go on several dates after that, but he soon tells me he has to leave after fall term. He doesn't qualify for financial aid and has to pay out of state tuition, so it's pretty clear that he can't stay. Fast forward to the end, a month and a half after that coffee date, and I'm sleeping over several times a week and the sex is great. We're still going on dates often and showing interest in one another at this point- situations where he's cooking me dinner or we're hanging out around campus. It's not a committed relationship- we weren't calling ourselves boyfriend and girlfriend, and he's openly seeing someone else- but he's also open about how he feels about me. A week before he's due to leave, and we're cuddling in the morning, him telling me how he cares about me and he's going to miss me. I'm direct, however. I straight up said: ""Please be an asshole. It would make this a lot easier."" But he's not an asshole. He took care of me while I was drunk, talked me through my anxiety, and would tell me to ""be safe"" every time he knew I was going somewhere or at a party.

&amp;#x200B;

I stayed with him on his last night in town. He came over to my place that morning and we took a nap together. He helped me run some errands and we went back to his house. I helped him pack up all his stuff, he made me dinner, and we had the best sex we'd ever had together. The next morning, he took me to get coffee and donuts. We said goodbye and he drove 12 hours back home.

&amp;#x200B;

He continued to message me over the next couple of days- mostly cute messages of him being back home. Trimming up his mom's plants, making pancakes, that sort of thing. I noticed how happy each of these messages made me and how I was looking forward to each Snap. After some reflection, I sent him: ""I've been missing you and it made me realize I caught feelings. I probably shouldn't be talking to you. I'm sorry if that makes me sound like a bitch, but I didn't want to ghost you.""

&amp;#x200B;

He replied ""Rip &lt;3 It's all good, wish the best"". All good, right? I told him not to talk to me again in an adult-way so that I could move on. We'd only been seeing each other for less than 2 months, I shouldn't make a big deal out of it, right?

&amp;#x200B;

Right, except he texted me on Christmas. And again on New Years. Cute little messages with those fucking heart emojis. My response last night was, ""Guess we're talking on holidays now""? He liked my message and responded ""Especial days only"". Maybe this is him trying to respect my attempt at cutting contact, while still being friendly?

&amp;#x200B;

I don't even know what to think anymore. I still miss him, but I don't know what his aim is, here. He lives 12 hours away, so I clearly won't be seeing him ever again. I struggle to define what it was we had because we clearly cared for each other, but it wasn't a committed relationship. In the same way, we weren't strictly having sex. In my mind, the only thing missing from it being a relationship was the title and the commitment. This makes it really difficult to find advice for my situation. We didn't have a bad split by any means- we kissed and he thanked me for making the last couple of weeks fun.

&amp;#x200B;

As to why he's only messaging me on ""especial days only"", I have no clue. I suspect he now wants to be friends or something, but I don't know what that would look like or even if it's possible after I told him I care about him. I don't know if I should text him back about the ""especial days only"" thing or not, either. I do know that I'm really sad that there's no real holidays until Valentine's day. I smile when his name pops up on my screen. 

&amp;#x200B;

846,"This is a post I've been meaning to write for a while. Being New Year it seems even more relevant, eg: - People are setting their New Year's Resolutions - People are posting on social media saying what they've achieved over the past decade and what they hope to achieve over this next decade. Anyway,... a little about me: I'm a 25 year old guy. I'm not the sort of person to sit at home playing computer games or anything like that. I'm active (love the gym), enjoy socialising with friends at bars or night outs etc etc. However there's very little else I want out of life right now.

I'm in a job that I don't find fulfilling or challenging and it's pretty montonenous but it's an easy pace of life... I wake up at 8am in the week (a nice lie-in compared to most jobs), then do very little in my office job, find it easy and stress-free despite it being boring. All of this I don't mind though as I don't like stress. I then go to the gym for 2 hours after work and lift weights. I then go home and sleep for day 2. When the weekend comes I usually do the same sort of thing... see friends, go for dinner, get very drunk somewhere and usually spend Sunday hungover and sleeping. I have friends that have goals like becoming a millionaire or having ¬£1m in assets (property) or generally very career driven but I don't want the long days and stress that comes with this.

I'm happy with a simple life without the stress and increases leisure/home time to do things I enjoy. I wake up and it's light outside and get home before it's dark. I do feel guilty sometimes because naturally I can push myself very hard (eg at the gym I work very hard) and sometimes I do feel guilty that I should want or expect more out of life.

I don't know if it's laziness being how I am. I've seen posts like this before on Reddit but the difference is, usually the person who writes it says things like ""I don't know what I want out of life - I don't have a job, play computer games and watch porn through the day, don't leave my messy bedroom and don't socialise with friends apart from gamer friends"". That's not my personality at all however I guess the similar theme is I don't want much other than stress-limitation.

I guess the only goal I have for this year is to find a girlfriend. However even then I'm not going to actively force this. If it happens it happens but I'm not going to chase anything especially if it leads to stress. Also if I feel the relationship is going to lead to stress then I quickly cut it off.

Is it weird to want so little from life and be happy with a minimalistic, simple life?",01Jan2020,1
847,"Before I start, this post is not about dating. I have no intention of dating the subject of this post, I'm trying to make friends.

So I (18M) been talking to this girl (17M) over DMs for like, close to a year now. I'm always looking for new people to talk to which is difficult because my social skills are questionable at best.

Recently, she's evidently trusted me enough to rant about her life on several occasions, so I figured she considered us friends. Well I asked her last night if she actually did consider us a friends, a yes or no question, and she responded with ""eh"".

Oof.

A while back, she also told me ""we should meet up sometime"" and yet every time I ask her she's busy.

I don't want to spend a whole bunch of time worrying about what to say to someone if there's zero chance we'll ever be friends, and I have no clue how to interpret anything that she does. So I'm sorta wondering now if I should keep talking to her.

Whenever she gets irritated at something I do, she throws out food. This, while not only wasteful, is something I begged her never to do because it makes me panic. If she's warming dinner and I talk too much to her when she's in a bad mood she'll take it right out of the microwave and throw it out. I've gotten accustomed to groveling and pleading for her to spare the food and I know this is making me even more anxious as nobody should have to deal with this. It's something close to my heart and sometimes I will binge food to make sure it isn't wasted if she decides to throw it out. In my lowest points, I've eaten from the garbage to not waste the food.

So for New Year's Eve we went to the house of a friend of mine, some of us stayed the night and in total there were 4 females and me (a male). I was near one of them, we were placed in a formation like a ""T"" where I was the top part of the letter and near me there were her feet.
So I have a problem with my libido and I've been seeing a therapist about it. I didn't do anything too ""extreme"" but still I searched contact between the plant of her feet and my privates and eventually I found it. Keep in mind that between her feet and my penis there were 5 layers of fabric (my boxer, pajama pants and sleeping bag plus her sleeping bag and her socks). However I'm 99% sure she noticed even though she didn't move and did not mentioned it later when we (me and her) were left alone. To make things worst she's my crush and nearly everyone including her knows about it.
Now I was thinking about writing her a message apologizing and explain my problems and the fact that I've been seeing a therapist about it. Point is 1 I don't know if this is appropriate and if maybe it's better to never bring the subject to light and 2 there's still that 1% probability she didn't notice. But I really don't want her to think that I am an heartless perverted sexual predator.

858,"I don‚Äôt want to go into too much detail here but... my s/o has always had it rough with depression/anxiety/the whole shebang. He can become verbally aggressive (never physical) and destructive when he gets into these moments. He recently had a loss that‚Äôs really affected his mental state and he has been going downhill since. We‚Äôve been together for years and he saw a therapist when he was in his early teens briefly. 

I have complex PTSD due to some stuff that happened and myself have been seeing people for it for years and even now since we moved together took it upon myself to get registered to look after myself and have had a decent amount of success and growth since. 
Him.. not so much. 

He‚Äôs a really great guy and treats me well otherwise but he gets really angry and destructive when something triggers him. He knows about my PTSD and its triggers so he sometimes (unintentionally according to him) would use them against me if he‚Äôs angry with me. I threatened to leave him if he didn‚Äôt get help because that‚Äôs not okay. 

He eventually saw a therapist who put him to this online course thing to deal with his anger and depression... he only signed on twice for about 30 minutes a time and then signed himself off the program, saying it didn‚Äôt work. 

Two years pass and I keep asking- rather begging him to get help. He kept brushing it off saying he would some days, then saying he doesn‚Äôt want a doctor to assign a label to him or whatever others. We get into an argument and he says he‚Äôd do it after he got his wisdom teeth taken out. I compromised. He didn‚Äôt even bother getting his teeth out to this day. Finally, the loss comes. 

He loses it. 

About a week ago we got into a bad argument. Violence is a big no no for me and triggers shit. I tried to leave and he restrained me from walking out the door. I demanded he let me go and had stepped back from him, where he then punched the door behind me. 

Yeah. That was it. 

The next day he was crying (i can literally count on one hand the amount of times I‚Äôve seen him cry so it‚Äôs serious) and begging for forgiveness saying he hasn‚Äôt been himself, which is true. He promises me he will get help for real now. I don‚Äôt even react. I tell him I‚Äôll take his apology and claim for face value but won‚Äôt believe it until I see it. But told him I‚Äôd support him regardless. 

The next day he fills out an application for the general doctor here since he hadn‚Äôt even bothered signing up to a regular doctor since we moved in here. He was so proud and happy showing me the filled application. Legit, it was like a kid showing off a good grade on a pop quiz or a new drawing for the fridge. Great. 

New Years has come so everything is understandably closed and he can‚Äôt take the application up. He starts going on about his resolutions and whatnot to get better. Cool. He turns to me and asks me if I believe him and.. I couldn‚Äôt exactly lie. 

I told him I loved him and appreciated his effort he‚Äôs making, but that I was still very skeptical and that my expectations for him to actually go through with it weren‚Äôt too high, but I‚Äôd support him and help him regardless. 

He got really upset at me and couldn‚Äôt understand what I meant. Now we‚Äôre just kinda sitting in our living room in silence trying not to make eye contact. 

What should I do about this? He definitely showed some growth filling that thing out since he tossed all the applications I previously got him. Is it bad I‚Äôm skeptical?",01Jan2020,1

861,"I've lived in California my whole life, but I visited New York City a few years ago and fell in love. I loved the energy in the air, the architecture, the restaurants/coffee shops, Broadway (I'm a huge theatre fan), basically everything about it. I'm currently applying to law school, and most jobs at big law firms are in NYC. I've been thinking for a couple years now that I'd definitely get a job in NY after finishing law school and fulfill my dream of moving there. Now that I'm actually applying, though, I'm having doubts.




I'm very close to my family and the thought of being so far from them makes me deeply sad. Additionally, the work/life balance at big firms isn't the greatest and I probably wouldn't be able to visit much. I'd be lucky to even come home for Christmas or Thanksgiving. My other option is to live/work in Los Angeles, which is within driving distance of my hometown. I went to college in Los Angeles and loved my time at school, but the city itself wasn't my favorite. It grew on me over time, though, and I wouldn't mind living there.



So far I've been accepted to two law schools on the east coast and  two in Los Angeles. The schools on the east coast, though, are not in New York and I don't care for their locations at all. Additionally, one of the schools is known for having a sort of fratty vibe, which wouldn't suit me at all. The vast majority of their graduates work in New York after graduation, but I don't think I'd be very happy there. The other school on the east coast has an abnormally large student body (so it's impersonal) and is known for being pretty cut-throat. One of the schools in Los Angeles is my undergrad school and I know I'd be happy there. I used to study in the law library as an undergrad and it's absolutely beautiful. All the people that I've talked to there are very happy, and the neighborhood of the school is amazing. It's also much cheaper and I would likely get a more significant scholarship there. I would likely get a job at a big firm in Los Angeles. I could get a job in New York from there, but my whole professional network would be in Los Angeles and I'd really like to be able to date/form relationships without thinking that I'll be moving in three years.




Looking at this rationally, it makes so much sense for me to go to my undergraduate school for law school. It's close to family, I'd likely graduate with over $100k less debt, I'd make the same amount as in New York, and its location and culture are far better than the east coast schools I've been accepted to. Additionally, as much as I love New York, my main dream in life is to have a home, a wife, and kids. I want the stereotypical upper middle class suburban life. I also would hate to be so far from my parents as they get older (already into their early 60s). 



All of the law schools I'm considering are in the top 20, and my career aspirations are totally achievable from any of them. 



Despite everything pointing to Los Angeles, it's hard to shake the idea of moving to New York. I was pretty happy with the idea of staying in California, but then I watched the CNN New Year's Eve special last night and fell in love with NY all over again. I heard Frank Sinatra sing ""New York, New York"" and just wanted to catch a plane right then and there. It just sucks I would have to live in a place I don't like for three years before finally getting a high-intensity job that I'm stuck in from student debt in order to live in NY. 


Any insight? Should I just forget it and go to the school in LA? Honestly, I could fund dozens of weekend trips to NY with the amount I'd save by staying here. I just hope I don't look back in thirty years and regret not going for it (but then again, I could regret leaving my family and everyone I love).",01Jan2020,1

867,"\[LONG\] Answer or not, this is a situation I've really been mulling over for a while, so I wanted to toss it into the void and see if anyone has had any similar experiences!  I'm going to call my friend Anne.

So, me and Anne started being friends like 7 years ago, and in the beginning, we were absolute BFF fuckin' *besties*.  I was about 15, and I guess we bonded over both being depressed and lonely and feeling like outcasts (classic).  We liked to take hallucinogens together or smoke weed, find parties, make fun of popular people, and shared niche interests.  We had traditions, certain hotels we liked to frequent, inside jokes, the full 9 yards.  It was great to have someone to be so close to at the time, as I really had very few other friends.

Basically, the older I got, the more I decided to branch out.  I gained more friends (nothing crazy, I'm still an introvert, but definitely a few) and eventually began going to community college to pursue my dream career.  I grew out of my drug phase, even stopped drinking and smoking weed for the most part as they both stopped agreeing with me.  I got a boyfriend that I am now engaged to, and a job in my field right after graduation.  I'm 22 now.  As I grew and became more stable and outgoing, I kind of watched her stagnate and become more and more depressed and lonely.  

Now, believe me, I know what it's like to have mental issues.  I really do.  I can't name one of my friends who isn't depressed and anxious, but she's a really serious case.  And the longer it went on, the more I felt like she wasn't helping herself at all.

She refused to move out of her parents house, even though she had enough money to do so (like, 10k in the bank kind of money).  In fact, she was always extremely worried about money, even with her great job and rent-free situation, while I was working minimum wage and just kind of living my life.  Her parents lived in the middle of nowhere in a tiny town, two hours away from the city I live in, so that alone basically cut off her entire social life.  She complained that she didn't connect with any of her coworkers.  When we would get together, she would always tell me how lonely she was, and how much she hated life, and everything.  She would even say this stuff around my friends, people who I was trying to introduce her to, that she could connect with.  It was hard to have her around my scene, because she would make comments about how she never gets to have fun, or never gets to hang out with people, and it would bring the mood down seriously.  In fact, one person I used to hand out with (who ended up being a huge asshole, to be fair) had such a negative reaction to her moods that she begged me to never invite her to any event ever again.

I honestly do care for Anne a great deal still.  I think she's a good person, creative, special, interesting, and has TONS of potential.  She's beautiful, musically gifted, artistically gifted, a former model, and she dresses well, and she has lots of money, but she's awkward, and just can't seem to find a direction that she wants to push herself in.  

We haven't been close for easily a year or two now.  We still message each-other sometimes, but I feel this strong guilt.  I have tried to make an effort to hang out with her, but it just genuinely isn't fun for me, because we spend the whole time talking about how sad she is, and how she can't do anything about it, and all of my suggestions to improve her life just won't work.

There's a part of me that is worried that she will attempt suicide and it will be my fault, because I was her closest friend and I abandoned her.  But at the same time, I don't know what to do.  She is very aware that the friendship is damaged and has admitted that she knows it's because of her depression and attitude, but we can't seem to figure it out.

I do love her.  I just can't be around her for all that long.

Has anyone else experienced something similar?  What did you do?  Am I to blame for her mood and mental health?  Is it my responsibility to support her more?

868,"I‚Äôm posting this after an almost day long argument with my partner where I still don‚Äôt feel 100% after.

It started today after he texted me as normal while I was at work, and I addressed an issue I was having where he forgot to give me my birthday present from 3 days ago. He already showed me at the start of the month, but told me I wouldn‚Äôt get it until my birthday. I expressed I was a bit disappointed and he apologized by text but I pointed out he only apologized since I called him out on it. The rest of the day I was getting very bland replies and asked him what was up. He told me nothing was up and he literally wanted to do nothing today. I was getting hours between texts though and I still didn‚Äôt believe him and was worried something was wrong.

He called me after work and we talked about it and it sparked a long standing argument about me not taking him at his word. I have severe trust issues from my last relationship where I was gaslighted and lied to a lot, and my current partner is very honest and up front. My mind was all over the place because I was really sick today, and he said it felt like I was harping on about the birthday thing earlier and he reiterated again that nothing is wrong and he literally did nothing today other than stare at the ceiling. This just seemed odd to me and it wasn‚Äôt that I didn‚Äôt believe him, but I was trying to wrap my head around it.  It escalated to a point where he asked why I never take him at his word and that he constantly feels like he has to change for me when I still don‚Äôt take him at his word which is the only thing he‚Äôs asked me to do. I‚Äôve tried explaining to him the trauma I still have from my last relationship and I‚Äôve been in and out of counselling for the last year trying to combat overthinking and my trust issues and he has been there for all of that. He can just be very blunt and direct when he‚Äôs like this and all I ask is that he‚Äôs a bit more emotional because as I said, it felt like I wasn‚Äôt even texting my boyfriend today. 

I‚Äôm terrified that everything I‚Äôm doing to combat this isn‚Äôt enough. He‚Äôs getting annoyed and feels like anything he tries to do for me isn‚Äôt good enough. I feel like that no matter how hard I try it isn‚Äôt good enough and that I‚Äôm not getting better fast enough. I also take issue with when he gets sarcastic when I try and talk to him about these things, but 99% of the time he‚Äôs helped me through these problems and has been a huge pillar of support. I‚Äôm still going for counselling but I‚Äôm scared he‚Äôs going to get sick of me and leave. I also don‚Äôt think he understands the impact his tone of voice or his words have. And that‚Äôs hard for me to explain without him thinking that it‚Äôs another thing he has to change for me.

I‚Äôm just at a loss. We hung up the phone there and said goodnight and we agreed on how things were gonna go, but I‚Äôm still in tears and he sounded so done. How can I start taking him at his word and how can I stop worrying that he‚Äôs getting sick of me and will leave?",01Jan2020,1

I find out shes anorexic, shes very skinny not starved but her parents havent monitored much, then she says ""I dont feel anything anymore"" She cuts herself wtf.

870,"Ever since I was younger, I‚Äôve always been obsessed with meeting people online. I consider myself an ambivert with more introverted tendencies, so I think maybe it‚Äôs just easier for me to engage in conversations online rather than in person(?). I don‚Äôt know. 

It‚Äôs been taking over my life for as long as I can remember. I feel like I can‚Äôt form new relationships or even maintain the relationships I currently have because I‚Äôm so fixated on my ‚Äúvirtual life.‚Äù It‚Äôs what I spend a majority of my free time doing, and I‚Äôm just over it. 

I can‚Äôt focus on anything anymore.. school, athletics, a healthy lifestyle, etc because I get so hooked onto chatting online. 

I miss real life. But I don‚Äôt know if I can just quit cold turkey and ghost all the amazing people I‚Äôve met. They have me added on multiple social media sites as well, and I don‚Äôt have the heart to just block everyone. Besides there are too many to block..

I guess what I truly need help with is stopping in general. I don‚Äôt want to form more online friendships. And I need to learn how to keep my online chatting to a minimum, something I only do once in a while.

876,"I (21F) will finish this year my Bachelor of Science in Chemistry at my university. I realized that this isn‚Äòt the thing I want to do, because I can only start working with a Ph.D. For that I have to make a Master of Science (+ 2 years) and the Ph.D (+ 3-5 years). This is not the way I want to go. So I am thinking about other studies I can do. 

I decided to go into  business/economy. Either I start the studies in October in the city my boyfriend already studies, or I start in April in the city where my brother lives (which is also possible in october) 

I always wanted to move into my brothers city (G). Not only because my brother lives there and we have a really good relationship. I love G, it‚Äòs incredibly beautiful.
On the other hand, I want to move together with my boyfriend (4 years together). He likes his city (H), will finish his Bachelor in October there and has friends in H. He thinks about continuing his Master in H, but he could also do it in G.  He doesn‚Äòt want to leave H, because his friends are great and I really can understand it. I also like them, but I have no problem to move anywhere, because I have no friends in my city.

The third option is, that I stay in my city (B) until october. I start the first semester of my Master in chemistry and have more time to decide what I really want, but I‚Äòm not quite sure my problems will solve until then. Unfortunately I am under time pressure, because I have to enroll myself until 14th january for the Master, or until 17th january for the studies in G. 

If I study in G, I have to move there. Because my boyfriend and I want to move together this year, it would be the best option for us, to directly move together. He could commute to H for his last semester of his Bachelor. 

We are stuck because I don't know what I want and he wants to stay in H, but we also want to move in together. I tear myself apart and don‚Äòt know which way to follow. Should I listen to him or should I do what I want? We can‚Äòt agree about that.",01Jan2020,1
877,"Ok let me explain myself. Yesterday I had a kickback at my house with a few lads on New Year‚Äôs Eve while they were at a party. A few brews were cracked and sooner or later I found out that one of them was smoking a nice cigar that his dad has. Being a curious boy I smoked it with him. After the kickback I was going to give the trash bag with all the bottles and cigars to my friend to drive to a off location dumpster but my brother didn‚Äôt know that and tried to hide it in a garbage can and cover it up with two other bags filled with regular trash. My parents found the bag this morning and although they aren‚Äôt mad about the drinking, they are very mad about the cigars and are going to check the cameras later. The videos can be accessed on my living room Samsung tv and if they find out I smoked, I‚Äôm as good as dead. Is there any way to delete segments of the camera without it seeming too suspicious. Pls help I‚Äôm a dumb teen",01Jan2020,1
880,"Sorry for the title, it‚Äôs my first time posting, I just feel like I don‚Äôt know where else to go to ask for advice on my emotions. My boyfriend came to my country as a student, and we both met online before dating for the last 2 years. Anyways, we‚Äôve made a trip to Japan for fun, and to spend a month with his family and friends in his home town. I got sick about 2 days into arriving at his hometown (after two weeks in Seoul and Tokyo) and had a pretty nasty cough and cold symptoms. Flash forward to yesterday when my boyfriend wakes up feeling pretty shit and by the end of the day (unbeknownst to me as he went to sleep in another room) he had a fever of 40 degrees, so his mum took him to the hospital, and Lo and behold, he has influenza. In Japan, they take influenza pretty seriously and he‚Äôs basically been quarantined from everyone while his mum looks after him.

This is all fair, but meanwhile I‚Äôm stuck in his bedroom by myself, struggling with my own sickness (every time I lie down my throat/lungs feel itchy, then I need to cough and rinse and repeat). I‚Äôm not at all saying I‚Äôm sicker, he definitely is, it‚Äôs just I‚Äôve been quite emotional and crying a lot, alone in his bedroom. I texted a few times asking if i could just come and sit beside him and he said no because I‚Äôll get sick and begged me to go back up to his room. I felt pretty shitty after that- I understand he‚Äôs sick, but he got it from me so I don‚Äôt see why I can‚Äôt sit beside him. Had the worst nights sleep ever being unable to breathe and just generally overthinking. So i thought I‚Äôd try again and go downstairs and sit with him, but his mum told me I should wait upstairs while she tries to call a doctor about me, and I ask my boyfriend if I can stay beside him, and again he says I shouldn‚Äôt because his fever is still 40 degrees and the doctor says he will be better after two days.

I understand that he is sick and obviously prolonged exposure to him increases my chances of catching it, but it‚Äôs so overwhelming being stuck in a small bedroom, by yourself, with no one to talk to in your native tongue, while you‚Äôre sick. I can understand Japanese when someone speaks, but my speaking is not strong itself, and my only contact has been his mum coming in trying to ask me how I‚Äôm feeling and other things.

I guess the advice I‚Äôm asking for is, obviously for two days I‚Äôm going to be stuck in this bedroom, how do I communicate to him how bad this experience has been for me? Every time I say how I‚Äôm feeling he just says that he is sick and if I could wait for him... these last 24 hours have honestly been terrible and all I want is to sit beside him and not be stuck in a bedroom alone crying.

882,"Hi, I'm a 20 year old male, and I've had depression anxiety for the past couple years of my life. Whenever I'm faced with an issue (for example; I'm transferring colleges and need to make a decision and set up appointments), I get overly emotional and stressed out. I find it extremely difficult to do whatever needs to be done due to my anxiety.

A big problem I face is constant suicidal thoughts. I'm not sure if they're really suicidal thoughts, however. Whenever I face a problem, I always get in a depressive and extremely debilitating anxious mindset. I constantly think about how I always feel this way when I'm presented with a problem, so when I move out and I'm on my own, I'll always be feeling this way since adult life is full of problems. I don't want to be constantly depressed and extremely anxious. I start thinking that it would be better if I killed myself because then I wouldn't have to deal with anything anymore.

I find joy in some things. I love my boyfriend, writing, reading, video games, music, and etc. But sometimes I just don't feel like it's worth it to stay alive when I feel depressed and anxious all the time. I know it's very selfish but it's getting to the point I don't care anymore. 

I don't know what to do. I don't really know how to fix myself, and I don't have a lot of money saved up to pay for therapy or medications for myself. I have an insurmountable fear of confessing my personal feelings like this to anyone (hence the throwaway). I really don't want to tell anyone and I'd rather just find a way to deal with this on my own or just off myself.

I'm really scared. Please someone help.",01Jan2020,1
883,"Okay, REALLY weird title, but this is what I mean.

Typically when two people hate each other, they can still go about their day. They might trash the other person, but there's still that ability to just go on with their day and brush them off as a jerk or something. At least, this is how it looks from my point of view, on the outside.

Me, I'm a bit different, and I can't really do that.

I don't really like to hate anyone, and even feel terrible that there's someone I can't get along with. Usually, my intention is never to anger the other person, but it ends up happening anyway because I can be pretty thoughtless at times with what I do and say. Nevertheless, though, if it gets to the point where someone hates me, I just hate the feeling.

Like, I can't really think of ways to put down the other person in my mind, or anything like that. What happens is, it sits in my mind all day for long periods of time, wishing I could just reconnect with that person and try to patch things up, but am afraid to because I feel it might cause a larger explosion. It even gets to the point where any thought of the person just rips me up inside, even down to their interests and personality (like, if there's something they're really passionate about, that particular thing makes me feel nauseated and I can't get into that thing either).

I can definitely get why someone would find me off-putting or be really bothered by something I say or do, and that's something I'm trying to work on. It's just that it's hard for me to envision me in their spot until a bit after the scenario happens, and I feel remorse about it. I have tried to ask them about it, but it didn't really do any good...

I don't know, how come I'm not able to hate other people?",01Jan2020,1
884,"My boyfriend said that his sponsor asked for one of his sublingual suboxone strips for ‚Äúpain‚Äù after a shoulder injury that he went to the ER for.

My eyes shot up to his screen due to flashing colors, and my eyes are kind of bad so i took out my phone and zoomed in with the camera, and he was looking at online chatrooms, and chatrooms with young girls. He's a 41 year old man with 5 kids, including myself, but I'm 18, and they're all under 13. He's been married to my mom for 15 years. I have pictures and videos of him looking at these things in a TOR browser. For me, I'm unsure how to go about telling my mother. She makes $300 a week, and can only provide food and the bare necessities to my family, whereas my father pays all the bills and the rent. I don't know how they're going to live their lives like that. I plan on telling her when she gets home in 3 hours, from work. I have video and pictures of him typing up these things, clicking on preteen chatrooms, downloading things ect. I plan to show everything to my mother. Please do mind that I did not take any video of any CP, or any pictures of any CP. I think what my father is doing is disgusting.

891,"Long story short I have a very bad relationship with my fam. It‚Äôs only now at 27 after countless hospitalizations by them and having been sent to Mexico as a teen for teen prison for smoking weed (&amp; causing a disruption in my schooling and college process that‚Äôs taken me years to catch up), they even used a creepy therapist against me to maliciously prosecuted and make me look really bad on record. 

When I tried to save up and work to transfer school and move out, my fam kicked me out and used my former therapist against me to put restraining order and keep me away from my beloved dogs as well as make me homeless without my belongings. They would violate the restraining order though whenever they felt like seeing me.

Fast forward to now my dad has tried to make it up to me and I‚Äôm now dependent on him (I can‚Äôt work or do school right now after losing my dog who got neglected away from me &amp; and just reeling) but have moved out as I am not speaking to the rest of my family now.

My dad keeps coming to my place when I say I want no contact. He came by when I first moved in and I had my window shades open and was so tired and depressed after moving I had fallen asleep in my new place naked. My dad came and just woke me up kept knocking on the door staring at me thru the window. I hate it because all my life he‚Äôs had a creepy perverse fixation on me and my body since I was a little girl. He has even called my body his property when he was mad I had my first bf.

I keep asking him to not come by I don‚Äôt want anything from him but he keeps coming by and dropping stuff off that I have no use for and he just came right now and it‚Äôs causing me triggers and anxiety. I‚Äôm afraid to even ask authorities for help I have phobia of going to courts or stuff like that as I have been put in a bad light in them and am never believed. What the fuck do I do?

That's I guess a large part of my issues in life right now. It's hard not to just get angry or sad out of almost no where. The first time I noticed it really was walking past the baby isle in Walmart remembering feelings of joy but.. idk even know what they are now. This morning my dad had a stroke. I've never seen him like that before. He couldn't speak and at the beginning of the day he couldn't move his left arm. I hate myself because I am doing a horrible job at being there for my mom or my dad in this moment. I want to be there for them I want to do anything I can but when I'm there who I am right now is less the what they deserve. I don't know how to be there for anyone else when all I want to do is give up.,01Jan2020,1
